part of your world is a song written by lyricist howard ashman and composer alan menken for disney s animated feature film little mermaid 1989 performed by american actress and singer jodi benson in titular role as ariel a mermaid princess part of your world is a power ballad in which main character expresses her strong desire to become human its lyrics use placeholder names in lieu of several human related terms that would be unfamiliar to a mermaid film s theme song part of your world is reprised by ariel after she rescues eric a human prince with whom she has fallen in love from drowning directly influenced by broadway and musical theatre ashman strongly believed that little mermaid would benefit from an i want song a musical number during which main character sings about what they hope to accomplish by end of their story directors ron clements and john musker originally asked ashman to write a song for ariel in which she expresses her romantic feelings for prince eric but lyricist felt that a song that details character s fascination with human world would better serve film s plot ashman recruited benson with whom he had previously collaborated on stage musical smile 1986 to record part of your world and worked closely with her to ensure that she delivered a desirable performance disney executive jeffrey katzenberg initially ordered that part of your world be removed from final film due to concerns that ballad would bore young children however ashman clements musker and animator glen keane ultimately convinced katzenberg that part of your world is essential to film s narrative and song was spared after audiences appeared to enjoy it during a subsequent test screening part of your world has garnered critical acclaim both film and music critics praised song s quality and benson s vocal performance several media publications agree that part of your world ranks among greatest disney songs ever written and credit success of ballad with making i want songs a standard component of future animated musical films critics have offered various interpretations of song s empowering lyrics ranging from seeking independence from overprotective parents to feminism and lgbt rights in addition to becoming benson s signature song which she continues to perform live part of your world has been covered extensively by several artists of various genres including faith hill jessica simpson miley cyrus bruno mars carly rae jepsen jessie j and sara bareilles actress sierra boggess debuted song in stage musical adaptation of film for which she originated role of ariel writing and recording written in 1986 part of your world was first song lyricist howard ashman and composer alan menken wrote for little mermaid although menken had not yet been enlisted as ashman s composer when song was first conceived directly inspired by broadway s most successful musicals ashman believed that little mermaid s story would benefit from at least one song that serves as its heroine s inner diary of thoughts having always intended for ariel to perform a song in her grotto directors and screenwriters ron clements and john musker originally asked ashman to write a song in which ariel declares her love for prince eric by singing to a statue of character but ashman suggested that a song depicting character s fascination with human world would be a stronger alternative ashman explained to filmmakers that part of your world would be ariel s i want song likening it to moments in stage musicals during which heroine sings about her dreams so that audience can begin to care about character and her journey menken believes that disney had not yet included explicit i want songs in studio s films prior to little mermaid making part of your world first time one had been written intentionally for a disney film however disney princesses had technically been singing i want songs since snow white and seven dwarfs 1937 and cinderella 1950 observing structural similarities between song and somewhere that s green from their musical little shop of horrors 1982 songwriters nicknamed part of your world somewhere that s dry because they believe it resembles an underwater version of little shop of horrors song additionally ashman had written a song entitled disneyland with composer marvin hamlisch for their broadway musical smile 1986 in which a young girl much like ariel sings about regularly watching disney anthology series as a means of escaping her troubled childhood menken identified musical motif he composed for beginning of ballad as his favorite part of song ashman debuted part of your world for clements and musker at his apartment in greenwich village manhattan only directors second time meeting ashman and first time meeting menken menken provided piano accompaniment while ashman sang ariel s melody himself instead of their traditional method of menken singing lead vocals moved by ashman s demonstration musker recalled that lyricist gazed up towards ceiling as though it were human world itself as he became ariel before our eyes and poured out his heart in song helping them visualize this far off place of wonder that so entranced this little mermaid clements and musker enjoyed song but would sometimes disagree with ashman over its lyrics which ashman had insisted be very specific musker specifically wanted to change line i wanna be where people are because he felt that it sounded too political and reminded him of governor of illinois dan walker suggesting that be removed appalled by this suggestion ashman insisted that line remain unchanged to prevent word where from having to be held longer musker would eventually admit that his suggestion was idiotic although ashman was very defensive about song and typically dismissed most of directors suggestions he agreed to revise lyrics that originally described contents of ariel s grotto using eloquent terms such as fine china and books bound in leather and gold and replaced them with words that would be more familiar to a mermaid who learns about humans from an uneducated seagull named scuttle ashman s revisions integrated funnier lyrics such as thingamabobs and and into song making part of your world more consistent with film s lighthearted tone ashman initially pitched ariel s reprise of part of your world as a sad lament in which character sings i ll never be part of that world clements and musker argued that reprise should instead convey ariel s determined nature as she decides to pursue her dream of becoming part of eric s world howard agreed to rewrite reprise into a more positive anthem that ultimately reads i don t know when i don t know how but i know something s starting right now watch and you ll see someday i ll be part of your world providing film with more momentum while establishing further conflict between ariel and her father king triton ashman s willingness to rewrite both versions of song s lyrics pleasantly surprised directors ashman first met actress and singer jodi benson while he was directing her in smile she had also performed disneyland in musical after production closed prematurely ashman invited smile s entire female cast to audition for little mermaid using part of your world although he did not tell them name of project they were auditioning for ashman mailed a copy of his demo of part of your world to benson to which she listened in a public restroom in preparation for her audition benson then recorded a brief sample of song on a reel to reel tape with casting director albert tavares which she mailed to disney all audition tapes were left unidentified so that candidates would remain anonymous to musker and clements delighting ashman when directors ultimately selected benson s tape to be voice of ariel about which she was informed one year after submitting tape her first voice acting role for which she had to be carefully trained on properly projecting into studio microphone benson found process of recording part of your world somewhat difficult after ashman instructed her to approach it as though she was reciting a monologue as opposed to singing a song although she found ashman telling her exactly how he wanted her to perform its lyrics helpful with benefiting her entire performance ashman remained in recording booth with benson during entire recording process advising her on performing song with realism and intensity as opposed to belting it and whispering lines to her as she sang them as benson sometimes struggled with over singing it was rare for a filmmaker to direct a performer from within booth requiring ashman to move carefully to prevent his gestures from being recorded by microphone initially struggling to capture ariel s tomboyish ness and yearning benson requested that studio s lights be dimmed to simulate feeling of being underwater menken and ashman deliberately selected segments from benson s recording session that are not perfectly sung to include in final version ranging from unsustained incorrect notes lacking in vibrato to spoken words because songwriters wanted her performance to sound as real as possible context background and animation thumb scene in which camera is animated to appear as though it is rotating around ariel as she sings proved challenging for animators clements and musker had originally intended to hire animator glen keane to animate ursula due to his history of animating disney villains keane specifically requested that he be allowed to animate ariel after hearing benson sing part of your world for first time captivated by her performance he decided to make scene his most important assignment volunteering to animate entire part of your world musical sequence himself and becoming its lead animator animating one particular scene to appear as though camera is rotating around ariel while she sings look at this trove treasures untold how many wonders can one cavern hold was particularly challenging for animators to perfect without aid of computer animation taking them considerably longer to complete keane described song as moment audience starts thinking of ariel as this real living thing a girl who s dreaming of something more and since so many of us feel just like that that s when audience falls in love with this character ashman was aware that writing a ballad capable of captivating young audiences during modern era of animation would be challenging in an effort to keep children interested ashman suggested that ariel should own a grotto in which she hides human artifacts she has collected from various shipwrecks and refer to them throughout scene disney executive jeffrey katzenberg ordered that part of your world be removed from film after observing that some children appeared to grow restless during sparsely animated musical sequence while attending an early test screening of little mermaid one child in particular spilled his popcorn during scene which measured three minutes and forty three seconds at time prompting katzenberg to worry that children would find song uninteresting bored by part of your world himself katzenberg felt that ballad only slowed down film nearly everyone involved in project protested and defended part of your world ashman reportedly voiced that song could only be removed over his dead body delivering an ultimatum and threatening to depart from project altogether should katzenberg proceed ashman argued that audiences would struggled to root for and fall in love with ariel should song be discarded clements and musker reminded katzenberg that snow white and seven dwarfs disney s first animated film features a song similar to part of your world entitled someday my prince will come which ultimately became very successful directors also reminded him that mgm executives had wanted to remove judy garland s song over rainbow from film wizard of oz 1939 until they reconsidered keane argued that part of your world is essential to film s narrative and eventually convinced katzenberg to let sequence remain at least until film s next test screening by which time it would be fully animated children responded better towards song during second screening some of whom enjoyed it to point of which they mimed some of its lyrics song even moved some older audience members to tears who ultimately applauded part of your world was ultimately spared katzenberg eventually admitted that he now feels embarrassed that he had ever wanted to dismiss part of your world expressing gratitude towards fact that no one agreed with him at time because he is now unable to imagine little mermaid without song sequence and use in little mermaid set prior to most of film s action part of your world is second proper song in little mermaid and takes place in ariel s grotto before she meets eric a character song used to progress plot part of your world resembles a monologue in which ariel expresses her desire to become part of human world while reveling in her expansive collection of discarded human items and artifacts singing about her interest in exploring human world and learning as much as she can about it ariel performs ballad while gazing up towards surface longingly wishing that she could be human herself and live among other humans and refusing to believe that they are as horrible as her father describes them part of your world reveals that ariel feels repressed and unhappy in her current environment despite her belongings and royal lineage want ing to be a part of something else a wind up toy resembling a woman dancing is used to demonstrate that ariel would much rather be like her character also sings line what s a fire and why does it what s word burn to georges de la tour s painting magdalene with smoking flame to indicate a similar sentiment thumb left georges de la tour s painting magdalene with smoking flame 1640 is shown during a portion of song offering character development song explores and voices inner goings on of ariel s mind ariel s craving for adventure makes it difficult for character to enjoy her current surroundings while knowing there is much left for her to explore causing her to grow increasingly despondent change a non physical concept that can not be purchased or stolen is only thing that could make her truly happy in meantime ariel uses material belongings to fill void of what is missing from her life attempting to live among humans vicariously via what she has salvaged from sunken ships voicing her frustration over being confined to ocean ariel is not shy about what she wants choosing to belt out her desires instead animated movie guide author jerry beck wrote that song capture s ariel s yearning so intensely that when she extends her hand toward surface we long to reach out with her ending with ariel gesturing while sighing longingly and descending back down to ocean floor part of your world serves as little mermaid s theme song entire film is defined around part of your world which provides film with momentum within its first 15 minutes as heart and centre of score several instrumental versions of part of your world are heard throughout film in form of a leitmotif overtures incorporated into its orchestral score although theme belongs to ariel it remains film s most consistent thematic idea and is thus manipulated throughout little mermaid to various affects for other characters as well that range from melancholic to sinister film s main title is a choral arrangement of ballad performed without any lyrics after ariel rescues eric and returns him to safety on a nearby beach she sings a shorter reprise of part of your world to him as he regains consciousness a distorted version of part of your world plays while triton destroys ariel s grotto eric constantly plays melody on his flute to show that he continues to be haunted by memory of mysterious girl who saved his life and a brass arrangement of song is heard while ursula magically transforms into a human named vanessa in order to trick eric into marrying her lastly a final choral version entitled happy ending is performed after ariel and eric s wedding interpretations crystal bell of mtv wrote that ballad gives ariel a purpose reveals her deepest desire to be where people are and shows us a glimpse of her strengths vulnerabilities and individual quirks while establishing ariel as an outsider writing for atlantic akash nikolas agreed that as film s i want song part of your world follows disney s trend of establishing main character as an outcast set apart from society by some innate desire as ariel literally longs to be belong to a different world film critic theresa basile identified part of your world as a song that belongs to an adventurer who wants to explore new environments zaron burnett iii writing for thought catalog described selection as a ballad in which a curious young woman who doesn t fully understand world she longs to be a part of bravely dreams of how she can move into a new world and reject limitations of her father s world read patriarchy identifying ariel as a young feminist meanwhile new york daily news film critic kathleen carroll identified part of your world as a typically plaintive solo that helps establish ariel as a broadway ingenue distinguished from earlier wish songs that discuss searching for happiness in everyday life part of your world is about longing to abandon normalcy in favor of seeking happiness elsewhere comparing part of your world to a dream is a wish your heart makes from cinderella entertainment weekly writer esther zuckerman observed that song proves how different ariel is from disney princesses by whom she was preceded while cinderella s a dream is a wish your heart makes is a passive song performed in third person ariel s number is brimming with agency to demonstrate character s thirst for knowledge zuckerman credits ashman s lyrics with providing ariel with a personality something she believes snow white cinderella and aurora from sleeping beauty 1959 lacked while giving ariel a motive that is not romance oriented additionally part of your world is delivered directly to camera as opposed to an audience of woodland animals ariel appears as though she is speaking directly to young girls who are watching scene context of part of your world and fact that it occurs before ariel meets and falls in love with eric is often used to defend ariel against critics who accuse her of sacrificing her talents for a man boing boing s caroline siede explained that ariel just happens to end up with a prince in process of achieving her larger dream to become human similarly sophie katz of odyssey online wrote that song proves that ariel doesn t give up her voice only for a guy she already wanted to be part of that world prince was a bonus writing for yahoo movies gwynne watkins penned there s little doubt that ariel s crush on prince eric strengthens her resolve to be part of human world but crucially her love of world above is established long before she sets eyes on prince during part of your world laura stampler writing for time agreed that character fell in love with human world before she even knew who eric was because she has always dreamed of being a part of your world ariel sings bright young women sick of swimmin ready to stand to indicate that she fantasizes about living in a feminist friendly society where she can speak her mind freely and grow intellectually demonstrating envy towards women who are capable of doing this on land however time s laura stampler joked that ariel will find human world disappointing considering my dad definitely still reprimanded me even though i had legs in reprise lyrics part of that world are replaced with part of your world to distinguish that character is now referring to her feelings for eric whom ariel had not yet met when she sang original song composition music written in key of f major at a moderately bright tempo of 135 part of your world is a yearning downtempo broadway and musical theatre influenced power ballad that gradually crescendos into a showstopping conclusion bolstered by benson s powerhouse performance variety s andrew barker summarized part of your world as a slow building broadway style showstopper that moves effortlessly from busy literate verses to a longing pre chorus and a belted to rafters refrain incorporating dramatic violins into its orchestration described as a big ballad song pairs ashman s lyrics about pining for life on land with menken s soaring melody beginning with a musical motif that resembles sound of flowing water described by d23 as tinkling piano keystrokes both song s music and vocals swell with passion and longing vocally benson performs part of your world using a whispered intense singing voice as opposed to belting although her performance has also been described as bigger than yourself spanning exactly one octave from c4 to c5 song s limited vocal range allows benson to effortlessly transition from her speaking to her singing voice raising and lowering her volume throughout in a manner that resembles normal speech in addition to singing using a light speech driven mix singer also incorporates quirky little comments and girly gestures according to screen rant s turner minton benson s vocals add a rawness to song giving a depth of eagerness to ariel s voice that makes for a genuine performance by delivering a vocal track that is a combination of passion strength sincerity angst emotion and innocence described as wistful pleas bustle s emma lord observed that benson sings song using a combination of tomboyish ness and yearning meanwhile final line of song s reprise is sung with a bit more oomph than original declaring i don t know when i don t know how but i know something s starting right now musical similarities have been drawn between part of your world and somewhere that s green from ashman and menken s musical little shop of horrors specifically manner in which lines part of your world and somewhere that s green are sung song has also been compared to judy garland s song over rainbow due to their shared themes about wish ing for something new and different kyle turner a writer for vice observed that both part of your world and over rainbow are gay anthems that plead for a place where dreams that you dream of really do come true meanwhile variety observed similarities between ballad and some selections from stage musical les miserables 1980 lyrical analysis despite its title word your is not heard in song until its reprise track s introduction is proceeded by a spoken monologue according to lindsey romain of marie claire ariel begins ballad by acknowledging her privilege as a princess wouldn t you think i m girl who has everything before admit ting that she wants more similarly kqed contributor emmanuel hapsis wrote that character laments that despite a life of privilege and spoils there s still a deep loneliness inside her beginning look at this stuff isn t it neat wouldn t you think my collection s complete wouldn t you think i m girl girl who has everything part of your world is a plea for a life of discovery and inquisitiveness as opposed to love using nonsensical expressions such as gadgets gizmos and in lieu of various human artifacts lyrically ballad employs several twist s and turns using very specific lyrics to describe both performer s fascination with human world and desire to walk among them including walking around on those what do you call them feet and up where they walk up where they run up where they stay all day in sun free

burnett iii described lyrics as feminist sounding one critic believes that since part of your world was released in 1989 during an uncertain time for women amidst backlash resulting from women s movement song could represent disillusionment of women in this decade sick of being told to settle with their lot and placate their dreams of true liberation with capitalist consumerism in same way

charming upon release of little mermaid in 1989 disney was unprepared for success that would be achieved by both film s soundtrack and its songs particularly that of part of your world which became an
