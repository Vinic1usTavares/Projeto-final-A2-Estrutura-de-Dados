has focused on film s explorations of romantic and paternal love sexuality materialism self liberation and redemption ball began writing american beauty as a play in early 1990s partly inspired by media circus that accompanied amy fisher trial in 1992 he shelved play after realizing story would not work on stage after several years as a television screenwriter ball revived idea in 1997 when attempting to break into film industry rewritten script had a cynical outlook influenced by ball s frustrating tenures writing for several sitcoms producers dan jinks and bruce cohen took script for

distributor american beauty marked acclaimed theater director mendes film debut courted after his successful productions of musicals oliver and cabaret mendes was nevertheless only given job after twenty others were considered and several a list directors reportedly turned down opportunity spacey was mendes first choice for role of lester though dreamworks urged him to consider better known

february 1999 on sound stages at warner bros backlot in burbank california and on location in los angeles mendes dominant directorial style was deliberate and composed he made extensive use of static shots and slow pans and zooms to generate tension cinematographer conrad hall complemented mendes style with peaceful shot compositions to contrast with turbulent on screen events during editing

crying in closet a bloodied frank returns home where a gun is missing from his collection lester s closing narration describes meaningful experiences during his life he says that despite his death he is happy because there is so much beauty in world themes and analysis multiple interpretations scholars and academics have offered many possible readings of american beauty film critics are similarly divided not so much about quality of film as their interpretations of it described by many as about meaning of life or hollow existence of american suburbs film has defied categorization by even filmmakers mendes is indecisive saying script seemed to be about something different each time he read it a mystery story a kaleidoscopic journey through american suburbia a series of love stories it was about imprisonment loneliness and beauty it was funny it was angry sad literary critic and author wayne c booth concludes that film resists any one interpretation american beauty cannot be adequately summarized as here is a satire on what s wrong with american life that plays down celebration of beauty it is more tempting to summarize it as a portrait of beauty underlying american miseries and misdeeds but that plays down scenes of cruelty and horror and ball s disgust with mores it cannot be summarized with either lester or ricky s philosophical statements about what life is or how one should live he argues that problem of interpreting film is tied with that of finding its center a controlling voice who unites all of choices he contends that in american beautys case it is neither mendes nor ball mendes considers voice to be ball s but even while writer was strongly influential on set he often had to accept deviations from his vision particularly ones that transformed cynical tone of his script into something more optimistic with innumerable voices intruding on original author s booth says those who interpret american beauty have forgotten to probe for elusive center according to booth film s true controller is creative energy that hundreds of people put into its production agreeing and disagreeing inserting and cutting imprisonment and redemption thumb alt a computer monitor on a busy cubicle desk monitor displays a spreadsheet in seven columns which span height of screen monitor also shows reflection of a middle aged man in a shirt and tie sitting close to desk and wearing a telephone headset contrasts monitor s dark background and lightness of text and man s shirt make reflection more prominent between and behind numbers lester s reflection in monitor resembles a man in a jail cell evoking director sam mendes s themes of imprisonment and escape or liberation mendes called american beauty a rite of passage film about imprisonment and escape from imprisonment monotony of lester s existence is established through his gray nondescript workplace and characterless clothing in these scenes he is often framed as if trapped reiterating rituals that hardly please him he masturbates in confines of his shower shower stall evokes a jail cell and shot is first of many where lester is confined behind bars or within frames such as when he is reflected behind columns of numbers on a computer monitor confined and nearly crossed out academic and author jody w pennington argues that lester s journey is story s center his sexual reawakening through meeting angela is first of several turning points as he begins to throw off responsibilities of comfortable life he has come to despise after lester shares a joint with ricky his spirit is released and he begins to rebel against carolyn changed by ricky s attractive profound confidence lester is convinced that angela is attainable and sees that he must question his banal numbingly materialist suburban existence he takes a job at a fast food outlet which allows him to regress to a point when he could see his whole life ahead of him when lester is caught masturbating by carolyn his angry retort about their lack of intimacy is first time he says aloud what he thinks about her by confronting issue and carolyn s superficial investments in others lester is trying to regain a voice in a home that only respects voices of mother and daughter his final turning point comes when angela and he almost have sex after she confesses her virginity he no longer thinks of her as a sex object but as a daughter he holds her close and wraps her up mendes called it most satisfying end to lester s journey there could possibly have been with these final scenes mendes intended to show lester at conclusion of a mythical quest after lester gets a beer from refrigerator camera pushes toward him then stops facing a hallway down which he walks to meet his fate having begun to act his age again lester achieves closure as he smiles at a family photo camera pans slowly from lester to kitchen wall onto which blood spatters as a gunshot rings out slow pan reflects peace of lester s death his body is discovered by jane and ricky mendes said that ricky s staring into lester s dead eyes is culmination of theme of film that beauty is found where it is least expected conformity and beauty like other american films of 1999 such as fight club bringing out dead and magnolia american beauty instructs its audience to lead more meaningful lives desowitz bill december 12 1999 finding spiritual rebirth in a valley of male ennui new york times 215 film argues case against conformity but does not deny that people need and want it even gay characters just want to fit in jim and jim burnhams other neighbors are a satire of gay bourgeois coupledom who invest in numbing sameness that film criticizes in heterosexual couples feminist academic and author sally r munt argues that american beauty uses its art house trappings to direct its message of nonconformity primarily to middle classes and that this approach is a cliche of bourgeois preoccupation underlying premise being that luxury of finding an individual self through denial and renunciation is always open to those wealthy enough to choose and sly enough to present themselves sympathetically as a rebel professor roy m anker argues that film s thematic center is its direction to audience to look closer opening combines an unfamiliar viewpoint of burnhams neighborhood with lester s narrated admission that this is last day of his life forcing audiences to consider their own mortality and beauty around them it also sets a series of mysteries anker asks from what place exactly and from what state of being is he telling this story if he s already dead why bother with whatever it is he wishes to tell about his last year of being alive there is also question of how lester has died or will die anker believes preceding scene jane s discussion with ricky about possibility of his killing her father adds further mystery professor ann c hall disagrees she says by presenting an early resolution to mystery film allows audience to put it aside to view film and its philosophical issues through this examination of lester s life rebirth and death american beauty satirizes american middle class notions of meaning beauty and satisfaction even lester s transformation only comes about because of possibility of sex with angela he therefore remains a willing devotee of popular media s exaltation of pubescent male sexuality as a sensible route to personal wholeness carolyn is similarly driven by conventional views of happiness from her belief in house beautiful domestic bliss to her car and gardening outfit carolyn s domain is a fetching american millennial vision of pleasantville or eden burnhams are unaware that they are materialists philosophically and devout consumers ethically who expect rudiments of american beauty to give them happiness anker argues that they are helpless in face of prettified economic and sexual stereotypes that they and their culture have designated for their salvation film presents ricky as its visionary spiritual and mystical center he sees beauty in minutiae of everyday life as much as he can for fear of missing it he shows jane what he considers most beautiful thing he has filmed a plastic bag tossing in wind in front of a wall he says capturing moment was when he realized that there was an entire life behind things he feels that sometimes there s so much beauty in world i feel like i can t take it and my heart is going to cave in anker argues that ricky in looking past cultural dross has grasped radiant splendor of created world to see god as film progresses burnhams move closer to ricky s view of world lester only personal satisfaction at film s end on cusp of having sex with angela he returns to himself after she admits her virginity suddenly confronted with a child he begins to treat her as a daughter in doing so lester sees himself angela and his family for poor and fragile but wondrous creatures they are he looks at a picture of his family in happier times and dies having had an epiphany that infuses him with wonder joy and soul shaking gratitude he has finally seen world as it is according to patti colors are used symbolically throughout film none more so than red which is an important thematic signature that drives story and defines lester s arc first seen in drab colors that reflect his passivity lester surrounds himself with red as he regains his individuality american beauty rose is repeatedly used as symbol when lester fantasizes about angela she is usually naked and surrounded by rose petals in these scenes rose symbolizes lester s desire for her when associated with carolyn rose represents a facade for suburban success roses are included in almost every shot inside burnhams home where they signify a mask covering a bleak reality carolyn feels that as long as there can be roses all is well she cuts roses and puts them in vases where they adorn her meretricious vision of what makes for beauty and begin to die roses in vase in angela lester seduction scene symbolize lester s previous life and carolyn camera pushes in as lester and angela get closer finally taking roses and thus carolyn out of shot lester s epiphany at end of film is expressed by rain and use of red building to a crescendo that is a deliberate contrast to release lester feels constant use of red lulls audience subliminally into becoming used to it consequently it leaves audience unprepared when lester is shot and his blood spatters on wall sexuality and repression pennington argues that american beauty defines its characters through their sexuality lester s attempts to relive his youth are a direct result of his lust for angela and state of his relationship with carolyn is in part shown through their lack of sexual contact also sexually frustrated carolyn has an affair that takes her from cold perfectionist to a more carefree soul who sings happily along with music in her car jane and angela constantly reference sex through angela s descriptions of her supposed sexual encounters and way girls address each other their nude scenes are used to communicate their vulnerability by end of film angela s hold on jane has weakened until only power she has over her friend is lester s attraction to her col fitts reacts with disgust to meeting jim and jim he asks how come these faggots always have to rub it in your face how can they be so shameless to which ricky replies that s thing dad they don t feel like it s anything to be ashamed of pennington argues that col fitts reaction is not homophobic but an anguished self interrogation with other turn of millennium films such as fight club in company of men 1997 american psycho 2000 and boys don t cry 1999 american beauty raises broader widely explored issue of masculinity in crisis professor vincent hausmann charges that in their reinforcement of masculinity against threats posed by war by consumerism and by feminist and queer challenges these films present a need to focus on and even to privilege aspects of maleness deemed deviant lester s transformation conveys that he and not woman has borne brunt of lack of being and he will not stand for being emasculated lester s attempts to strengthen traditional masculinity conflict with his responsibilities as a father although film portrays way lester returns to that role positively he does not become figure implicitly celebrated in films like fight club hausmann concludes that lester s behavior toward angela is a misguided but nearly necessary step toward his becoming a father again hausmann says film explicitly affirms importance of upholding prohibition against incest a recurring theme of ball s work is his comparison of taboos against incest and homosexuality instead of making an overt distinction american beauty looks at how their repression can lead to violence col fitts is so ashamed of his homosexuality that it drives him to murder lester ball said movie is in part about how homophobia is based in fear and repression and about what they can do film implies two unfulfilled incestuous desires lester s pursuit of angela is a manifestation of his lust for his own daughter while col fitts repression is exhibited through almost sexualized discipline with which he controls ricky consequently ricky realizes that he can only hurt his father by falsely telling him he is homosexual while angela s vulnerability and submission to lester reminds him of his responsibilities and limits of his fantasy col fitts represents ball s father whose repressed homosexual desires led to his own unhappiness ball rewrote col fitts to delay revealing him as homosexual which munt reads as a possible deferment of ball s own patriarchal incest fantasies temporality and music american beauty follows a traditional narrative structure only deviating with displaced opening scene of jane and ricky from middle of story although plot spans one year film is narrated by lester at moment of his death jacqueline furby says that plot occupies no time or all time citing lester s claim that life did not flash before his eyes but that it stretches on forever like an ocean of time furby argues that a rhythm of repetition forms core of film s structure for example two scenes have burnhams sitting down to an evening meal shot from same angle each image is broadly similar with minor differences in object placement and body language that reflect changed dynamic brought on by lester s new found assertiveness another example is pair of scenes in which jane and ricky film each other ricky films jane from his bedroom window as she removes her bra and image is reversed later for a similarly voyeuristic and exhibitionist scene in which jane films ricky at a vulnerable moment thumb

repeats several times before she reaches end of zip she opens sweater at which point hundreds of rose petals erupt from her chest towards man as on broadway returns so do cheerleaders parents and regular lights lester s fixation on angela is reflected in a discordant percussive musical motif that temporarily replaces diegetic on broadway lester s fantasies are emphasized by slow and repetitive motion shots mendes uses double and triple cutbacks in several sequences and score alters to make audience aware that it is entering a fantasy one example is gymnasium scene lester s first encounter with angela while cheerleaders perform their half time routine to on broadway lester becomes increasingly fixated on angela time slows to represent his voyeuristic hypnosis and lester begins to fantasize that angela s performance is for him alone on broadway which provides a conventional underscore to onscreen action is replaced by discordant percussive music that lacks melody or progression this score is important to creating narrative stasis in sequence it conveys a moment for lester that is stretched to an indeterminate length effect is one that stan link likens to vertical time described by composer and music theorist jonathan kramer as music that imparts a single present stretched out into an enormous duration a potentially infinite now that nonetheless feels like an instant music is used like a visual cue so that lester and score are staring at angela sequence ends with sudden reintroduction of on broadway and teleological time according to drew miller of stylus soundtrack gives unconscious voice to characters psyches and complements subtext most obvious use of pop music accompanies and gives context to lester s attempts to recapture his youth reminiscent of how counterculture of 1960s combated american repression through music and drugs lester begins to smoke cannabis and listen to rock music mendes song choices progress through history of american popular music miller argues that although some may be over familiar there is a parodic element at work making good on film s encouragement that viewers look closer toward end of film thomas newman s score features more prominently creating a disturbing tempo that matches tension of visuals exception is don t let it bring you down which plays during angela s seduction of lester at first

production development in 1997 alan ball resolved to move into film industry after several frustrating years writing for television sitcoms grace under fire and cybill he joined united talent agency where his representative andrew cannava suggested he write a spec script to reintroduce himself to town as a screenwriter ball pitched three ideas to cannava two conventional romantic comedies and american beauty cohen david s march 7 2000 scripter ball hits a home run variety which he had originally conceived as a play in early 1990s despite story s lack of an easily marketable concept cannava selected american beauty because he felt it was one for which ball had most passion while developing script ball created another television sitcom oh grow up he channeled his anger and frustration at having to accede to network demands on that show and during his tenures on grace under fire and cybill into writing american beauty ball did not expect to sell script believing it would act as more of a calling card but american beauty drew interest from several production bodies cannava passed script to several producers including dan jinks and bruce cohen who took it to dreamworks with help of executives glenn williamson and bob cooper and steven spielberg in his capacity as studio partner ball was convinced to develop project at dreamworks he received assurances from studio known at time for its more conventional fare that it would not iron edges out in an unusual move dreamworks decided not to option script instead in april 1998 studio bought it april 14 1998 dreamworks grateful for american beauty hollywood reporter for 250 000 outbidding fox searchlight pictures october films metro goldwyn mayer and lakeshore entertainment cox dan april 14 1998 d works courts beauty spec variety dreamworks planned to make film for 6 8 million jinks and cohen involved ball throughout film s development including casting and director selection producers met with about 20 interested directors several of whom were considered a list at time ball was not keen on more well known directors because he believed their involvement would increase budget and lead dreamworks to become nervous about content nevertheless studio offered film to mike nichols and robert zemeckis neither accepted in same year mendes then a theater director revived musical cabaret in new york with fellow director rob marshall beth swofford of creative artists agency arranged meetings for mendes with studio figures in los angeles to see if film direction was a possibility mendes came across american beauty in a pile of eight scripts at swofford s house and knew immediately that it was one he wanted to make early in his career he had been inspired by how film paris texas 1984 presented contemporary america as a mythic landscape and he saw same theme in american beauty as well as parallels with his own childhood mendes later met with spielberg impressed by mendes productions of oliver and cabaret fanshawe simon january 22 2000 sam smiles guardian 32 spielberg encouraged him to consider american beauty mendes found that he still had to convince dreamworks production executives to let him direct he had already discussed film with jinks and cohen and felt they supported him ball was also keen having seen cabaret he was impressed with mendes keen visual sense and thought he did not make obvious choices ball felt that mendes liked to look under story s surface a talent he felt would be a good fit with themes of american beauty mendes background also reassured him because of prominent role playwright usually has in a theater production over two meetings first with cooper walter parkes and laurie macdonald second with cooper alone mendes pitched himself to studio studio soon approached mendes with a deal to direct for minimum salary allowed under directors guild of america rules 150 000 mendes accepted and later recalled that after taxes and his agent s commission he only earned 38 000 in june 1998 dreamworks confirmed that it had contracted mendes to direct film hindes andrew june 16 1998 staging a transfer legit helmer mendes makes pic bow with beauty variety writing ball was partly inspired by two encounters he had in early 1990s in about 1991 92 ball saw a plastic bag blowing in wind outside world trade center he watched bag for 10 minutes saying later that it provoked an unexpected emotional response in 1992 ball became preoccupied with media circus that accompanied amy fisher trial discovering a comic book telling of scandal he was struck by how quickly it had become commercialized he said he felt like there was a real story underneath that was more fascinating and way more tragic than story presented to public and attempted to turn idea into a play ball produced around 40 pages but stopped when he realized it would work better as a film he felt that because of visual themes and because each character s story was intensely personal it could not be done on a stage all main characters appeared in this version but carolyn did not feature strongly jim and jim instead had much larger roles ball based lester s story on aspects of his own life lester s re examination of his life parallels feelings ball had in his mid 30s like lester ball put aside his passions to work in jobs he hated for people he did not respect scenes in ricky s household reflect ball s own childhood experiences ball suspected his father was homosexual and used idea to create col fitts a man who gave up his chance to be himself kilday gregg january 18 2000 worth a closer look advocate 91 92 ball said script s mix of comedy and drama was not intentional but that it came unconsciously from his own outlook on life he said juxtaposition produced a starker contrast giving each trait more impact than if they appeared alone in script that was sent to prospective actors and directors lester and angela had sex by time of shooting ball had rewritten scene to final version ball initially rebuffed counsel from others that he change script feeling they were being puritanical final impetus to alter scene came from dreamworks then president walter parkes he convinced ball by indicating that in greek mythology hero has a moment of epiphany before tragedy occurs ball later said his anger when writing first draft had blinded him to idea that lester needed to refuse sex with angela to complete his emotional journey to achieve redemption jinks and cohen asked ball not to alter scene right away as they felt it would be inappropriate to make changes to script before a director had been hired early drafts also included a flashback to col fitts service in marines a sequence that unequivocally established his homosexual leanings in love with another marine col fitts sees man die and comes to believe that he is being punished for sin of being gay ball removed sequence because it did not fit structure of rest of film col fitts was only character to have a flashback and because it removed element of surprise from col fitts later pass at lester ball said he had to write it for his own benefit to know what happened to col fitts though all that remained in later drafts was subtext ball remained involved throughout production he had signed a television show development deal so had to get permission from his producers to take a year off to be close to american beauty ball was on set for rewrites and to help interpret his script for all but two days of filming his original bookend scenes in which ricky and jane are prosecuted for lester s murder after being framed by col josh march 27 2000 pitching fitts entertainment weekly were excised in post production writer later felt scenes were unnecessary saying they were a reflection of his anger and cynicism at time of writing see editing ball and mendes revised script twice before it was sent to actors and twice more before first read through shooting script features a scene in angela s car in which ricky and jane talk about death and beauty scene differed from earlier versions which set it as a big scene on a freeway in which three witness a car crash and see a dead body change was a practical decision as production was behind schedule and they needed to cut costs schedule called for two days to be spent filming crash but only half a day was available ball agreed but only if scene could retain a line of ricky s where he reflects on having once seen a dead homeless woman when you see something like that it s like god is looking right at you just for a second and if you re careful you can look right back jane asks and what do you see ricky beauty ball said they wanted to cut that scene they said it s not important i said you re out of your fucking mind it s one of most important scenes in movie if any one line is heart and soul of this movie that is line another scene was rewritten to accommodate loss of freeway sequence set in a schoolyard it presents a turning point for jane in that she chooses to walk home with ricky instead of going with angela by end of filming script had been through 10 drafts casting 275px thumb alt seven head and shoulder

archetypes shohan said all of them are very strained and their lives are constructs burnhams household was designed as reverse of fitts former a pristine ideal but graceless and lacking in inner balance leading to carolyn s desire to at least give it appearance of a perfect all american household fitts home is depicted in exaggerated darkness and symmetry 250px thumb alt high angled aerial

selected two adjacent properties on warner backlot s blondie street for burnham and fitts homes crew rebuilt houses to incorporate false rooms that established lines of sight between ricky and jane s bedroom windows and between ricky s bedroom and lester s garage garage windows were designed specifically to obtain crucial shot toward end of film in which col fitts watching from ricky s bedroom mistakenly assumes that lester is paying ricky for sex mendes made sure to establish line of sight early on in film to make audience feel a sense of familiarity with shot house interiors were filmed on backlot on location and on soundstages when overhead shots were needed inside of burnhams home was shot at a house close to interstate 405 and sunset boulevard in los angeles inside of fitts home was shot in city s hancock park neighborhood ricky s bedroom was designed to be cell like to suggest his personality while at same time blending with high tech equipment to reflect his voyeuristic side production deliberately minimized use of red as it was an important thematic signature elsewhere burnhams home uses cool blues while fitts is kept in a depressed military palette mendes dominating visual style was deliberate and composed with a minimalist design that provided a sparse almost surreal feeling a bright crisp hard edged near magritte like take on american suburbia mendes constantly directed his set dressers to empty frame he made lester s fantasy scenes more fluid and graceful and mendes made minimal use of feeling that stable shots generated more tension for example when mendes used a slow push in to burnhams dinner table he held shot because his training as a theater director taught him importance of putting distance between characters he wanted to keep tension in scene so he only cut away when jane left table mendes did use a hand held camera for scene in which col fitts beats ricky mendes said camera provided scene with a kinetic off balance energy he also went hand held for excerpts of ricky s camcorder footage mendes took a long time to get quality of ricky s footage to level he wanted for plastic bag footage mendes used wind machines to move bag in air scene took four takes two by second unit did not satisfy mendes so he shot scene himself he felt his first take lacked grace but for last attempt he changed location to front of a brick wall and added leaves on ground mendes was satisfied by way wall gave definition to outline of bag mendes avoided using close ups as he believed technique was overused he also cited spielberg s advice that he should imagine an audience silhouetted at bottom of camera monitor to keep in mind that he was shooting for display on a screen spielberg who visited set a few times also advised mendes not to worry about costs if he had a great idea toward end of a long working day mendes said that happened three or four times and they are all in movie stein ruthe september 12 1999 from cabaret to california san francisco chronicle 55 despite spielberg s support dreamworks and mendes fought constantly over schedule and budget although studio interfered little with film s content spacey bening and hall worked for significantly less than their usual rates american beauty cost dreamworks 15 million to produce slightly above their projected sum mendes was so dissatisfied with his first three days filming that he obtained permission from dreamworks to reshoot scenes he said i started with a wrong scene actually a comedy scene and actors played it way too big it was badly shot my fault badly composed my fault bad costumes my fault and everybody was doing what i was asking it was all my fault aware that he was a novice mendes drew on experience of hall i made a very conscious decision early on if i didn t understand something technically to say without embarrassment i don t understand what you re talking about please explain it weinraub bernard september 12 1999 new season film stage to screen a wunderkind discovers wonders of film new york times 271 mendes encouraged some improvisation for example when lester masturbates in bed beside carolyn director asked spacey to improvise several euphemisms for act in each take mendes said i wanted that not just because it was funny but because i didn t want it to seem rehearsed i wanted it to seem like he was it out of his mouth without thinking spacey is so in control i wanted him to break through spacey obliged eventually coming up with 35 phrases but bening could not always keep a straight face which meant scene had to be shot 10 times production used small amounts of computer generated imagery most of rose petals in lester s fantasies were added in post production although some were real and had wires holding them digitally removed when lester fantasizes about angela in a rose petal bath steam was real save for in overhead shot to position camera a hole had to be cut in ceiling through which steam escaped it was instead added digitally editing american beauty was edited by christopher greenbury and tariq anwar greenbury began in position but had to leave halfway through post production because of a scheduling conflict with me myself and irene 2000 mendes and an assistant edited film for 10 days between appointments mendes realized during editing that film was different from one he had envisioned he believed he had been making a much more whimsical kaleidoscopic film than what came together in edit suite instead mendes was drawn to emotion and darkness he began to use score and shots he had intended to discard to craft film along these lines in total he cut about 30 minutes from his original edit opening included a dream in which lester imagines himself flying above town mendes spent two days filming spacey against bluescreen but removed sequence as he believed it to be too whimsical like a coen brothers movie and therefore inappropriate for tone he was trying to set opening in final cut reused a scene from middle of film where jane tells ricky to kill her father this scene was to be revelation to audience that pair was not responsible for lester s death as way it was scored and acted made it clear that jane s request was not serious however in portion he used in opening and when full scene plays out later mendes used score and a reaction shot of ricky to leave a lingering ambiguity as to his guilt subsequent shot an aerial view of neighborhood was originally intended as plate shot for bluescreen effects in dream sequence mendes spent more time recutting first 10 minutes than rest of film taken together he trialled several versions of opening first edit included bookend scenes in which jane and ricky are convicted of lester s murder but mendes excised these in last week of editing because he felt they made film lose its mystery staff july 7 2000 beauty mark dvd due with 3 hours of extras hollywood reporter and because they did not fit with theme of redemption that had emerged during production mendes believed trial drew focus away from characters and turned film into an episode of nypd blue instead he wanted ending to be a poetic mixture of dream and memory and narrative resolution when ball first saw a completed edit it was a version with truncated versions of these scenes he felt that they were so short that they didn t really register mendes and he argued but ball was more accepting after mendes cut sequences completely ball felt that without scenes film was more optimistic and had evolved into something that for all its darkness had a really romantic heart cinematography conrad hall was not first choice for director of photography mendes believed he was too old and too experienced to want job and he had been told that hall was difficult to work with instead mendes asked fred elmes who turned job down because he did not like script hall was recommended to mendes by tom cruise because of hall s work on without limits 1998 which cruise had executive produced mendes was directing cruise s then wife nicole kidman in play blue room during preproduction on american beauty and had already storyboarded whole film hall was involved for one month during preproduction his ideas for lighting film began with his first reading of script and further passes allowed him to refine his approach before meeting mendes hall was initially concerned that audiences would not like characters he only felt able to identify with them during cast rehearsals which gave him fresh ideas on his approach to visuals hall s approach was to create peaceful compositions that evoked classicism to contrast with turbulent on screen events and allow audiences to take in action hall and mendes first discussed intended mood of a scene but he was allowed to light shot in any way he felt necessary in most cases hall first lit scene s subject by painting in blacks and whites before adding fill light which he reflected from or white card on ceiling this approach gave hall more control over shadows while keeping fill light unobtrusive and dark areas free of spill hall shot american beauty in a 2 39 1 aspect ratio in super 35 format primarily using kodak vision 500t 5279 35 mm film stock he used super 35 partly because its larger scope allowed him to capture elements such as corners of petal filled pool in its overhead shot creating a frame around angela within he shot whole film at same t stop t1 9 given his preference for shooting that wide hall favored high speed stocks to allow for more subtle lighting effects he used panavision platinum cameras with company s primo series of prime and zoom lenses hall employed kodak vision and stock for scenes with daylight effects he had difficulty adjusting to kodak s newly introduced vision release print stock which combined with his contrast heavy lighting style created a look with too much contrast hall contacted kodak who sent him a batch of 5279 that was 5 lower in contrast hall used a 1 8 inch black filter for almost every scene which he said in retrospect may not have been best choice as optical steps required to blow super 35 up for its anamorphic release print led to a slight amount of degradation therefore diffusion from filter was not required when he saw film in a theater hall felt that image was slightly unclear and that had he not used filter diffusion from super 35 anamorphic conversion would have generated an image closer to what he originally intended a shot where lester and ricky share a cannabis joint behind a building came from a misunderstanding between hall and mendes mendes asked hall to prepare shot in his absence hall assumed characters would look for privacy so he placed them in a narrow passage between a truck and building intending to light from top of truck when mendes returned he explained that characters did not care if they were seen he removed truck and hall had to rethink lighting he lit it from left with a large light crossing actors and with a soft light behind camera hall felt consequent wide shot worked perfectly for tone of scene hall made sure to keep rain or suggestion of it in every shot near end of film in one shot during lester s encounter with angela at burnhams home hall created rain effects on foreground cross lights in another he partly lit pair through french windows to which he had added material to make rain run slower intensifying light although strength of outside light was unrealistic for a night scene hall felt it justified because of strong contrasts it produced for close ups when lester and angela move to couch hall tried to keep rain in frame lighting through window onto ceiling behind lester he also used rain boxes to produce rain patterns where he wanted without lighting entire room music thomas newman s score was recorded in santa monica california he used mainly percussion instruments to create mood and rhythm inspiration for which was provided by mendes newman favored pulse rhythm and color over melody making for a more minimalist score than he had previously created he built each cue around small endlessly repeating phrases often only variety

featured were guitars flute and world music instruments newman also used electronic music and on quirkier tracks employed more unorthodox methods such as tapping metal mixing bowls with a finger and using a detuned mandolin newman believed score helped move film along without disturbing moral ambiguity of script it was a real delicate balancing act in terms of what music worked to preserve that

wittiest and most agile to date maslin janet september 15 1999 dad s dead and he s still a funny guy new york times e1 and roger ebert of chicago sun times singled spacey out for successfully portraying a man who does reckless and foolish things but who doesn t deceive himself ebert roger september 23 1999 american beauty chicago sun times kevin jackson of sight sound said spacey impressed in ways distinct from his previous performances most satisfying aspect being his portrayal of both sap and hero writing in film quarterly gary hentzi praised actors but said that characters such as carolyn and col fitts were stereotypes hentzi accused mendes and ball of identifying too readily with jane and ricky saying latter was their fantasy figure a teenaged boy who s an absurdly wealthy artist able to finance his own projects hentzi said angela was most believable teenager in particular with her painfully familiar attempts to live up to an unworthy image of herself maslin agreed that some characters were unoriginal but said their detailed characterizations made them memorable kenneth turan of los angeles times said actors coped faultlessly with what were difficult roles he called spacey s performance energy that drives film saying actor commanded audience involvement despite lester not always being sympathetic against considerable odds we do like these characters turan concluded turan kenneth september 15 1999 american beauty rose s thorns los angeles times maslin felt that mendes directed with terrific visual flair saying his minimalist style balanced mordant and bright and that he evoked delicate eroticized power playing vignettes of his theater work jackson said mendes theatrical roots rarely showed and that most remarkable aspect was that spacey s performance did not overshadow film he said that mendes worked script s intricacies smoothly to ensemble s strengths and staged tonal shifts skillfully mccarthy believed american beauty a stunning card of introduction for film debutantes mendes and ball he said mendes sure hand was as precise and controlled as his theater work mccarthy cited hall s involvement as fortunate for mendes as cinematographer was unsurpassed at conveying themes of a work turan agreed that mendes choice of collaborators was shrewd naming hall and newman in particular turan suggested that american beauty may have benefited from mendes inexperience as his anything s possible daring made him attempt beats that more seasoned directors might have avoided turan felt that mendes accomplishment was to capture and enhance duality of ball s script simultaneously caricatured and painfully real characters hentzi while critical of many of mendes and ball s choices admitted film showed off their considerable talents turan cited ball s lack of constraint when writing film as reason for its uniqueness in particular script s subtle changes in tone mccarthy said script was as fresh and distinctive as any of its american film contemporaries and praised how it analyzed characters while not compromising narrative pace he called ball s dialogue tart and said characters carolyn excepted were deeply drawn one other flaw mccarthy said was revelation of col fitts homosexuality which he said evoked hoary jackson said film transcended its cliched setup to become a wonderfully resourceful and sombre comedy he said that even when film played for sitcom laughs it did so with unexpected nuance hentzi criticized how film made a mystery of lester s murder believing it manipulative and simply a way of generating suspense mccarthy cited production and costume design as and said soundtrack was good at creating ironic counterpoint s to story hentzi concluded that american beauty was vital but uneven he felt film s examination of ways which teenagers and adults imagine each other s lives was its best point and that although lester and angela s dynamic was familiar its romantic irony stood beside most enduring literary treatments of theme such as lolita nevertheless hentzi believed that film s themes of materialism and conformity in american suburbia were hackneyed mccarthy conceded that setting was familiar but said it merely provided film with a starting point from which to tell its subtle and acutely judged tale maslin agreed she said that while it takes aim at targets that are none too fresh and that theme of nonconformity did not surprise film had its own corrosive novelty ebert awarded american beauty four stars out of four and turan said it was layered subversive complex and surprising

all time premiere 19 1 103 108 mendes accepted inevitability of critical reappraisal saying i thought some of it was entirely justified it was a little at time as 20th anniversary of film s release approached huffington posts matthew jacobs noted that film s reputation had continued to decline to point of making it a widespread punchline by 2019 what was once a provocative masterstroke now looks like retrograde hooey he observed there were he believed several different reasons for this reassessment even without overtones to lester s character created by 2017 sexual assault allegations against spacey jacobs notes his attraction to angela is problematic since while film recognizes it as unhealthy in part it also eroticizes her film also he suggests deserves criticism for equating homosexuality and death when frank kills lester for rejecting his advances i t s striking how few challenged its dodgy ideas about gender class and sexuality writes jacobs given that film would hardly survive think piece cycle that now pop culture for jacobs reassessment of film likely began when dreamworks refused to make a clip of fantasized kiss between lester and angela available for that year s mtv movie award for best kiss which viewers nominated it for since studio felt that even considering it for that award went against filmmakers intentions in including that scene he notes that parodies of scenes in film including two within a few weeks of each other on animated series family guy that appeared within a year of film s release suggested a further skepticism on popular culture s part as to film s importance but it was in particular september 11 attacks that made american beauty seem dated and shallow within two years of its release according to jacobs overnight we saw entire world differently he recalls profound ideas at which film grasped now seemed passe at best and clueless at worst great recession widened that cultural distance from late 1990s jacobs argues and
