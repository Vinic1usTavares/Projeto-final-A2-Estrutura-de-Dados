boletus curtisii is a species of fungus in boletaceae family it produces small to medium sized fruit bodies mushrooms with a convex cap up to wide atop a slender stem that can reach a length of in young specimens cap and stem are bright golden yellow although color dulls to brownish when old both stem and cap are slimy or sticky when young on underside of cap are small circular to angular pores mushroom is edible but not appealing it is found in eastern and southern north america where it grows in a mycorrhizal association with hardwood and conifer trees once classified as a species of pulveroboletus yellow color of b curtisii is a result of pigments chemically distinct from those responsible for yellow coloring of pulveroboletus taxonomy species was first described scientifically by english mycologist miles joseph berkeley in 1853 specific epithet curtisii honors moses ashley curtis who collected type material from south carolina american mycologist william murrill called it ceriomyces curtisii in 1909 but ceriomyces as defined by murrill in 1909 has since been subsumed into boletus in his 1947 monograph on boletes of florida rolf singer transferred species to genus pulveroboletus and made it type of his newly described section which featured species with a glutinous or sticky stem and a leather colored to brownish hymenophore species in pulveroboletus are characterized by presence of pigments based on chemical structure of pulvinic acid a yellow orange compound found in some species of boletales pigments responsible for color of b curtisii are however entirely different from pulvinic acid compounds found in pulveroboletus species which invalidates chemotaxonomical rational for generic placement in pulveroboletus otto kuntze once placed species in suillus but it lacks partial veil and glandular dots associated with that genus william chambers coker and alma beers considered charles horton peck s boletus described from new york in 1895 as well as henry curtis s 1915 b carolinensis to be same species as b curtisii coker and beer s suggested synonymy however is not recognized by taxonomical authorities mycobank or index fungorum wally snell once considered boletus carolinensis to be species as b curtisii he claimed that former species was then considered distinct from latter by virtue of an even instead of reticulate netlike stem although they were otherwise quite similar in appearance and spore size and shape snell explained that although neither english nor latin text of berkeley s original description mentioned a reticulated stem a later 1872 description by berkeley characterized stem as snell thought that this might have been an error in transcription or an error in species account as herbarium specimens that he had examined lacked this feature he changed his mind a couple of years later when he found a small amount of reticulation in material collected by peck description thumb left view of cap underside showing margin small white pores and droplets of golden yellow liquid cap is wide and initially obtuse to convex in shape before becoming broadly convex to nearly flat when mature cap margin has a narrow band of sterile tissue that in young fruit bodies is curved inwards cap surface is somewhat sticky when fresh smooth and bright yellow to orange yellow sometimes with brownish tints or whitish areas in age whitish flesh does not change color when exposed to air and has no distinctive odor or taste on underside of cap pore surface is initially whitish to buff or pale yellow but becomes duller and darker at maturity often depressed near stem in age unlike some other boletes b curtisii does not turn blue when bruised or injured pores are circular to angular and there are 2 3 per mm tubes are 6 12 mm deep young fruit bodies usually have droplets of golden yellow liquid on pore surface sometimes abundantly so although this is rarely observed in older specimens stem is long thick and roughly equal in width throughout its surface is sticky and glutinous when fresh somewhat scurfy near apex covered with loose scales but smooth below it is pale yellow to yellow down to base which is sheathed with a cottony white mycelium stem can be either solid or hollow mushroom lacks a partial veil and a ring spore print is olive brown mushroom is edible but not appealing thumb right smooth yellowish spores have an ellipsoid to somewhat ventricose shape 1000x magnification divisions are 1 mm spores are 9 5 17 by 4 6 mm ellipsoid to somewhat ventricose inflated on one side smooth and yellowish basidia spore bearing cells are four spored measuring 25 32 by 6 10 8 mm cystidia lining inside of tubes are shaped like setae i e thick walled and thorn like and have dimensions of 43 86 by 6 5 11 mm all hyphae lack clamp connections similar species retiboletus retipes is somewhat similar in appearance but is distinguished by a more orange to orange yellow color a lack of sliminess and a distinctly reticulated stalk habitat and distribution fruit bodies of b curtisii grow singly scattered or in small groups on ground in coniferous or mixed woods often with pines fruit bodies generally appear from august to november geographical distribution of fungus is limited to eastern and southern north america in united states it occurs from new england south to florida and west to texas species was newly reported from mexico in 2001 pigments fruit bodies of boletus curtisii contain a unique series of derivatives of molecule canthin 6 one before this discovery canthin 6 one alkaloids were only known from higher plants among canthin 6 one derivatives are pigments that give mushroom its bright yellow color including two optically active named and 9 spraying a fruit body with methanol causes pigments to dissolve and makes color wash away a phenomenon unknown in other bolete mushrooms additionally spraying fruit bodies with acetone results in a green yellow fluorescence
