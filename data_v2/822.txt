diocesan land not used for church purposes and over next few years land surplus vestments and works of art owned by archdiocese were sold off these sales combined efforts of archbishop and diocesan priests to secure donations from around archdiocese meant that by 1901 o reily was able to report that debt had been reduced by three quarters this had been achieved at same time as expenditure was being made on new schools churches and other diocesan buildings in fact o reily noted in his report for that year that remainder of debt could have been removed had expenditure been cut writing

instruction in state schools so long as teachers themselves were religious and catholic students received instruction from catholic teachers on subject of a capitation grant o reily was strongly supportive arguing that moral impediments prevented catholics from using secular education and that since religious schools provided elements of secular education as well as religious instruction they should receive government assistance at referendum south australians affirmed system of free secular education but rejected scriptural readings in schools and capitation grant o reily blamed labor party for loss of capitation grant according to o reily serving premier charles kingston could have been convinced to support grant were it not for objections of labor with whom kingston had formed a
