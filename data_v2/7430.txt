roman empire he was made king of armenia after its conquest by shapur i in 252 hormizd is believed to be many modern historians to have taken part in shapur i s second roman expedition which took place in roman provinces of syria cilicia and cappadocia and which lasted from 253 to 256 this is supported by reports of cappadocian conquests cappadocia does not appear to be have been only area that hormizd fought in according to scriptores historiae augustae roman rebel assisted shapur i and a certain odomastes in conquest of antioch name odomastes is an incorrect transliteration of hormizd

reign he reportedly gave zoroastrian priest kartir clothes that were worn by upper class cap and belt ud and appointed him as chief priest mowbed like his father hormizd also granted manichaean prophet mani permission to continue his preaching it is unclear why hormizd supported kartir and mani both of whom represented a different religion iranologist touraj has suggested that it was possibly part of his attempt to control both religions which were both seeking to become main religion in empire according to norwegian iranologist prods hormizd was like his two predecessors a lukewarm zoroastrian hormizd is usually given epithet of new or both meaning brave in manichean middle iranian sources possibly indicating his accomplishments in warfare it was seemingly under hormizd that two new year festivals nowruz in month of were linked together to design a festival that lasted six days in primary sources hormizd is credited as founder of city of ohrmazd ardashir present day ahvaz however in some instances ardashir i is also attributed as its founder modern historians consider hormizd to be its actual founder hormizd was not succeeded by his son but by his brother bahram who became known as bahram i who ascended throne with aid of kartir coinage and imperial ideology thumb coin of hormizd i while ardashir i and shapur i generally used title of king of kings of iran ians on their coinage hormizd had title modified adding phrase and non iran ians his full title thus read mazda worshiping divine hormizd king of kings of iran ians and non iran ians whose image brilliance is from gods phrase and non iran ians had already been in use in inscriptions of shapur i and in rare cases his coin mints but was first regularized under hormizd extended title demonstrates incorporation of new territory into empire however what was precisely seen as non iran ian is not certain reverse of hormizd s coin portrayed two attendants an addition that was first made by shapur i on whose coinage both attendants are depicted wearing mural crowns whilst looking away from fire temple between them they most likely represented shah in coinage of hormizd attendants face temple and are wearing different crowns figure on left side represents hormizd whilst figure on right depending on its portrayal represents iranian deities mithra or anahita notes references
