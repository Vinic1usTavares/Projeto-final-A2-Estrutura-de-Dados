scholar william e barton interviewed oldest residents of hopkinton massachusetts for their memories of bixby s family before she moved to boston they recalled her sons as being tough with some of them too fond of drink one son may have served a jail sentence for some misdemeanor on august 12 1925 elizabeth towers a daughter of oliver bixby told boston herald that her grandmother had great sympathy

original bixby letters every year including copies of a lithographic facsimile of letter in widespread circulation these first appeared in 1891 when new york city print dealer michael f tobin applied for a copyright to sell souvenir copies of letter with an engraving of lincoln by john chester for 2 each soon huber s museum a dime museum in manhattan began displaying a copy stained by coffee and exposure of tobin s facsimile as original bixby letter and selling their own copies for 1 each charles hamilton an autograph dealer and handwriting expert examined tobin facsimile concluding it had been copied from a poorly executed forgery originally written in pencil and retraced in ink to imitate lincoln s handwriting calling it halting and awkward and makes his forceful hand appear like a child s scrawl tobin s facsimile also errs when compared to original text of letter published in boston newspapers adding salutation to mrs bixby boston mass misspelling word assuage as omitting word to after word tendering changing plural words into word not capitalizing words freedom and republic missing recipient mrs bixby on bottom left and combining original three paragraphs into one huber s museum corrected spelling of assuage in their version of facsimile thumb left john hay lincoln s private secretary authorship scholars have debated whether bixby letter was written by lincoln himself or by his assistant private secretary john hay november 1864 was a busy month for lincoln possibly forcing him to delegate task to hay second and third hand recollections of acquaintances suggest hay may have claimed to others that he wrote it but his children could not recall him ever mentioning composing letter writing to william e chandler in 1904 hay said letter of mr lincoln to mrs bixby is genuine but he may only have been referring to its text in a 1917 letter to historian isaac robert todd lincoln said hay had told him that he did not have any special knowledge of letter at time it was written historian michael burlingame who believes hay is author has pointed out that hay s scrapbooks have two newspaper clippings of letter while largely containing hay s own writing however they also contain material written by lincoln including gettysburg address and second inaugural scholars favoring lincoln s authorship including edward steers and jason emerson note that gettysburg address and farewell address are similar examples of lincoln s highly regarded style other scholars such as burlingame have countered that hay wrote pieces that compare favorably to bixby letter and note words and phrases in letter that appear more frequently in hay s writings than those of lincoln for instance burlingame notes word beguile appears numerous times in works of hay and phrase i cannot refrain from tendering is used by hay in an 1864 letter to quincy gillmore but neither appears once in other collected works of lincoln however phrase i cannot refrain from is used by lincoln in an 1859 letter to salmon p chase in 1988 at request of investigator joe nickell university of kentucky professor of english jean g studied vocabulary syntax and other stylistic characteristics of letter and concluded that it more closely resembled lincoln s style of writing than hay s a computer analysis method developed to address difficulty in attribution of shorter texts used in a 2018 study by researchers at aston university s centre for forensic linguistics identified hay as letter s author thumb 200px inscription quoting bixby letter at national memorial cemetery of pacific legacy letter
