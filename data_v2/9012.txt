a momentary lapse of reason is thirteenth studio album by english progressive rock band pink floyd released in uk and us on 7 september 1987 by emi and columbia it was recorded primarily on guitarist david gilmour s converted houseboat astoria it was first pink floyd album recorded without founding member roger waters who departed in 1985 production was marred by legal fights over rights to pink floyd name which was not resolved until several months after album was released unlike earlier pink floyd records a momentary lapse of reason is not a concept album it includes writing contributions from outside songwriters following gilmour s decision to include material once intended for his third solo album album was promoted with a successful world tour and with three singles double a side learning to fly terminal frost on turning away and one slip a momentary lapse of reason received mixed reviews critics praised production and instrumentation but criticised gilmour s writing and it was derided by waters it reached number three in uk and us and outsold pink floyd s previous album final cut background after release of pink floyd s 1983 album final cut viewed by some as a de facto solo record by bassist and songwriter roger waters band members worked on solo projects guitarist david gilmour expressed feelings about his strained relationship with waters on his second solo album about face 1984 and finished accompanying tour as waters began touring to promote his debut solo album pros and cons of hitch hiking although both had enlisted a range of successful performers including in waters case eric clapton their solo acts attracted fewer fans than pink floyd poor ticket sales forced gilmour to cancel several concerts and critic david fricke felt that waters show was a petulant echo a transparent attempt to prove that roger waters was pink floyd waters returned to us in march 1985 with a second tour this time without support of cbs records which had expressed its preference for a new pink floyd album waters criticised corporation as a machine after drummer nick mason attended one of waters london performances in 1985 he found he missed touring under pink floyd name his visit coincided with release in august of his second solo album profiles on which gilmour sang with a shared love of aviation mason and gilmour were taking flying lessons and together bought a de havilland dove aeroplane gilmour was working on other collaborations including a performance for bryan ferry at 1985 s live aid concert and co produced dream academy s self titled debut album in december 1985 waters announced that he had left pink floyd which he believed was a spent force creatively after failure of his about face tour gilmour hoped to continue with pink floyd name threat of a lawsuit from gilmour mason and cbs records was meant to compel waters to write and produce another pink floyd album with his bandmates who had barely participated in making final cut gilmour was especially critical of album labelling it cheap filler and meandering rubbish according to gilmour i told waters before he left if you go man we re carrying on make no bones about it we would carry on and roger replied you ll never fucking do it waters had written to emi and columbia declaring his intention to leave group and asking them to release him from his contractual obligations he also dispensed with services of pink floyd manager steve o rourke and employed peter rudge to manage his affairs this left gilmour and mason in their view free to continue with pink floyd name in 2013 waters said he regretted lawsuit and had not understood english jurisprudence in waters absence gilmour had been recruiting musicians for a new project months previously keyboardist jon carin had jammed with gilmour at his studio where he composed chord progression that became learning to fly and so was invited onto team gilmour invited bob ezrin co producer of 1979 s wall to help consolidate their material ezrin had turned down waters offer of a role on development of his new solo album radio k a o s saying it was far easier for dave and i to do our version of a floyd record ezrin arrived in england in mid 1986 for what gilmour later described as mucking about with a lot of demos at this stage there was no commitment to a new pink floyd release and gilmour maintained that material might become his third solo album cbs representative stephen ralbovsky hoped for a new pink floyd album but in a meeting in november 1986 told gilmour and ezrin that music doesn t sound a fucking thing like pink floyd gilmour later said that project had been difficult without waters he experimented with songwriters such as eric stewart and roger but settled on anthony moore who was credited as co writer of learning to fly and on turning away whereas many prior pink floyd albums are concept albums gilmour chose a more conventional approach of a collection of songs without a thematic link by end of that year he had decided to make material into a pink floyd project recording a momentary lapse of reason was recorded in several studios mainly gilmour s houseboat studio astoria moored on thames according to ezrin working there was just magical so inspirational kids down river geese flying by andy jackson was brought in to engineer during sessions held between november 1986 and february 1987 gilmour s band worked on new material which in a marked change from previous pink floyd albums was recorded with a 24 track analogue machine and overdubbed onto a 32 track mitsubishi digital recorder this trend of using new technologies continued with use of midi synchronisation aided by an apple macintosh computer after agreeing to rework material that ralbovsky had found objectionable gilmour employed session musicians such as carmine appice and jim keltner both drummers they replaced mason on several songs mason was concerned that he was too out of practice to perform on album and instead busied himself with its sound effects some drum parts were also performed by drum machines during sessions gilmour was asked by wife of pink floyd s former keyboardist richard wright if he could contribute a founding member of band wright had left in 1979 and there were legal obstacles to his return but after a meeting in hampstead he was recruited as a paid musician on a weekly wage of 11 000 gilmour said in an interview with author karl dallas that wright s presence would make us stronger legally and musically however his contributions were minimal most of keyboard parts had already been recorded and so from february 1987 wright played some background reinforcement on a hammond organ and a rhodes piano and added vocal harmonies he also performed a solo in on turning away which was discarded according to wright not because they didn t like it they just thought it didn t fit gilmour later said both nick and rick were catatonic in terms of their playing ability at beginning neither of them played on this at all really in my view they d been destroyed by roger gilmour s comments angered mason who said i d deny that i was catatonic i d expect that from opposition it s less attractive from one s allies at some point he made some sort of apology mason conceded that gilmour was nervous about how album would be perceived learning to fly with its lyrics of circling sky tongue tied and twisted just an earthbound misfit i was inspired by gilmour s flying lessons which occasionally conflicted with his studio duties track also contains a recording of mason s voice during takeoff band experimented with audio samples and ezrin recorded sound of gilmour s boatman langley iddens rowing across thames iddens presence at sessions was made vital when astoria began to lift in response to rapidly rising river which was pushing boat against pier on which it was moored dogs of war is a song about physical and political mercenaries according to gilmour its creation came about through a mishap in studio when a sampling machine began playing a sample of laughter which gilmour thought sounded like a dog s bark terminal frost was one of gilmour s older demos which he considered adding lyrics to but decided to leave as an instrumental conversely lyrics for sorrow were written before music song s opening guitar solo was recorded in los angeles memorial sports arena a 24 track mobile studio piped gilmour s guitar tracks through a public address system and resulting mix was then recorded in surround sound legal disputes right thumb

glass awning astoria sessions were interrupted by escalating disagreement between waters and pink floyd over who had rights to pink floyd name o rourke believing that his contract with waters had been terminated illegally sued waters for ps25 000 of back commission in a late 1986 board meeting of pink floyd music ltd pink floyd s clearing house for all financial transactions since 1973 waters learnt that a bank account had been opened to deal exclusively with all monies related to new pink floyd project he immediately applied to high court to prevent pink floyd name from being used again but his lawyers discovered that partnership had never been formally confirmed waters returned to high court in an attempt to gain a veto over further use of band s name gilmour s team responded by issuing a press release affirming that pink floyd would continue to exist however gilmour told a sunday times reporter roger is a dog in manger and i m going to fight him no one else has claimed pink floyd was entirely them anybody who does is extremely arrogant waters twice visited astoria and with his wife had a meeting in august 1986 with ezrin ezrin later suggested that he was being checked out as waters was still a shareholder and director of pink floyd music he was able to block any decisions made by his former bandmates recording moved to mayfair studios in february 1987 and from february to march under terms of an agreement with ezrin to record close to his home to a m studios in los angeles it was fantastic because lawyers couldn t call in middle of recording unless they were calling in middle of night bitterness of row between waters and pink floyd was covered in a november 1987 issue of rolling stone which became magazine s best selling issue of that year legal disputes were resolved out of court by end of 1987 packaging and title left thumb 250px alt a monochrome photograph of two middle aged men alongside which is a list of credits original lp gatefold

studio album cover his finished design was a long river of hospital beds arranged on a beach inspired by a phrase from yet another movie and gilmour s vague hint of a design that included a bed in a mediterranean house as well as vestiges of relationships that have evaporated leaving only echoes cover shows hundreds of hospital beds placed on sands in devon where some of scenes for pink floyd wall were filmed beds were arranged by thorgerson s colleague colin elgie a hang glider in sky references learning to fly photographer robert dowling won a gold award at association of photographers

released in uk and us on 7 september 1987 it went straight to number three in both countries held from top spot in us by michael jackson s bad and whitesnake s self titled album it spent 34 weeks on uk albums chart it was certified silver and gold in uk on 1 october 1987 and gold and platinum in us on 9 november it went double platinum on 18 january following year triple platinum on 10 march 1992 and quadruple platinum on 16 august 2001 greatly outselling final cut gilmour presented a momentary lapse as a return to an older pink floyd sound citing his belief that under waters tenure lyrics had become more important than music he said that their albums dark side of moon and wish you were here were successful not just because of roger s contributions but also because there was a better balance between music and lyrics than on later albums waters said of album i think it s very facile but a quite clever forgery songs are poor in general lyrics i can t quite believe gilmour s lyrics are very third rate wright later said waters criticisms were fair in q phil sutcliffe wrote that it does sound like a pink floyd album and highlighted two part a new machine as a chillingly beautiful vocal exploration and a brilliant stroke of imagination he concluded a momentary lapse is gilmour s album to much same degree that previous four under floyd s name were dominated by waters clearly it wasn t only business sense and repressed ego but repressed talent which drove guitarist to insist on continuing under band brand name available at rock s backpages subscription required recognising return to a more music oriented approach sounds said album was back over wall to where diamonds are crazy moons have dark sides and mothers have atom hearts conversely greg quill of toronto star wrote something s missing here this is for all its lumbering weight not a record that challenges and provokes as pink floyd should a momentary lapse of reason sorry to say is mundane predictable village voice critic robert christgau wrote you d hardly know group s was gone except that they put out noticeably fewer ideas in 2016 allmusic critic william ruhlmann described it as a gilmour solo album in all but name in 2016 nick shilton chose a momentary lapse of reason as one of top 10 essential 80s prog albums for prog he wrote while it s not a patch on floyd masterworks of 70s it merits inclusion here ironically titled signs of life is an instrumental prelude for learning to fly which showcases gilmour s guitar while pulsating dogs of war is considerably darker and uplifting on turning away simply sublime reissues it was reissued in 1988 as a limited edition vinyl album complete with posters and a guaranteed ticket application for band s upcoming uk concerts album was digitally remastered and re released in 1994 and a tenth anniversary edition was issued in us three years later a momentary lapse of reason will be reissued again as part of pink floyd later years box set due in november 2019 album has been updated and remixed by gilmour and andy jackson and will feature restored contributions from wright and newly recorded drum tracks from mason to restore creative

rehearsals were chaotic mason and wright were out of practice and realising he had taken on too much work gilmour asked ezrin to take charge matters were complicated when waters contacted several us promoters and threatened to sue if they used pink floyd name gilmour and mason funded start up costs mason separated from his wife used his ferrari 250 gto as collateral some promoters were offended by waters threat and several months later 60 000 tickets went on sale in toronto selling out within hours as new line up with wright toured throughout north america waters radio k a o s tour was sometimes close by waters forbade members of pink floyd to attend his concerts which were generally in smaller venues waters also issued a writ for copyright fees for use of pink floyd flying pig pink floyd responded by attaching a huge set of male genitalia to balloon s underside to distinguish it from waters design by november 1987 had waters given up and on 23 december a legal settlement was reached at a meeting on astoria mason and gilmour were allowed use of pink floyd name in perpetuity and waters would be granted among other things rights to wall however waters claimed that they would never have level of success that they had during his tenure again momentary lapse tour beat box office records in every us venue it booked and was most successful us tour that year tours of australia
