homer and bart return to springfield unaware they left homer s electric hammer at museum later when family watches news on television kent brockman announces that chair and electric hammer have been discovered at edison museum and are expected to generate millions for edison s already wealthy heirs to ire of family production wizard of evergreen terrace was written by john swartzwelder who had a deal with producers of show to write five scripts for season ten although he was one who wrote episode dan greaney was one who came up with idea for it greaney based homer s intense obsession with edison on fact that when he himself would have an obsession with something in life he would badger and bore people with details of it homer s relationship to thomas edison s achievements is a version of my own experience of trying to communicate experience of things you love by driving people crazy greaney said in a dvd audio commentary for episode chair was also an idea of greaney s while working on episode he was leaning back in his chair and fell backwards he casually said it would be great if there were legs on back of chair and someone in writing room said that would be a great invention for homer soon after coming up with story greaney told it to swartzwelder so that he could turn it into a script greaney said it couldn t in my best dreams have turned out as good as it did if i had written it mark kirkland was director of wizard of evergreen terrace he recalls that when he attended table read for episode staff thought it was hilarious and they could tell it was going to be a good one it was last episode to be produced during season nine production run and because it takes several months to complete production of a single episode it had to air as a hold over in upcoming tenth season it was decided that wizard of evergreen terrace would be premiere episode of season ten as a result annual premiere party was held at museum of science and technology in los angeles it was a tradition for premiere party to be related to premiere episode kirkland cites his assistant director matthew nastuk as a big influence on episode he became heavily involved with animation because he had grown up in new jersey where thomas edison national historical park that homer and bart visit is located to help make museum look as authentic as possible kirkland and nastuk visited it and took a large number of photographs that they brought back to animation studio at one point in episode homer writes complex math formulas on a chalkboard producers wanted them to be actual formulas so writer david x cohen got in contact with a professor at massachusetts institute of technology who were able to provide them right thumb william daniels guest starred as kitt a character from knight

and sly digs at our expectations of homer s abilities fact that he invents things that other people find useful and steal credit for is both amusing and a little sad poor homer writing for dvd movie guide colin jacobson commented that though wizard borders on homer s wacky scheme territory his attempts to come up with something significant offer amusement at no point does wizard threaten to become a particularly strong episode but it entertains to a reasonable degree i do like everything s okay alarm and makeup gun though although lard of dance aired as a teaser episode a month earlier
