trajan 18 september 117 was roman emperor from 98 to 117 officially declared by senate optimus princeps best ruler trajan is remembered as a successful soldier emperor who presided over greatest military expansion in roman history leading empire to attain its maximum territorial extent by time of his death he is also known for his philanthropic rule overseeing extensive public building programs and implementing social welfare policies which earned him his enduring reputation as second of five good emperors who presided over an era of peace and prosperity in mediterranean world

emperor domitian serving as a legatus legionis in hispania tarraconensis in 89 trajan supported domitian against a revolt on rhine led by antonius saturninus in september 96 domitian was succeeded by old and childless nerva who proved to be unpopular with army after a brief and tumultuous year in power culminating in a revolt by members of praetorian guard he was compelled to adopt more popular trajan as his heir and successor nerva died in 98 and was succeeded by his adopted son without incident as a civilian administrator trajan is best known for his extensive public building program which reshaped city of rome and left numerous enduring landmarks such as trajan s forum trajan s market and trajan s column early in his reign he annexed nabataean kingdom creating province of arabia petraea his conquest of dacia enriched empire greatly as new province possessed many valuable gold mines trajan s war against parthian empire ended with sack of capital ctesiphon and annexation of armenia and mesopotamia his campaigns expanded roman empire to its greatest territorial extent in late 117 while sailing back to rome trajan fell ill and died of a stroke in city of selinus he was deified by senate and his ashes were laid to rest under column he was succeeded by his cousin hadrian whom trajan supposedly adopted on his deathbed sources as an emperor trajan s reputation has is one of few rulers whose reputation has survived nineteen centuries every new emperor after him was honoured by senate with wish felicior augusto melior traiano that he be luckier than augustus and better than trajan among medieval christian theologians trajan was considered a virtuous pagan in renaissance machiavelli speaking on advantages of adoptive succession over heredity mentioned five successive good emperors from nerva to marcus discourses on livy i 10 4a trope out of which 18th century historian edward gibbon popularized notion of five good emperors of whom trajan was second as far as ancient literary sources are concerned an extant continuous account of trajan s reign does not exist an account of dacian wars commentarii de bellis written by trajan himself or a ghostwriter and modelled after caesar s commentarii de bello gallico is lost with exception of one sentence only fragments remain of a book by trajan s personal physician a 17 volume account of parthian wars written by arrian has met a similar fate in cassius dio s roman history which survives mostly as byzantine abridgments and is main source for political history of trajan s rule besides this pliny younger s and dio of prusa s orations are best surviving contemporary sources both are adulatory typical of late roman era that describe an idealized monarch and an equally idealized view of trajan s rule and concern themselves more with ideology than with actual fact tenth volume of pliny s letters contains his correspondence with trajan which deals with various aspects of imperial roman

implied as much when he wrote that although an emperor could not be coerced into doing something if this were way in which trajan was raised to power then it was worth it if this was what actually

that these former danubian outposts had ceased to be frontier bases and were now in deep rear acted as an inducement to their urbanization and development not all of dacia was permanently occupied what was permanently included in province after post trajanic evacuation of some land across lower danube were lands extending from danube to inner arch of carpathian mountains including transylvania mountains and oltenia roman province eventually took form of an excrescence north of danube with ill defined limits stretching from danube northwards to carpathians and was intended perhaps as a basis for further expansion in eastern romans conceived to be much more flattened and closer to ocean than it actually was defense of province was entrusted to a single legion xiii gemina stationed at apulum which functioned as an advanced guard that could in case of need strike either west or east at sarmatians living at borders therefore indefensible character of province did not appear to be a

currency he decreased silver purity of denarius from 93 5 to 89 actual silver weight dropping from 3 to 2 this devaluation coupled with massive amount of gold and silver carried off after trajan s dacian wars allowed emperor to mint a larger quantity of denarii than his predecessors also trajan withdrew from circulation silver denarii minted before previous devaluation achieved by nero

formalisation of alimenta a welfare program that helped orphans and poor children throughout italy it provided general funds as well as food and subsidized education program was supported initially out of dacian war booty and then later by a combination of estate taxes and philanthropy in general terms scheme functioned by means of mortgages on italian farms through which registered landowners received a lump sum from imperial treasure being in return expected to pay yearly a given proportion of loan to maintenance of an alimentary fund john rich andrew wallace hadrill eds city and country

provisions of augustus moral legislation lex julia favoring procreation on moral openly acknowledged by pliny judith evans grubbs tim parkin eds oxford handbook of childhood and education in classical world oxford university press 2014 page 344 nevertheless this reproductive aim was anachronistic based as it was on a view of roman empire as centered on rome and italy with a purely italian manpower base both increasingly no longer case this outdated stance was confirmed by pliny when he wrote that recipients of alimenta were supposed to people barracks and tribes as future soldiers and roles ill fitted to contemporary reality of an empire stretching across entire mediterranean and ruled by an autocrat fact that scheme was restricted to italy suggests that it might have been conceived as a form of political privilege accorded to original heartland of empire jose maria blanch regimen de las en derecho romano madrid 2007 page 151 according to french historian paul petit alimenta should be seen as part of a set of measures aimed towards economic recovery of italy finley thinks that scheme s chief aim was artificial bolstering of political weight of italy as seen for example in praised by down by trajan that ordered all senators even when from provinces to have at least a third of their landed estates in italian territory as it was unseemly that they should treat rome and italy not as their native land but as a mere inn or lodging house interesting and unique as scheme was it remained small fact that it was subsidized by means of interest payments on loans made by large ones

scheme was to some extent a forced loan something that tied unwilling landowners to imperial treasure in order to make them supply some funds to civic expenses susan r holman hungry are dying beggars

similar and lesser schemes senator pliny had endowed his city of comum a perpetual right to an annual charge of thirty thousand sestertii on one of his estates in perpetuity even after his death pliny s heirs or any subsequent purchaser of estate being liable with rent thus obtained contributing to maintenance of pliny s semi private charitable foundation duncan jones 298 299 with such a scheme pliny probably hoped to engender enthusiasm among fellow landowners for such philanthropic ventures trajan did likewise but since willingness is a slippery commodity finley suspects that in order to ensure italian landowners acceptance of burden of borrowing from alimenta fund some moral pressure was exerted in short scheme was so limited in scope that it could not have fulfilled a coherent economic or demographic was usual ancient charity directed not towards poor but to community in this case italian cities as a whole fact that alimenta was begun during and after dacian wars and twice came on heels of a distribution of money to population of rome following dacian triumphs points towards a purely charitable motive suzanne dixon ed childhood class and kin in roman world london

context something that has led to a long running controversy about its precise happenings and ultimate aims many modern historians consider that trajan s decision to wage war against parthia might have had economic motives after trajan s annexation of arabia he built a new road via traiana nova that went from bostra to aila on red sea that meant that charax on persian gulf was sole remaining western terminus of indian trade route outside direct roman control christol nony rome 171 and such control was important in order to lower import prices and to limit supposed drain of precious metals created by deficit in roman trade with far east that charax traded with roman empire there can be no doubt as its actual connections with merchants from palmyra during period are well documented in a contemporary palmyrene epigraph which tells of various palmyrene citizens honoured for holding office in charax daniel t potts ed araby studies in arabian archaeology copenhagen museum tusculanum

story of a frontier london i b tauris 2012 page 211 other historians reject these motives as supposed parthian control over maritime far eastern trade route was at best conjectural and based on a selective reading of chinese by land through parthia seems to have been unhampered by parthian authorities and left solely to devices of private enterprise commercial activity in second century mesopotamia seems to have been a general phenomenon shared by many peoples within and without roman empire with no sign of a concerted imperial policy towards it as in case of alimenta scholars like moses finley and paul veyne have considered whole idea of a foreign trade policy behind trajan s war anachronistic according to them sole roman concern with far eastern luxuries collecting toll taxes and grain market in roman empire a social political and economic study cambridge university press 2005 page 5was moral and involved frowning upon softness of luxuries but no economic policy in absence

policy of imperial expansion first among them being all powerful licinius sura alternatively one can explain campaign by fact that for romans their empire was in principle unlimited and that trajan only took advantage of an opportunity to make idea and reality coincide dexter hoyos ed a companion to roman imperialism leiden brill 2012 page 262 finally there are other modern historians who think that trajan s original aims were purely military and quite modest to assure a more defensible eastern frontier for roman empire crossing northern mesopotamia along course of khabur river in order to

during dacian wars he had been relieved from front line duties at decisive stage of second dacian war being sent to govern newly created province of pannonia inferior he had pursued a senatorial career without particular distinction and had not been officially adopted by trajan although he received from him decorations and other marks of distinction that made him hope for succession he received no post after his 108 consulate and no further honours other than being made archon for athens in 111 112 he probably did not take part in parthian war literary sources relate that trajan had considered others such as jurist lucius neratius priscus as heir however hadrian who was eventually entrusted with governorship of syria at time of trajan s death was trajan s cousin and was married

born in hispania and seems to have been well connected with powerful group of spanish senators influential at trajan s court through his ties to plotina and prefect attianus fact that during hadrian s reign he did not pursue trajan s senatorial policy may account for crass hostility shown him by literary sources aware that parthian campaign was an enormous setback and that it revealed that roman
