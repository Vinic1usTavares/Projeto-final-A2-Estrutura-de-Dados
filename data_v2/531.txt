white deer hole creek is a tributary of west branch susquehanna river in clinton lycoming and union counties in u s state of pennsylvania a part of chesapeake bay drainage basin white deer hole creek watershed drains parts of ten townships creek flows east in a valley of ridge and valley appalachians through sandstone limestone and shale from ordovician silurian and devonian periods as of 2006 creek and its watershed are relatively undeveloped with 28 4 percent of watershed given to agriculture and 71 6 percent covered by forest including part of tiadaghton state forest western part of white deer hole creek has very high water quality and is only major creek section in lycoming county classified as class a wild trout waters defined by pennsylvania fish and boat commission as streams which support a population of naturally produced trout of sufficient size and abundance to support a long term and rewarding sport fishery rest of creek and its major tributary spring creek are kept stocked there are opportunities in watershed for canoeing hunting and camping and trails for hiking and horseback riding historically two paths of native indigenous peoples ran along parts of white deer hole creek settlers arrived by 1770 but fled in 1778 during american revolutionary war they returned and creek served as southern boundary of lycoming county when it was formed on april 13 1795 a logging railroad ran along creek from 1901 to 1904 for timber clearcutting and small scale lumbering continues during world war ii a tnt plant which became a federal prison in 1952 was built in watershed most development is in eastern end of valley with two unincorporated villages a hamlet and most of farms many amish name two etymologies have been suggested for white deer hole creek s unusual name according to donehoo it is a translation of lenape or delaware woap achtu meaning white deer digs a hole note isbn refers to a 1999 reprint edition url is for susquehanna river basin commission s web page of native american place names quoting and citing book it is on earliest map showing creek 1755 while a 1759 map has both and its translation white flint creek by 1770 when first settlers arrived a map has white deer hole in 1870 88 year old john farley gave a second explanation of name his family had settled on banks of white deer hole creek in 1787 and john s father john built a mill on creek by 1789 creek was named because a white deer is said to have been killed at an early day in a low hole or pond of water that once existed where my father built his mill hole was a large circular basin of low ground of some ten acres four ha in extent after my father s mill and dam were built water of dam overflowed and covered most of hollow basin of ground mill was just west of mouth at unincorporated village of allenwood then called uniontown now in gregg township in union county name white deer hole creek is unique in usgs geographic names information system and on its maps of united states although whole creek is now referred to by this name in 1870 name applied only to section from confluence with spring creek east to its mouth while main branch west of spring creek was called south creek meginness used this name in 1892 and it appeared on a 1915 state map of union county but not 1916 lycoming county map note shows white deer hole creek and south creek note shows only white deer hole creek in 2009 name south creek has disappeared but there is still a south creek road on right bank of creek in gregg township from near mouth of spring creek west to county line according to meginness long and wide white deer hole creek valley was just called white deer valley by many in 1892 and this is still common note refers to white deer valley confusion about names arises since white deer creek is next creek south of white deer hole creek they are on opposite sides of south white deer ridge for a document that refers mistakenly to both white deer creek valley and to white deer creek for white deer hole creek and its valley see lenape name for white deer creek was woap achtu hanne translated as white deer stream spring creek is only named tributary of white deer hole creek five unnamed tributaries flow through named features of south white deer ridge going upstream in order they are beartrap hollow first gap second gap third gap and fourth gap course left thumb white deer hole creek much muddier just downstream of spring creek near allenwood and site of mill that may have given it its name lycoming county is about northwest of philadelphia and east northeast of pittsburgh source of white deer hole creek is in crawford township just over clinton county line both it and western half of creek are within tiadaghton state forest creek flows east and soon crosses a natural gas pipeline and lycoming county line into limestone township it soon flows into washington township which has more of white deer hole creek than any other township it receives unnamed tributaries in fourth third second and first gaps of south white deer ridge on south or right bank creek leaves tiadaghton state forest after third gap forest itself continues along ridge to river and stops being class a wild trout waters between second and first gaps it receives unnamed tributary in beartrap hollow upstream of its mouth then passes south of unincorporated village of elimsport white deer hole creek then flows east into gregg township in union county receiving its major tributary spring creek on left bank upstream of its mouth spring creek rises north of elimsport in washington township and flows east southeast passing through pennsylvania state game lands no 252 and just south of federal correctional institute allenwood note shows white deer hole creek and almost all streams feeding it creek next flows just south of hamlet of spring garden then south of village of allenwood where it has its confluence with west branch susquehanna river direct distance between source and mouth is only u s route 15 and union county industrial railroad run north south here along river and cross creek just before its mouth however this track is not in service as of 2009 pennsylvania route 44 runs east west roughly parallel to creek between elimsport and allenwood township roads run along eastern two thirds of creek and smaller more primitive roads follow it to its source thumb spring creek only named tributary and a farm from pennsylvania route 44 bridge from mouth of white deer hole creek it is along west branch susquehanna river to its confluence with susquehanna river at northumberland elevation at source is while mouth is at an elevation of difference in elevation divided by length of creek of gives average drop in elevation per unit length of creek or relief ratio of 84 6 feet mile 16 0 m km meander ratio is 1 14 so creek s path is not entirely straight in its bed meandering increases near mouth for its entire length white deer hole creek runs along north side of south white deer ridge an east west ridge of appalachian mountains north white deer ridge and bald eagle mountain form northern edge of creek valley there are 24 unnamed tributaries on south side of creek all flowing down side of south white deer ridge while there are only 11 tributaries on north side including spring creek white deer creek next major creek to south

white deer ridge and bald eagle mountain are composed of sedimentary ordovician rock while valley rock is silurian with a small devonian region closer to river in north watershed has no deposits of coal nor natural gas or oil fields creek is in a narrow mountain valley with steep slopes in its upper reaches in its middle and lower reaches it has steep mountain slopes to south and a wide valley with rolling hills and gentle slopes to north channel pattern is transitional with a trellised drainage pattern from 1961 to 1995 united states geological survey usgs operated one stream gauge on white deer hole creek at gap road bridge upstream of elimsport for uppermost of watershed highest yearly peak discharge measured at this site was per second and highest yearly peak gauge height was both on june 22 1972 during hurricane agnes lowest yearly peak discharge in this time period was per second and lowest yearly peak gauge height was both on november 26 1986 usgs also measured discharge at allenwood very near creek s mouth as part of water quality measurements on seven occasions between 1970 and 1975 average discharge was per second and ranged from a high of per second to a low of per second there are no other known stream gauges on creek watershed thumb upright unnamed tributary in fourth gap of south white deer ridge is also rated class a wild trout waters white deer

just north of creek for federal prison 90 percent and village of allenwood 10 percent drainage basin has been designated by pennsylvania department of environmental protection as a high quality watershed since 2001 mean annual precipitation for white deer hole creek is 40 to 42 inches 1 016 to 1 067 mm pennsylvania receives most acid rain of any state in united states because creek is in a sandstone limestone and shale mountain region it has a relatively low capacity to neutralize added acid this makes it especially vulnerable to acid rain which poses a threat to long term health of

includes white deer hole creek and shows native paths along it note this website has more information on and complete file in sid native american paths first recorded inhabitants of susquehanna river valley were susquehannocks an iroquoian speaking people their name meant people of muddy river in algonquian but their name for themselves is unknown decimated by diseases and warfare they had largely died out moved away or been assimilated into other tribes by early 18th century lands of west branch susquehanna river valley were then chiefly occupied by munsee phratry of lenape or delaware and were under nominal control of five later six nations of iroquois two important paths of these native indigenous peoples ran along parts of white deer hole creek great island path was a major trail that ran north along susquehanna river from village of shamokin at modern sunbury fording river there and following west bank of west branch susquehanna river north until white deer hole valley path turned west at allenwood and followed white deer hole creek until about present location of elimsport there it headed northwest crossed north white deer ridge and passed west through nippenose valley then turned north and crossed bald eagle mountain via creek and ran along south bank of river to great island near present day city of lock haven stretch from mouth of creek to nippenose valley is approximately followed by route 44 from great island great shamokin path continued further west to modern boroughs of clearfield and last on allegheny river note isbn refers to 1998 impression right upright thumb white deer hole creek near first gap in south white deer ridge there are now hiking and horseback riding trails throughout its watershed culbertson s path followed white deer hole creek west from allenwood then followed spring creek north crossed bald eagle mountain and followed mosquito run to river at current borough of duboistown here it crossed river to french margaret s town western modern day williamsport before joining major path which led north up lycoming creek to north branch of susquehanna river modern new york and iroquois there these trails were only wide enough for one person but settlers in white deer hole valley broadened path to duboistown to take grain to culbertson s mill on mosquito run hence name culbertson s path was used as a part of underground railroad until american civil war began in 1861 escaped slaves would often wade in creeks to hide their scent from pursuing bloodhounds 60 minutes retrieved on 2009 03 03 in 2009 there is still a culbertson s trail for hiking over bald eagle mountain from pennsylvania route 554 to duboistown lycoming county boundaries when lycoming county was organized on april 13 1795 bill passed by pennsylvania legislature defined new county s boundaries thus borders of county have changed considerably since but white deer hole creek watershed still approximates county line in south until 1861 what is now gregg township in union county was a part of brady township in lycoming county thus until start of american civil war almost all of white deer hole creek and its watershed were part of lycoming county early inhabitants right thumb white deer hole creek very near its mouth and site of its earliest settlements looking west from u s route 15 in gregg township prior to construction site of wastewater treatment plant yielded archeological evidence of habitation by indigenous peoples from paleo indian archaic and woodland periods only native american inhabitant of valley whose name is known lived near mouth of white deer hole creek white deer hole creek was acquired by colonial government of pennsylvania on november 5 1768 as part of new purchase in treaty of fort stanwix first settlers came to valley in 1769 or 1770 and by 1778 there were 146 landowners on township tax rolls though many likely resided elsewhere in american revolutionary war settlements throughout susquehanna valley were attacked by loyalists and native americans allied with british after wyoming valley battle and massacre in summer of 1778 near what is now wilkes barre and smaller local attacks big runaway occurred throughout west branch susquehanna valley settlers fled from feared and actual attacks by british and their allies settlers abandoned their homes and fields drove their livestock south and towed their possessions on rafts on river to sunbury their abandoned property was burnt by attackers some settlers soon returned only to flee again in summer of 1779 in little runaway sullivan s expedition helped stabilize area and encouraged resettlement which continued after war however in 1787 there were only fourteen families in valley five on river banks five on white deer hole creek between spring creek and river two on spring creek and two on creek west of spring creek six families left area not long after 1787 first grist mill was built on creek in 1789 and four more were built in 1798 1815 1817 and 1842 lumber and logging railroad right thumb farms and woodlands in white deer hole creek valley with second growth tiadaghton state forest on south white deer ridge behind beginning with first settlers much of land along white deer hole creek was slowly cleared of timber small sawmills were constructed in 19th century and a much larger lumber operation was run by vincent lumber company from 1901 to 1904 company built a narrow gauge railroad from elimsport west into timber and a line east to allenwood and reading railroad there lumber railroad which ended near fourth gap ran parallel to creek it was incorporated on june 24 1901 around time of construction as allenwood and western railroad lumbering operation ceased in 1904 when forests were gone railroad was torn up and its one second hand shay locomotive was moved to vincent lumber company operation at denholm in juniata county from 1900 to 1935 much of what is now tiadaghton state forest was purchased by pennsylvania from lumber companies that had no further use for clear cut land in 1930s there were seven civilian conservation corps ccc camps to construct roads and trails in forest ccc camp s 125 pa elimsport was located west of allenwood along creek between third and fourth gaps note this mistakenly refers to camp as instead of elimsport small scale lumbering continues in watershed but forest is certified as well managed in an environmentally sensitive manner and lumber from it qualifies for a green label gertler reports lumber operations along white deer hole creek near elimsport in early 1980s a sawmill owned and operated by amish is on route 44 in elimsport it burned down on may 10 2006 causing 500 000 in damages but was expected to be back in operation in a month it has since reopened despite this small scale lumbering as of 2009 forests have grown back and are mixed oak with blueberry and mountain laurel bushes white deer hole creek and its tributaries also have stands of hemlock and thickets of rhododendron along them ordnance plant to federal prison and game lands during second world war federal government built 50 million susquehanna ordnance depot to make tnt on partially in white deer hole creek watershed in spring of 1942 residents were evicted by eminent domain from 163 farms and 47 other properties in gregg township in union county and brady clinton and washington townships in lycoming county village of alvira in gregg township disappeared alvira was founded in 1825 as and had 100 inhabitants by 1900 although inhabitants were told they could return after war almost all buildings seized were razed only some cemeteries and nearby stone church remain construction of plant involved some 10 000 people and it took 3 500 to 4 500 employees to run plant with its more than 200 buildings and 149 storage bunkers for tnt and high explosives as well as storage racks of bombs however need for tnt was lower than originally estimated and project was nearly abandoned by 1945 only workers left at depot were guards left thumb an overgrown bunker from former susquehanna ordnance depot in state game lands 252 from spring creek depot closed after war and land was used by united states army for testing in 1950 federal bureau of prisons was given of plant site and began housing prisoners from lewisburg federal penitentiary there in 1952 in 1957 allenwood prison camp was built which became federal correctional institute allenwood this was greatly expanded in early 1990s to become largest federal prison facility in united states north of white deer hole creek watershed some of land was sold to make white deer golf course in clinton township and in 1973 of prison land in brady township were leased to lycoming county for its landfill which serves five counties remaining were given to pennsylvania and became state game lands 252 many of 149 concrete bunkers remain but it is a diverse mix of mature forest impoundments and brushy thickets as well as a local hotspot for a variety of birds during migration watershed is a haven for wildlife common animals in game lands include painted and common snapping turtles muskrats frogs eastern cottontails red foxes and white tailed deer while birds include golden winged hooded and blue winged warblers red shouldered hawks wood ducks tundra swans pied billed grebes american bitterns herons and belted kingfishers note this guide is available both as a book page numbers given and website url given first barn owls to be banded in lycoming county were in a barn near elimsport in 2006 gray squirrels groundhogs raccoons crows red tailed hawks downy woodpeckers cardinals blue jays american robins nuthatches titmice and sparrows are also found in white deer hole creek watershed some locals in surrounding areas often report paranormal sightings and activities in bunker areas many stories and experiences are recurring while others are different there have been
