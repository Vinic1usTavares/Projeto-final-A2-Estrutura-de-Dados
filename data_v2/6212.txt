original mother and game came under repeated threats of cancellation until iwata joined team originally scheduled for release in january 1993 game was completed around may 1994 themed around an idiosyncratic portrayal of americana and western culture earthbound subverted popular role playing game traditions by featuring a real world setting while parodying numerous staples of genre itoi wanted game to reach non gamers with its intentionally goofy tone for example player uses items such as pencil eraser to remove pencil statues experiences in game hallucinations and battles piles of vomit taxi cabs and walking nooses for its american release game was marketed with a 2 million promotional campaign that sardonically proclaimed this game stinks additionally game s puns and humor were reworked by localizer marcus lindblom and title was changed from mother 2 to avoid confusion about what it was a sequel to initial reviewers had little praise for earthbound in united states where it sold half as many copies as in japan critics attributed this to a combination of its simple graphics satirical marketing campaign and a lack of market interest in genre however in ensuing years a dedicated fan community spawned which advocated for series s recognition starting with first installment in 1999 ness has appeared as a playable character in each entry of super smash bros series which helped popularize earthbound by 2000s game had become regarded as a sacred cow amongst gaming s cognoscenti with multiple reader polls and critics naming it one of greatest video games of all time it was followed by japan only sequel mother 3 for game boy advance in 2006 in 2013 earthbound was given a worldwide release on wii u virtual console following years of fan lobbying marking its debut in territories including europe gameplay left thumb poo jeff paula and ness left to right walking summers beachfront earthbound features many traditional role playing game elements player controls a party of characters who travel through game s two dimensional world composed of villages cities caves and dungeons along way player fights battles against enemies and party receives experience points for victories if enough experience points are acquired a character s level will increase this pseudo randomly increases character s attributes such as offense defense and maximum hit points hp and psychic points pp of each character rather than using an overworld map screen like most console rpgs of its era world is entirely seamless with no differentiation between towns and outside world another non traditional element is perspective used for world game uses oblique projection while most 2d rpgs use a top down view on a grid or an isometric perspective unlike its predecessor earthbound does not use random encounters when physical contact occurs between a character and an enemy screen dissolves into battle mode in combat characters and enemies possess a certain amount of hp blows to an enemy reduce amount of hp once an enemy s hp reach zero that enemy is defeated if a specific type of enemy is defeated there is a chance that character will receive an item after battle in battle player is allowed to choose specific actions for their characters these actions can include attacking healing spying reveals enemy weakness strengths mirroring emulate a specific enemy and running away characters can also use special psi attacks that require pp once each character is assigned a command characters and enemies perform their actions in a set order determined by character speed whenever a character receives damage hp box gradually rolls down similar to an odometer this allows players an opportunity to heal character or win battle before counter hits zero after which character is knocked unconscious if all characters are rendered unconscious game transitions to an endgame screen asking if player wants to continue an affirmative response brings ness conscious back to last telephone he saved from with half money on his person at time of his defeat and with other party members showing as still unconscious because battles are not random tactical advantages can be gained if player physically contacts an enemy from behind indicated by a translucent green swirl which fills screen player is given a first strike priority however this also applies to enemies who can also engage party from behind in this case swirl is red neutral priority is indicated by a blue swirl unlike other rpgs enemies are not killed but only made tame with exception of additionally as ness and his friends become stronger battles with weaker enemies are eventually won automatically forgoing battle sequence and weaker monsters will begin to flee from ness and his friends rather than chase them currency is indirectly received from ness father who can also save game s progress each time party wins a battle ness father deposits money in an account that can be withdrawn at atms in towns players can visit various stores where weapons armor and items can be bought weapons and armor can be equipped to increase character strength and defense respectively in addition items can be used for a number of purposes such as healing towns also contain several other useful facilities such as hospitals where players can be healed for a fee plot earthbound takes

defeat alien eradicating him from all of existence in a post credits scene ness whose life has returned to normal following giygas defeat receives a note from pokey who challenges ness to come and find him development first mother was released for nes in 1989 its sequel mother 2 or earthbound was developed over five years by ape and hal and published through nintendo game was written and designed by japanese author musician and advertiser shigesato itoi and produced by satoru iwata who became nintendo s president and ceo mother 2 was made with a development team different from that of original game and most of its members were unmarried and willing to work all night on project mother 2 development took much longer than planned and came under repeated threat of cancellation itoi has said that project s dire straits were resolved when iwata joined team ape s programming team had more members than hal on project hal team led by lead programmer iwata worked on game programming while ape team led by lead programmer kouji malta worked on specific data such as text and maps they spent biweekly retreats together at hal office in view of mount fuji game continues mother story in that giygas reappears as antagonist and thus did not die at end of mother and player has option of choosing whether to continue protagonist s story by choosing whether to name their player character same as original he considered interstellar and interplanetary space travel instead of confines of a single planet in new game after four months itoi scrapped idea as cliche itoi sought to make a game that would appeal to populations that were playing games less such as girls mother series titles are built on what itoi considered reckless wildness where he would offer ideas that encouraged his staff to contribute new ways of portraying scenes in video game medium he saw titles foremost as games and not big scenario scripts itoi has said that he wanted player feel emotions such as distraught when playing game game s writing was intentionally quirky and goofy in character and written in japanese kana script so as to give dialogue a conversational feel itoi thought of default player character names when he did not like his team s suggestions many of characters were based on real life personalities for instance desert miners were modeled on specific executives from a japanese construction company final battle dialogue with giygas was based on itoi s recollections of a traumatic scene from shintoho film military policeman and dismembered beauty that he had accidentally seen in his childhood itoi referred to battle background animations as a video drug same specialist made nearly 200 of these animations working solely on backgrounds for two years idea for rolling hp meter began with pachinko balls that would drop balls off screen upon being hit this did not work as well for characters with high health instead around 1990 they chose an odometer style hit points counter bicycle was one of harder elements to implement it used controls similar to a tank before it was tweaked iwata felt that ape programmers were particularly willing to tackle such challenges programmers also found difficulty implementing in game delivery service where delivery person had to navigate around obstacles to reach player they thought it would be funny to have delivery person run through obstacles in a hurry on his way off screen unusual maps laid out with diagonal streets in oblique projection required extra attention from artists itoi specifically chose against having an overworld map and didn t want to artificially distinguish between towns and other areas instead he worked to make each town unique his own favorite town was threed though it was summers before then mother 2 was designed to fit within an eight megabit limit but was expanded in size and scope twice first to 12 megabits and second to 24 megabits game was originally scheduled for release in january 1993 on a 12 megabit cartridge it was finished around may 1994 and japanese release was set for august 27 1994 with extra few months team played game and added small personal touches itoi told weekly famitsu that shigeru miyamoto liked game and that it was first role playing game that miyamoto had completed mother 2 would release in north america about a year later music mother composers keiichi suzuki and hirokazu tanaka returned to make earthbound soundtrack along with newcomers hiroshi kanazu and toshiyuki ueno in comparison with mother itoi said that earthbound had more jazzy pieces suzuki told weekly famitsu that super nes afforded team more creative freedom with its eight channel based as opposed to old nintendo entertainment system s restriction of five channels of basic waveforms this entailed higher sound quality and music that sounds closer to his regular compositions itoi believes that earthbound may be first video game to use vibrato or string bending in its music soundtrack was released by sony records on november 2 1994 in suzuki s songwriting process he would first compose on a synthesizer before working with programmers to get it in game his personal pieces play when player is walking about map out of battle suzuki s favorite piece is music that plays while player is on a bicycle which he composed in advance of this job but found appropriate to include he wrote over 100 pieces but much of it was not included in game team wrote enough music as to fill eight megabits of 24 megabit cartridge about two compact discs 200px thumb left beach boys were one of many western artists suzuki and tanaka drew inspiration from while developing game s soundtrack according to tanaka beach boys were repeatedly referenced between him and suzuki and that he would often listen to co founder brian wilson s 1988 eponymous album while on way to suzuki s home suzuki has stated that percussive arranging in game s soundtrack was based on beach boys albums smile unreleased and smiley smile 1967 which both contained american themes shared with van dyke parks song cycle 1968 to suzuki smile evoked bright and dark aspects of america while song cycle displayed a hazy sound mixed with american humor and hints of ray bradbury a style which he considered essential to soundtrack of mother tanaka recalls randy newman being first quintessentially american composer he could think of and that his albums little criminals 1977 and land of dreams 1988 were influential while suzuki corroborated with his own affinity for harry nilsson s nilsson sings newman 1970 he also cited john lennon as a strong influence due to common theme of love in his music which was also a prominent theme in game and that his album john lennon plastic ono band 1970 helped him to avoid excessive instrumentation over snes s technical constraints soundtrack contains direct musical quotations of some classical and folk music composers also derived a few samples culled from other sources including commercial pop and rock music texture of work was partially influenced by some salsa reggae and dub music speaking about frank zappa s make a jazz noise here 1991 tanaka felt that zappa would have been best at creating a live performance of mother music but could not detail zappa s specific influence on earthbound additionally he felt that mix tape wired magazine presents music futurists 1999 presented a particular selection of artists which embody ethos of earthbound running gamut from space age composer esquivel to avant garde trumpeter ben neill along with innovators sun ra steve reich todd rundgren brian eno and can tanaka also mentioned that he listened to various artists compilation stay awake various interpretations of music from vintage disney films 1988 heavily during earthbound s development miscellaneous influences on suzuki and tanaka for earthbound include music of michael nyman miklos rozsa s film score for lost weekend 1945 and albums by various other pop rock musicians english localization right thumb in original mother 2 ness walks naked through his dream town magicant in u s release this was changed to his pajamas without his cap as was traditional for nintendo mother 2 was developed in japan and localized in united states a process in which game is translated into english for western audiences as only game in mother series to be released in north america at time its title mother 2 was changed to earthbound to avoid confusion about what it was a sequel to nintendo of america s dan owsen began english localization project and converted about ten percent of script before moving to another project marcus lindblom filled owsen s position around january 1995 lindblom credits owsen with coining some of game s most iconic phrases such as say fuzzy pickles lindblom himself was given liberties to make script as weird as he wanted as nintendo wanted script to be more american than a direct translation would be he worked alone and with great latitude due to no divisional hierarchies lindblom was aided by japanese writer masayuki miura who translated japanese script and contextualized its tone which lindblom positively described as a glass half full lindblom was challenged by task of culturally translating an outsider s view of u s for an american audience he also sought to stay true to original text though he never met or spoke with itoi in addition to reworking original puns and humor lindblom added private jokes and american cultural allusions to bugs bunny comedian benny hill and this is spinal tap apart from dialogue he wrote rest of game s text including combat prompts and item names as one of several easter eggs he named a non player character for his daughter nico who was born during development while lindblom took day off for her birth he proceeded to work 14 hour days without weekends for next month game also includes protection against piracy that when triggered increases enemy counts to make game less enjoyable additionally right before players reach end of pirated copy s story their game resets and deletes its saved file in an act that ign declared arguably most devious and notorious example of creative copy protection under directives from nintendo lindblom worked with japanese artists and programmers to remove references to intellectual property religion and alcohol from american release such as a truck s coca cola logo red crosses on hospitals and crosses on tombstones alcohol became coffee ness was no longer nude in magicant area as seen in image and happy blue cultists were made to look less like ku klux klansmen team was not concerned with music licensing issues and considered itself somewhat protected under guise of parody lindblom recalled that music did not need many changes graphical fixes were not finished until march 1995 and game was not fully playable until may reception us sales and was released on june 5 1995 in north america though nintendo spent about 2 million on marketing american release was ultimately viewed as unsuccessful within nintendo game s atypical marketing campaign was derived from game s unusual humor as part of nintendo s larger play it loud campaign earthbound this game stinks campaign included foul smelling scratch and sniff advertisements at time digital trends described campaign as bizarre and based around fart jokes gamepro reported that they received more reader complaints about game s scratch and sniff ad than about any other 1995 advertisement campaign was also expensive it emphasized magazine advertisements and had extra cost of strategy guide included with each game between poor sales and phasing out of super nes game did not receive a european release aaron linde of shacknews believed that price of packaged game ultimately curtailed sales contemporary earthbound originally received little critical praise from american press and sold poorly in us around 140 000 copies as compared to twice as many in japan kotaku described earthbound 1995 american release as a dud and blamed low sales on a bizarre marketing campaign and graphics cartoonish beyond average taste of players game was released when rpgs were not popular in us and visual taste in rpgs was closer to chrono trigger and final fantasy vi while game on itoi s celebrity in japan it became a curio for european audiences of original reviewers nicholas dean des barres of diehard gamefan wrote that earthbound was not as impressive as final fantasy iii although just as fun he praised game s humor and wrote that game completely defied his first impressions des barres wrote that past graphics which were purposefully 8 bit for nostalgia game is not an entry level or a child s rpg but highly intelligent and captivating brazilian super gamepower explained that those expecting a dungeons and dragons style rpg will be disappointed by childish visuals which were unlike other 16 bit games they wrote that american humor was too mature and that gameplay was too immature as if for beginners gamepro gave game a mixed review commenting that t he lack of a convincing story line and dull nes clone graphics will make serious rpg fans a little cautious about approaching earthbound they said saving graces are fairly good music and hilarious adult humor but added that humor is too mature for little kids and gameplay is too immature for older gamers lindblom and his team were devastated by release s poor critical response and sales he recalled that game was hurt by reception of its graphics as simplistic at a time when critics placed high importance on graphics quality lindblom felt that game s changes to rpg formula e g rolling hp meter and fleeing enemies were ignored in following years though he thought game had aged well at time of its virtual console rerelease in 2013 retrospective reviewing game years after its release at least four writers described game as original or unique at least two praised its script s range of emotions and at least four praised its humor ign s scott thompson said game teetered between solemn and audacious in its dialogue and gameplay and noted its deviance from rpg tropes in aspects such as choice of attacks in battle he found game both bizarre and memorable official nintendo magazine simon parkin thought game s script was its best asset as one of medium s strongest and idiosyncratic storylines that fluctuated between humorous and poignant gamezone david sanchez thought its script was clever and sharp as it displayed a wide range of emotions that made him want to talk to all non player characters gamestm wrote that game designers spoke with their players through non playable characters and noted how itoi s interests shaped script its allusions to popular culture and its strangely existential narrative framework at least three critics praised its real world setting which was seen as an uncommon choice thompson noted its 1990s homage as a love letter to 20th century americana with a payphone as a save point atms to transfer money yo yos as weapons skateboarders and hippies as enemies and references to classic rock bands official nintendo magazine parkin noted theme s distance from knights and dragons common to japanese role playing game genre thompson noted game s steep difficulty he wrote that beginning was hardest and that aspects such as limited inventory experience grinds and monetary penalties upon death were unfriendly for players new to japanese rpgs he also cited quick respawn time for foes and ultimate need not to avoid battles given difficulty of bosses at least two reviewers described game s ambiance as cheery and full of charm david sanchez of gamezone thought game s self awareness added to its charm where player learned through game s poking lighthearted fun he added that music was an absolute delight and complimented its range from space sounds to themes to bizarre battle tracks that varied with enemy type gamestm wrote that game s reputation comes from consistent visual language in its charles m schulz esque character and world design kotaku jason schreier found ending unsatisfying and despite finding ending credits with its character curtain call and photo album of fuzzy pickles moments all wonderful thompson wrote that earthbound balances dark lovecraftian apocalypse and silly lightheartedness and was just as interesting nearly a decade after its original release while he lamented a lack of visual feedback in battle animations he felt game had innovations that still feel smart and unique rolling hp meter and lack of random battles thompson also noted that technical issues like animation slowdown with multiple enemies on screen went unfixed in rerelease parkin found game to provide a more potent experience than developers with more resources and thought its battle sequences were sleek nintendo world reports justin baker was surprised by excellent battle system and controls which he found to be underreported in other reviews despite their streamlined grind reducing convenience he wrote that some of menu interactions were clunky gamestm felt that game was far from revolutionary compared to final fantasy vi and chrono trigger and that its battle scenes were unexciting magazine compared game s chosen one story to a throwaway link s awakening goonies hybrid narrative thompson praised nintendo for digitizing player s guide though noted that it was technically easier to view it on another tablet rather than switching wii u s view mode at least five reviewers concluded that game had aged well legacy acclaim and was listed in 1001 video games you must play before you die where christian donlan wrote that game is name checked by video gaming cognoscenti more often than it s actually been played he called game utterly brilliant and praised its overworld and battle system similarly eurogamer simon parkin described it as a sacred cow amongst gaming s cognoscenti game journalists have ranked earthbound among best super nintendo games and most essential japanese role playing games and at least three reader polls ranked game among best of all time for a piece about top worlds in video games ign rated earthbound setting among best indelible between its unconventional environments 1960s music and portrayal of americanism kotaku described game as one of weirdest most surreal role playing games in rpg history examples include using items such as pencil eraser to remove pencil statues experiencing in game hallucinations meeting a man who turned himself into a dungeon and battling piles of vomit taxi cabs and walking nooses david sanchez of gamezone wrote that earthbound went places no other game would in 1990s or even in present day including trolling player before trolling was cool localization reviewer clyde mandelin described japanese to english conversion as top notch for its time 1up com said it was unusually excellent for time ign wrote that nintendo was dead wrong for believing that americans would not be interested in such a chaotic and satirical world jeremy parish of usgamer called earthbound all time champion of self aware games that warp perceptions and boundaries and break fourth wall citing its frequent internal commentary about medium and final scenes where player is directly addressed by game gamestm said game felt fresh because of its reliance on personal experiences made it exactly sort of title that would thrive today as an indie hit he called this accomplishment remarkable and credited nintendo s commitment to voices of creators ign s nadia oxford said that nearly two decades since release its final boss fight against giygas continues to be one of most epic video game standoffs of all time and noted its emotional impact kotaku wrote that game was content to make player feel lonely and overall was special not for any individual aspect but for its method of using video game medium to explore ideas impossible to explore in other media thumb earthbound child protagonists and ordinary american setting influenced south park co creator trey parker few role playing games set in real world non fantasy settings pc gamer has written are often and accurately described as having been influenced by earthbound it was cited as an official influence on video games including costume quest south park stick

80 times r 1101 fandom a cult following for earthbound developed after game s release colin campbell of polygon wrote that few gaming communities are as passionate and active as earthbound and 1up com bob mackey wrote that no game was as poised to have a cult following ign s lucas m thomas wrote in 2006 that earthbound persistent ambitious and religiously dedicated collective of hardcore fans would be among first groups to influence nintendo s decision making through their purchasing power on virtual console digital trends s anthony john agnello wrote that no video game fans have suffered as much as earthbound fans and cited nintendo s reluctance to release mother series games in north america ign described series as neglected by nintendo in north america for similar reasons nintendo president satoru iwata later credited community response on their online miiverse social platform as leading to earthbound eventual rerelease on their virtual console platform physical copies of earthbound were hard to find before rerelease and in 2013 were worth twice its initial retail price wired described amount of earthbound fan art videos and tributes on fan sites like earthbound central or starmen net as mountainous reid young of starmen net and fangamer credits earthbound popularity to its labor of love nature with a double coat of thoughtfulness and care across all aspects of game by a development team that appeared to love their work young started fansite that would become starmen net in 1997 while in middle school it became definitive fan community for earthbound on web and had almost inexplicable growth shacknews described site s collection of fan made media as absolutely massive it also provided a place to aggregate information on mother series and to coordinate fan actions earthbound fan community at starmen net coalesced with intent to have nintendo of america acknowledge mother series community drafted several thousand person petitions for specific english language mother series releases but in time their request shifted to no demand at all wanting only their interest to be recognized by nintendo a 2007 campaign for a mother 3 english localization led to creation of a full color 270 page art book earthbound anthology sent to nintendo and press outlets as demonstration of consumer interest shacknews called it more of a proposal than a collection of fan art and greatest gaming love letter ever created upon little response from nintendo they decided to localize game themselves starmen net co founder and professional game translator clyde tomato mandelin led project from its november 2006 announcement to october 2008 finish they then printed a professional quality strategy guide through fangamer a video game merchandising site

fan produced sequel to mother series that went into production when itoi definitively declared that he was done with series after following fan community from afar lindblom came out to fans in mid 2012 and press became interested in his work he had planned a book about game s development release and fandom before a reply from nintendo discouraged him from pursuing idea he plans to continue to communicate directly with community about game s history ness earthbound ness became widely known for his appearance as a playable character throughout super smash bros fighting game series debuting as a fighter in first installment in 1999 ness s inclusion in original release was among its biggest surprises and renewed mother series fans faith in new content from nintendo ness was one of game s most powerful characters according to ign if players could perfect his odd controls and psychic powers in europe which did not see an earthbound release ness was better known for his role in fighting game than for his original role in role playing game ness returned in first sequel melee alongside an earthbound themed item and battle arena lucas protagonist of mother 3 joined ness in brawl several years after brawl release official nintendo magazine wrote that ness was an unpopular smash character who should be removed from future installments however ness returned in super smash bros for nintendo 3ds and wii u and super smash bros ultimate and lucas was later added as downloadable content nintendo also produced ness and lucas amiibo figurines sequels and rerelease in 1996 nintendo announced a sequel to earthbound for nintendo 64 mother 3 earthbound 64 in north america it was scheduled for release on 64dd a nintendo 64 expansion peripheral that used a magneto optical drive but struggled to find a firm release date as its protracted development entered development hell it was later canceled altogether in 2000 when 64dd flopped in april 2003 a japanese television advertisement revealed that both mother 3 and a combined mother 1 2 cartridge were in development for handheld game boy advance mother 3 abandoned nintendo 64 version s 3d but kept its plot it became a bestseller upon its japanese release in 2006 yet did not receive a north american release on basis that it would not sell ign described series as neglected by nintendo in north america as mother 1 mother 1 2 and mother 3 were not released outside japan when nintendo launched its digital distribution platform virtual console for wii in 2006 ign expected earthbound to be among nintendo s highest priorities for rerelease given religious dedication of its fanbase though game was ranked most desired virtual console release by nintendo power readers rated for release by esrb and able to be published with little effort wii version did not materialize many fans believed that music licensing or legal concerns impeded rerelease english localizer marcus lindblom doubted that game s music samples were an issue since they were not a concern during development and instead hypothesized that nintendo did not realize magnitude of game s popular support and did not consider it a priority project by 2008 it was not apparent that nintendo of america was considering a rerelease at end of 2012 itoi announced that rerelease was moving forward which a january 2013 nintendo direct presentation confirmed as part of anniversary celebrations for nintendo entertainment system and mother 2 in march 2013 nintendo rereleased earthbound for japan on wii s successor wii u virtual
