transported by rail all way to market instead of by water transport lane led inquiry and held hearings in chicago and concluded that car shortage was due to demand for cars further west and that it would actually cause area railways to lose money since they could not transport grain to port in january 1907 he submitted his report to roosevelt which set out causes of shortage he found that fifty million bushels of grain still remained on north dakota farms or in state s grain elevators because of lack of space in eastbound railroad cars he recommended that railroad companies pool their cars with neighboring lines commission spent much of 1907 investigating railroads and other companies owned by edward h harriman holding hearings across country in october lane determined that southern

candidates such as former san francisco mayor james d phelan and wilson friend walter page at icc meeting on january 8 1913 commissioners elected lane as new chairman effective january 13 wilson

on february 16 house met again with him on wilson s instructions to get a better sense of icc chairman s views on conservation according to house s diaries lane while reluctant to leave his position as chairman was willing to serve in interior position if offered he considered position most difficult cabinet post but was also willing to serve in any other capacity as wilson adjusted his lineup of potential cabinet appointees he and house considered lane for positions of attorney general and secretary of war finally wilson wrote to him on february 24 1913 offering him interior position and although two had never met he accepted post according to new york times chairman lane was selected since he was one of few california democrats who had fought railroads and who was not beholden to hearst at time it was customary not to make an official announcement of cabinet appointments until new president formally submitted names to senate on afternoon of inauguration day march 4 however new york times obtained list of wilson s appointees a day early senate met in special session on march 5 and approved all of president wilson s cabinet appointees department activities thumb president

congress to implement his agenda one such ally was new junior senator from montana thomas j walsh whose support was key to passage of hetch hetchy legislation while walsh dissented from lane s policies on national parks for example by supporting local control of development in his home state s glacier national park he sided with him on subjects ranging from development of alaska to reclamation projects interior secretary advocated leasing rather than selling public lands with possible mineral deposits and senator walsh pursued legislation in this area while two were successful
