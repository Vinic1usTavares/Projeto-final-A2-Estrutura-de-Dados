taxing cary elwes as dr lawrence gordon leigh whannell as adam danny glover as david tapp monica potter as alison gordon michael emerson as zep ken leung as detective steven sing tobin bell as john kramer dina meyer as detective allison kerry mike butters as paul paul as mark shawnee smith as amanda young makenzie vega as diana gordon ned bellamy as jeff ridenhour alexandra chun as carla oren koules as donnie greco benito martinez as brett production development and writing thumb left wan left and whannell right after finishing film school australian director james wan and australian writer leigh whannell wanted to write and fund a film inspiration that they needed came after watching low budget independent film blair witch project another film that inspired them to finance film themselves was darren aronofsky s pi two thought cheapest script to shoot would involve two actors in one room whannell said so i actually think restrictions we had on our bank accounts at time fact that we wanted to keep film contained helped us come up with ideas in film one idea was to have entire film set with two actors stuck in an elevator and being shot in point of view of security cameras wan pitched idea to whannell of two men chained to opposite sides of a bathroom with a dead body in middle of floor and they are trying to figure out why and how they are there by end of film they realize person lying on floor is not dead and he is reason they are locked in room whannell initially did not give wan reaction he was looking for he said i ll never forget that day i remember hanging up phone and started just going over it in my head and without any sort of long period of pondering i opened my diary that i had at time and wrote word saw before instantaneously writing word saw in a blood red dripping font two had not come up with a title it was one of those moments that made me aware that some things just really are meant to be some things are just waiting there to be discovered whannell said character of jigsaw did not come until months later when whannell was working at a job he was unhappy with and began having migraines convinced it was a brain tumor he went to a neurologist to have an mri and while sitting nervously in waiting room he thought what if you were given news that you had a tumor and you were going to die soon how would you react to that he imagined character jigsaw having been given one or two years to live and combined that with idea of jigsaw putting others in a literal version of situation but only giving them a few minutes to choose their fate wan did not intend to make a torture porn film as script only had one short segment of torture he said film played out like a mystery thriller it was not until sequels that plot focused more on torture scenes funding whannell and wan initially had 30 000 to spend on film but as script developed it was clear that more funds would be needed script was optioned by a producer in sydney for a year but deal eventually fell through after other failed attempts to get script produced in australia from 2001 to 2002 literary agent ken read script and suggested they travel to los angeles where their chances of finding an interested studio were greater wan and whannell initially refused due to lack of traveling funds but pair s agent stacey convinced them to go in order to help studios take interest in script whannell provided a 5 000 us 5 000 to make a seven minute short film based on script s jaw trap scene which they thought would prove most effective whannell played david man wearing reverse bear trap working at australian broadcasting corporation whannell and wan knew cameramen who were willing to provide technical assistance for short wan shot short with a 16mm camera in over two days and transferred footage to dvds to ship along with script whannell wanted to play lead character in feature film short helped show that wan and whannell were a director actor team rather than just wanting to sell script wan said leigh and i just loved project so much and we wanted a career in filmmaking so we stuck to our guns and said look guys if you want this project we re coming on board leigh has to act in it and i have to direct it in early 2003 while in los angeles and before they met with producer gregg hoffman hoffman s friend pulled him into his office and showed him short hoffman said about two or three minutes into it my jaw hit floor he quickly showed short and script to his partners mark burg and oren koules of evolution entertainment they later formed twisted pictures as a horror genre production label producers read screenplay that night and two days later offered wan and whannell creative control and 25 of net profits even though wan and whannell received better offers from studios like dreamworks and gold circle films they were not willing to chance wan s directing and whannell acting in lead role in order to finance film hoffman burg and koules put up a second mortgage on their highland avenue headquarters saw was given a production budget of between 1 million and 1 2 million casting cary elwes was sent short film on dvd and immediately became interested in film he read script in one sitting and was drawn in by uniqueness and originality of story to prepare for his role as an oncologist he met with a doctor at ucla s department of neurosurgery shawnee smith who is not a horror fan initially refused role describing script as horrific however after watching short she agreed to role which was part that whannell portrayed in short on taking role of jigsaw tobin bell said i did saw because i thought it was a fascinating location for a film to be made these guys locked in a room to me was fresh i did not anticipate ending when i read script so i was quite caught by surprise and it was clear to me that if filmmakers shot scene well audience would be caught by surprise as well film was worth doing for that moment alone filming and post production with a shooting budget of 700 000 saw began principal photography on at lacy street production facility in los angeles for 18 days bathroom was only set that had to be built danny glover completed his scenes in two days due to tight shooting schedule wan could not afford to shoot more than a couple of takes per actor it was a really tough struggle for me every day it was me fighting to get shots i did not get i had high aspirations but there s only so much you can do i wanted to make it in a very hitchcockian style of filmmaking but that style of filmmaking takes time to set up and so on wan said about very short shooting schedule he said style instead ended up being more gritty and rough around edges due to lack of time and money that we had to shoot movie with and it ultimately became aesthetic of film in post production wan found he did not have enough shots or takes to work with as he was basically shooting rehearsals having a lot of missing gaps in final product he and editor kevin greutert created shots to mend together during editing such as making a shot look like a surveillance camera feed and using still photographs we did a lot of things to fill in gaps throughout film whatever we cut to newspaper clippings and stuff like that or we cut to surveillance cameras or we cut to still photography within film which now people say wow that s such a cool experimental style of filmmaking we really did that out of necessity to fill in gaps we did not get during filming he explained music soundtrack was mainly composed by charlie clouser which took six weeks to complete other songs were performed by front line assembly fear factory enemy pitbull daycare and psycho pumps megadeth s song die dead enough was originally set to be featured in film but was not used for undisclosed reasons soundtrack was released on by koch records johnny loftus of allmusic gave it three out of five stars he said that clouser really nails it with his creaky clammy score and that he understands that saw horror only works with a heady amount of camp and he draws from industrial music in same way he particularly liked cigarette

345 critical response critical reception to saw was mixed on review aggregator rotten tomatoes film has a rating of 49 based on 184 reviews with an average rating of 5 53 10 site s consensus reads saw audiences with a deceptively clever plot and a myriad of memorable nasty set pieces but its lofty ambitions are undercut by a nihilistic streak that feels more mean than profound metacritic gave film a score of 46 out of 100 based on 32 critics indicating mixed or average reviews dennis harvey of variety gave film a negative review after its sundance premiere he called it a crude concoction sewn together from severed parts of prior horror serial killer pics he called screenplay convoluted criticizing use of flashbacks within flashbacks and red herrings he described film as being too hyperbolic to be genuinely disturbing carla meyer of san francisco chronicle gave film a positive review saying film combined b movie acting with a twisted mind set and visual tricks designed to camouflage cheap effects and that it was terrifying at some moments and creepy at many others she called killing scenes amazingly evocative for such a low budget movie empire kim newman gave film four out of five stars he said saw is styled like early david fincher films and boasts an intricate structure complex flashbacks within flashbacks explain how characters have come to this crisis and a satisfying mystery to go with its ghastly claustrophobia he ended his review saying as good an all out non camp horror movie as we ve had lately owen gleiberman of entertainment weekly gave film a b minus calling it derivative and messy and too nonsensical for its own good he described jigsaw s intent as to show you serial killer lurking inside yourself gleiberman criticized elwes performance by saying elwes ought to be featured in a seminar on perils of overacting daniel m kimmel of telegram gazette called it one of most loathsome films this critic has seen in more than 20 years on job new york times stephen holden gave a mixed review saying film does a better than average job of conveying panic and helplessness of men terrorized by a sadist in a degrading environment but it is still not especially scary what sets its demon apart from run of mill movie serial killers is his impulse to humiliate and torture his victims and justify it with some twisted morality he said film is seriously undermined by half baked formulaic detective story in which horror is framed carina chocano of los angeles times also gave film a mixed review saying saw is so full of twists it ends up getting snarled for all of his flashy engineering and inventive torture scenarios jigsaw killer comes across as an amateur hannibal lecter would have him for lunch she said film carelessly underscores its own shaky narrative at every turn with its mid budget she also noted that elwes and whannell had trouble keeping an american accent another mixed review came from roger ebert who gave film 2 out of 4 stars and lamented gimmicks and plot contrivances but nonetheless described saw as well made and acted and does what it does about as well as it could be expected to roger ebert 2004 saw accessed 10 april 2013 comparisons to seven 1995 when asked if 1995 thriller film seven was an inspiration to saw whannell said for me as writer definitely i mean seven is just a very well constructed film and if you re writing a thriller it can t hurt to study it in terms of story though james and i never really felt seven was that close to our film i guess if you stand back you have two detectives chasing a psychopath who uses vile methods to teach people lessons and those points echo seven what we always liked about saw though was fact that story is told from point of view of two of psychopath s victims instead of police chasing after him as you so often see entertainment weekly owen gleiberman compared plot to seven saying in a blatant imitation of seven saw features a lunatic sadist whose ghoulish crimes are meant in each case to mirror sins of his victims twist here is that psycho doesn t do killing richard j of champaign urbana s news gazette said saw wants to be taken as another seven though it features perverse gross out scenes and a villain with a superficially pedantic motive behind his crimes his victims if they survive have learned to appreciate life more it lacks finesse and polish of david fincher film accolades bloody disgusting ranked film tenth in its list of top 20 horror films of decade with article calling saw perhaps most influential horror film of decade which kick started a franchise in light of its measly 1 2 million price tag film s quality relative to bigger budget horror films is striking it also takes itself seriously which came as a breath of fresh air following trend of wimpy tongue in cheek horror that had dominated multiplexes post scream more than anything this twisted morality tale is a film made by horror fans for horror fans it s gory it s depraved and best of all it introduced a new horror icon in jigsaw daily telegraph listed film number 14 on their top 100 list that defined 2000s award category recipient s result
