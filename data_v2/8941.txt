professional journalists washington d c pro chapter criticism and controversy thumb upright washington blade dispenser at huntington metro station publication of paper has not been without controversy over years news coverage from early years to mid 1980s was perceived by some as being white washed for its lack of coverage of gay african american population located in washington d c a city where more than 70 percent of its residents were african american this led to creation of short lived publication blacklight city s first african american gay monthly periodical in august 1979 which attempted to compete with blade coverage of city council special election in april 1991 garnered intensive criticism of biased coverage and led to calls for reforming paper s editorial board in 1993 blade and its publishing company threatened to sue fairfax county library over a potential ban on distribution of blade at its branches also 2001 sale of washington blade to window media llc led to intense criticism from former employees editors and media pundits of consolidation of so many gay newspapers editorial boards into same company leading to fears of of content and editorial control a former staff writer has also accused paper of playing politics through mandated use of capitalized version of word gay in order to make a political statement newspaper has been accused from time to time of forcing public figures out of closet this policy of outing individuals surfaced in 1996 during debate over defense of marriage act when blade and advocate were going to out congressmen jim kolbe and mark foley neither publication did out either politician and both publications later denied ever intending to out congressmen in recent years these accusations have resurfaced as kevin naff current editor of blade has accused washington post of straight washing stories about lgbt individuals naff wrote that when someone is described as flamboyant eccentric or a lifelong bachelor we know what s being implied readers of washington post had better hone their gaydar skills because in story after story behemoth either ignores questions of sexual orientation or employs endless winks and nods to convey what would be better spelled out when asked why identifying and outing of individuals by publications like blade staff writer greg wrote why do we insist on mentioning someone s sexual orientation at all because we re a queer paper as reported in washington post former editor chris crain summarized blades editorial reasoning for outings by stating that it is 2004 not 1954 and sexual orientation in and of itself is no longer a private fact beyond pale of inquiry blade he wrote would investigate and report about whether influential hill aides are gay if facts about their sexual orientation raise highly newsworthy questions of hypocrisy in stands taken by anti gay members of congress for whom they work a former staff writer of washington blade has noted objections to this perceived campaign to label individuals by their sexual orientations and has used a blog to register these objections in july 2005 jeff gannon began writing editorials for paper his pieces included criticism of gay blogger john who had helped uncover gannon s pornographic ads editor chris crain attracted his own criticism from many in gay community for this decision due to gannon s history of anti gay reporting as well as gannon s refusal to disclose his sexual orientation he has said my personal life is a private matter despite fact that i have become a public person crain defended his decision in a september 2005 editorial and claimed steady stream of feedback vitriol had declined a little with each new gannon article references external links dc agenda website for new publication
