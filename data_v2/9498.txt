liner notes svoboda wrote when concerto is performed according to svoboda instruments on stage are separated into three contrasting sections solo marimba quintet and remainder of orchestra quintet is placed near conductor and solo marimba which is prominent voice of this uncommon ensemble composition contains several instances where quintet plays for extended periods referred to as islands by svoboda which create concerto grosso like interplay with orchestra symphony no 1 was completed in 1956 and premiered in prague on september 7 1957 inspired by svoboda s exposure to nature within a pastoral setting composition was commissioned anonymously 25 years later 1982 providing svoboda an opportunity to make revisions work was influenced by ludwig van beethoven antonin dvorak and pyotr

chorale is in key of c sharp minor and features a theme performed by flute second movement a scherzo features a quick motoric triple rhythm and meter third is a pastorale that highlights woodwind

and broadcasts thumb right oregon symphony was conducted by james depreist pictured in 2005 with president george w bush after receiving national medal of arts album received a mixed reception blair sanderson of allmusic found svoboda s compositions to be imitative specifically comparing overture of season to work by leos janacek and symphony no 1 to equal parts of hugo alfven and jean sibelius with just a dash of carl nielsen sanderson criticized harmonic language of concerto for marimba and orchestra and found deponte s performance to be admirable but weakly planned similarly robert dettmer of classical cd review found svoboda s work to be derivative and expressively sterile and no more engaging than any other marimba concerto however dettmer acknowledged that marimba was one of his least favorite solo instruments dettmer wrote that depriest serves composer dutifully but not as as one might have expected for his marimba performance deponte earned a grammy award nomination for best instrumental soloist performance with orchestra first time that oregon symphony or any of its musicians had been recognized by recording academy following announcement deponte admitted that he was surprised by nomination and had not felt similar emotions since learning of his invitation to join orchestra 26 years earlier i am completely overwhelmed i had no idea recording had been submitted depriest said credit goes to mary tooze for making recording possible to niel for his fine playing and to tomas for writing such a wonderful piece i am thrilled for everyone concerned svoboda said of nomination prestige goes to orchestra this is a great moment for our symphony oregon symphony s director of public relations commented running joke is that forever more name of this organization is
