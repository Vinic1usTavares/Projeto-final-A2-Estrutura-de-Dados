thumb olca volcano lies in background olca paruma is a volcanic complex in chile lying on border between chile and bolivia it is formed by an east west alignment of volcanoes from west to east these are cerro paruma volcan paruma olca and mencheca or michincha aside from mines of ujina rosario and quebrada blanca area is sparsely populated these volcanoes have erupted mainly lava flows which descend their slopes volcanoes range in shape from long and narrow to short and stubby craters are found on volcanoes eruptive activity commenced during pleistocene and continued during holocene there is evidence of glaciation on volcanoes including moraines only historical activity of unspecified character occurred during 1865 1867 volcano may still be a threat to bolivia and chile it also features vigorous fumarolic activity and has been inspected for its geothermal energy potential geomorphology and geography olca paruma forms part of chile bolivia border chilean sector lies partly in commune of ollague el loa province antofagasta region and partly in tamarugal province tarapaca region bolivian segment lies in potosi department estacion yuma and estacion lie at southern foot of olca paruma along with an unpaved road buildings of and pajancha lie on bolivian side at southeastern foot southwest of olca paruma lie various mines including in order of increasing distance ujina rosario and quebrada blanca habitations in area include amincha and ollague olca paruma is relatively remote from human habitation regional olca paruma belongs to central volcanic zone cvz of andean volcanic belt a long volcanic arc that features or potentially active volcanoes most active volcano is lascar where a major eruption took place in 1993 other volcanoes with recorded activity include irruputuncu isluga and san pedro fumarolic activity has been recorded at alitar guallatiri lastarria olca paruma ollague putana and tacora volcanic activity of cvz ultimately is caused by nazca plate subducting beneath south american plate thumb map of region local olca paruma is a long volcanic complex it is composed of high conical cerro paruma high volcan paruma west of cerro paruma high olca west of volcan paruma and high mencheca volcanoes which are aligned in an east west direction mencheca is also known as michincha an additional centre is high cerro olca sur directly west of cerro paruma lies cerro candelaria and north of it a saddle named salle orca which leads north to another summit cerro moro olca has a summit crater and two craters are found on volcan paruma plus at least twelve additional vents some vents have well preserved craters and others are eroded volcanoes are accompanied by surge deposits formed during explosive activity basal diameter of edifice is basal surface and volume of edifice is lava flows reaching lengths of extend in a northerly direction from summit crater of olca there appear to be older lava flows on western side of olca that reach lengths of and that have been buried by younger flows other lava flows on northern and western sides of volcano were erupted from vents farther west of olca some fresh lava flows extend in a southeasterly direction from volcan paruma reaching in length they are long and wide and do not branch another much shorter lava flow with flow ridges lies east of volcan paruma s summit basement is formed by miocene pliocene age ujina ignimbrite basement around olca volcano lies at an elevation of about salar de laguani sits at eastern foot of olca paruma and salar de la laguna at its northern foot hydrology southern side of complex shows some traces of past glaciation in form of two different sets of apron like moraines one at an elevation of and other at even lower moraines have been found and valley glaciers formed on paruma some lower lava flows show evidence of heavy glaciation at least one warm spring is located at foot of olca paruma eastern slopes drain into salar de laguani northern slopes into salar de la laguna and southwestern slopes into salar michincha on southeastern side rio pajancha originates on olca paruma s slopes while southern slope drains into salar de alconcha through quebrada and quebrada composition lava flows contain andesite and dacite of relatively uniform composition former containing amphibole morphology of two long lava flows from volcan paruma implies that they were formed by lavas more mafic than is typical for region perhaps by andesite andesite fumarolic alteration is widespread on volcanic complex being conspicuous on ridge between olca and volcan paruma and on northern and southeastern flanks sulfur is present on volcano mainly around olca and was mined into 1980s sulfur mines on bolivian side include mina carlota between olca and paruma and mina tres on olca fumarolic activity lava dome in main crater of olca is fumarolically active with activity occurring over a long elliptical fumarole field paruma volcano also shows fumarolic activity additional reports claim that vapours emanate from yellow pits on western side fumarolic activity at olca paruma forms clouds that are visible over large distances measurements have yielded sulfur dioxide concentrations of 35 ppm over area ground temperatures in fumarole fields is about satellite observation has shown temperature anomalies reaching potentially caused by fumarolic activity fumarole gases in olca appear to be influenced by hydrothermal components rather than magmatic ones including high methane concentrations and overall high carbon sulfur ratios conversely water in fumaroles appears to be roughly equally of magmatic and meteoric origin and carbon dioxide is almost entirely of non mantle origin and predominantly from limestone argon isotope data indicate a moderately radiogenic origin for argon and a substantial amount of helium seems to have been added by crust ultimately fumarolic gases of olca appear to form in a hydrothermal system above magma at high temperatures of and with significant contributions from magma itself suggesting that there is still liquid magma beneath olca paruma with a resulting risk of future volcanic activity olca paruma has been investigated as a potential source of geothermal energy drilling to depths less than has demonstrated existence of warm groundwater beneath a clay layer with temperatures of a layer of high electrical conductivity has been found at depths of between and beneath olca paruma this conductive zone extends to irruputuncu and appears to be part of a general high conductivity area associated with volcanic arc eruption history olca paruma complex has been active since 80 000 years before present volcan paruma generated lava flows during holocene and lava flows of volcan paruma likewise display a fresh appearance being clearly post glacial other research has claimed that lava flows on western side of olca were erupted during pleistocene and that others seem to be much older appearance of edifices suggest that volcanic activity migrated east over time although validation of proposed older dates would contradict this cerro paruma is of pre holocene age potassium argon dating has yielded ages of 430 000 500 000 from distal lava flows west of olca and 5 000 350 000 from lava flows closer to summit of olca on its southwestern slope both are considered unreliable more recent volcanic activity was phreatic and phreatomagmatic and formed summit craters occurrence of recent volcanic activity and its location on olca paruma complex is unclear an unconfirmed flank eruption occurred in 1865 1867 on olca it may have occurred on volcan paruma however fumarolic activity has been ongoing for over sixty years and may have spiked in november 1989 march 1990 when seismic and fumarolic activity occurred at volcano during that instance strong fumarolic activity was observed on 13november 1989 from ujina and seismic activity was reported in mid march of subsequent year this fumarolic activity occurred in coincidence with earthquakes at iquique on coast seismic activity three potential seismic swarms occurred in 2010 on 2july and 7september a cluster of seismic activity has been observed between olca paruma and irruputuncu an seismometer array lies at olca paruma with over six seismometers in total around volcano between 2010 2011 these seismometers observed earthquake activity ranging from a mean of 1 6 to a maximum of 10 earthquakes per day most of which have however been linked to mining activity hazards as one of bolivia s two historically active volcanoes other being irruputuncu olca paruma is considered a possible volcanic threat however bolivia does not have any active volcano monitoring on olca paruma chilean sernageomin considers it a middle to low hazard volcano 46th most dangerous volcano of chile and publishes a volcano hazard level for volcano a hazard map has also been published references sources
