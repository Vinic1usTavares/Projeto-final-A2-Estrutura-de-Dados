menkauhor kaiu also known as ikauhor and in greek as mencheres was an ancient egyptian pharaoh of old kingdom period he was seventh ruler of fifth dynasty at end of 25th century bc or early in 24th century bc circa 2390 bc menkauhor ruled for possibly eight or nine years following king nyuserre ini and was succeeded in turn by djedkare isesi although menkauhor is well attested by historical sources few artifacts from his reign have survived consequently his familial relation to his predecessor and successor is unclear and no offspring of his have been identified khentkaus iii may have been menkauhor s mother as indicated by evidence discovered in her tomb in 2015 beyond construction of monuments only known activity dated to menkauhor s reign is an expedition to copper and turquoise mines in sinai menkauhor ordered construction of a sun temple called akhet ra meaning horizon of ra last ever to be built this sun temple known from inscriptions found in tombs of its priests is yet to be located menkauhor was buried in a small pyramid in saqqara which ancient egyptians named netjer isut menkauhor divine places of menkauhor known today as headless pyramid ruin had been lost under shifting sands until its rediscovery in 2008 figure of menkauhor was at centre of a long lasting funerary cult until end of old kingdom period with at least seven agricultural domains producing goods for necessary offerings cult of a deified menkauhor then known by titles strong lord of two lands menkauhor justified reappeared during new kingdom period c 1550 c 1077 bc and lasted until at least nineteenth dynasty c 1292 c 1077 bc some 1200 years after his death attestations historical menkauhor is attested by three hieroglyphic sources all from much later new kingdom period his name is given on 31st entry of abydos king list which was inscribed on walls of a temple during reign of seti i 1290 1279 bc he is also mentioned on saqqara tablet 30th entry and on turin canon third column 23rd row both of which were written during reign of ramesses ii 1279 1213 bc turin canon credits menkauhor with a reign of eight years these sources indicate that menkauhor succeeded nyuserre ini and preceded djedkare isesi on throne making him seventh pharaoh of fifth dynasty menkauhor was likely mentioned in aegyptiaca a history of egypt written in 3rd century bc during reign of ptolemy ii 283 246 bc by egyptian priest manetho but no copies of text survive and it is known only through later writings by sextus julius africanus and eusebius africanus relates that aegyptiaca mentioned a pharaoh mencheres reigning for nine years as seventh king of fifth dynasty mencheres is believed to be a hellenized form of menkauhor and africanus nine year figure fits well with eight years of reign given to menkauhor on turin canon latter figure being considered by some egyptologists including hartwig altenmuller as more likely than former contemporaneous thumb left upright personified agricultural estate of menkauhor tomb of ptahhotep saqqara relatively few attestations dating to menkauhor s reign have survived compared to other kings of fifth dynasty nonetheless menkauhor s name is well attested in names and titles of priests and officials of fifth dynasty as well as in names of agricultural estates associated with his funerary cult surviving artefacts contemporaneous with menkauhor s reign include two stone vessels inscribed with his name from mortuary temple of neferefre possibly gifts from menkauhor for funerary cult of neferefre as well as a few sealings from same temple and from an area known as djedkare s family cemetery in abusir cylinder seal impressions showing menkauhor s horus name or name of his pyramid have also been unearthed in mortuary complex of nyuserre ini and in necropolises of giza and gebelein a gold cylinder seal bearing menkauhor s cartouche as part of name of his pyramid together with serekh of djedkare isesi is now on display at museum of fine arts boston seal purportedly discovered near pactolus river valley in western anatolia could attest to wide ranging trade contacts during fifth dynasty but its provenance remains unverifiable only secure depiction of king dating to old kingdom that has survived to this day is a rough possibly unfinished alabaster statuette showing menkauhor enthroned and wearing tight fitting ceremonial robe of heb sed statue was discovered in a built during late new kingdom beneath floor of a room to west of sacred lake at temple of ptah in memphis egyptologist jocelyn berlandini proposed that another statuette usually attributed to teti belongs instead to menkauhor kaiu berlandini bases her hypothesis on stylistic grounds noting resemblance with menkauhor s seated statue as well as location of second statue which was uncovered east of teti s pyramid in close proximity to menkauhor s pyramid monumental attestations of menkauhor are limited to a rock inscription at wadi maghareh in sinai showing his titulary and a rough stele inscribed with his cartouche from mastaba 904 at saqqara family thumb drawing of a serpentine cylinder seal of menkauhor kaiu name name of menkauhor is a departure from those of other kings of fifth dynasty menkauhor whose name means eternal are kas of horus is first pharaoh in 80 years whose name does not refer to sun god ra name of menkauhor instead finds its peers among princes of fifth dynasty with for example prince khentykauhor forces of horus are at fore a son of nyuserre ini and prince neserkauhor a son of djedkare isesi filiation owing to paucity of contemporaneous sources for menkauhor his relation to his predecessor nyuserre ini and to his successor djedkare isesi cannot be ascertained beyond doubt menkauhor may have been a son of nyuserre ini indeed nyuserre ini is known to have fathered a prince khentykauhor as shown by a relief mentioning prince from mortuary complex of queen khentkaus ii mother of nyuserre ini similarity of khentykauhor s name to that of menkauhor led egyptologists miroslav verner and vivienne callender to propose that two are same person with khentykauhor taking name menkauhor upon ascending throne this hypothesis is possibly contradicted by an inscription discovered in 2008 in mastaba of eldest son of an unnamed king inscription mentions a menkauhor but does not ascribe any royal attributes to him egyptologists hana vymazalova and filip coppens suggest this might refer to future pharaoh menkauhor kaiu at a time when he was still a prince they note that menkauhor might have offered high quality stone blocks for construction of tomb of his possible relative which would explain inscription this contradicts identification of menkauhor with khentykauhor vymazalova and coppens theorize that khentykauhor and menkauhor were brothers and sons of nyuserre ini identity of menkauhor s mother is equally uncertain in january 2015 tomb of king s wife and king s mother khentkaus iii was discovered by a team of czech archaeologists in necropolis surrounding pyramid of neferefre in abusir mud seals in tomb indicate that khentkaus iii was buried during nyuserre ini s reign since nyuserre ini s own mother is known to have been khentkaus ii discovery suggests that she was menkauhor kaiu s mother position of her tomb close to pyramid of neferefre could indicate that she was this king s consort and thus that neferefre was menkauhor s father consorts no queen consort of menkauhor has been identified for certain egyptologist wilfried seipel has proposed that khuit i was a queen of menkauhor based on dating of tombs surrounding khuit s burial seipel argues that she lived during mid fifth dynasty by process of elimination he attributes known queens to each king of period which leaves only menkauhor as a candidate for her king these arguments are criticized by egyptologist michel baud who observes that pharaohs could have had more than one queen queen meresankh iv has also been suggested as a consort for menkauhor based on dating and location of her tomb in saqqara it is possible however that she was a wife of djedkare isesi descendants there is no evidence either for or against hypothesis that menkauhor s successor djedkare isesi was his son two sons have been suggested for menkauhor based on dating and general location of their tombs in saqqara princes raemka and kaemtjenent both believed to be children of meresankh iv by same reasoning they could instead be sons of djedkare isesi reign duration thumb right upright 1 1 relief of menkauhor kaiu from wadi maghareh given scarcity of contemporaneous attestations for menkauhor modern egyptologists consider his reign to have been perhaps eight or nine years long as indicated by much later historical sources small seated statue of menkauhor wearing robe of sed festival might suggest a longer reign since this festival was typically celebrated only after a ruler had spent 30 years on throne however egyptologist hartwig altenmuller deems this hypothesis unlikely mere depictions of festival do not necessarily imply a long reign for example a relief showing pharaoh sahure in tunic of sed festival was found in his mortuary temple although both historical sources and archaeological evidence suggest sahure ruled egypt for less than 14 full years activities owing to scarcity of artefacts and inscriptions relating to menkauhor s reign few of his activities are known menkauhor sent an expedition to sinai to exploit mines of turquoise and copper in wadi maghareh expedition is evidenced by a damaged rock inscription showing menkauhor s titulary which is one of few attestations dating to his lifetime mines of sinai had been exploited since third dynasty 2686 bc 2613 bc and both menkauhor s predecessor nyuserre ini and successor djedkare isesi sent expeditions to wadi maghareh construction activities menkauhor kaiu is known to have ordered construction of two major monuments during his reign a sun temple for veneration of ra and a pyramid for his burial known today as headless pyramid sun temple following a tradition which started with userkaf founder of fifth dynasty menkauhor built a temple to sun god ra he was last pharaoh to do so his successors djedkare isesi and unas abandoned this practice as cult of ra declined at expense of that of osiris given paucity of documents relating to menkauhor s sun temple it probably functioned for only a short time or was never completed menkauhor s sun temple was called akhet ra which is variously translated as horizon of ra or place where ra issues forth temple has yet to be located and could be lying under sands of saqqara or abusir its existence is known thanks to inscriptions found in tombs of fifth and sixth dynasties officials who served as priests of ra in temple these include hemu buried in giza and neferiretptah and raemankh who were both buried in saqqara north in addition to his service in akhet ra neferiretptah was a priest in menkauhor s pyramid and held office of royal ornament making him responsible for precious items in palace of king besides these inscriptions a single seal bearing name of akhet ra is known from tomb of princess located near mortuary temple of niuserre in abusir seal was placed on a large vessel indicating that provisions for tombs of members of royal family were dispatched from menkauhor s temple to niuserre s pyramid complex pyramid thumb left upright 1 2 pyramid of menkauhor lepsius xxix was constructed on a south west north east axis linking pyramids of djoser and userkaf and after menkauhor s death those of unas and teti as well menkauhor kaiu built a pyramid in north saqqara thereby abandoning royal necropolis of abusir where kings of fifth dynasty had been buried since reign of sahure some 80 years earlier reason for this choice may be that abusir plateau had become overcrowded by beginning of menkauhor s reign originally named netjer isut menkauhor by ancient egyptians meaning divine places of menkauhor pyramid is known today as lepsius xxix after number given to it by archaeologist karl richard lepsius who discovered pyramid in 1843 owing to ruined state of structure it is known in arabic as headless pyramid a name that has been retained pyramid was lost under shifting sands in early 20th century and its attribution to menkauhor was consequently debated instead it was proposed that headless pyramid was that of a structure dating to first intermediate period and which has yet to be found in 2008 structure identified by lepsius was rediscovered by a team of archaeologists under direction of zahi hawass and excavations at site quickly established a fifth dynasty date as indicated by construction techniques used in its making although excavations failed to yield name of king who built pyramid menkauhor was last pharaoh of dynasty whose pyramid remained undiscovered thus proceeding by elimination archeologists and egyptologists have formally recognized headless pyramid as that of menkauhor pyramid is estimated to have been around at base so that edifice would have stood high at time of its construction making it one of smallest royal pyramids of old kingdom there is evidence that menkauhor had time to complete his pyramid whose small dimensions are thus consistent with his short eight to nine years of reign on north side lies entrance to underground chamber system which was sealed by two granite portcullises indicating that a burial took place a broken sarcophagus lid of blue grey basalt was found in burial chamber by cecil mallaby firth during his brief excavations of pyramid in 1930 funerary cult thumb upright personified hwt domain of menkauhor called menkauhor is perfect of appearances tomb of ptahhotep old kingdom after his death menkauhor enjoyed a funerary cult centered on his pyramid complex cult lasted at least until second half of sixth dynasty nearly 150 years later provisions for this cult were produced in dedicated agricultural domains that were established during menkauhor s lifetime products of these domains were delivered to menkauhor s sun and mortuary temples and distributed to priests of cult who could use them for their sustenance or their own funerary cults personified representations of menkauhor s agricultural domains are depicted bringing offerings on walls of mastabas of these priests most of depictions are located in saqqara north near pyramid complex of djoser this area comprises tombs of neferiretptah raemankh iti sekhemnefer akhethotep ptahhotep and all priests of funerary cult of menkauhor further tombs of priests of this cult are found to north in abusir south with mastaba of and and in giza complete names of at least seven domains of menkauhor are known ikauhor is perfect in favor and favor of ikauhor both mentioned in tombs of ptahhotep and akhethotep ikauhor is perfect of life from tomb of ptahhotep ii horus causes ikauhor to live ikauhor is strong seshat loves ikauhor and loves ikauhor from tombs of viziers senedjemib inti senedjemib mehi and hemu in giza in addition hwt domain of king which comprises land holdings of mortuary temple of menkauhor was named menkauhor is perfect of appearances new kingdom thumb left upright 1 menkauhor represented on a stele from tomb of ameneminet louvre cult of menkauhor enjoyed a revival during new kingdom period 1550 1077 bc at this point menkauhor had been deified as a local god of saqqara necropolis acting as a divine intercessor and qualified of strong lord of two lands menkauhor justified this cult is evidenced by reliefs showing menkauhor in tombs of chief of artisans and jewelers ameneminet and of physician in saqqara north both of whom lived at time of late eighteenth dynasty 1550 1292 bc during reigns of tutankhamun ay and an inscribed block dating to later ramesside period 1292 1077 bc and now in egyptian museum of berlin was uncovered by lepsius in a house in abusir and shows menkauhor enthroned beside four other deified kings of old kingdom name of first partially lost but probably sneferu is then followed by menkaure menkauhor and finally neferkare owner of tomb stands before kings in worship another relief dating to same period shows a similar scene it was inscribed on lintel of tomb chapel of mahy buried in saqqara north four deified kings of old kingdom are shown all of whom built their pyramids at saqqara djoser teti userkaf and menkauhor persistence of cult of menkauhor during late eighteenth to nineteenth dynasty possibly results from location of his pyramid which stood on way to necropolis of apis bulls which later became serapeum notes references bibliography external links category 25th century bc pharaohs
