metro revealed that carey was possibly recording a christmas album composition and reception angels cry is an r b song on which carey uses her higher vocal register over an instrumental of a piano and hand clapping lyrically song is about maintaining hope that a fading relationship can be salvaged because true love only happens once carey sings i m willing to live and die for our love baby we can get back that shine however lyrics super natural love conquers all could also be interpreted as feeling god s love adam holz of plugged in thought that lyrics were depressing while lauren murphy of entertainment ie felt that lyrics when you and i say goodbye i felt angels cry were too sentimental although ann powers of los angeles times thought that song had a sad tone she praised its production musically remix does not greatly differ from that of original apart from a new second verse by ne yo digital spy s robert copsey praised track he wrote that it was one of standouts on memoirs of an imperfect angel and that it s about as close to classic mariah as new mariah gets he complimented carey s classy and effortless vocals and added that ne yo gave track an emotional extra dimension copsey likened song to one of carey s previous singles we belong together 2005 it s a bit of a we belong together retread but it s a thoroughly pleasant we belong together retread a reviewer for dj booth commented that song sounded as thought it could have been released in 1994 bill lamb of about com placed angels cry in his list of album s best tracks leonie cooper of guardian gave a mixed review of remix although she did not express her dislike for track she felt that it was too similar to carey previous material writing that it is middle of road inoffensive semi soul fodder we ve had to come to expect from her cooper was however critical of decision to include ne yo and that his addition makes song even more bland robbie daw of idolator also felt that track was a typically mariah esque ballad michael cragg of musicomh was critical of song writing that it is a limp ballad which he thought was trying too hard at recreating some of carey s previous material and concluded by writing that it ultimately ends up making you want to hear original version more than anything chart performance in united states remix peaked at number twenty six on adult contemporary chart becoming her twenty eighth career entry and ne yo s first it is second song from memoirs of an imperfect angel to enter chart following carey s single release cover of i want to know what love is which peaked

newman of hitfix thought that video appeared to have a bigger production budget than that of video for up out my face with minaj but noted that it was still low key for a carey video newman further commented that while singer appears to be wearing albeit little make up she looked more natural and beautiful than ever leonie cooper thought that video made bland song more appealing video with a moist mariah in rain preposterous sequinned gold boots a puppy in studio and shameless pimping of her latest perfume kind of makes up for it charts chart 2010 peakposition japan japan hot 100 89 south
