changes needed to transfer materiel and troops more efficiently from rail to ship however he was warned by chief of staff of united states army general george c marshall that his tenure might be brief and might soon be given another assignment so he should select a deputy and train him to take over lee chose colonel frederick gilbreath a sign that lee was being considered for a command assignment was his being sent to fort benning georgia for a refresher course on infantry tactics lee was designated as an observer at louisiana maneuvers in 1940 and 1941 during those maneuvers 2d infantry division had been disappointing and lee was ordered to assume command of it at fort sam houston texas and bring it up to standard he replaced commander of 38th infantry regiment with colonel william g weaver lee was concerned about performance of divisional artillery and arranged for it to receive additional training at fort sill oklahoma which was where he was when he heard news of japanese attack on pearl harbor which brought united states into world war ii lieutenant general lesley j mcnair was impressed with lee s performance and lee was promoted to major general on 14 february 1942 bolero in may 1942 war department considered creation of a services of supply sos organization in european theater of operations eto to handle large volume of service troops and supplies being deployed to united kingdom for operation bolero buildup of us troops there for operation sledgehammer proposed allied invasion of france in 1942 and operation roundup larger follow up operation in 1943 lee s name was put forward for position of its commander by secretary of war stimson commander of united states army services of supply usasos lieutenant general brehon b somervell and mcnair commander of army ground forces marshall had already formed a positive impression of lee when he had commanded pacific ports of embarkation and decided to appoint him lee arrived in washington dc on 5 may 1942 where he attended two weeks of conferences about bolero and form of organization for eto sos that marshall and somervell had in mind they were determined that organization of sos in theaters of war should be identical to that of usasos in united states during world war i this had not been case and resultant overlapping and criss crossing lines of communication had caused great confusion and inefficiency both in washington and in tours somervell instructed each chief in usasos to recommend best two men in his branch one of whom would accompany lee while other remained in washington for his chief of staff lee chose colonel thomas b larkin who was promoted to brigadier general thumb left general depot at stocked with supplies for operation overlord lee met with major general homer m groninger commander of new york port of embarkation poe through which all troops and supplies for eto would be funnelled and lee and larkin consulted with lieutenant general james g harbord who had commanded sos of american expeditionary force during world war i harbord noted that he too had commanded 2d division before being given sos assignment he recommended that lee obtain a personal train harbord had been given one by french in world war i and had found it invaluable lee flew to uk on 23 may 1942 with nine staff who would form nucleus of his new command he found that commander of united states forces in british isles usafbi major general james e chaney had prepared a different plan for organization of eto headquarters one along orthodox lines laid out in field service regulations with brigadier general donald a davison designated to command sos but marshall had selected lee and he had mandated that new theater organization should be along general pattern of a command post with a minimum of supply and administrative services somervell and major general dwight d eisenhower head of operations division of war department general staff arrived in london on 26 may for discussions with chaney about organization of eto and sos usafbi officially became european theater of operations united states army etousa on 8 june and chaney was replaced by eisenhower on 24 june somervell and lee conducted a whirlwind inspection tour of us depots and bases in england on a special train belonging to general sir bernard paget british commander in chief home forces this reminded lee of harbord s advice about special train they took up matter with lord leathers british minister of war transport who agreed to provide a small train it had a car for lee two cars for his staff a conference car two flatcars for vehicles and a dining car one of lee s first concerns was to find a suitable location for his sos headquarters he found limited space at its initial location at no 1 great cumberland place in london and decided to locate headquarters in southern england where most base installations would be located brigadier general claude n thiele lee s chief of administrative services suggested cheltenham in gloucestershire about northwest of london british war office administrative staff occupied of offices there but were willing to return to their old london location a regional organization was adopted on 20 july with uk divided into four base sections torch by end of june 1942 there were 54 845 us troops in uk but a series of defeats in north africa and on russian front along with heavy losses from submarine attacks convinced british chiefs of staff that sledgehammer would not be feasible instead operation torch an invasion of northwest africa was substituted this changed only purpose of bolero over of stores and supplies still arrived in august september and october although less than somervell hoped it was more than lee s service units could cope with stores and supplies had to be cleared from port areas as quickly as possible lest they become targets for german bombing raids there was no time to build new depots so they were shipped to british depots and warehouses americans and british were unfamiliar with each other s procedures priority had been given to shipping combat units and service units made up only 21 percent of theater s strength which was insufficient nor were more units available in united states mobilization program had also produced too few service units and somervell was forced to ship partly trained units in hope that they could learn on job perhaps 30 percent of stores arrived with no markings indicating what they were and 25 percent were merely marked by general type such as medical or ordnance stores lee did not have enough personnel to sort identify and catalog their contents soon vast quantities of stores and supplies could not be located in august it was discovered that most of organizational equipment of 1st infantry division which was earmarked for operation torch was still in united states and none of hospitals earmarked for torch arrived with their full equipment before october lee was initially optimistic that he could turn situation around but by september there was no option but to request that usasos re ship stores that had already been despatched but could not be located if torch was to be mounted on time eisenhower who had been designated to command torch leaned on lee and withdrew his recommendation that lee succeed him as commander of etousa strenuous efforts were made and by october lee was able to report that needs of torch would be met needs of torch placed a heavy drain on resources of lee s command there were 228 000 us troops in uk in october but 151 000 went to north africa by end of february 1943 sos also lost key officers including larkin some of supplies were shipped from uk to north africa between october 1942 and april 1943 while receipts totalled less than per month lee forcefully argued that preparations for roundup should resume he visited north africa in january 1943 after taking a course as an air gunner so he would not be a useless passenger of aircraft and spoke to patton and general sir bernard montgomery about their supply situation overlord eisenhower was succeeded as commander of etousa by lieutenant general frank m andrews on 4 february 1943 on somervell s advice lee submitted a proposal to andrews that he be named deputy theater commander for supply and administration and that theater g 4 branch be placed under him this would have given lee a status similar to that enjoyed by somervell andrews rejected proposal but he did make some changes moving part of sos headquarters to london while its operations staff remained in cheltenham weaver was appointed lee s deputy for operations andrews regarded lee as oppressively religious and resolved to ask marshall for his recall before he could do so andrews was killed in a plane crash in iceland on 3 may and was succeeded by lieutenant general jacob l devers who agreed to abolish theater g 4 and transfer its functions to lee thumb left communications zone improvised red ball express which used trucks to deliver supplies to forward area until railroad system could be rehabilitated for cross channel attack now postponed to 1944 and codenamed operation overlord service chiefs wanted 490 000 sos troops devers trimmed this to 375 000 which would be 25 percent of theater troop strength a figure that was accepted by war department most acute shortages in 1943 were of engineer units to build new airbases hospitals supply depots and training facilities as in 1942 lee was forced to accept partly trained units in first four months of 1944 number of sos troops in uk increased from 79 900 to 220 200 some lessons had been learned from 1942 new york poe started turning back incorrectly labelled cargo in first day this system went into operation some 14 700 items were returned to depots on 16 january 1944 eisenhower returned to take control of allied forces for overlord his headquarters was designated supreme headquarters allied expeditionary force shaef with shaef taking over operational functions etousa was combined with sos to create what would become communications zone com z once operations commenced a complicating factor was creation of first united states army group under lieutenant general omar n bradley who sought to place logistical functions under his command lee also conflicted with eisenhower s chief of staff lieutenant general walter b smith while eisenhower respected lee s administrative talents smith resented lee s position as deputy theater commander which allowed lee to bypass eisenhower and occasionally frustrate smith s efforts to rein in operational commanders like bradley and patton through logistics smith arranged for his own protege major general royal lord to be appointed as lee s deputy on 21 february 1944 lee was promoted to lieutenant general along with courtney h hodges richard k sutherland and raymond a wheeler lee began a curious habit of wearing his stars on both back and front of his helmet which added to his reputation as an eccentric lee was often called jesus christ himself based on his initials he was also known as court house and church house lee logistical arrangements for d day proceeded well although initial advance was much slower than anticipated and casualties and ammunition expenditure were high in lead up to operation cobra breakout from normandy com z s advance section took over responsibility for depots and installations in normandy except for fuel dumps during subsequent pursuit across france and belgium advance was much faster than forecast there was no time to establish intermediate supply dumps lee improvised with road transport red ball express but logistic support of armies depended on repair of railroad system and development of ports original plans to use ports in brittany were abandoned in favor of marseilles in south and le havre and antwerp which were captured by british 21st army group in august com z headquarters moved from uk to a camp at valognes in france although eisenhower had expressed a desire that headquarters not be located in paris on 1 september lee decided to move com z headquarters there this involved movement of 8 000 officers and 21 000 enlisted men from uk and valognes and took two weeks to accomplish at a time when there were severe supply shortages eventually com z occupied 167 hotels in paris seine base section headquarters occupied 129 more and shaef occupied another 25 lee established his own official residence in hotel george v front of building was kept clear for his own vehicle he justified move to paris on grounds that paris was hub of france s road rail and inland waterway communications networks logic was conceded but use of scarce fuel and transport resources at a critical time caused embarrassment during ardennes offensive lee deployed service troops particularly engineers to help delay german advance while other com z troops shifted supply dumps in path of german advance to safer locations in rear thereby denying germans access to captured american fuel supplies some of fuel were moved lee s challenge to army racial policy thumb right upright memo from lieutenant general j c h lee calling for volunteers for infantry training without regard to color or race during october bradley incurred very heavy casualties in fighting in battle of aachen and battle of forest in october and november this resulted in a critical shortage of infantry replacements even before crisis situation created by ardennes offensive noting that casualties among newly arrived reinforcements greatly exceeded those among veterans lee tried to humanize replacement depots and suggested changing name so that they sounded less like spare parts bradley opposed this arguing for more substantial changes one source of infantry reinforcements was com z lee suggested that physically fit african american soldiers in communications zone providing their jobs could be filled by limited duty personnel should be allowed to volunteer for infantry duty and be placed in otherwise white units without regard to a quota but on an as needed basis he wrote it is planned to assign you without regard to color or race smith disagreed with lee s plan writing to eisenhower reflecting prevalent racial prejudices of most us army officers at time smith did not believe negro troops capable of combat duty his opinion was that a one for one replacement should not be attempted only replacements as full platoons of black soldiers as a result of directive 2 500 volunteers were organized into 53 rifle platoons and sent to front to be distributed as needed to companies in 12th army group they were attached to regiments while in 6th army group platoons were grouped into companies attached to division former arrangement were generally better rated by units they were attached to because negro platoons had no company level unit training post war career after ve day communications zone became theater service forces and lee moved his headquarters to frankfurt in september 1945 in december 1945 he succeeded lieutenant general matthew b ridgway as deputy theater commander and commander mediterranean theater of operations united states army mtousa in italy he worked closely with theater commander british lieutenant general sir william duthie morgan until

repatriation of hundreds of thousands of american service men and women opened sicily rome american cemetery and memorial and restored infrastructure of many of nations surrounding mediterranean allied occupation of italy ended when peace treaty with italy went into effect in september 1947 and lee returned to united states in august 1947 newspaper columnist robert c ruark claimed that general lee misused enlisted men under his command in occupied italy ruark vowed i am going to blow a loud whistle on lieutenant general john c h lee and published a series of articles critical of lee s command quoting several disgruntled soldiers some suggested ruark was unhappy because a journalist s train had left him behind and lee would not provide secondary transportation for him subsequently
