stephen thomas stjepan 1411 july 1461 a member of house of kotromanic reigned from 1443 until his death as penultimate king of bosnia an illegitimate son of king ostoja thomas succeeded king tvrtko ii but his accession was not recognized by leading magnate of kingdom of bosnia stjepan vukcic kosaca two engaged in a civil war which ended when king repudiated his wife vojaca and married insubordinate nobleman s daughter catherine thomas and his second wife both raised in bosnian church tradition converted to roman catholicism and sponsored construction of churches and monasteries throughout kingdom throughout his reign thomas waged a war with serbian despotate over lucrative mining town of srebrenica and its surroundings in addition to or in conjunction with multiple conflicts with his father in law moreover he had a tense relationship with menacing ottoman empire after years of skirmishes and raids thomas appeared willing to lead christian coalition against turks but received no assistance from fellow christian rulers having failed to expand into croatia proper thomas turned again to east in 1458 arranging a match between his son stephen and serbian heiress helena bosnian control over remnants of serbian despotate lasted merely a month before ottoman conquest of state king thomas failure to defend serbia permanently damaged his reputation in europe wishing to improve his image among europe s catholics thomas turned against bosnian church thus becoming first ruler of bosnia to engage in religious persecution thomas sometime contradictory traits earned him both admiration and scorn from his contemporaries his son stephen succeeded him and immediately proved more apt at dealing with challenges of time background thomas was son of king ostoja who died in 1418 and his mistress whose name is not recorded he was a doubly adulterine child as both his father and mother were married at time of his birth ostoja was only non catholic king of bosnia and thomas was raised as a member of bosnian church to which his parents adhered tvrtko ii deposed stephen ostojic ostoja s only known legitimate child and successor in 1421 thomas illegitimate older brother radivoj unsuccessfully contested tvrtko s rule with help of ottoman turks and kosaca family leading magnates of kingdom of bosnia narrative sources refer to thomas as well as his father and brother as a which is thought to be name of a cadet branch of kotromanic dynasty thomas was thus closely related to tvrtko ii likely his first cousin avoiding limelight during reign of tvrtko ii thomas lived with a commoner named vojaca and their children he was loyal to king tvrtko and together two took part in a skirmish in usora where thomas was wounded his loyalty likely influenced childless and ailing king to ensure his succession thomas was certainly preferable to his brother radivoj whom tvrtko detested count hermann ii of celje a descendant of kotromanic family once designated as heir presumptive had died in 1435 accession to coronation thumb upright reproduction of king stephen thomas blazon with his monogram on shield and royal crown tvrtko ii died in november 1443 approved his choice of heir and thomas was duly elected king by 5 december like his predecessors he added royal name stephen to his own however kingdom s most powerful magnate grand duke stjepan vukcic kosaca refused to accept thomas as king and announced his support for radivoj authorities of neighbouring republic of ragusa immediately expressed concern about situation kosaca and radivoj appealed to ragusa not to recognize thomas as king but to no avail simultaneously hermann s grandson ulrich ii pressed his claim to bosnian throne and tried to gather support among thomas s opponents because of this thomas hastened to send word of his accession to foreign rulers including german king frederick iv ulrich s rival and ragusan and venetian authorities hoping to receive recognition ulrich was occupied with feud waged against him by frederick as well as with succession struggle in hungary where he had taken side with his cousin queen dowager elizabeth of luxembourg and her infant son ladislaus against reigning monarch vladislav i leaving thomas ample space of maneuver france al atlas ljubljana 2011 pp 90 igor helene glas iz veka ljubljana 1999 pp 9 povijest od vremena do xix vol 3 zagreb 1974 pp 206 207 succession war king thomas acted resolutely to strengthen his position in january 1444 he penetrated bosnian held region of zachlumia ruled by kosacas kosaca s nephew ivanis pavlovic accompanied him and radivojevic family discontented vassals of kosacas joined them upon their arrival party soon took drijeva thus restoring important customs town to royal domain for first time in three decades pressed by his simultaneous war with venice and receiving no help from ottoman turks kosaca agreed to a truce in march both sides hoped to buy time to regain strength for future clashes king thomas tried to exact promise of help from venice in event of a hungarian offensive against him even offering 25 year long control over some of his towns and mines to republic in return however throughout may successful negotiations with hungary rendered this cession unnecessary janos hunyadi s intercession with king vladislaus i led to hungarian recognition of thomas in june for which grateful king of bosnia promised hunyadi free passage shelter an annual income and assistance in any matter thus by summer thomas had secured his grip on throne in july 1444 hungarian king informed thomas of his intention to break truce with ottomans king thomas decided to make best of his membership in christian coalition in may he had already conquered lucrative silver mining town of srebrenica taken by ottomans from serbian despotate which in turn had taken it from bosnia he now decided to resume his war against rebellious kosaca an ottoman tributary turks were now ready to assist duke and broke into bosnia forcing king to flee from to bobovac and enabling kosaca to reverse all his losses in august ottomans restored serbia to durad brankovic who allied with kosaca against king thomas destruction of hungarian army in november 1444 at battle of varna where king vladislaus himself perished left thomas vulnerable forced again to rely solely on venice thomas repeated his earlier offer but republic declined and made peace with kosaca in april 1445 thomas lost srebrenica and entire drina valley to brankovic ivanis pavlovic came to his aid again and two advanced towards thomas retook drijeva but his advance was suddenly halted perhaps by another turkish incursion or a truce hostilities finally ended in september conversion and marriage having failed to strengthen royal authority by force king thomas decided to seek another way to pacify kingdom a rapprochement with kosaca via marriage with his daughter catherine was probably already envisaged in 1445 when thomas improved relations with holy see in order to be cleared of stain of illegitimacy as well as to receive an annulment of his union with vojaca pope eugene iv responded affirmatively on 29 may by that time thomas appears to have decided to join roman catholic church negotiations with kosaca intensified in beginning of 1446 king thomas was then finally converted from bosnian christianity to roman catholicism by tommaso tommasini bishop of however cardinal juan carvajal only performed baptism in 1457 thumb roman catholic monasteries during thomas reign thomas intention to marry kosaca s daughter catherine was made known in april their lands and borders reverting to status quo ante bellum prospective bride a bosnian christian also had to convert to catholicism for marriage to proceed these developments angered ivanis pavlovic and petar another vassal but in end no conflict with them took place elaborate festivities marked royal wedding in mid may in conducted by catholic rite followed by couple s coronation in mile for first time a crown was sent from rome to be placed on head of a bosnian king bishop of feltre and papal legate to bosnia another tommaso tommasini fetched crown from cathedral of saint in spalato in july but it never reached thomas as it facilitated alliances with western rulers and came along with western cultural influences in art architecture music and fashion that penetrated bosnia roman catholicism became preferable faith early in thomas reign many bosnian noblemen followed king s example in converting to catholicism but some soon returned to bosnian church kosaca wrote that he considered conversion but never went through with it churches and franciscan monasteries sprang up throughout bosnia during thomas reign some erected by king himself despite his efforts to project an image of a good catholic king thomas religious policy was not initially so resolute he continued honoring bosnian christians and their clergy as his predecessors had done which led to disputes with local franciscans pope eugene agreed that for political reasons king thomas had to tolerate heretics peak peace brought unusual stability to bosnia as well as security to thomas he retook srebrenica once again in autumn of 1446 and eventually struck a short lived compromise with brankovic by which two would share town and its mining revenues it was not to last however unfounded rumour had it that hungarian noblemen considered offering holy crown of hungary to him which testified to his growing reputation ottomans who wanted to weaken bosnia by encouraging internal division were very displeased by kingdom s stability at request of durad brankovic turks broke into both king thomas personal lands and those of his father in law in march 1448 plundering and burning towns kosaca who now called himself herzog of saint sava was thus forced to side with brankovic against his son in law and king in mid september brankovic s brother in law thomas kantakouzenos leading an army that included kosaca himself soundly defeated king thomas king thomas reconquered srebrenica again in february 1449 but hostilities continued until 1451 when king made peace again with his insubordinate father in law dispute was even taken before diet of hungary to finance this incessant warfare as well as to sustain royal court king thomas engaged in vigorous commerce and made business deals with dalmatian traders he relied heavily on his silver mining but profited most from his salt trade monopolies in laws conflict in 1451 when kosaca sought to improve his own economy through a war with republic of ragusa thomas refused to join either side but still interceded with pope nicholas v to prevent his father in law s excommunication however ragusa persisted and promised to return favor by helping thomas take drijeva from kosaca and hodidjed from turks in summer thomas was even approached by kosaca s family namely king s brother in law vladislav and mother in law jelena who were gravely offended when duke took his son s charming bride as his concubine in mid december thomas finally agreed with ragusa on a pact against his infamous father in law but war ended abruptly when hungary and ottomans signed a truce which specifically forbade latter s tributary to attack ragusa thumb blagaj fort contested between thomas and his brother in law open rebellion against stjepan kosaca broke out in march 1452 vladislav along with his mother and grandmother raised an army and took control over most of his father s territory thomas vladislav s king and brother in law answered his call for help and arrived with his army following month ragusa also joined them however king thomas proved reluctant to attack and soon went back north to ward off a turkish incursion kosaca seized opportunity to enlist help from venice which took drijeva from vladislav and to entice uprisings against rebels themselves thomas returned as he had promised chasing venetians from drijeva and easily defeating his brother in law s enemies coalition then suddenly fell apart when it became clear that vladislav would not hand over parts of his patrimony that thomas claimed as his due namely drijeva and blagaj which was kosaca seat and key to zachlumia new conflict emerged in 1453 upon death of petar talovac who had governed croatia proper as ban on behalf of hungarian king both thomas and his recently widowed father in law wished to gain control of talovac s allodial land by offering marriage to his widow hedwig garai kosaca proposed himself while thomas suggested his son stephen kosaca invited turks to bosnia in autumn but neither prevailed as venice moved in to protect talovac s heirs they then made peace realizing that ottomans who had just stunned europe by conquering constantinople would soon be at their gates as well another concern was end of regency for hitherto underage hungarian king ladislaus posthumous which decreased influence of thomas friend janos hunyadi and led to rise of ulrich of celje who was supported by kosaca after ladislaus made ulrich new ban of croatia latter started seizing control of croatian towns which met strong opposition from thomas bosnian king feared that ulrich would take talovac s land and have his territory border kosaca s not wishing to break peace with his father in law yet again king turned to venice for help christian coalition thumb upright mehmed painted by a follower of gentile bellini holy see put king thomas under its protection in 1455 and promised that he would be given back lands taken by turks and his treacherous magnates if christians defeated ottomans in 1456 thomas sent a letter to pope callixtus iii asking him to find a bride for his son stephen hoping that holy see would provide him with a daughter in law of royal blood preparations were under way for another ottoman attack on hungary in beginning of that year mehmed conqueror ottoman sultan issued unusual demands to king of bosnia and his nobles kosacas and pavlovic family he asked thomas to send 10 000 loads of food his father in law 8 000 and petar pavlovic 4 000 mehmed also demanded that they commit their troops and personally take part in war on ottoman side he also requested from thomas cession of four towns two in middle of bosnia and two bordering hungary and venetian dalmatia this was all refused by now thomas suspected that mehmed also intended to conquer his kingdom therefore he started taking more interest in a christian coalition against turks and cooperating more closely with his father in law lack of a firmer action against ottomans was blamed on bosnian christians whom he described as being more inclined towards muslims than towards other christians heavy ottoman defeat by hungarians at battle of belgrade in july 1456 did nothing to alleviate thomas situation as mehmed started exerting an even greater pressure on bosnia in addition to financial extortion thomas was now forbidden to export silver which mehmed claimed for himself this severe crippling of bosnian economy suffocated kingdom thumb upright left crusader s cross situation in hungary took a sharp turn for worse immediately after celebrated victory over turks victorious commanders including janos hunyadi died of plague ulrich of celje was murdered and even young king ladislaus died suddenly following year aged durad brankovic also died his despotate passing to his son lazar realizing that hungary was drastically weakened and that he had crossed point of no return by refusing sultan s demands thomas decided to step forward to head christian coalition in august 1456 ragusa received an information from king in utmost secrecy he was intent on declaring war on turks he was far from capable of succeeding and even suffered a turkish raid in beginning of 1457 pope callixtus iii took king thomas very seriously he ordered that king of bosnia be handed crusaders cross papal flag and crusading fund marking him as leader of coalition in july 1457 however thomas relied not on his own dubious strength but on assistance of western rulers his emissaries to king alfonso v of aragon doge francesco foscari of venice duke francesco i sforza of milan and duke philip good of burgundy all reported refusals of help cardinal carvajal was sent to bosnia to meet with king thomas cardinal giovanni castiglione sceptically wrote that carvajal would have been better off if he had stayed in buda indeed carvajal found thomas ill equipped to deal with enemy pope became disillusioned with him and transferred leadership of christian coalition to albanian lord skanderbeg fall into disrepute expansion efforts ultimately failed crusading efforts did not preclude thomas from seeking expansion death of heirless ulrich of celje reopened possibility of seizing talovac lands but his father in law moved more quickly leading to a new brief cooling in their relations however in january 1458 a new opportunity arose on bosnia s eastern border turmoil that followed death of lazar brankovic enabled thomas to retake formerly bosnian part of drina river valley conquered by lazar s father in preceding decade as well as to expand into its right bank thomas captured a total of eleven towns keeping srebrenica zvornik and teocak for himself and distributing rest among local nobility who swore fealty to him he then turned his attention back to croatia he suggested to venice that since hungarians had not yet appointed a new ban of croatia he and republic should split banate among themselves in june he warned venice that new hungarian king matthias corvinus hunyadi s son would not be a good neighbour to either bosnia or venice if he took hold of croatia thumb left smederevo fortress an important but not lasting acquisition a large turkish raid in february 1458 forced thomas to sign a truce despite his earlier crusading vows but mehmed no longer insisted on cession of four towns he intended to conquer serbia instead at that time king thomas dropped plan of having his son marry an illegitimate daughter of francesco sforza match with a bastard daughter of a duke was far beneath king s expectations for stephen instead he successfully negotiated with lazar s widow byzantine princess helena palaiologina about a marriage between stephen and her oldest daughter helena that way thomas procured not only a daughter in law of imperial blood but also found a way to extend kotromanic rule to despotate of serbia now reduced to smederevo fortress and its surroundings as lazar had left no sons thomas sent word of plans to king matthias his feudal overlord in october in early december thomas himself went to meet matthias at a diet in szeged matthias was thrilled and urged thomas to send his son as soon as possible during thomas long absence turks broke into bosnia and besieged bobovac and but his son stephen and brother radivoj escaped thomas returned to bosnia in mid january 1459 and took up fight against attackers even trying to eject them from hodidjed in mid april he raided outskirts of hodidjed and besieged fort meanwhile thomas son had married lazar s daughter and taken possession of smederevo thomas boasted about his son being made despot but arrangement was cut short by arrival of mehmed at head of a vast force before walls of smederevo terrified thomas son and brother agreed to surrender town and fortress on 20 june in exchange for safe conduct thomas and radivoj were bitterly reproached by hungarian king matthias told all europe that thomas had sold fortress of paramount importance to enemy thomas took great pains to clear his name explaining to pope pius ii that smederevo could not have been defended king sent a delegation to council of mantua in july promising to do his best to hold turks back and begging for help only ruler to provide assistance to thomas was bianca maria visconti duchess of milan who sent 300 men via ancona religious persecution unlike in other balkan states of time politics of bosnia were not dominated by religion and its rulers as well as common people were entirely indifferent to religious beliefs of others however this changed in 1459 when ottoman threat became greater pope pius ii informed thomas that he would not come to his aid as long as bosnian church was tolerated thomas was anxious to appear as a good catholic in wake of hungarian accusations of betraying christendom decision thomas took in 1459 made him first bosnian ruler to persecute people for their religious beliefs a policy popes had long demanded by holy see bosnian church had been decimated by catholic and then even orthodox proselytization and its own low morale thomas order that its clergy either convert or leave his domain was followed by confiscation of their considerable property which probably helped him make otherwise difficult decision persecution lasted almost two years 12 000 people were forcefully converted while forty members of clergy fled to his father in law s domain in 1461 he sent three men accused of heresy to be questioned by cardinal juan de in rome bosnian church was thus all but annihilated by king thomas persecution did little to restore thomas reputation in catholic europe when possession of formerly talovac held castle caused another feud with his father in law in 1459 kosaca accused him of having invited turks who plundered his land accusation reached pope pius who ordered that king be excommunicated if such a grave offense against christian interests were proven though thomas probably did invite turkish raiders excommunication never took place last years thumb left restored chapel among ruins of bobovac fall of serbia meant that eastern border of thomas realm was now bulwark of christendom however bosnia was not mehmed s priority thomas was forced to surrender northeastern bosnia namely usora srebrenica zvornik and teocak in early 1460 allowing turks to cross sava to hungarian regions of slavonia and syrmia both thomas and his father in law were aware that ottoman conquest of bosnia was inevitable they continued to seek foreign assistance but were also preparing for a life in exile however this prospect did not help them settle their differences and put up a more effective defence thomas still estranged from his in laws fell ill in june 1461 and requested a physician from ragusa he died in july aged around 50 he was buried in royal mausoleum in bobovac circumstances of his death are unclear rumours circulated first recorded by a gunsmith from nuremberg that king s death was not natural specifically it was said that his brother radivoj and son stephen had conspired against him later narratives also involved mehmed and matthias in plot with hungarian king as mastermind these rumours are generally dismissed by historians stephen succeeded him to benefit of doomed kingdom as ruptures between monarch and his nobles were finally healed personality and legacy thumb 1910 depiction of king thomas thomas was a man of many contradictions his good looks and noble comportment greatly impressed his contemporaries italian condottiero broglio da son of angelo tartaglia whom he met in 1452 wrote that he had never met a prince more refined and dignified surpassing even intellectual humanist federico da montefeltro broglio s idol at same time thomas inconstancy and lack of courage inspired disdain he was capable of both great generosity and pettiness fickleness damaged his reputation abroad while religious persecution and forced conversions caused disapproval at home he was cursed in early years of ottoman rule for robbing indigenous bosnian church of its property thomas union with vojaca produced at least four children stephen who succeeded him a son who died as a child during a pilgrimage to meleda a daughter who married a hungarian nobleman in 1451 and another daughter who married in 1451 with catherine who outlived both him and his kingdom thomas had a son named sigismund in 1449 and a daughter named catherine in 1453 family tree notes references bibliography category bosnian monarchs category 15th
