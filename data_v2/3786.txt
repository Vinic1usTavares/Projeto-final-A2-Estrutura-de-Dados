fossa or cryptoprocta ferox is a cat like carnivorous mammal endemic to madagascar it is a member of eupleridae a family of carnivorans closely related to mongoose family herpestidae its classification has been controversial because its physical traits resemble those of cats yet other traits suggest a close relationship with viverrids most civets and their relatives its classification along with that of other malagasy carnivores influenced hypotheses about how many times mammalian carnivores have colonized madagascar with genetic studies demonstrating that fossa and all other malagasy carnivores are most closely related to each other forming a clade recognized as family eupleridae carnivorans are now thought to have colonized island once around 18 to 20 million years ago fossa is largest mammalian carnivore on island of madagascar and has been compared to a small cougar adults have a head body length of and weigh between with males larger than females it has semi retractable claws meaning it can extend but not retract its claws fully and flexible ankles that allow it to climb up and down trees head first and also support jumping from tree to tree fossa is unique within its family for shape of its genitalia which share traits with those of cats and hyenas species is widespread although population densities are usually low it is found solely in forested habitat and actively hunts both by day and night over 50 of its diet consists of lemurs endemic primates found on island tenrecs rodents lizards birds and other animals are also documented as prey mating usually occurs in trees on horizontal limbs and can last for several hours litters range from one to six pups which are born blind and toothless altricial infants wean after 4 5 months and are independent after a year sexual maturity occurs around three to four years of age and life expectancy in captivity is 20 years fossa is listed as a vulnerable species by international union for conservation of nature it is generally feared by malagasy people and is often protected by their fady taboo greatest threat to species is habitat destruction etymology generic name cryptoprocta refers to how animal s anus is hidden by its anal pouch from ancient greek words crypto hidden and anus species name ferox is latin adjective fierce or wild its common name is spelled fossa in english or fosa in malagasy austronesian language from which it was taken but some authors have adopted malagasy spelling in english word is similar to posa meaning cat in iban language another austronesian language from borneo and both terms may derive from trade languages from 1600s however an alternative etymology suggests a link to another word that comes from malay pusa refers to malayan weasel mustela nudipes malay word pusa could have become posa for cats in borneo while in madagascar word could have become fosa to refer to fossa taxonomy fossa was formally described by edward turner bennett on basis of a specimen from madagascar sent by charles telfair in 1833 common name is same as generic name of malagasy civet fossa but they are different species because of shared physical traits with civets mongooses and cats felidae its classification has been controversial bennett originally placed fossa as a type of civet in family viverridae a classification that long remained popular among taxonomists its compact braincase large eye sockets retractable claws and specialized carnivorous dentition have also led some taxonomists to associate it with felids in 1939 william king gregory and milo hellman placed fossa in its own subfamily within felidae george gaylord simpson placed it back in viverridae in 1945 still within its own subfamily yet conceded it had many cat like characteristics thumb upright left fossa has a cat like appearance resembling a small cougar in 1993 geraldine veron and francois published a dna hybridization study suggesting that fossa was more closely related to mongooses family herpestidae than to cats or civets however in 1995 veron s morphological study once again grouped it with felidae in 2003 molecular phylogenetic studies using nuclear and mitochondrial genes by anne yoder and colleagues showed that all native malagasy carnivorans share a common ancestry that excludes other carnivores meaning they form a clade making them monophyletic and are most closely related to asian and african herpestidae to reflect these relationships all malagasy carnivorans are now placed in a single family eupleridae within eupleridae fossa is placed in subfamily along with falanouc and malagasy civet but its exact relationships are poorly resolved an extinct relative of fossa was described in 1902 from subfossil remains and recognized as a separate species cryptoprocta spelea in 1935 this species was larger than living fossa with a body mass estimate roughly twice as great but otherwise similar across madagascar people distinguish two kinds of fossa a large fosa mainty black fossa and smaller fosa mena reddish fossa and a white form has been reported in southwest it is unclear whether this is purely folklore or individual variation related to sex age or instances of melanism and or whether there is indeed more than one species of living fossa description fossa appears as a diminutive form of a large felid such as a cougar but with a slender body and muscular limbs and a tail nearly as long as rest of body it has a mongoose like head relatively longer than that of a cat although with a muzzle that is broad and short and with large but rounded ears it has medium brown eyes set relatively wide apart with pupils that contract to slits like many carnivorans that hunt at night its eyes reflect light reflected light is orange in hue its head body length is and its tail is long there is some sexual dimorphism with adult males weighing being larger than females smaller individuals are typically found north and east on madagascar larger ones to south and west unusually large individuals weighing up to have been reported but there is some doubt as to reliability of measurements fossa can smell hear and see well it is a robust animal and illnesses are rare in captive fossas thumb right upright cranium dorsal ventral and lateral views and mandible lateral and dorsal views both males and females have short straight fur that is relatively dense and without spots or patterns both sexes are generally a reddish brown dorsally and colored a dirty cream ventrally when in rut they may have an orange coloration to their abdomen from a reddish substance secreted by a chest gland but this has not been consistently observed by all researchers tail tends to be lighter in coloration than sides juveniles are either gray or nearly white several of animal s physical features are adaptions to climbing through trees it uses its tail to assist balance and has semi retractable claws that it uses to climb trees in its search for prey it has semiplantigrade feet switching between a plantigrade like gait when arboreal and a digitigrade like one when terrestrial soles of its paws are nearly bare and covered with strong pads fossa has very flexible ankles that allow it to readily grasp tree trunks so as to climb up or down trees head first or to leap to another tree captive juveniles have been known to swing upside down by their hindfeet from knotted ropes fossa has several scent glands although glands are less developed in females like herpestids it has a skin gland inside an anal sac which surrounds anus like a pocket pocket opens to exterior with a horizontal slit below tail other glands are located near penis or vagina with penile glands emitting a strong odor like herpestids it has no glands external genitalia thumb 100px external genitalia of cryptoprocta ferox one of more peculiar physical features of this species is its external genitalia male fossa has an unusually long penis and baculum penis bone reaching to between his forelegs when erect with an average thickness of glans extends about halfway down shaft and is spiny except at tip in comparison glans of felids is short and spiny while that of viverrids is smooth and long female fossa exhibits transient masculinization starting at about 1 2 years of age developing an enlarged spiny clitoris that resembles a male s penis enlarged clitoris is supported by an os which decreases in size as animal grows females do not have a pseudo scrotum but they do secrete an orange substance that colors their underparts much like secretions of males hormone levels testosterone androstenedione dihydrotestosterone do not seem to play a part in this transient masculinization as those levels are same in masculinized juveniles and non masculinized adults it is speculated that transient masculinization either reduces sexual harassment of juvenile females by adult males or reduces aggression from territorial females while females of other mammal species such as spotted hyena have a pseudo penis no other is known to diminish in size as animal grows comparison with related carnivorans overall fossa has features in common with three different carnivoran families leading researchers to place it and other members of eupleridae alternatively in herpestidae viverridae and felidae felid features are primarily those associated with eating and digestion including tooth shape and facial portions of skull tongue and digestive tract typical of its exclusively carnivorous diet remainder of skull most closely resembles skulls of genus while general body structure is most similar to that of various members of herpestidae permanent dentition is three incisors one canine three or four premolars and one molar on each side of both upper and lower jaws with deciduous formula being similar but lacking fourth premolar and molar fossa has a large prominent rhinarium similar to that of viverrids but has comparatively larger round ears almost as large as those of a similarly sized felid its facial vibrissae whiskers are long with longest being longer than its head like some mongoose genera particularly which is now in fossa s own family eupleridae and of herpestidae it has carpal vibrissae as well its claws are retractile but unlike those of felidae species they are not hidden in skin sheaths it has three pairs of nipples one inguinal one ventral and one pectoral habitat and distribution fossa has most widespread geographical range of malagasy carnivores and is generally found in low numbers throughout island in remaining tracts of forest preferring pristine undisturbed forest habitat it is also encountered in some degraded forests but in lower numbers although fossa is found in all known forest habitats throughout madagascar including western dry deciduous forests eastern rainforests and southern spiny forests it is seen more frequently in humid than in dry forests this may be because reduced canopy in dry forests provides less shade and also because fossa seems to travel more easily in humid forests it is absent from areas with heaviest habitat disturbance and like most of madagascar s fauna from central high plateau of country fossa has been found across several different elevational gradients in undisturbed portions of protected areas throughout madagascar in reserve naturelle d andringitra evidence of fossa has been reported at four different sites ranging from its highest known occurrence was reported at its presence high on andringitra massif was subsequently confirmed in 1996 similarly evidence has been reported of fossa at elevational extremes of and in andohahela national park presence of fossa at these locations indicates its ability to adapt to various elevations consistent with its reported distribution in all madagascar forest types behavior thumb right fossa are active both day and night cathemeral fossa is active during both day and night and is considered cathemeral activity peaks may occur early in morning late in afternoon and late in night animal generally does not reuse sleeping sites but females with young do return to same den home ranges of male fossas in kirindy forest are up to large compared to for females these ranges overlap by about 30 percent according to data from eastern forests but females usually have separated ranges home ranges grow during dry season perhaps because less food and water is available in general radio collared fossas travel between per day although in one reported case a fossa was observed moving a straight line distance of in 16 hours animal s population density appears to be low in kirindy forest where it is thought to be common its density has been estimated at one animal per in 1998 another study in same forest between 1994 and 1996 using mark and recapture method indicated a population density of one animal per and one adult per except for mothers with young and occasional observations of pairs of males animals are usually found alone so that species is considered solitary a 2009 publication however reported a detailed observation of cooperative hunting wherein three male fossas hunted a propithecus for 45 minutes and subsequently shared prey this behavior may be a vestige of cooperative hunting that would have been required to take down larger recently extinct lemurs fossas communicate using sounds scents and visual signals vocalizations include purring a threatening call and a call of fear consisting of repeated loud coarse and gasps of breath a long high yelp may function to attract other fossas females mew during mating and males produce a sigh when they have found a female throughout year animals produce long lasting scent marks on rocks trees and ground using glands in anal region and on chest they also communicate using face and body expression but significance of these signals is uncertain animal is aggressive only during mating and males in particular fight boldly after a short fight loser flees and is followed by winner for a short distance in captivity fossas are usually not aggressive and sometimes even allow themselves to be stroked by a zookeeper but adult males in particular may try to bite diet fossa is a carnivore that hunts small to medium sized animals one of eight carnivorous species endemic to madagascar fossa is island s largest surviving endemic terrestrial mammal and only predator capable of preying upon adults of all extant lemur species largest of which can weigh as much as 90 percent of weight of average fossa although it is predominant predator of lemurs reports of its dietary habits demonstrate a wide variety of prey selectivity and specialization depending on habitat and season diet does not vary by sex while fossa is thought to be a lemur specialist in ranomafana national park its diet is more variable in other rain forest habitats diet of fossa in wild has been studied by analyzing their distinctive scats which resemble gray cylinders with twisted ends and measure long by thick scat collected and analyzed from both andohahela and andringitra contained lemur matter and rodents eastern populations in andringitra incorporate widest recorded variety of prey including both vertebrates and invertebrates vertebrates consumed ranged from reptiles to a wide variety of birds including both understory and ground birds and mammals including insectivores rodents and lemurs invertebrates eaten by fossa in high mountain zone of andringitra include insects and crabs one study found that vertebrates comprised 94 of diet of fossas with lemurs comprising over 50 followed by tenrecs 9 lizards 9 and birds 2 seeds which comprised 5 of diet may have been in stomachs of lemurs eaten or may have been consumed with fruit taken for water as seeds were more common in stomach in dry season average prey size varies geographically it is only in high mountains of andringitra in contrast to in humid forests and over in dry deciduous forests in a study of fossa diet in dry deciduous forest of western madagascar more than 90 of prey items were vertebrates and more than 50 were lemurs primary diet consisted of approximately six lemur species and two or three spiny species along with snakes and small mammals generally fossa preys upon larger lemurs and rodents in preference to smaller ones prey is obtained by hunting either on ground or in trees during non breeding season fossa hunts individually but during breeding season hunting parties may be seen and these may be pairs or later on mothers and young one member of group scales a tree and chases lemurs from tree to tree forcing them down to ground where other is easily able to capture them fossa is known to eviscerate its larger lemur prey a trait that along with its distinct scat helps identify its kills long term observations of fossa s predation patterns on rainforest sifakas suggest that fossa hunts in a subsection of their range until prey density is decreased then moves on fossa has been reported to prey on domestic animals such as goats and small calves and especially chickens food taken in captivity includes amphibians birds insects reptiles and small to medium sized mammals this wide variety of prey items taken in various rainforest habitats is similar to varied dietary composition noted occurring in dry forests of western madagascar as well as largest endemic predator on madagascar this dietary flexibility combined with a flexible activity pattern has allowed it to exploit a wide variety of niches available throughout island making it a potential keystone species for madagascar ecosystems breeding thumb 250px fossa illustration circa 1927 fossas have a polyandrous mating system most of details of reproduction in wild populations are from western dry deciduous forests determining whether certain of these details are applicable to eastern populations will require further field research mating typically occurs during september and october although there are reports of its occurring as late as december and can be highly conspicuous in captivity in northern hemisphere fossas instead mate in northern spring from march to july usually occurs in trees on horizontal limbs about off ground frequently same tree is used year after year with remarkable precision as to date season commences trees are often near a water source and have limbs strong enough and wide enough to support mating pair about wide some mating has been reported on ground as well as many as eight males will be at a mating site staying in close vicinity to receptive female female seems to choose male she mates with and males compete for attention of female with a significant amount of vocalization and antagonistic interactions female may choose to mate with several of males and her choice of mate does not seem to have any correlation to physical appearance of males to stimulate male to mount her she gives a series of mewling vocalizations male mounts from behind resting his body on her slightly off center a position requiring delicate balance if female were to stand male would have significant difficulty continuing he places his paws on her shoulders or grasps her around waist and often licks her neck mating may last for nearly three hours this unusually lengthy mating is due to physical nature of male s erect penis which has backwards pointing spines along most of its length fossa mating includes a copulatory tie which may be enforced by male s spiny penis tie is difficult to break if mating session is interrupted copulation with a single male may be repeated several times with a total mating time of up to fourteen hours while male may remain with female for up to an hour after mating a single female may occupy tree for up to a week mating with multiple males over that time also other females may take her place mating with some of same males as well as others this mating strategy whereby females monopolize a site and maximize available number of mates seems to be unique among carnivores recent research suggests that this system helps fossa overcome factors which would normally impede mate finding such as low population density and lack of den use birthing of litter of one to six typically two to four takes place in a concealed location such as an underground den a termite mound a rock crevice or in hollow of a large tree particularly those of genus commiphora contrary to older research litters are of mixed sexes young are born in december or january making gestation period 90 days with late mating reports indicating a gestational period of about six to seven weeks newborns are blind and toothless and weigh no more than fur is thin and has been described as gray brown or nearly white after about two weeks cubs eyes open they become more active and their fur darkens to a pearl gray cubs do not take solid food until three months old and do not leave den until they are 4 5 months old they are weaned shortly after that after first year juveniles are independent of their mother permanent teeth appear at 18 to 20 months physical maturity is reached by about two years of age but sexual maturity is not attained for another year or two and young may stay with their mother until they are fully mature lifespan in captivity is up to or past 20 years of age possibly due to slow juvenile development human interactions fossa has been assessed as vulnerable by iucn red list since 2008 as its population size has probably declined by at least 30 percent between 1987 and 2008 previous assessments have included endangered 2000 and insufficiently known 1988 1990 1994 species is dependent on forest and thus threatened by widespread destruction of madagascar s native forest but is also able to persist in disturbed areas a suite of microsatellite markers short segments of dna that have a repeated sequence have been developed to help aid in studies of genetic health and population dynamics of both captive and wild fossas several pathogens have been isolated from fossa some of which such as anthrax and canine distemper are thought to have been transmitted by feral dogs or cats toxoplasma gondii was reported in a captive fossa in 2013 although species is widely distributed it is locally rare in all regions making fossas particularly vulnerable to extinction effects of habitat fragmentation increase risk for its size fossa has a lower than predicted population density which is further threatened by madagascar s rapidly disappearing forests and dwindling populations of lemurs which make up a high proportion of its diet loss of fossa either locally or completely could significantly impact ecosystem dynamics possibly leading to over grazing by some of its prey species total population of fossa living within protected areas is estimated at less than 2 500 adults but this may be an overestimate only two protected areas are thought to contain 500 or more adult fossas masoala national park and sud national park although these are also thought to be overestimated too little population information has been collected for a formal population viability analysis but estimates suggest that none of protected areas support a viable population if this is correct extinction of fossa may take as much as 100 years to occur as species gradually declines in order for species to survive it is estimated that at least is needed to maintain smaller short term viable populations and at least for populations of 500 adults taboo known in madagascar as fady offers protection for fossa and other carnivores in marolambo district part of atsinanana region in toamasina province fossa has traditionally been hated and feared as a dangerous animal it has been described as greedy and aggressive known for taking fowl and piglets and believed to take little children who walk alone into forest some do not eat it for fear that it will transfer its undesirable qualities to anyone who consumes it however animal is also taken for bushmeat a study published in 2009 reported that 57 percent of villages 8 of 14 sampled in makira forest consume fossa meat animals were typically hunted using slingshots with dogs or most commonly by placing snare traps on animal paths near ranomafana national park fossa along with several of its smaller cousins and introduced small indian civet indica are known to scavenge on bodies of ancestors which are buried in shallow graves in forest for this reason eating these animals is strictly prohibited by fady however if they wander into villages in search of domestic fowl they may be killed or trapped small carnivore traps have been observed near chicken runs in village of fossas are occasionally held in captivity in zoos they first bred in captivity in 1974 in zoo of montpellier france next year at a time when there were only eight fossas in world s zoos duisburg zoo in germany acquired one this zoo later started a successful breeding program and most zoo fossas now descend from duisburg population research on duisburg fossas has provided much data about their biology fossa was depicted as an antagonist in dreamworks 2005 animated film madagascar accurately shown as lemurs most feared predator references citations books
