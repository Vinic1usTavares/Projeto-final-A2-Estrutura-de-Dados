english except for some french verses in vanilla chocolat and a couple of lines of spanish in we wanna none are in stan s native romanian though hitfire suggested that her accent is strong enough that thanks for leaving a ballad written in aftermath of stan s violent breakup with prodan would have sounded better in romanian songs are a mixture of dance techno pop and r b with influences varying from j pop cherry pop and bhangra kiss me goodbye to house dance a saxophone sound similar to that on mr saxobeat 2011 is used on dance an everything express reviewer felt that stan was either influenced by or deliberately imitating music of britney spears rihanna and sia identifying in particular happy and little lies a cover of fleetwood mac s 1987 single of same name as sounding like material from spears catalog songs on album touch on themes such as freedom and new beginnings several reviews found music danceable but criticized songs for lacking originality hitfire described vanilla chocolat as catchy but found lyrics meaningless and track unremarkable pure charts described we wanna as nothing new and another hitfire editor felt that dance while better than earlier singles from unlocked was unoriginal thanks for leaving drew some positive comments and was described as a grown up breakup ballad and a nice pop ballad not too dramatic everything express thought that cherry pop had a weak chorus and poor quality backing track reviewer also felt celebrate was ruined by backing vocals and dance had weak lyrics they were more positive about give me your everything which reminds us she can actually sing and described set me free as a mid tempo power ballad possibly best song on album but recommended skipping remixes on deluxe edition of unlocked rnb junk s review was more favorable describing album as a major evolution in stan s style beyond straightforward dance songs and recommending thanks for leaving unlocked set me free and give me your
