position for qualification race first qualifying session had norris at top of time sheets with a lap of two minutes and 11 570 seconds after he improved on his own personal best he was fastest in circuit s mountain section but admitted to press majority of his advantage was created by installing new rear tyres at his pit stop after struggling to find a decent car balance norris was nine tenths of a second faster than second placed pedro piquet after he fitted new tyres to his vehicle gunther was second but fell to third in spite of improving his fastest lap time on worn tyres ticktum ended up provisionally fourth and was narrowly in front of teammate eriksson in fifth finished sixth with fenestraz best placed rookie in seventh and he was followed closely in time sheets by sette camara

and hit wall final stoppage came when aron went into wall at moorish hill turn in second qualifying session first red flag came out when daruvala crashed at solitude esses complex shortly after sette camara crashed for a second time at fisherman s bend and this prompted second stoppage of session ticktum was early pace setter before norris returned to top of time sheets on a new set of tyres by being first driver to go into two minutes and 10 seconds range more than halfway through eriksson fitted four new tyres to his car and found a gap between traffic to better norris s time with a lap of two minutes and 10 720 seconds with five minutes left zhou hit wall and came to a stop with heavy damage to his vehicle causing session s third stoppage norris and eriksson elected not to venture onto

hindered by slower traffic and oversteer and settled for third having been eighth beforehand gunther dropped one position from his provisional grid slot to start from fourth habsburg damaged his suspension after hitting wall but limped back to pit lane fell to fifth due to ilott improving his position and him choosing not to venture onto track at restart ticktum was bulked by slow moving habsburg but his earlier effort placed him sixth with schumacher best placed rookie in seventh top ten was completed by sekiguchi sette camara and zhou behind them rest of field lined up as fenestraz makino piquet defrancesco sato yamashita aron tsuboi daravala miyata and palou qualification race qualifying race to set grid order for main race started at 10 20 macau standard time utc 08 00 on 18 november on grid in dry but cloudy weather conditions eriksson maintained his startline advantage heading into first turn norris was slow off line and ilott moved past him for second place gunther followed suit and overtook slow moving norris for third position at end of first lap eriksson led ilott by 1 127 seconds sette camara passed habsburg to take fourth heading towards lisboa corner on lap two he then slipstreamed onto back of gunther and overtook him for third place on next lap habsburg lost a further position to ticktum on same lap and fell behind schumacher who overtook him under braking for lisboa on fourth lap schumacher locked his tyres driving towards lisboa corner as he attempted to overtake habsburg for sixth and ran onto turn s escape to enable his continuation in event gap between leading two competitors remained stable over next three laps until ilott drew closer to eriksson and got onto latter s slipstream by end of fifth lap ilott immediately attempted to execute an overtake on eriksson around outside of lisboa corner but was unable to pass him ilott remained close behind eriksson on following lap and elected to stay back until he exited mandarin bend kink before attempting a pass on eriksson who had worn tyres this enabled eriksson to cover inside line and keep first place when duo drew alongside each other under braking for lisboa corner ilott had a large amount of momentum on eriksson that at start of lap seven he passed eriksson around inside at mandarin bend kink for lead after he was overtaken by ilott eriksson immediately came under pressure from his teammate sette camara norris fell to ninth after his slow getaway and overtook ticktum to move back into top five on lap seven but then slowed without warning and fell down order ilott opened up an advantage of nearly eight seconds and crossed start finish line after ten laps to win qualification race and pole position for grand prix itself he was joined on front row of grid by eriksson who fended off consecutive overtaking attempts from sette camara behind trio gunther followed with habsburg in fifth piquet norris and ticktum were in close formation for positions six to eight and sekiguchi and zhou were similarly close to round out top ten yamashita fenestraz aron japanese duo of sato and tsuboi daruvala makino palou miyata schumacher and defrancesco delayed by an unnoticed incident completed twenty one classified finishers main race race started at 15 30 local time on 19 november weather conditions were cloudy and dry although some rain had fallen earlier in day eriksson made a brisk getaway off grid and clung onto slipstream of pole position starter ilott heading towards lisboa corner and moved into first place competitive racing was temporarily suspended with a full course yellow flag on second lap after sato crashed at kink going into entry for fisherman s bend as field were travelling down straight heading towards lisboa corner green flags were waved to signal to drivers that racing resumed this appeared to catch out race leaders ilott and eriksson with ilott steering into corner earlier than anticipated and made contact with front left suspension on eriksson s car eriksson reached turn in first position but damage to his car meant he retired from grand prix after he stopped before tyre barrier at san francisco hill a few hundred metres later incident allowed sette camara into lead with gunther moving into second and carlin pairing of habsburg and norris inherited third and fourth places eriksson s stranded car necessitated a second full course yellow flag which was later converted to a safety car because he was deemed to be in a dangerous position ilott made a pit stop for repairs to his car under safety car while schumacher had gearbox issues that needed tending to race restarted on seventh lap with sette camara ahead of gunther habsburg norris and ticktum gunther could not get back up to speed and this allowed sette camara to establish a healthy lead and former came under attack from habsburg defrancesco was another retiree when he went into barriers at lisboa corner after he completed ten laps on eleventh lap habsburg used slipstream of gunther and braking area at lisboa turn to overtake him for second position he set about reducing sette camara s two second advantage over rest of field meanwhile ticktum pressured norris ticktum took advantage of a four wide battle of norris gunther and aron driving towards lisboa corner for third place on grand prix s 14th and penultimate lap and executed a successful overtaking manoeuvre by using slipstream to move into third place as leading two started race s final lap habsburg drew close to sette camara going into mandarin corner habsburg s higher straight line speed allowed him to attempt a pass to left of sette camara heading into lisboa corner despite drawing alongside sette camara he did not take lead at turn s braking zone as latter held onto position by using inside line as two cars slid in mountain complex habsburg could not take lead due to a lack of on track space habsburg however got a fast exit leaving track s penultimate turn and used momentum on straight linking melco and fisherman s bend corners to challenge sette camara habsburg passed sette camara around outside for lead but in an attempt to brake later than each other both drivers braked too late for corner drove onto some dust and understeered into barriers on left of fisherman s bend habsburg ricocheted off wall and managed to limp to line whilst sette camara was left stranded in tyre wall thus in his third formula three race ticktum inherited lead and swerved to avoid hitting debris to win grand prix norris finished half a second adrift in second and aron completed podium in third having moved up ten from his starting position off podium habsburg limped his car which had its left front suspension deranged to fourth ahead of gunther in fifth piquet took sixth place ahead of fenestraz and zhou top ten was rounded out by makino and daravala outside top ten palou finished eleventh having moved up seven from his starting position in front of miyata and stricken sette camara tsuboi ilott and schumacher were last of classified finishers post race top three drivers appeared on podium to collect their trophies and spoke to media in a later press conference ticktum spoke of an pretty unlucky weekend for himself before sunday race and admitted that his victory was serendipitous owing to sette camara and habsburg crash on final lap i was due a bit of luck with what happened at final corner but there are no words to describe what it was like coming across line he thanked red bull motorsport adviser helmut marko for signing him and said he sought to improve himself i think if you are a second year driver in red bull programme then helmut has established that you are bloody fast unless something else has gone wrong with team and he cannot quite gauge what driver is doing though norris congratulated ticktum for his victory he spoke of his disappointment over not winning but expressed a desire for a macau return in 2018 and sought an improvement in his tyre s life span i came to macau to win and in some ways i didn t prepare for it as much as i should have done and maybe i could have done because i was focusing on other things third placed aron said of his achievement it could be said that it was a happy one too but that s macau macau s always race that everyone wants to win and it often ends with silly maneuvers i finally got third place probably a tenth but it was time for luck to finally end up on my side habsburg spoke of his pride about his weekend and stated that he was 100 percent unwilling to finish second as he attempted to put off sette camara on final lap i was crying when i crashed because i knew i d lost it and i was wiping my tears away but i don t think you can say you ve lost it when you ve thrown everything into winning it at final corner move was either win or crash and for me it was crash sette camara revealed he lost aerodynamic grip shortly before his crash it hurts a lot it is not easy but it s a world cup it s not a championship either you win or you lose i do not have to get upset about it eriksson apportioned blame for his crash on ilott who received a ten second penalty from stewards which could not be applied since he retired whom he felt was overaggressive callum crashed into me he thought he was already past me and he was not it was his mistake and we both had to pay price for it ilott stated his belief that he was unworthy of being penalised because his car s onboard footage was not made available to stewards and it reportedly showed eriksson steering left he argued that he provided eriksson with enough room and stated his belief that he was past latter before collision classification qualifying driver team 1 15 motopark 2 13 637
