production thumb right producer ira steven behr wanted a holodeck episode for deep space nine that was different from any seen on next generation story editor rene echevarria was keen not to have a damaged holodeck story appear as he felt it had been overdone in star trek next generation it was specified in information sheet sent to freelance writers that deep space nine was not accepting stories involving malfunctioning producer ira steven behr explained that show had been looking for a unique holodeck story that would be specifically for deep space nine rather than sherlock holmes and dixon hill detective stories seen in next generation whilst bashir and o brien s adventures in holosuites in battle of britain and battle of clontarf have been mentioned in episodes they were simply too expensive to be shown on screen effectively but behr felt that story for our man bashir was within budget of show erdmann block 2000 p 294 story was initially pitched to echevarria by robert gillan who was on staff of deep space nine as assistant script coordinator echevarria was immediately convinced and told behr about story who was equally as enthusiastic in gillan s original pitch there wasn t a specific setting clearly set out but behr and echevarria were sold on idea that nothing went wrong with holosuites it was simply where computer decided to store information following a transporter accident producer ronald d moore came up with 1960s setting as he felt it was appropriate since garak was a spy for cardassian obsidian order he wrote teleplay and based it on a variety of sources including james bond our man flint man from u n c l e and wild wild west he later explained that he loved all of them as a kid they had a certain panache i loved writing that episode erdmann block 2000 p 295 thumb left upright julian bashir played by alexander siddig was central character in this episode some of elements were suggested by other staff members with robert wolfe naming colonel anastasia komananov and behr changing suzie luvsitt to mona luvsitt metro goldwyn mayer was later not pleased with james bond style approach and when bashir s spy program appeared in later episode a simple investigation references were more generic dennis madalone managed to save some time during production as one of shots involved bashir seeing falcon approach him from behind by seeing his reflection in a bottle of champagne after time was already scheduled to attempt shot madalone explained to director that he could take filmed sequence and digitally manipulate it onto bottle madalone was also responsible for firing a cork from a bottle at colm meaney s head from off screen to make it appear as if bashir did it and managed to do it on first take our man bashir was longest shoot of any single episode of deep space nine taking nine days to film instead of normal seven episode required a great deal of stunt work and special equipment such as stuntmen going through tempered glass instead of sugar glass because of better glass breaking effect there was a great deal of new sets used as well which each took longer to set up camera and lighting for as crew were not as familiar with them as standing sets backdrop used for mount everest was rented but crew realised it lacked snow so they had to modify it and then return it to original condition afterwards majority of 1960s style technologies such as dr noah s base were all custom built in house and where parts moved they were generally manually operated off screen art director herman zimmerman said that everything that could be manually operated was because brain is still smarter than most computers and you can still do some things faster by hand erdmann block 2000 p 296 reception our man bashir was
