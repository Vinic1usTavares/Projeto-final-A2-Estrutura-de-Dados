history in arizona us 70 has had two different routings in its history despite being one of original u s highways designated in 1926 us 70 only ran along its current alignment since 1935 earlier in highway s history us 70 was designated further north than it is now and served a small area of northeastern arizona globe new mexico route was previously numbered as us 180 both alignments of us 70 also have preceding highways and trails that date back to 19th century after multiple reroutings and redesignations us 70 and us 180 designations have essentially switched routes u s route 180 1926 1935 u s route 180 us 180 was original u s highway designation between globe and new mexico state border near virden being one of original u s highways established in 1926 it was first child route of us 80 to be designated route was originally designated in 1909 when arizona territorial legislature established a territorial road system under management of territorial engineer yuma duncan territorial road ran between yuma in west and new mexico territorial line near duncan despite being a territorial designated road improvements to two existing territorial roads was slow due to low funding no improvements were made to yuma duncan road between 1909 and 1912 with all funding going towards grand canyon duncan territorial road between grand canyon area and douglas in 1912 arizona territory was granted statehood which changed organization of territorial road system into new state highway system yuma duncan route became part of transcontinental southern national highway auto trail in 1913 in 1914 arizona s highway system was further reorganized into a better funded and organized network of early state highways yuma duncan route between globe and new mexico was added to newly designated roosevelt dam highway rest of new route ran from mesa to globe via apache trail now sr 88 in 1919 roosevelt dam highway became a northern branch of lee highway auto trail due to popularity of lee highway state designated roosevelt dam name became largely forgotten by traveling public between 1917 and 1921 route from solomonsville to geronimo was paved it along with borderland highway between bisbee and douglas became first two paved state highways in arizona with a second reorganization of state highway system in 1921 due in part to newly available federal funding eastern section of roosevelt dam highway was redesignated by state to become part phoenix globe rice highway and entirety of rice safford duncan highway by this point a previously existing more direct route between san jose and duncan had been added as a branch of rice safford duncan highway in 1924 funding allocated by federal aid project no 15 allowed state to improve conditions of phoenix globe rice highway between globe and geronimo both phoenix globe rice highway and rice safford duncan highway were designated as new us 180 on november 11 1926 with establishment of arizona s own highway numbering system on september 9 1927 us 180 designation was officially recognized by state highway department and earlier state designations were dropped thumb left a postcard of us 70 originally us 180 going across top of coolidge dam at first us 180 was a mostly unpaved highway save for aforementioned section between geronimo and solomonsville entire route was at least graded with most of it being of an improved surface other than true pavement a new section of us 180 was also under construction to bypass route between cutter and rice now san carlos new route would go over coolidge dam around new san carlos reservoir construction of dam itself was approved by united states congress on june 7 1924 purpose of dam was to help solve water issues plaguing apache people living within san carlos indian reservation heavy irrigation of gila river for farming upstream had greatly decreased amount of water available in river to apache nation construction of coolidge dam was started in january 1927 and completed in october 1928 water retaining began on november 15 1928 and was placed under management of san carlos project a division of bureau of indian affairs bia at first construction of dam faced massive opposition from apache nation as a tribal burial ground was within area of proposed reservoir exhumation of any human remains was out of question as apache people considered it desecration bia therefore constructed a concrete slab over burial ground allowing bia and apache nation to reach a compromise by 1929 us 180 had been re routed onto new alignment over coolidge dam section of former us 180 between rice and a point northwest of geronimo was abandoned from state highway system sr 73 which had previously ended at us 180 in rice was extended west over former us 180 to end at new highway in cutter due to limited state funding new alignment wasn t paved but was instead oiled down to provide some stability and rigidity approximately was oiled between globe and safford at a cost of 88 904 a large amount of oiling and construction cost was reimbursed by federal government us 180 was paved from globe to pinal county line near coolidge dam by 1930 besides already paved segment of highway near safford rest of highway was surfaced with a lesser improved material save for a section between duncan and new mexico border which wasn t surfaced but was at least graded several sections of us 180 were graded and improved with oil surfacing in 1931 under five separate labor projects in both gila county and graham county most of this work was done between coolidge dam area and geronimo costing over 100 000 total amount of road reconstructed was at least in length later in 1931 us 180 was fully paved between gila pinal county line to calva to an area west of geronimo when us 60 was extended west to california through arizona same year both highways shared a concurrency between globe and us 180 s western terminus in florence junction since us 60 wasn t completed between globe and springerville yet us 180 was concurrent with us 60t temporary route of us 60 between globe and cutter us 60t then followed sr 73 northeast from cutter to springerville paving from solomonville to new mexico state line was completed in 1932 by november 20 1932 over of us 180 was surfaced with either pavement or an oiled surface by 1934 entirety of us 180 between globe and new mexico was now paved new mexico had also paved part of its section of us 180 between arizona border and lordsburg in october 1934 two bridges were widened on us 180 near solomonville and two new bridges on highway were also constructed redesignation to u s route 70 us 70 was originally designated in arizona on november 11 1926 route started at us 66 in holbrook and ran south to concho then east to st johns where highway turned south again to springerville then due east into new mexico to clovis and eventually its eastern terminus in beaufort north carolina prior to 1926 arizona portion of us 70 had been a section of beale s wagon road and national old trails road on june 8 1931 us 70 between holbrook and clovis was replaced by us 60 and a newly designated us 260 us 70 was given a new routing between clovis and el paso texas via alamogordo new mexico us 70 continued to end in el paso until june 17 1935 when highway was re routed over us 180 retiring latter route nationally us 70 was re routed west of hondo new mexico through carrizozo san marcial and hot springs to caballo new mexico from there us 70 replaced all of us 180 between caballo new mexico and florence junction arizona us 70 also ran entirely concurrent with us 60 from globe into california to a junction with us 99 near mecca california old route to el paso became part of us 54 this not only moved western terminus of us 70 from el paso to california but also reintroduced us 70 to state of arizona after 4 years of absence in later years us 180 would also be re introduced to arizona coincidentally taking over former route of us 70 between holbrook and new mexico some adjustments were made to new routing of us 70 between 1935 and 1936 moving highway between hondo and lordsburg in new mexico further south through alamogordo las cruces and deming us 70 in california was also extended west over us 60 and us 99 to downtown los angeles this meant that both us 60 and us 70 were now entirely concurrent each other west of globe arizona to a shared western terminus despite route being changed through new mexico and california us 70 remained mostly unaltered through arizona until mid 1950s in 1936 overall length of us 70 in arizona was including both standalone section between globe and new mexico and section entirely concurrent with us 60 between globe and colorado river in ehrenberg arizona republic newspaper advertised us 70 as shortest route across southern arizona claiming it was at least shorter than any other highway crossing state of arizona laterally on june 21 1937 sr 77 was extended south to oracle junction establishing a short concurrency with us 70 between globe and an intersection just west of cutter in 1939 us 666 was extended south to douglas from new mexico establishing a concurrency with us 70 between safford and san jose following end of second world war on may 26 1945 arizona state highway department released its postwar highway improvement and construction plans to press among many proposed improvement projects was construction of a new alignment of us 70 between cutter and safford arizona new route was proposed to run around north side of san carlos reservoir and bypass coolidge dam on may 29 1950 highway department initially budgeted 550 000 to begin new construction project allocated funds would go towards building first segment of coolidge dam bypass from cutter to peridot by december 1951 new route from cutter to peridot was under construction by a private contractor from globe cutter to peridot project along with remaining proposed route was estimated to cost a total of 6 million when complete and would eliminate 11 miles off length of us 70 construction on section from cutter to peridot was nearing completion in april 1953 with a bridge over gilson wash on route being last segment under construction by late 1953 section between cutter and peridot was completed but unpaved route was also not yet signed as a state highway remainder of highway between peridot and geronimo was now under construction construction and improvement on new route was still undergoing by february 1956 with bridge over gila river and paving of new route scheduled to be completed by late may by december 5 1956 new section of us 70 had been opened to traffic and designation re routed to newer alignment original route over coolidge dam was subsequently abandoned by state highway department although older route is in very rough shape former us 70 over coolidge dam remains open to car traffic and is now maintained by bia as bia route 3 new route was dedicated in an opening ceremony on december 8 during 1960s days of us 70 being a full transcontinental highway came to an end during 1964 california state highway renumbering us 70 designation eliminated entirely from state of california placing national western terminus of highway at arizona border on colorado river in ehrenberg on february 13 1969 us 70 was further truncated to us 60 in globe where its western terminus remains to this day today former us 70 between ehrenberg and globe is now part of interstate 10 us 60 and several city and county maintained roads remaining section of us 70 has remained mostly unchanged since 1956 despite its truncation us 70 remains an important artery between globe and safford for san carlos indian reservation providing reservation with an adequate connection to rest of state it also continues to serve as both main street and through route for towns of duncan and safford today us 70 between new mexico state line and us 60 in globe is designated as part of old west highway a tourist route established by old west history association in 1994 old west highway designation also extends west from globe along us 60 to
