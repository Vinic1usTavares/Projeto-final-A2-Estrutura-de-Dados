action of 26 july 1806 was a minor naval engagement of napoleonic wars fought off southern coast of island of celebes in dutch east indies during battle a small british squadron attacked and defeated a dutch force defending a valuable convoy which was also captured british force consisting of frigate and brig sloop under command of captain edward elphinstone was initially wary of dutch mistaking dutch east indiaman merchant ship victoria for a ship of line closer observation revealed identity of dutch vessels following day and elphinstone led his frigate against leading dutch warship hms celebes 1806 pallas while harrier engaged merchant vessels and forced them to surrender only corvette william escaped taking no part in engagement battle was first in a series of actions by royal navy squadron based at madras with intention of eliminating dutch squadron maintained at java greyhound had been sent to java sea and molucca islands to reconnoitre dutch ports in preparation for a raid on java by a larger force under rear admiral sir edward pellew later in year elphinstone s success was followed by a second frigate action by captain peter rainier in which dutch ship was captured in november 1806 admiral pellew led main body of his squadron against capital of dutch east indies at batavia and a year later eliminated last vessels of dutch east indies squadron at griessie background dutch squadron in dutch east indies was a constant threat to british system of trade routes during napoleonic wars dutch under guise of kingdom of holland and ruled by french emperor napoleon s brother louis bonaparte had joined war against britain following end of peace of amiens in 1803 although primary function of dutch east indies squadron was suppression of piracy their presence threatened british shipping in malacca straits in particular lucrative trade with china at start of every year china fleet a large convoy of british east indiamen merchant ships sailed from canton and passed through south china sea and malacca strait on their journey to indian ocean and eventually to britain worth millions of pounds these convoys were vital to british economy but they faced considerable danger in passing through waters that were within easy reach of dutch ports in java clowes p 336 in 1804 a french squadron under rear admiral charles linois used batavia on java as a base to attack china fleet although attempt ended in failure at battle of pulo aura clowes p 336 java presented a clear threat to british maritime interests in south china sea but british squadron based in indian ocean was too weak in 1805 to consider operations so far from its main base at madras while linois remained active by start of 1806 linois had sailed into atlantic and an expeditionary force had seized dutch base at cape of good hope securing western indian ocean and providing reinforcements that allowed rear admiral sir edward pellew to begin operations against dutch forces in east indies gardiner p 81 pellew s first action during spring of 1806 was to deploy several frigates to java sea with instructions to reconnoitre dutch squadron and its main port at batavia first british ship to reach java sea was 32 gun frigate under captain edward elphinstone which arrived in july 1806 in company with brig sloop under commander edward troubridge two vessels cruised in search of dutch activity in area on 4 june they successfully destroyed armed brig christian elizabeth at manado and two days later captured belgica at tidore during evening of 25 july lookouts spotted four sails passing through selayar strait that separates selayar island from southern tip of celebes these four vessels were a dutch convoy from molucca islands consisting of dutch national frigate pallas of 36 guns under captain n s aalbers dutch east india company corvette william of twenty 24 pounder guns and 110 men under captain p dutch east indiaman victoria or in some sources vittoria of about 800 tons burthen bm under captain klaas and dutch east indiaman batavier of some 500 tons bm under captain william de val james p 251 battle on observing dutch ships elphinstone immediately gave chase aalbers responded by forming his ships in a line of battle and retaining close formation as convoy passed celebes coast close to small dutch trading posts at and at 21 00 aalbers ordered his force to anchor offshore and prepare for british attack elphinstone was cautious however as victoria was a particularly large ship with two decks and appearance of a ship of line aware that such a large vessel could easily destroy his frigate elphinstone halted his advance and greyhound and harrier stopped to observe dutch convoy during night maintaining a position to windward of aalbers force at dawn lookouts on greyhound were able to establish that victoria was a large merchant ship rather than a warship and elphinstone was encouraged to resume attack aalbers sailed shortly afterwards his ships tacking away from shore in line of battle ready for british advance in doing so pallas drew ahead of next ship in line creating a gap through which british attack could be directed at 05 00 elphinstone raised french colours in an effort to confuse dutch officers and indicated that he wished to speak with dutch commander aalbers was not fooled and when elphinstone opened fire on pallas at close range at 05 30 dutch frigate replied immediately with frigates engaged harrier cut between pallas and victoria troubridge discharging his carronades into victoria and ordering his crew to fire muskets at deck of pallas in response victoria and batavier pulled out of line to engage harrier which continued its fire against pallas while william bringing up rear of dutch line pulled out completely and sailed for coast clowes p 387 elphinstone rapidly took advantage of confusion harriers attack had created passing aalbers bow and raking his ship elphinstone then threw his sails back halting his ship and allowing greyhound to maintain a position across pallas bow from which he could inflict severe damage on dutch frigate without coming under fire himself as damage and casualties mounted on pallas harrier joined attack gunfire from dutch ship gradually slackened and finally stopped at 06 10 dutch flag was struck from mast and pallas surrendered with over 40 casualties from a crew of 250 including 50 local recruits clowes p 386 throughout engagement victoria and batavier had kept up a constant but inefficient fire on harrier troubridge waiting until dutch flagship surrendered before counterattacking james p 252 with troubridge in pursuit dutch merchant ships were unable to escape harrier and at 06 30 victoria surrendered sending a boat to take possession troubridge immediately turned away towards batavier elphinstone too was sailing towards isolated merchant vessel and at 06 40 captain de val surrendered rather than fight superior british force william successfully escaped in aftermath of battle rapidly a weak chase from battered harrier all three captured ships were taken over by prize crews and brought to port cornwallis on south andaman island casualties on pallas were heavy with eight men killed outright and 32 wounded including aalbers and three of his lieutenants six of wounded later died including dutch captain there were also four men killed on east indiamen and seven wounded one of whom died later british losses by contrast were light with one man killed and eight wounded on greyhound and just three wounded on harrier aftermath prizes were sold in india royal navy took pallas into service as hms celebes clowes p 564 however it sold her in 1807 winfield 2008 p 215 elphinstone did not long survive his victory he was ordered back to britain in early 1807 and took passage on rear admiral sir thomas troubridge s flagship he was presumed drowned in february 1807 along with entire crew when blenheim disappeared during a hurricane in western indian ocean for pellew victory was an encouraging sign of weakness of dutch squadron in october captain peter rainier seized another dutch frigate from batavia harbour itself and following month admiral pellew led a large scale raid on port that eliminated most of dutch east indies squadron two ships of line escaped pellew s attack but they were old and in a poor state of repair and so were unable to defend themselves when pellew discovered and destroyed them at griessie in 1807 gardiner p 82 citations references category naval battles involving netherlands category
