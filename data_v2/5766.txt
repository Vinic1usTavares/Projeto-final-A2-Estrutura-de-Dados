taken while she was being administered cortexiphan walter s voice is heard on tape as is william bell s both are trying to calm little olivia while she sits huddled amidst a debris strewn room of equipment it becomes clear olivia has caused this chaos in walter and bell s lab presumably with her cortexiphan induced abilities production episode was written and directed by academy award winning screenwriter akiva goldsman goldsman was attracted to series because he believed that at time fringes mythology was already really starting to hum bad dreams was his first writing credit for a television episode and he wrote several hours of material before co executive producer jeff pinkner helped him condense it every episode since bad dreams goldsman has been credited as a consulting producer it marked first episode with previous fringe director brad anderson now also credited as a producer thumb upright one scene was shot with torv jackson and noble driving back and forth on 59th street bridge to simulate them en route opening scene in subway was initially going to be on top of a building so that episode would begin and end same but co creator j j abrams thought it would be better to start it underground and move up throughout episode episode began setup of olivia s backstory by revealing cortexiphan drug trials which would be an ongoing plot point in continuing episodes all shots were chosen carefully to put viewer in olivia s troubled frame of mind and consequently episode had many tight shots that were meant to give a sense of unease producers felt that shooting on lab set was hardest set to shoot at on planet because it contained several levels that inhibited crew s ability to move cameras around as goldsman had an aversion to shooting in hospitals they used a church for mental hospital scenes when olivia peter and walter are en route to climax at building shots of them in suv were just shots of them driving back and forth on 59th street bridge climatic scene where olivia encounters nick and group of people at top of building was shot at 902 broadway in manhattan though actors appeared to be on edge of a very tall building there was in fact a hidden roof extending out that they would have fallen on instead visual and special effects departments worked in conjunction to simulate woman jumping off building while actress simply jumped onto a tarp several feet below her crew rigged car with pneumatic rams air cannons and cables to implode under weight of her body and then cgi was used to make woman appear to fall on car actress anna torv called episode s hotel scene her favorite of show so far explaining i loved shooting that because it was first time that olivia really inched her way into that dynamic of peter and walter she s been kind of on outside and wrangling them constantly but this gave me a glimpse into realizing everything is a little bit entwined and building more of that emotional conflict between them i really loved shooting that final scene of episode ended with a tape of a young olivia in a fire damaged room leading to rumors her character was a fire starter torv however discounted this soon after explaining i think it s more than that i think what they got given or what they got taught is much bigger than just starting fire jeff pinkner agreed and elaborated further we saw consequence we saw that she started a fire at end of last episode but i think it s a mistake to assume that that s her power i think truth is it s probably a consequence of her ability this particular scene as well as episode s reference to experiments walter performed on children comprise main plot of season three episode subject 13 reception ratings episode was watched by more than 9 89 million viewers in united states with a 5 9 9 rating among all households reviews noel murray from a v club graded episode with an a he praised fine job of director writer akiva goldsman and thought climax was extraordinarily well shot and performed ign s ramsey isler rated episode 9 2 10 writing that it is a classic example of a story you have to be patient with this was an episode with a compelling shocking start that kept us hooked well enough to deal with some slow points in rest of first half hour but we were rewarded for our patience with one heck of a climax and epilogue this was well executed tv andrew hanson from los angeles times thought that while first half wasn t very exciting second half had plenty to keep up interest as more was revealed about olivia and walter s backgrounds rhee dee of pinkraygun com liked scenes depicting olivia and broyles relationship as well as revelations behind experimentation on a young olivia and thought fox promos made episode look much lamer than it actually was io9 s annalee newitz loved great creepy opening scene arc concerning walter s past experimentation on children and well played funny and strange scene when olivia goes to strip club though a bit disappointed with conspiracy story sfscope coms sarah stegall nevertheless called episode well crafted enjoyed peter olivia moments praised torv s performance and said akiva goldsman gave us an episode built like a
