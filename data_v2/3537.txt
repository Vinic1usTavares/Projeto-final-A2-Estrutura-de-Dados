style remained similar with some new instrumental work introduced flute synth or cello were noted by allmusic s nitsuh abebe on we have facts and we re voting yes band again expanded their use of unorthodox instruments including organ and glockenspiel pitchfork called them a gentle niche in current rock climate compared with bands such as modest mouse and built to spill rolling stone reviewed transatlanticism and commented that it contained melodic melancholy songs about feeling both smart and confused hopelessly romantic but wary of love gibbard s voice was described as plaintive boy next door entertainment weekly commented on music on plans saying lush arrangements are long on hothouse organs and pianos but short on squirmy guitars and beats that on gibbard s best work offset his sweet voice and borderline maudlin poetics with a sense of emotional danger band s music on plans was described by dallas morning news as a literate whispery style kind of stuff that normally sounds better in headphones than in large venues in an interview with shave magazine ben gibbard commented on his song writing saying that he never sit s down to write an album number one i just kind of sit down and write songs and theme kind of makes itself apparent but i would never say i was writing about searching for something as much as just trying to document with every song where i am in that moment when i m writing that song if a theme kind of makes itself apparent in a record it has more to do with fact that just what s been on my mind recently so i guess clearly i have been and was and am but it was never a conscious decision band name gibbard took band name from song death cab for cutie which was written by neil innes and vivian stanshall and performed by their group bonzo dog doo dah band song is a track on bonzo s 1967 debut album gorilla and was performed by them in beatles film magical mystery tour innes originally took title from an old pulp fiction crime magazine he came across in a street market in a 2011 interview gibbard stated name was never supposed to be something that someone was going to reference 15 years on so yeah i would absolutely go back and give it a
