benjamin morrell july 5 1795 1838 or 1839 was an american sea captain explorer and trader who made a number of voyages mainly to atlantic southern ocean and pacific islands in a ghost written memoir a narrative of four voyages which describes his sea going life between 1823 and 1832 morrell included numerous claims of discovery and achievement many of which have been disputed by geographers and historians and in some cases have been proved false he ended his career as a fugitive having wrecked his ship and misappropriated parts of salvaged cargo morrell had an eventful early career running away to sea at age of 17 and being twice captured and imprisoned by british during war of 1812 he subsequently sailed before mast for several years before being appointed as chief mate and later as captain of new york sealer wasp in 1823 he took wasp for an extended voyage into subantarctic waters and on his return made unsubstantiated claims to have travelled beyond 70 degs and to have sighted new coastlines in area now known as weddell sea his subsequent voyages mainly centered on pacific where he attempted to develop trading relations with indigenous populations although morrell wrote of enormous potential wealth to be obtained from pacific trade his endeavours were in main commercially unprofitable despite his reputation among his contemporaries for untruth and fantasy morrell has been defended by some later commentators who while questioning his general reliability maintain that not all his life was fraud and exaggeration they believe that aside from bombast and boastful tone of account that carries his name there is evidence that he carried out useful work such his discovery of large scale guano deposits which led to development of a full scale industry he is believed to have died in 1838 or 1839 in mozambique there is however evidence to suggest that this death might have been staged and that he lived on in exile possibly in south america early life and career thumb left map of south shetland islands scene of morrell s first antarctic adventures morrell was born at rye in westchester county new york on july 5 1795 he grew up in stonington connecticut where his father also named benjamin was employed as a shipbuilder morrell after minimal schooling ran away to sea at age of 17 without taking leave of any member of my family or intimating my purpose to a single soul morrell introduction pp ix xi during war of 1812 which broke out while he was at sea he was twice captured by british on his first voyage his ship carrying a cargo of flour was intercepted off st john s newfoundland and morrell was detained for eight months his second voyage landed him in dartmoor prison england for two years h r mill p 104 after his release morrell continued his seafaring career sailing before mast as an ordinary seaman since his lack of education prevented him advancing to officer rank a sympathetic captain josiah macy taught him what he needed to know to qualify as an officer american national biography vol 15 p 879 and in 1821 he was appointed chief mate on sealer wasp under captain robert johnson wasp was bound for south shetland islands which had been discovered three years earlier by british captain william smith h r mill pp 94 95 morrell who had evidently heard stories of these islands was keen to go there on ensuing voyage he was involved in a series of remarkable adventures which included a narrow escape from drowning then being lost at sea in a small boat during a gale that swept him from ship and leading efforts to extricate wasp when she became trapped in ice h r mill p 105 on day following his return to new york morrell was appointed captain of wasp while johnson took over schooner henry two ships were jointly commissioned to return to south seas for sealing trading and exploration and to ascertain practicality under favourable circumstances of penetrating to south pole morrell p 30 four voyages first voyage south seas and pacific ocean wasp and henry sailed from new york on june 21 1822 and remained together as far as falkland islands they then separated wasp travelling east in search of sealing grounds morrell s account of next few months of voyage in antarctic and subantarctic waters is controversial his claims of distances latitudes and discoveries have been challenged as inaccurate or impossible giving substance to his reputation among his contemporaries for untruth and leading to much criticism by later writers gould p 255 and p 258 antarctic waters thumb bouvet island 1898 photograph morrell s journal indicates that wasp reached south georgia on november 20 and then sailed eastwards towards isolated bouvet island which lies approximately midway between southern africa and antarctic continent and is known as world s remotest island it had been discovered in 1739 by french navigator jean baptiste charles bouvet de lozier mills pp 434 35 but his plotting of its position was inaccurate h r mill p 47 captain james cook in 1772 had been unable to find it and had assumed its nonexistence it had not been seen again until 1808 when british sealing captains james lindsay and thomas hopper reached it and recorded its correct position though they were unable to land p 135 morrell by his own account found island without difficulty with improbable ease in words of historian william mills before landing and hunting seals there in his subsequent lengthy description morrell does not mention island s most obvious physical feature its permanent ice cover h r mill pp 106 107 this has caused some commentators to doubt whether he actually visited island thumb 300px left sketch of wasp s voyage track november 20 1822 to february 28 1823 based on morrell s claimed positions much of return journey continuous line is within antarctic coastline after leaving bouvet island wasp continued eastward reaching kerguelen islands on december 31 1822 where she remained for 11 days voyage then evidently continued to south and east until february 1 1823 when morrell records his position as s 118deg27 e morrell pp 65 68 here morrell says he took advantage of an eleven knot breeze and turned ship to begin a passage westward apart from one undated position at s e morrell s journal is silent until february 23 when he records crossing greenwich 0deg meridian historians have doubted whether such a long passage from about could have been made so quickly in ice strewn waters and against prevailing winds h r mill pp 107 08 although some writers including former royal navy navigator rupert gould have argued that morrell s claims as to speed and distance are plausible gould pp 260 62 morrell s undated interim latitude was later shown to be well inside antarctic mainland territory of enderby land gould writing in 1928 before continental boundaries of this sector of antarctica were known based his support for morrell on premise that enderby land was an island with a sea channel south of it see gould p 257 and pp 261 62 he added if at some future date enderby land is found to form part of antarctic continent morrell s most inveterate champions will have to throw up sponge gould p 281 according to morrell wasp reached south sandwich islands on february 28 his presence there is corroborated by his descriptions of harbour on thule island confirmed by early 20th century expeditions gould p 263 in next phase of voyage morrell records that he took wasp southwards and sea being remarkably clear of ice reached a latitude of 70deg14 s before turning north on march 14 as fuel for ship s stoves was running out this journey if morrell s account is true made him first american sea captain to penetrate antarctic circle he believed he says that but for this deficiency he could have made a glorious advance directly to south pole or to 85deg without least doubt some credence to his claimed southern latitude is provided by james weddell s voyage on a similar track a month earlier which reached 74deg15 s before retreating words used by weddell to express his belief that south pole lay in open water are replicated by morrell whose account was written nine years after event thus it is suggested by geographer paul simpson housley that morrell may have plagiarised weddell s experiences simpson housley pp 57 59 since weddell s account had been published in 1827 new south greenland morrell s account describes how on day after turning north from his southernmost point a large tract of land was sighted in region of 67deg52 n w morrell refers to this land as new south greenland morrell pp 69 70 and records that during next few days wasp explored more than of coast morrell provided vivid descriptions of land s features with observations of its abundant wildlife no such land exists other appearances of land at or near this bearing reported during 1842 expedition of sir james clark ross have likewise proved imaginary gould pp 272 74 in 1917 scottish explorer william speirs bruce wrote that existence of land in this area should not be rejected until absolutely disproved bruce in scottish geographical magazine june 1917 quoted in gould pp 270 71 by this time both wilhelm filchner and ernest shackleton in their respective ice bound ships had drifted close to plotted positions of new south greenland and reported no sign of it shackleton pp 60 61 it has been suggested that what morrell saw was actually eastern coast of antarctic peninsula some further west from his sighting h r mill pp 109 10 this would require a navigational error of at least 10deg and a complete revision of morrell s timeline after leaving south sandwich islands gould pp 276 82 assuming that morrell did not invent experience a possible explanation is that he witnessed a superior mirage pacific and home on march 19 morrell bade farewell to cheerless shores of new south greenland and sailed away from antarctic never to return remaining stages of voyage are uncontroversial involving a year long cruise in pacific ocean this took wasp to galapagos islands and also to island of mas a tierra where a century earlier scottish seaman alexander selkirk had been marooned providing inspiration for robinson crusoe story wasp returned to new york in may 1824 there he found that his wife whom he had married in 1819 not named in any accounts of morrell s life or career and his two small children likewise unnamed had all died he quickly married his 15 year old cousin abigail jane wood abby second voyage north and south pacific for his second voyage morrell took charge of a new ship tartar which sailed from new york on july 19 1824 for pacific ocean in next two years tartar first explored american coastline from straits of magellan to cape blanco now in oregon morrell pp 203 15 he then sailed westward to islands of hawaii known at that time as sandwich islands where captain james cook had met his death nearly 40 years earlier thereafter tartar returned to american coast and tracked slowly southwards back to straits of magellan morrell pp 246 48 thumb left fernandina island in galapagos where morrell witnessed a spectacular volcanic eruption on february 14 1825 among events witnessed and recorded in morrell s journal were siege of callao main port of peru by simon bolivar s liberators rodriguez p pp 177 78 and a spectacular volcanic eruption on fernandina island in galapagos archipelago which tartar visited during february 1825 fernandina then known as narborough island exploded on february 14 in morrell s words heavens appeared to be one blaze of fire intermingling with millions of falling stars and meteors while flames shot upward from peak of narborough to height of at least two thousand feet p 57 morrell reports that air temperature reached 123 degf 51 degc and as tartar approached river of lava flowing into sea water temperature rose to 150 degf 66 degc some of crew collapsed in heat morrell also records how a hunting trip ashore in california led to a skirmish with locals which turned into a full scale battle ending he says with seventeen natives dead and seven of tartars men wounded morrell claims that he was among casualties with an arrow in his thigh of a visit to san francisco morrell writes inhabitants are principally mexicans and spaniards who are very indolent and consequently very filthy after revisiting galapagos islands and gathering a harvest of fur seal and terrapin morrell uses word terrapin presumably referring to galapagos tortoise terms were used interchangeably in morrell s day for example see charles darwin in p 312 tartar began a slow journey home on october 13 1825 as they left pacific morrell claimed to have personally inspected and identified every danger existing along american pacific coast morrell p 231 tartar finally reached new york harbour on may 8 1826 with a main cargo of 6 000 fur seals this haul did not please morrell s employers who had evidently expected rather more reception i met from my owners was cold and repulsive he wrote tartar did not return home laden with silver and gold and therefore my toils and dangers counted for nothing morrell p 251 third voyage west african coast thumb a 19th century depiction of african slaves in 1828 morrell was engaged by messrs christian bergh co to take command of schooner antarctic named he claims in honour of his earlier antarctic achievements morrell pp 253 54 antarctic left new york on june 25 1828 bound for western africa during following months morrell carried out an extensive survey of african coast between cape of good hope and benguela and led several short excursions inland he was impressed by commercial potential of this coast recording that many kinds of skins may be procured about here including those of leopard fox bullock together with ostrich feathers and valuable minerals morrell p 294 at ichaboe island he discovered huge deposits of guano 25 feet thick in face of such opportunity he records his belief that a 30 000 investment would produce in two years a profit from ten to fifteen hundred per cent during voyage morrell experienced several encounters with slave trade first at cape verde islands then a centre for trade because of its geographical position in relation to americas europe and africa stewart et al p 15 he found slaves conditions wretched but was impressed by their passion for music which he thought can alleviate even pangs caused by galling fetters of slavery morrell p 261 later in voyage he witnessed what he describes as horrid barbarity including spectacle of two women slaves in their death agonies as a result of floggings a lengthy soliloquy in his journal on evils of slavery concludes t he root source foundation of evil is ignorance and superstition of poor negroes themselves morrell pp 328 30 on june 8 1829 morrell wrote in his journal voyage had been prosperous beyond our expectations and any further stay on african coast would have been a waste of time and money morrell p 331 he arrived in new york on july 14 morrell p 333 fourth voyage south seas and pacific ocean thumb a pacific war canoe with warriors morrell s party encountered similar armed vessels during its skirmishes in pacific isles according to morrell antarctic s owners were unanimous that he should make another voyage with ship morrell p 337 and in september 1829 antarctic left new york bound for south atlantic and pacific in search of seals at her own insistence and against morrell s and owners advice his wife abby accompanied him fairhead pp 46 47 by january 1830 antarctic had reached auckland islands south of new zealand where morrell had hoped for a rich harvest of seal but found waters empty w j mills p 39 he sailed north for manila in philippines hoping to find a commercial cargo there and arrived in march 1830 fairhead pp 48 50 no such cargo was available but morrell was persuaded by american consul george hubbell that a potentially profitable enterprise would be to collect sea cucumbers otherwise known as beche du mer plentifully available in islands now known as micronesia these could then be taken to china where they were much prized chapter 12 line 32 hubbell would not permit antarctic to sail with abby on board possibly he had designs on her fairhead pp 50 52 morrell sailed from manila without her and initially had little luck in finding sea cucumbers in any quantity eventually antarctic reached carteret islands a small atoll which now forms part of papua new guinea and found sea cucumbers in abundance fairhead p 53 morrell set up camp on one of islands where he faced a hostile reception from population who were nevertheless intrigued by their first sight of metal there were thefts of tools morrell responded by holding several chiefs as hostages at which islanders mounted a full scale attack on morrell s shore base fourteen crew members were killed antarctic was forced to make a hasty withdrawal leaving much equipment behind fairhead p 54 morrell retreated to manila planning retaliation he hired a large number of to augment his crew and with a help of a loan from british consul adapted antarctica and fitted her with guns and cannons ship with abby now on board returned to carteret islands and attacked with gunfire after a series of such assaults and heavy casualties population sued for peace fairhead pp 55 56 this enabled morrell to occupy one of islands in exchange for cutlery trinkets tools and other metal artefacts morrell p 440 peace was temporary morrell s shore camp was continually harassed by population finally morrell decided to abandon enterprise citing unappeasable vindictiveness and incessant hostilities of native population morrell p 452 on november 13 1830 while returning to manila antarctica anchored off coast of island of in today s west new britain province fairhead p 56 a flotilla of native canoes approached ship full of apparently well armed and aggressive islanders after his experiences at carteret island morrell took no chances and ordered his crew to fire small craft were shattered many died while others manage to regain shore one man who had clung to rudder was hauled on board as a prisoner crew named him sunday his actual name was dako fairhead pp 22 24 an account of this engagement was entered into ship s log by john keeler ship s young navigator just over a week later on november 22 a skirmish in islands brought morrell another captive whom crew named monday his true name was never discovered fairhead pp 57 58 with two native prisoners but little else to show from this venture antarctic returned to manila in mid december fairhead pp 71 72 by now desperate for some profitable activity morrell made some money by displaying dako and monday to a fascinated public fairhead pp 69 70 only maritime opportunity available was to take a cargo to cadiz which he was obliged to accept he left manila on january 13 1831 taking his captives with him when antarctic reached cadiz five months later port was under quarantine and closed he was forced to discharge cargo in bordeaux where dako and monday rumored in town to be cannibals again attracted great curiosity antarctic finally reached new york on august 27 1831 despite his lack of commercial success morrell remained upbeat about future prospects in pacific i could with only a modest share of patronage open a new avenue of trade more lucrative than any that our country has ever yet enjoyed and further it would be in my power and mine alone to secure monopoly for any term i pleased morrell p 341 in final paragraph of his account of morrell records that his wife s father her aunt and her aunt s child had all died during his absence as had one of morrell s cousins and her husband morrell p 492 later career money making when he returned to new york after his profitless fourth voyage morrell was heavily in debt and in urgent need of funds fairhead p 75 newspapers showed great interest in story of voyage and morrell was keen to cash in fairhead p 76 within a few days of his arrival he had organised a stage show entitled two cannibals of islands of south pacific this spectacle embellished with accounts of massacre at carteret island and other dramatic inclusions played to large crowds at new york s rubens peale museum fairhead pp 76 83 in october 1831 morrell took show on a tour which began in albany on october 10 among those who visited show was 12 year old herman melville future author of moby dick who may have based character of on his memory of dako fairhead pp 92 93 tour proceeded to philadelphia baltimore and finally washington dc before ending in january 1832 at which point morrell returned show to peale s fairhead p 103 morrell s second projected source of funds was his account of his voyages which firm of j and j harper were willing to publish fairhead p 107 9 359 they engaged an experienced writer and dramatist samuel woodworth to make sense of morrell s notes and sea journals although woodworth s role as ghost writer was not made public fairhead pp 141 42 abby morrell s journals received similar treatment from another established author samuel knapp his book was published in december 1832 hers early in 1833 morrell s was very successful and sold well new york mirror found it a highly interesting and instructive work with stirring adventures and much geographical and nautical information france s leading explorer jules dumont d urville was complimentary acknowledging morrell as courageous skilled and dedicated fairhead p 143 explorer and journalist jeremiah reynolds on other hand observed that account contained more poetry than truth abby s book attracted less attention it purported to be written to promote amelioration of condition of american seaman a subject in which she had not otherwise evinced interest fairhead p 122 woodworth exploited public s curiosity by preparing a stage play cannibals which opened at bowery theatre new york in march 1833 and had a lengthy and successful run fairhead p 144 46 morrell s account was one of sources used by edgar allan poe in his novel narrative of arthur gordon pym peeples p 56 return to pacific with restoration of his fortunes and his new found fame morrell began plans for a further pacific voyage intending to return dako and monday to their islands and exploit further trading opportunities having lobbied unsuccessfully for congressional funding fairhead pp 101 02 morrell eventually found backers who secured a converted brigantine margaret oakley in which he set sail from new york on march 9 1834 among crew was samuel woodworth s 18 year old son selim woodworth whose journals and letters provided a record of voyage fairhead pp 164 65 monday was not with them he had died a year previously fairhead p oakley took westerly route to pacific across atlantic to cape verde islands then south to cape of good hope and across indian ocean fairhead pp 167 69 arriving in vicinity of dako s home islands in november 1834 dako was received rapturously by his people as one who had returned from dead fairhead 173 74 morrell remained in area for several months exploring and collecting artefacts before departing in april 1835 for port jackson sydney harbour in australia for repairs and repainting fairhead pp 220 21 by june morrell was back among pacific islands where he took his final leave of dako fairhead pp 225 26 after a fruitless interval prospecting for gold on new guinea mainland morrell took ship to canton in china fairhead pp 227 33 where he found a valuable cargo for new york on which he anticipated a profit of 100 000 fairhead pp 235 36 after leaving canton on november 14 margaret oakley was delayed in singapore by bad weather where some of cargo was sold to pay for repairs fairhead p 237 ship left singapore on december 31 1835 and was seen off mauritius in early february 1836 but then disappeared fairhead p 239 she was given up for lost with all her crew before months later news arrived in mauritius that she had been wrecked on coast of madagascar crew was rescued although much of ship s cargo was lost in wreck fairhead pp 241 43 and more was used to pay off rescuers and other of morrell s debts when representatives of insurers arrived in madagascar to assess loss they discovered that morrell had departed taking part of remaining cargo with him he found his way to south africa where he boarded a british ship rio packet bound for london fairhead pp 247 49 outside us jurisdiction he was beyond reach of american authorities who equated his actions with piracy final years and death in london early in 1837 morrell attempted to convert some of purloined cargo into cash but word of his activities had spread and proceeds were immediately confiscated by agents acting for margaret oakley s insurers fairhead pp 250 51 his reputation as a probable fraud prevented him from finding new employment he sought work with shipping firm of enderby brothers but charles enderby said that he had heard so much of morrell that he did not think fit to enter into any engagement with him gould p 255 thwarted in london morrell turned his attention to france he had heard that d urville was organising an expedition to antarctic and on june 20 1837 wrote to french geographical society in paris to offer his services i will engage to place proud banner of france ten degrees nearer pole than any other banner has ever been planted providing i can obtain command of a small schooner properly manned and equipped fairhead pp 253 54 his offer was declined h r mill pp 110 11 morrell was by now regarded as a fraud in france as well as in britain and america fairhead pp 256 57 it is not known how morrell supported himself during his months in london it is possible that abby sent him funds from america fairhead pp 272 73 somehow in autumn of 1837 he made his way to havana in cuba after which his movements are unclear it appears that he eventually obtained command of a vessel possibly christine and that he sailed in september 1838 fairhead pp 268 70 probably planning a return to pacific he got no further than mozambique on east african coast his ship was wrecked and morrell was stranded ashore he is reported to have died either of fever or during an insurrection in late 1838 or early 1839 this story is complicated by an alternative account indicating that christine was wrecked a year later early in 1840 although whether morrell was alive and in command by that date is unrecorded christine was known as a slave ship which raises possibility that in his final years morrell was engaged with slave trade fairhead suggests an alternative hypothesis that morrell staged his death in mozambique to evade margaret oakley s insurers in this scenario he may have escaped to south america and lived out his days there a letter dated august 11 1843 to editor of new york commercial advertiser and signed morrell could fairhead maintains only have been written by someone with intimate knowledge of oakley voyage fairhead offers no explanation why morrell if alive should break his silence other than perhaps like many criminals he could not resist flaunting himself fairhead pp 316 19 there is little documented history for abby morrell after 1838 two records respectively dated 1841 and 1850 place her in new york but details of her life and eventual death are unknown assessment despite morrell s exposure as a fraud following margaret oakley debacle his contemporaries did not uniformly denounce him to some he was biggest liar in pacific while d urville who had earlier warmly praised morrell s four voyages account turned on american and accused him of fabricating many of his supposed discoveries fairhead pp 286 88 however jeremiah reynolds who had expressed scepticism over narrative included morrell s pacific discoveries in his report to congress a report in relation to islands reefs and shoals in pacific ocean house document 105 23rd congress second session 1835 this says simpson housley was surely a compliment to otherwise disgraced navigator later commentators and historians have tended to assess his career with a degree of sympathy hugh robert mill of royal geographical society writing in 1905 considered that a man may be ignorant and boastful yet still do solid work mill thought morrell intolerably vain and as great a braggart as any hero of autobiographical romance but still found narrative itself most entertaining rupert gould writing in 1928 thought that morrell may have been boastful and self aggrandizing but that did not make him a deliberate liar gould points to accurate information provided by morrell on discovery of guano deposits on ichaboe island which laid foundations of a flourishing industry gould p 268 william mills a much more recent commentator echoes view that something may be salvaged from morrell s account although much of it must be discarded in regard to antarctic discoveries which are mills s particular concern he points out that these are given no special emphasis morrell does not seem to regard antarctic expedition as particularly remarkable and discovery of new south greenland is not claimed by morrell himself but is credited to captain johnson in 1821 in preface to his four voyages book morrell admits that he incorporated experiences of others into his account morrell preface advertisement to a narrative of four voyages paul simpson housley suggests that as well as adapting weddell s narrative as his own experience morrell may have taken details of his 1823 visit to bouvet island from records of an 1825 visit by captain george norris simpson housley p 60 as a reminder of morrell s brief antarctic exploits morrell island at 59deg27 s 27deg19 w is an alternative name for thule island in southern thule sub group of south
