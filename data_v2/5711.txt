entertainment weekly felt that performances of i m a slave 4 u and me against music fell flat opining that glee best musical numbers are ones which twist rather than imitate original versions though he praised morris dancing he felt episode revealed her to be not a standout vocalist conversely erica futterman of rolling stone enjoyed direct recreations of iconic spears moments in i m a slave 4 u and mtv s aly semigran called it one of best sequences in show s history futterman was also impressed by me against music recreation highlighting way it played on ambiguous brittany santana relationship complimenting morris dancing and rivera s vocals raymund flandez of wall street journal criticized michele s rendition of baby one more time writing her earnestness her adoring look and her intelligent voice bumps up against breathless sound of breathy pop it s like a youtube spoof an opera singer trying to make a barmaid s ditty on oktoberfest more appealing by shedding her clothes futterman was left wanting by number feeling that tune lost all of its scandalous sexuality with rachel s octaves higher singing stack deemed stronger his favorite performance of episode as well as best incorporation of spears music as song served artie s storyline he praised increased use of mchale as a vocalist in second season enjoying his soulful voice flandez also enjoyed stronger appreciating twist of having males sing a feminist empowerment song semigran wrote that it was toxic which provided best spears cover of episode commenting that it took on its own fresh sound all while honoring original she disapproved of only exception as closing song feeling that use of another spears song such as everytime would have been more appropriate however flandez called michele s paramore rendition suitably earnest futterman described it as gorgeous and tender and stack felt it served as a nice emotional capper to episode ratings during its original broadcast britney brittany

received mixed reviews from critics emily vanderwerff of a v club graded episode d commenting that it was what people who say glee is awful are talking about when they say glee is awful she criticized lack of plot and coherence in musical numbers feeling that storyline and character arcs were ignored in favor of showcasing spears covers stack described episode as a monumental television event however he also expressed his lingering sense of slight disappointment while he enjoyed episode overall stack wrote that spears songs felt forced into storyline and that episode was neither as iconic nor as exhilarating as glee madonna tribute parents television council slammed episode accusing presentation of spears as a symbol of empowerment and self esteem problematic observing that young audience basically witnessed an endorsement of narcotics abuse public masturbation and school sanctioned burlesque james poniewozik of time who disliked madonna episode was pleasantly surprised by britney brittany he deemed it one of funniest and most entertaining episodes of series crediting morris performance and fortunately limited spears cameos responding to criticism of episode poniewozik conceded that storylines were slender and spears remakes dominated episode however felt that unlike power of madonna it worked because it owned its slightness it kept videos and britney s appearances where they belonged as fantasy bobby hankinson of houston chronicle described episode as brilliant and felt that presenting spears performances as a series of unrelated hallucinations was an inspired choice ign s robert canning rated britney brittany 8 10 signifying an impressive episode he described it as fun but close to being too much of a gimmick with incongruous song choices vanderwerff deemed spears cameo totally useless criticizing singer s flat listless dialogue lisa de moraes of washington post graded her cameo a c commenting at least she didn t have to try to be funny as in her how i met your mother guest spot flandez was disappointed that spears did not appear for longer yet he concluded that given acting demonstrated in her 2002 film crossroads it was better that pop star did not conversely jenna mullins of e online appreciated fact that spears did not appear as a background character writing that she is best when she is playing herself stack felt her appearances were well handled with a nice level of restraint and canning felt they were kept to a perfect minimum morris performance attracted critical praise with de moraes calling britney brittany a great showcase for actress praising her spectacular dance moves and deadpan flare in his otherwise negative review vanderwerff deemed morris hysterical throughout and cast s best dancer he stated murphy seems intent on running this character into ground but morris isn t going to have her stop being funny without a fight mullins observed when ryan murphy said this episode was a celebration of heather he wasn t kidding commending her musical performances canning was initially concerned that episode would diminish morris appeal by elevating her from a background role but was ultimately pleased that it managed to retain her fan favorite secondary character status references external links britney brittany at fox com britney brittany at tv com category 2010 american television episodes category glee season 2
