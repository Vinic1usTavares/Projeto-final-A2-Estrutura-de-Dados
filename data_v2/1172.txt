thumb right 250px surface weather map of 1935 labor day hurricane moving up west coast of florida tropical cyclone observation has been carried out over past couple of centuries in various ways passage of typhoons hurricanes as well as other tropical cyclones have been detected by word of mouth from sailors recently coming to port or by radio transmissions from ships at sea from sediment deposits in near shore estuaries to wiping out of cities near coastline since world war ii advances in technology have included using planes to survey ocean basins satellites to monitor world s oceans from outer space using a variety of methods radars to monitor their progress near coastline and recently introduction of unmanned aerial vehicles to penetrate storms recent studies have concentrated on studying hurricane impacts lying within rocks or near shore lake sediments which are branches of a new field known as paleotempestology this article details various methods employed in creation of hurricane database as well as reconstructions necessary for reanalysis of past storms used in projects such as atlantic hurricane reanalysis geological markers of past activity stalagmites in caves recent studies of 18o and 13c isotopes found in stalagmites in belize show that tropical cyclone events can leave markers that can be separated out on a week by week basis error rate of this type of microanalysis was 1 error in 1 200 sampling points markers in coral rocks contain certain isotopes of elements known as natural tracers which describe conditions under which they formed by studying calcium carbonate in coral rock past sea surface temperature and hurricane information can be revealed lighter oxygen isotopes are left behind in coral during periods of very heavy rainfall nobu shimizu if rocks could talk retrieved on 2006 12 09 since hurricanes are main source of extreme rainfall in tropical oceans past hurricane events can be dated to days of their impact on coral by looking at increased 18o concentration within coral anne l cohen and graham d layne seeking a hurricane signature in coral skeleton retrieved on 2006 12 09 sediment deposition in coastal lakes kam biu liu a professor at louisiana state university has been studying sediment lying at bottom of coastal lakes and marshes in order to study frequency and intensity of hurricanes over past 5 000 years since storm surges sweep coastal sands with them as they progress inland a layer of sand is left behind in coastal lakes and marshes radiocarbon dating is then used to date layers louisiana state university lsu professor looks for link between hurricanes and coastal fires evidence suggests risk for fire may be higher after catastrophic storms retrieved on 2006 12 09 newspapers before invention of telegraph in early to mid 19th century news was as fast as quickest horse stage or ship normally there was no advance warning of a tropical cyclone impact however situation changed in 19th century as seafaring people and land based researchers such as father vines in cuba came up with systematic methods of reading sky s appearance or sea state which could foretell a tropical cyclone s approach up to a couple days in advance in china abundance of historical documentary records in form of local gazettes offers an extraordinary opportunity for providing a high resolution historical dataset for frequency of typhoon strikes kam biu liu et al 2001 reconstructed a 1 000 year time series of typhoon landfalls in guangdong province of southern china since ad 975 and found that on a decadal timescale twenty year interval from ad 1660 to 1680 is most active period on record with twenty eight to thirty seven typhoon landfalls per decade variability in typhoon landfalls in guangdong mimics that observed in other paleoclimatic proxies e g tree rings ice cores from china and northern hemisphere remarkably two periods of most frequent typhoon strikes in guangdong ad 1660 1680 1850 1880 coincide with two of coldest and driest periods in northern and central china during little ice age surface observations ship reports for centuries people have sailed world s oceans and seas and for just as long they have encountered storms worst of cyclones over open seas likely took those that observed them into depths of oceans however some did survive to report harrowing tales before invention of wireless telegraph in 1905 reports about storms at sea either coincided with their arrival at coast as ships scrambled into port or came weeks and months afterwards from remote ports of call ship and buoy reports available since 1970s are used in real time not only for their temperature pressure and wind measurements but also for their sea surface temperature and wave height measurements wind reports from ships at sea have become increasingly based on anemometers and less so on beaufort scale this is important to note as beaufort scale underestimates winds at higher wind speeds indicating ship wind observations taken for older storms are likely to their true value brian r charles j neumann and mary a s davis a tropical cyclone data tape for north atlantic basin 1886 1983 contents limitations and uses retrieved on 2006 12 09 as christopher landsea et al point out many tropical cyclones that formed on open sea and did not affect any coast usually went undetected prior to satellite observation since 1970s they estimated an undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 and zero to four per year between 1886 and 1910 these undercounts roughly take into account typical size of tropical cyclones density of shipping tracks over atlantic basin and amount of populated coastline land based observations in early 20th century forecasting track of cyclones was still confined to areas of greatest surface pressure falls based upon surface weather observations and climatology these methods proved to be cutting edge of tropical cyclone forecasting through mid 20th century land based surface observations remain invaluable as a source of real time information at locations near coastline and inland combined with ship observations and newspapers they formed total information network for hurricane detection until radiosondes were introduced in 1941 and reconnaissance aircraft began in 1944 land based observations of pressure and wind can show how quickly a tropical cyclone is decaying as it moves inland their rainfall reports show where significant rainfall is occurring and can be an alert for possible flooding

platforms since 1990s academic researchers have begun to deploy mobile weather stations fortified to withstand hurricane force winds two largest programs are florida coastal monitoring program and wind engineering mobile instrumented tower experiment during landfall noaa hurricane research division compares and verifies data from reconnaissance aircraft including wind speed data taken at flight level and from gps dropwindsondes and stepped frequency microwave radiometers to wind speed data transmitted in real time from weather stations erected near or at coast national hurricane center uses data to evaluate conditions at landfall and to verify forecasts upper air observations reconnaissance aircraft idea of aircraft reconnaissance of tropical cyclones first was put forth by captain w l farnsworth of galveston commercial association in early 1930s supported by united states weather bureau it passed both united states senate and united states house of representatives in 1936 associated press storm patrol bill passed to president retrieved on 2008 06 06 since 1944 aircraft have been flying out to sea to find tropical cyclones before regular satellite coverage this was a hit or miss affair thereafter aircraft flights into tropical systems became more targeted and precise nowadays a c 130 is used as a hurricane hunter by air force while p 3 orion is used by national oceanic and atmospheric administration for research projects used to better understand tropical cyclones and improve hurricane forecasts implementation of synoptic observation missions by a gulfstream
