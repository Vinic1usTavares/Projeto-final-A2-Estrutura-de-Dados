thumb 300px right figure showing progression of menstrual cycle and different hormones contributing to it menstrual cycle is regular natural change that occurs in female reproductive system specifically uterus and ovaries that makes pregnancy possible cycle is required for production of oocytes and for preparation of uterus for pregnancy menstrual cycle occurs due to rise and fall of hormones this cycle results in thickening of lining of uterus and growth of an egg which is required for pregnancy egg is released from an ovary around day fourteen in cycle thickened lining of uterus provides nutrients to an embryo after implantation if pregnancy does not occur lining is released in what is known as menstruation up to 80 of women report having some symptoms during one to two weeks prior to menstruation common symptoms include acne tender breasts bloating feeling tired irritability and mood changes these symptoms interfere with normal life and therefore qualify as premenstrual syndrome in 20 to 30 of women in 3 to 8 they are severe first period usually begins between twelve and fifteen years of age a point in time known as menarche they may occasionally start as early as eight and this onset may still be normal average age of first period is generally later in developing world and earlier in developed world typical length of time between first day of one period and first day of next is 21 to 45 days in young women and 21 to 35 days in adults an average of 28 days menstruation stops occurring after menopause which usually occurs between 45 and 55 years of age bleeding usually lasts around 3 to 7 days menstrual cycle is governed by hormonal changes these changes can be altered by using hormonal birth control to prevent pregnancy each cycle can be divided into three phases based on events in ovary ovarian cycle or in uterus uterine cycle ovarian cycle consists of follicular phase ovulation and luteal phase whereas uterine cycle is divided into menstruation proliferative phase and secretory phase stimulated by gradually increasing amounts of estrogen in follicular phase discharges of blood menses flow stop and lining of uterus thickens follicles in ovary begin developing under influence of a complex interplay of hormones and after several days one or occasionally two become dominant non dominant follicles shrink and die approximately mid cycle 24 36 hours after luteinizing hormone lh surges dominant follicle releases an ovocyte in an event called ovulation after ovulation ovocyte only lives for 24 hours or less without fertilization while remains of dominant follicle in ovary become a corpus luteum this body has a primary function of producing large amounts of progesterone under influence of progesterone uterine lining changes to prepare for potential implantation of an embryo to establish a pregnancy if implantation does not occur within approximately two weeks corpus luteum will involute causing a sharp drop in levels of both progesterone and estrogen hormone drop causes uterus to shed its lining in a process termed menstruation menstruation also occurs in closely related primates apes and monkeys onset and frequency thumb diagram illustrating how uterus lining builds up and breaks down during menstrual cycle average age of menarche is 12 15 they may occasionally start as early as eight and this onset may still be normal this first period often occurs later in developing world than developed world average age of menarche is approximately 12 5 years in united states 12 7 in canada 12 9 in uk and 13 1 years in iceland factors such as genetics diet and overall health can affect timing cessation of menstrual cycles at end of a woman s reproductive period is termed menopause average age of menopause in women is 52 years with anywhere between 45 and 55 being common menopause before age 45 is considered premature in industrialised countries like age of menarche age of menopause is largely a result of cultural and biological factors however illnesses certain surgeries or medical treatments may cause menopause to occur earlier than it might have otherwise length of a woman s menstrual cycle typically varies somewhat with some shorter cycles and some longer cycles a woman who experiences variations of less than eight days between her longest cycles and shortest cycles is considered to have regular menstrual cycles it is unusual for a woman to experience cycle length variations of more than four days length variation between eight and 20 days is considered as moderately irregular cycles variation of 21 days or more between a woman s shortest and longest cycle lengths is considered very irregular average menstrual cycle lasts 28 days variability of menstrual cycle lengths is highest for women under 25 years of age and is lowest that is most regular for ages 25 to 39 subsequently variability increases slightly for women aged 40 to 44 luteal phase of menstrual cycle is about same length in most individuals mean 14 13 days standard deviation 1 41 days whereas follicular phase tends to show much more variability log normally distributed with 95 of individuals having follicular phases between 10 3 and 16 3 days follicular phase also seems to get significantly shorter with age geometric mean 14 2 days in women aged 18 24 vs 10 4 days in women aged 40 44 health effects some women with neurological conditions experience increased activity of their conditions at about same time during each menstrual cycle for example drops in estrogen levels have been known to trigger migraines especially when woman who suffers migraines is also taking birth control pill many women with epilepsy have more seizures in a pattern linked to menstrual cycle this is called catamenial epilepsy different patterns seem to exist such as seizures coinciding with time of menstruation or coinciding with time of ovulation and frequency with which they occur has not been firmly established using one particular definition one group of scientists found that around one third of women with intractable partial epilepsy has catamenial epilepsy an effect of hormones has been proposed in which progesterone declines and estrogen increases would trigger seizures recently studies have shown that high doses of estrogen can cause or worsen seizures whereas high doses of progesterone can act like an antiepileptic drug studies by medical journals have found that women experiencing menses are 1 68 times more likely to attempt suicide mice have been used as an experimental system to investigate possible mechanisms by which levels of sex steroid hormones might regulate nervous system function during part of mouse estrous cycle when progesterone is highest level of nerve cell gaba receptor subtype delta was high since these gaba receptors are inhibitory nerve cells with more delta receptors are less likely to fire than cells with lower numbers of delta receptors during part of mouse estrous cycle when estrogen levels are higher than progesterone levels number of delta receptors decrease increasing nerve cell activity in turn increasing anxiety and seizure susceptibility estrogen levels may affect thyroid behavior for example during luteal phase when estrogen levels are lower velocity of blood flow in thyroid is lower than during follicular phase when estrogen levels are higher among women living closely together it was once thought that onsets of menstruation tend to synchronize this effect was first described in 1971 and possibly explained by action of pheromones in 1998 subsequent research has called this hypothesis into question research indicates that women have a significantly higher likelihood of anterior cruciate ligament injuries in pre ovulatory stage than post ovulatory stage fertility thumb chance of fertilization by menstrual cycle day relative to ovulation most fertile period time with highest likelihood of pregnancy resulting from sexual intercourse covers time from some 5 days before until 1 to 2 days after ovulation weschler 2002 pp 242 374 in a 28 day cycle with a 14 day luteal phase this corresponds to second and beginning of third week a variety of methods have been developed to help individual women estimate relatively fertile and relatively infertile days in cycle these systems are called fertility awareness there are many fertility testing methods including urine test kits that detect lh surge that occurs 24 to 36 hours before ovulation these are known as ovulation predictor kits computerized devices that interpret basal body temperatures urinary test results or changes in saliva are called fertility monitors fertility awareness methods that rely on cycle length records alone are called calendar based methods methods that require observation of one or more of three primary fertility signs basal body temperature cervical mucus and cervical position weschler 2002 p 52 are known as symptoms based methods a woman s fertility is also affected by her age as a woman s total egg supply is formed in fetal life to be ovulated decades later it has been suggested that this long lifetime may make chromatin of eggs more vulnerable to division problems breakage and mutation than chromatin of sperm which are produced continuously during a man s reproductive life however despite this hypothesis a similar paternal age effect has also been observed as measured on women undergoing in vitro fertilization a longer menstrual cycle length is associated with higher pregnancy and delivery rates even after age adjustment delivery rates after ivf have been estimated to be almost doubled for women with a menstrual cycle length of more than 34 days compared with women with a menstrual cycle length shorter than 26 days a longer menstrual cycle length is also significantly associated with better ovarian response to gonadotropin stimulation and embryo quality cramps many women experience painful cramps also known as dysmenorrhea during menstruation pain results from ischemia and muscle contractions spiral arteries in secretory endometrium constrict resulting in ischemia to secretory endometrium this allows uterine lining to slough off contracts spasmodically in order to push menstrual fluid through cervix and out of vagina contractions are mediated by a release of prostaglandins mood and behavior different phases of menstrual cycle correlate with women s moods in some cases hormones released during menstrual cycle can cause behavioral changes in females mild to severe mood changes can occur menstrual cycle phase and ovarian hormones may contribute to increased empathy in women natural shift of hormone levels during different phases of menstrual cycle has been studied in conjunction with test scores when completing empathy exercises women in follicular stage of their menstrual cycle performed better than women in their midluteal phase a significant correlation between progesterone levels and ability to accurately recognize emotion was found performances on emotion recognition tasks were better when women had lower progesterone levels women in follicular stage showed higher emotion recognition accuracy than their midluteal phase counterparts women were found to react more to negative stimuli when in midluteal stage over women in follicular stage perhaps indicating more reactivity to social stress during that menstrual cycle phase overall it has been found that women in follicular phase demonstrated better performance in tasks that contain empathetic traits fear response in women during two different points in menstrual cycle has been examined when estrogen is highest in stage women are significantly better at identifying expressions of fear than women who were menstruating which is when estrogen levels are lowest women were equally able to identify happy faces demonstrating that fear response was a more powerful response to summarize menstrual cycle phase and estrogen levels correlates with women s fear processing however examination of daily moods in women with measuring ovarian hormones may indicate a less powerful connection in comparison to levels of stress or physical health ovarian hormones had less of an impact on overall mood this indicates that while changes of ovarian hormones may influence mood on a day to day level it does not influence mood more than other stressors do sexual feelings and behaviors change during menstrual cycle before and during ovulation high levels of estrogen and androgens result in women having a relatively increased interest in sexual activity unlike other mammals women may show interest in sexual activity across all days of menstrual cycle regardless of fertility mate choice behavior towards potential mating partners changes during different phases of menstrual cycle near ovulation women may have increased physical attraction and interest in attending social gatherings with men during fertile phase of cycle women appear to prefer males who are more masculine intensity of mate guarding differs across phases of cycle with increased mate guarding occurring when women are fertile during fertile phase many women experience more attraction fantasies and sexual interest for extra pair men but not for primary partner they also engage in extra pair flirtations and demonstrate a preference for extra pair copulation voice preferences for voice pitch change across cycle when seeking a short term mating partner women may prefer a male with a low voice pitch particularly during fertile phase during late follicular phase it is common for women demonstrate a preference for mates with a masculine deep voice research has also been conducted on attractiveness of female voice throughout cycle during their most fertile phase of menstrual cycle there is some evidence that female voices are rated as significantly more attractive this effect is not found with women on birth control pill smell women s preference for male s body odor can change across menstrual cycle males who score highly on dominance have been rated as sexier by females during fertile phase of menstrual cycle additionally during their most fertile phase of menstrual cycle women may show preference for odor of symmetrical men this effect is not found for women on birth control pill also during late follicular and ovulatory phases women prefer scent of masculine men scent of responsible for testosterone levels is highly preferred by women during peak of their fertility in menstrual cycle moreover women may demonstrate preference for men with a scent that indicates developmental stability with regard to women s smell across cycle some evidence indicates that men use olfactory cues in order to know if a woman is ovulating using a rating of women s odors women who are ovulating have been rated as more attractive by men men demonstrate preferences for scent of fertile women body preferences for facial features in mates can also change across cycle there has been no difference found in preference for long term mating partners during menstrual cycle however those seeking a short term relationship were more likely to choose a partner with more masculine features than usual this was found to be case especially during woman s high conception risk stage and when salivary testosterone was high however when women are in luteal non fertile phase they tend to prefer men and females with more feminine faces a preference is also shown for self resembling faces and apparent health in faces during luteal phase of cycle apparent health preferences were found to be strongest when progesterone levels were high additionally during fertile phase many women show a preference for men with darker skin pigmentation research on facial symmetry is mixed preferences for body features can change during fertile phase of cycle women seeking a short term partner demonstrate a preference for taller and muscular males women also show preferences of males with masculine bodies at peak fertility mixed research has been found regarding body symmetry preferences throughout different phases of cycle personality in short term mates during fertile phase women may show more attraction to dominant men who display social presence for long term mates shifts in desired trait preferences do not occur throughout cycle eating behavior females have been found to experience different eating habits at different stages of their menstrual cycle with food intake being higher during luteal phase than follicular phase food intake increases by approximately 10 during luteal phase compared to follicular phase various studies have shown that during luteal phase woman consume more carbohydrates proteins and fats and that 24 hour energy expenditure shows increases between 2 5 11 5 increasing intake during luteal phase may be related to higher preferences for sweet and fatty foods which occurs naturally and is enhanced during luteal phases of menstrual cycle this is due to higher metabolic demand during this phase in particular women tend to show a cravings for chocolate with higher cravings during luteal phase females with premenstrual syndrome pms report changes in appetite across menstrual cycle more than non sufferers of pms possibly due to their to changes in hormone levels in women with pms food intake is higher in luteal phase than follicular remaining symptoms of pms including mood changes and physical symptoms also occur during luteal phase no difference for preference of food types has been found between pms sufferers and non sufferers different levels of ovarian hormones at different stages of cycle have been used to explain eating behaviour changes progesterone has been shown to promote fat storage causing a higher intake of fatty foods during luteal phase when progesterone levels are higher additionally with a high estrogen level dopamine is ineffective in converting to noradrenaline a hormone which promotes eating therefore decreasing appetite in humans level of these ovarian hormones during menstrual cycle have been found to influence binge eating it is theorized that use of birth control pills should affect eating behaviour as they minimise or remove fluctuations in hormone levels neurotransmitter serotonin is also thought to play a role in food intake serotonin is responsible for inhibiting eating and controlling meal size among other things and is modulated in part by ovarian hormones a number of factors affect whether dieting will affect these menstrual processes age weight loss and diet itself first younger women are likely to experience menstrual irregularities due to their diet second menstrual abnormalities are more likely with more weight loss for example anovulatory cycles can occur as a result of adopting a restricted diet as well as engaging in a high amount of exercise finally cycle is affected more by a vegetarian diet compared to a non vegetarian diet substance abuse studies investigating effects of menstrual cycle on alcohol consumption have found mixed evidence however some evidence suggests that individuals consume more alcohol during luteal stage especially if these individuals are heavy drinkers or have a family history of alcohol abuse level of substance abuse increases with pms mostly with addictive substances such as nicotine tobacco and cocaine one theory behind this suggests this higher level of substance abuse is due to decreased self control as a result of higher metabolic demands during luteal phase menstrual disorders infrequent or irregular ovulation is called absence of ovulation is called anovulation normal menstrual flow can occur without ovulation preceding it an anovulatory cycle in some cycles follicular development may start but not be completed nevertheless estrogens will be formed and stimulate uterine lining anovulatory flow resulting from a very thick endometrium caused by prolonged continued high estrogen levels is called estrogen breakthrough bleeding anovulatory bleeding triggered by a sudden drop in estrogen levels is called withdrawal bleeding weschler 2002 p 107 anovulatory cycles commonly occur before menopause and in women with polycystic ovary syndrome very little flow less than 10 ml is called regular cycles with intervals of 21 days or fewer are frequent but irregular menstruation is known as sudden heavy flows or amounts greater than 80 ml are termed menorrhagia heavy menstruation that occurs frequently and irregularly is term for cycles with intervals exceeding 35 days is amenorrhea refers to more than three to six months without menses while not being pregnant during a woman s reproductive years term for painful periods is dysmenorrhea cycles and phases thumb 350px right menstrual cycle thumb 350px right flowchart of hormonal control of menstrual cycle menstrual cycle can be described by ovarian or uterine cycle ovarian cycle describes changes that occur in follicles of ovary whereas uterine cycle describes changes in endometrial lining of uterus both cycles can be divided into three phases ovarian cycle consists of follicular phase ovulation and luteal phase whereas uterine cycle consists of menstruation proliferative phase and secretory phase ovarian cycle follicular phase follicular phase is first part of ovarian cycle during this phase ovarian follicles mature and get ready to release an egg latter part of this phase overlaps with proliferative phase of uterine cycle through influence of a rise in follicle stimulating hormone fsh during first days of cycle a few ovarian follicles are stimulated these follicles which were present at birth and have been developing for better part of a year in a process known as compete with each other for dominance under influence of several hormones all but one of these follicles will stop growing while one dominant follicle in ovary will continue to maturity follicle that reaches maturity is called a tertiary or follicle and it contains ovum ovulation thumb an ovary about to release an egg ovulation is second phase of ovarian cycle in which a mature egg is released from ovarian follicles into oviduct ovulation test at duke fertility center retrieved 2 july 2011 during follicular phase estradiol suppresses release of luteinizing hormone lh from anterior pituitary gland when egg has nearly matured levels of estradiol reach a threshold above which this effect is reversed and estrogen stimulates production of a large amount of lh this process known as lh surge starts around day 12 of average cycle and may last 48 hours exact mechanism of these opposite responses of lh levels to estradiol is not well understood in animals a gonadotropin releasing hormone gnrh surge has been shown to precede lh surge suggesting that estrogen s main effect is on hypothalamus which controls gnrh secretion this may be enabled by presence of two different estrogen receptors in hypothalamus estrogen receptor alpha which is responsible for negative feedback estradiol lh loop and estrogen receptor beta which is responsible for positive estradiol lh relationship however in humans it has been shown that high levels of estradiol can provoke 32 increases in lh even when gnrh levels and pulse frequencies are held constant suggesting that estrogen acts directly on pituitary to provoke lh surge release of lh matures egg and weakens wall of follicle in ovary causing fully developed follicle to release its secondary oocyte if it is fertilized by a sperm secondary oocyte promptly matures into an and then becomes a mature ovum if it is not fertilized by a sperm secondary oocyte will degenerate mature ovum has a diameter of about 0 2 mm which of two ovaries left or right ovulates appears essentially random no known left and right co ordination exists occasionally both ovaries will release an egg if both eggs are fertilized result is fraternal twins after being released from ovary egg is swept into fallopian tube by fimbria which is a fringe of tissue at end of each fallopian tube after about a day an unfertilized egg will disintegrate or dissolve in fallopian tube fertilization by a spermatozoon when it occurs usually takes place in ampulla widest section of fallopian tubes a fertilized egg immediately begins process of embryogenesis or development developing embryo takes about three days to reach uterus and another three days to implant into endometrium it has usually reached blastocyst stage at time of implantation in some women ovulation features a characteristic pain called german term meaning middle pain sudden change in hormones at time of ovulation sometimes also causes light mid cycle blood flow weschler 2002 p 65 luteal phase luteal phase is final phase of ovarian cycle and it corresponds to secretory phase of uterine cycle during luteal phase pituitary hormones fsh and lh cause remaining parts of dominant follicle to transform into corpus luteum which produces progesterone increased progesterone in adrenals starts to induce production of estrogen hormones produced by corpus luteum also suppress production of fsh and lh that corpus luteum needs to maintain itself consequently level of fsh and lh fall quickly over time and corpus luteum subsequently falling levels of progesterone trigger menstruation and beginning of next cycle from time of ovulation until progesterone withdrawal has caused menstruation to begin process typically takes about two weeks with 14 days considered normal for an individual woman follicular phase often varies in length from cycle to cycle by contrast length of her luteal phase will be fairly consistent from cycle to cycle weschler 2002 p 47 loss of corpus luteum is prevented by fertilization of egg which is outer layer of resulting embryo containing structure blastocyst and later also becomes outer layer of placenta produces human chorionic gonadotropin hcg which is very similar to lh and which preserves corpus luteum corpus luteum can then continue to secrete progesterone to maintain new pregnancy most pregnancy tests look for presence of hcg uterine cycle uterine cycle has three phases menses proliferative secretory menstruation menstruation also called menstrual bleeding menses or a period is first phase of uterine cycle flow of menses normally serves as a sign that a woman has not become pregnant however this cannot be taken as certainty as a number of factors can cause bleeding during pregnancy some factors are specific to early pregnancy and some can cause heavy flow thumb levels of estradiol main estrogen progesterone luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone during menstrual cycle taking inter cycle and inter woman variability into account denotes normal regular menstruation that lasts for a few days usually 3 to 5 days but anywhere from 2 to 7 days is considered normal average blood loss during menstruation is 35 milliliters with 10 80 ml considered normal women who experience menorrhagia are more susceptible to iron deficiency than average person an enzyme called plasmin inhibits clotting in menstrual fluid painful cramping in abdomen back or upper thighs is common during first few days of menstruation severe uterine pain during menstruation is known as dysmenorrhea and it is most common among adolescents and younger women affecting about 67 2 of adolescent females when menstruation begins symptoms of premenstrual syndrome pms such as breast tenderness and irritability generally decrease sanitary products include pads and tampons and are essential items for use during menstruation proliferative phase proliferative phase is second phase of uterine cycle when estrogen causes lining of uterus to grow or proliferate during this time as they mature ovarian follicles secrete increasing amounts of estradiol and estrogen estrogens initiate formation of a new layer of endometrium in uterus histologically identified as proliferative endometrium estrogen also stimulates crypts in cervix to produce cervical mucus which causes vaginal discharge regardless of arousal and can be tracked by women practicing fertility awareness secretory phase secretory phase is final phase of uterine cycle and it corresponds to luteal phase of ovarian cycle during secretory phase corpus luteum produces progesterone which plays a vital role in making endometrium receptive to implantation of blastocyst and supportive of early pregnancy by increasing blood flow and uterine secretions and reducing contractility of smooth muscle in uterus it also has side effect of raising woman s basal body temperature weschler 2002 pp 361 2 ovulation suppression birth control thumb right half used blister pack of a combined oral contraceptive white pills are mainly for purpose of reminding woman to continue taking pills while some forms of birth control do not affect menstrual cycle hormonal contraceptives work by disrupting it progestogen negative feedback decreases pulse frequency of gonadotropin releasing hormone gnrh release by hypothalamus which decreases release of follicle stimulating hormone fsh and luteinizing hormone lh by anterior pituitary decreased levels of fsh inhibit follicular development preventing an increase in estradiol levels progestogen negative feedback and lack of estrogen positive feedback on lh release prevent a mid cycle lh surge inhibition of follicular development and absence of a lh surge prevent ovulation degree of ovulation suppression in progestogen only contraceptives depends on progestogen activity and dose low dose progestogen only contraceptives traditional progestogen only pills subdermal implants and and intrauterine system inhibit ovulation in about 50 of cycles and rely mainly on other effects such as thickening of cervical mucus for their contraceptive effectiveness intermediate dose progestogen only contraceptives progestogen only pill and subdermal implant allow some follicular development but more consistently inhibit ovulation in 97 99 of cycles same cervical mucus changes occur as with very low dose progestogens high dose progestogen only contraceptives provera and completely inhibit follicular development and ovulation combined hormonal contraceptives include both an estrogen and a progestogen estrogen negative feedback on anterior pituitary greatly decreases release of fsh which makes combined hormonal contraceptives more effective at inhibiting follicular development and preventing ovulation estrogen also reduces incidence of irregular breakthrough bleeding several combined hormonal contraceptives pill and contraceptive patch are usually used in a way that causes regular withdrawal bleeding in a normal cycle menstruation occurs when estrogen and progesterone levels drop rapidly temporarily discontinuing use of combined hormonal contraceptives a placebo week not using patch or ring for a week has a similar effect of causing uterine lining to shed if withdrawal bleeding is not desired combined hormonal contraceptives may be taken continuously although this increases risk of breakthrough bleeding breastfeeding breastfeeding causes negative feedback to occur on pulse secretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone gnrh and luteinizing hormone lh depending on strength of negative feedback breastfeeding women may experience complete suppression of follicular development but no ovulation or normal menstrual cycle may resume suppression of ovulation is more likely when suckling occurs more frequently production of prolactin in response to suckling is important to maintaining amenorrhea on average women who are fully breastfeeding whose infants suckle frequently experience a return of menstruation at fourteen and a half months postpartum there is a wide range of response among individual breastfeeding women however with some experiencing return of menstruation at two months and others remaining for up to 42 months postpartum which cites and january february 1987 13 4 5 other interventions ovulation induction and controlled ovarian are techniques used in assisted reproduction involving use of fertility medications to treat anovulation and or produce multiple ovarian follicles menstruation can be delayed by use of progesterone or progestins for this purpose oral administration of progesterone or progestin during cycle day 20 has been found to effectively delay menstruation for at least 20 days with menstruation starting after 2 3 days have passed since discontinuing regimen society and

thumb left awareness raising through education is taking place among women and girls to modify or eliminate practice of chhaupadi in nepal in some cultures females are isolated during menstruation as they are seen as unclean dangerous or bringing bad luck to those who encounter them these practices are common in parts of south asia especially in nepal chhaupadi is a social practice that occurs in western part of nepal for hindu women which prohibits a woman from participating in everyday activities during menstruation women are considered impure during this time and are kept out of house and

words month and moon moon even though average length of human menstrual cycle is similar to that of lunar cycle in modern humans there is no relation between two relationship is believed to be a coincidence light exposure does not appear to affect menstrual cycle in humans a meta analysis of studies from 1996 showed no correlation between human menstrual cycle and lunar cycle as cited by
