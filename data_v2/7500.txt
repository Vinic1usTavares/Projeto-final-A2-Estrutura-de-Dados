borough of bronx just north of triborough bridge from there route runs northward through hudson valley capital district and easternmost part of north country to canadian border in town of champlain at its north end i 87 continues into quebec as autoroute 15 a 15 i 87 connects with several regionally important roads i 95 in new york city new york state route 17 ny 17 future i 86 near harriman i 84 near newburgh and i 90 in albany route is longest intrastate interstate highway in interstate highway system highway is not contiguous with i 87 in north carolina i 87 was assigned in 1957 as part of establishment of interstate highway system portion of i 87 south of albany follows two freeways that predate interstate highway designation major deegan expressway locally known as deegan in new york city and new york state thruway from new york city line to albany north of albany i 87 follows adirondack northway a highway built in stages between 1957 and 1967 early proposals for i 87 called for route to take a more easterly course through hudson valley and extreme southwestern connecticut between new york city and newburgh these plans were scrapped in 1970 when i 87 was realigned onto thruway between westchester county and newburgh route description i 87 makes up most of major strategic corridor between new york city largest metropolitan area in u s and montreal second largest metropolitan area in canada formerly largest metro in canada new york state department of transportation nysdot considers route important for commerce as it connects with numerous highways in region and serves approximately 80 million people along mid atlantic states new england and quebec motorists can connect to multiple highways on i 87 to travel farther south along i 95 through mid atlantic states or through numerous other highways to travel farther east into new england highest ridership on highway is between bruckner expressway and george washington bridge in new york city remainder of route in new york city and its suburbs mainly suffern and south also has particularly high ridership especially over tappan zee bridge as it goes over hudson river upstate highest ridership is in albany and saratoga as those are most populated areas in north lowest ridership is section of thruway between newburgh and berkshire connector followed by northway through northern parts of adirondack park south of albany major deegan expressway left thumb looking north at deegan from 138th street i 87 and major deegan expressway begin in bronx at northern approach to triborough bridge where it connects to bruckner expressway i 278 at a directional t interchange route heads west from interchange paralleling loosely with harlem river through mott haven after highway makes a turn to north mirroring a change in nearby river s course it passes by yankee stadium on its way to highbridge where deegan connects to cross bronx expressway i 95 and u s route 1 or us 1 at eastern approach to

montreal history designation and early construction thumb right overhead signage at northern terminus of major deegan expressway origins of major deegan expressway date back to 1936 when regional plan association concluded that in order to relieve new york city s traffic problems a limited access truck accessible expressway should be built on west side of bronx this route would connect brand new triborough bridge to proposed new york state thruway in westchester county a section of expressway from bridge to grand concourse was completed in april 1939 highway was adorned with whitestone style light posts placed every of 6 lane highway each of which were in width expressway was designated as new york state route 1b ny 1b however designation was removed by 1947 in 1945 public works planner robert moses proposed extending highway to proposed thruway construction on extension began in 1950 and new route was opened in 1956 major deegan expressway is named for william francis deegan who died in 1932 he was an architect a major in army corps of engineers and a democratic political leader in new york city i 87 was assigned on august 14 1957 as part of establishment of interstate highway system highway initially utilized pre existing new york state thruway from albany to newburgh and in lower westchester county and major deegan expressway in new york city from newburgh to elmsford area i 87 was to follow a new highway running parallel to us 9 northward along eastern bank of hudson river to fishkill i 87 would then have followed proposed i 84 across hudson to rejoin thruway outside of newburgh after hudson river expressway proposal was cancelled in 1960s alignment of i 87 was shifted farther east to follow a newly completed freeway in route 22 corridor that started at i 287 in white plains then cut north through extreme southwest corner of connecticut before re entering new york and reaching i 84 at brewster i 87 then followed i 84 west to newburgh in 1970 i 87 designation was shifted to new york state thruway between newburgh and deegan expressway its previous alignment between brewster and white plains was redesignated as interstate 684 meanwhile all of adirondack northway portion of i 87 slated to extend from albany north to canadian border had yet to be built fuller road alternate spur leading south from adirondack northway to us 20 was originally intended to be part of southern albany expressway a proposed highway which would have connected northway with i 787 and run parallel to thruway between exits 23 and 24 left thumb map of ny 912q once part of i 87 northway was built in segments which became i 87 as they were completed and linked to pre existing route construction began in late 1950s on portion of northway between thruway and ny 7 near latham this segment was open to traffic by 1960 by which time work had begun on two additional segments from latham to malta at ny 67 and from us 9 in northern saratoga county to us 9 and ny 149 midway between glens falls and lake george village expressway was completed between latham and clifton park ny 146 and from us 9 south of glens falls to hudson river us 9 ny 149 section of highway was finished on may 26 1961 at a total cost of 9 5 million equivalent to in work on latham malta segment concluded on november 22 of that year with opening of a 6 6 million piece equivalent to in between ny 146 and ny 67 when latham malta segment was opened it featured one of few railroad grade crossings on an interstate highway just south of thaddeus kosciusko bridge over hudson this at grade crossing was removed within a couple of years when railroad line was cut backwards and crossing was no longer needed construction on portion of highway between two segments began part between ny 9p and ny 50 near saratoga springs was finished on july 19 1963 and entire ny 67 us 9 segment was completed by 1964 an extension linking ny 149 to ny 9n south of lake george village opened in mid 1963 by july 1963 northway was completed from canadian border south to exit 34 at keeseville additionally existing albany lake george section was extended slightly by may 1966 to serve northern part of lake george at time i 87 curved around western outskirts of village to end at ny 9n north of village on a highway built in mid 1966 state opened a 23 million section equivalent to in of northway between lake george and exit 26 at pottersville i 87 was reconfigured slightly near lake george as a result instead of heading east to ny 9n it continued north on a parallel routing to us 9 northway s former routing to ny 9n known infrequently today as lake george connector is now ny 912q an unsigned reference route in length ny 912q has one intermediate interchange with us 9 on march 5 1967 lake george pottersville portion of i 87 was chosen as america s most scenic new highway of 1966 by parade magazine it became second new york highway to win award as a stretch of ny 17 in broome and delaware counties was selected for title in 1964 filling gaps gap in northway between pottersville and keeseville was narrowed considerably by july 1967 with completion of a segment from pottersville to exit 30 at underwood it was closed further on july 25 1967 with opening of a stretch near keeseville between exits 34 and 33 last section of northway to be built a stretch between underwood and keeseville exit 33 was finished on august 31 1967 completion of northway linked new york city with montreal by way of a direct limited access highway with i 87 becoming a 15 at canadian border total cost to build adirondack northway was 208 million equivalent to in another gap in i 87 existed in downstate new york as plan to build i 87 along proposed hudson river expressway had been scrapped by 1962 instead i 87 was now proposed to begin in port chester and follow a new routing through purchase armonk and katonah to brewster where it would join i 84 routing was modified slightly by 1968 i 87 still began in new york city then overlapped with i 287 east to purchase from there i 87 headed north along now open expressway to armonk where it ended at ny 22 another portion of highway from goldens bridge ny 138 to brewster was open as well while part from armonk to katonah was under construction this segment as well as part from katonah to goldens bridge was completed by 1971 on january 1 1970 i 87 was rerouted between elmsford and newburgh to follow mainline of thruway instead leaving purchase brewster freeway to become i 684 tappan zee bridge replacement thumb original tappan zee bridge original tappan zee bridge carrying concurrency of new york state thruway i 87 and i 287 was a cantilever bridge built during 1952 55 bridge was long and spanned hudson at its second widest point before its replacement in 2017 deteriorating structure carried an average of 138 000 vehicles per day substantially more traffic than its designed capacity during its first decade bridge carried fewer than 40 000 vehicles per day part of justification for replacing bridge stems from its construction immediately following korean war on a low budget of only 81 million unlike other major bridges in metropolitan new york tappan zee was designed to last only 50 years federal highway administration issued a report in october 2011 designating tappan zee s replacement to be a dual span twin bridge construction officially began in october 2013 with new spans being built to north of existing bridge new bridge connects to existing highway approaches of i 87 and i 287 on both river banks northbound westbound span opened on august 25 2017 southbound eastbound traffic remained on old bridge until october 6 2017 at that point southbound eastbound traffic shifted to westbound span of new bridge and old bridge closed bridge s eastbound span opened to traffic on september 11 2018 upon completion new tappan zee bridge became one of longest cable stayed spans in nation in june 2017 tappan zee bridge was renamed governor mario m cuomo bridge renaming resulted in controversy from public who wanted to keep name to honor tappan indians and dutch who previously resided in area in august 2019 some signs for bridge were replaced because they did not include governor s middle initial in name other developments in wake of former new york yankees player joe dimaggio s death on march 8 1999 governor george pataki proposed renaming deegan expressway to joe dimaggio highway however new york city mayor rudy giuliani favored renaming west side highway for dimaggio instead pataki agreed to giuliani s proposal one week later a long stretch of northway through adirondack park had been an zone for cellular telephone service in 2007 a driver who crashed off road was unable to summon help prompting messages from local governments to telephone companies to add new wireless towers to address problem and warning signs to inform travelers of so called dark zone throughout this area roadside emergency call boxes are located approximately every two miles on both sides of roadway these boxes use a two way uhf radio network to connect directly to new york state police dispatchers first of 13 new cellular phone towers along i 87 was installed in october 2008 a second cellular phone tower was completed just one month later exit 6 on adirondack northway was originally a diamond interchange construction to convert junction into a single point urban interchange began in mid 2008 and was completed on september 12 2010 total cost of project was 41 9 million albany airport connector until october 2019 there was no exit 3 on northway section of i 87 as this number was reserved for an interchange with now cancelled i 687 a project to improve access to albany international airport at exit4 is currently underway two old deteriorating bridges at exit4 which had carried 102 000 vehicles a day were replaced once new replacement bridges were built old bridges were demolished construction began in february 2015 and was completed on october 31 2015 in august 2018 plans were announced to build a new on northway providing more direct access from both directions to albany international airport project will be completed by lancaster development and tully construction at a cost of 50 million and will be completed by mid 2020 as part of interchange a flyover ramp is currently being constructed over northway allowing northbound and traffic direct access to albany shaker road ny 155 near desmond hotel albany southbound traffic is able to both exit and enter to from connector southbound exit and entrance for connector exit 3 opened on october 20th 2019 traffic signals were installed at intersection of albany shaker road and connector northbound exit is planned to
