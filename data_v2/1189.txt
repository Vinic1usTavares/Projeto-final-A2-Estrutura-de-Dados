technologies that allowed higher quality environments and characters ghost of sparta offers over 25 more gameplay than its psp predecessor chains of olympus while adding more enemies on screen and a greater number of boss encounters development of ghost of sparta took 23 months to complete chains of olympus game director ru weerasuriya did not return to direct due to his busy schedule at ready at dawn so dana jan lead level designer on chains of olympus became director at comic con 2010 jan noted that when development began in 2008 goal was to make game bigger than chains of olympus which had pushed psp to its functional limits jan stated that ghost of sparta has taken psp to its absolute capacity with one additional feature being more on screen foes game concept was originally used as a teaser for players who obtained platinum trophy from god of war iii trophy revealed a site called spartansstandtall com it initially featured a simple animation of torrential rain falling into a body of water and a spartan shield encompassed by a meter on screen meter was speculated to have been filled by players achieving trophy and reaching site on may 4 2010 meter reached maximum and site was updated for a final time revealing an image of kratos standing above a reflection and logo for god of war ghost of sparta as official site on june 15 2010 sony displayed a cinematic trailer narrated by linda hunt during their 2010 electronic entertainment expo e3 press conference thumb right artwork of kratos brother deimos dana jan stated reason they chose to have game take place between god of war and god of war ii was because it seemed to make a lot of sense to fill in that void jan said with some scenes team wasn t sure how gamers would react because god of war usually doesn t slow down and team worried if these scenes would be captivating enough to keep player interested and still feel like god of war for puzzles jan stated that they tried to make outcomes unexpected because players assume that they will have to push something carry a body or smash something with blades hinting at a possible future installment from ready at dawn jan stated that he is intrigued by flashbacks in god of war and god of war ii and that there s definitely a back story to kratos that nobody s touched on for character deimos jan stated that first reference was actually in chains of olympus finale in game helios states do you think that they ll survive and athena says they must jan said that this line was purposefully put in that game and that there are also references to deimos in god of war iii he confirmed that kratos and deimos are not twins and that while kratos father is zeus deimos father is more of a mystery he confirmed that a character named dominus appears in game kratos original name and scene featuring a soldier named dominus was a nod to that he also stated that he does not know where god of war betrayal fits chronologically in series several voice actors returned to reprise their roles from previous installments including terrence c carson erin torpey gideon emery steven blum paul eiding and linda hunt who voiced kratos athena poseidon ares gravedigger and
