enterprise but jackson was finished batsman batsman who knows one stroke for each ball and executes that stroke with an artistry that has no parallel to this day williams p 37 before 1930 tour of england experts such as frank woolley percy fender and maurice tate rated jackson as more likely to succeed in english conditions bradman was seen as too unorthodox or even cross batted for softer
