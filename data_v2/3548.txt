included two singles johnny s got a gun and somebody s tearin flag latter of which was previously found on right for flight both of these songs drew minor media attention to raven as many radio stations took johnny s got a gun out of rotation in wake of various school shootings while television network cmt refused to air video for somebody s tearin flag due to concerns that song did not fit network s intended programming demographics at time raven felt that songs failures were due to a preconception that artists of his age were not seen as suitable for mainstream country radio combined

recordings of existing material with accompaniment from bluegrass band carolina road musical styles raven s musical style is defined largely by his strong influence of cajun music along with his lyric driven songs and distinct vocal delivery according to raven he drew musical influence from his father who largely listened to country music but he also drew influence from prominence of cajun music in his native louisiana an uncredited 1984 article in stated that raven s style at time was characterized by his emotive vocals and musical as well as lyrical hooks thomas goldsmith in encyclopedia of country music wrote that raven s style was defined by direct soulful singing skillful songwriting and cajun heritage many of his songs have also displayed influences of reggae and caribbean music such as reggae influenced guitar riffs played by session guitarist reggie young on i should ve called and caribbean sway described by newport news daily press writer billy warden in a review of joe knows how to live joe edwards of associated press said that raven has a deep masculine voice that pours out incisive songs in a style he describes as cajun reggae cajun caribbean electric cajun similarly susan beyer wrote in a review of right for flight that h is voice has a soulful edge with a nice strip of grit right in middle and said that instead of whomping us from first beats with accordions and cajun calls he finds delicacy in cajun legacy influence on other artists several of raven s songs were later successful for other artists among his early successes as a songwriter were four top ten
