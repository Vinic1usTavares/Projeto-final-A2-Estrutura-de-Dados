viet nam quoc dan dang chu han vietnamese nationalist party abbreviated vnqdd or viet quoc was a nationalist and moderate socialist political party that sought independence from french colonial rule in vietnam during early 20th century its origins lie in mid 1920s when a group of young hanoi based intellectuals began publishing revolutionary material in 1927 after publishing house failed because of french harassment and censorship vnqdd was formed under leadership of nguyen thai hoc modelling itself on republic of china s kuomintang same 3 characters in chu han vnqdd gained a following among northerners particularly teachers and intellectuals party which was less successful among peasants and industrial workers was organised in small clandestine cells from 1928 vnqdd attracted attention through its assassinations of french officials and vietnamese collaborators a turning point came in february 1929 with bazin assassination killing of a french labour recruiter widely despised by local vietnamese people although perpetrators precise affiliation was unclear french colonial authorities held vnqdd responsible between 300 and 400 of party s approximately 1 500 members were detained in resulting crackdown many of leaders were arrested but hoc managed to escape in late 1929 party was weakened by an internal split under increasing french pressure vnqdd leadership switched tack replacing a strategy of isolated clandestine attacks against individuals with a plan to expel french in a single blow with a large scale popular uprising after stockpiling home made weapons vnqdd launched yen bai mutiny on february 10 1930 with aim of sparking a widespread revolt vnqdd forces combined with disaffected vietnamese troops who mutinied against french colonial army mutiny was quickly put down with heavy french retribution hoc and other leading figures were captured and executed and vnqdd never regained its political strength in country some remaining factions sought peaceful means of struggle while other groups fled across border to kuomintang bases in yunnan province of china where they received arms and training during 1930s party was eclipsed by ho chi minh s indochinese communist party icp vietnam was occupied by japan during world war ii and in chaos that followed japanese surrender in 1945 vnqdd and icp briefly joined forces in fight for vietnamese independence however after a falling out ho purged vnqdd leaving his communist dominated viet minh unchallenged as foremost anti colonial militant organisation as a part of post war settlement that ended first indochina war vietnam was partitioned into two zones remnants of vnqdd fled to capitalist south where they remained until fall of saigon in 1975 and reunification of vietnam under communist rule today party survives only among overseas vietnamese toc origins french involvement in vietnam started in late 18th century when catholic priest pigneau de behaine assisted nguyen anh to found nguyen dynasty by recruiting french volunteers in return nguyen anh who took reign name gia long allowed catholic missionaries to operate in vietnam however relations became strained under gia long s successor minh mang as missionaries sought to incite revolts in an attempt to enthrone a catholic this prompted anti christian edicts and in 1858 a french invasion of vietnam was mounted ostensibly to protect catholicism but in reality for colonial purposes french steadily made gains and completed colonization of vietnam in 1883 armed revolts against colonial rule occurred regularly most notably through can vuong movement of late 1880s in early 20th century 1916 southern revolts and thai nguyen uprising were notable disruptions to french administration in late 1925 a small group of young hanoi based intellectuals led by a teacher named pham tuan tai and his brother pham tuan lam started nam dong thu xa southeast asia publishing house they aimed to promote violent revolution as a means of gaining independence for vietnam from french colonization and published books and brochures about sun yat sen and chinese revolution of 1911 as well as opening a free school to teach quoc ngu romanised vietnamese script to working class group soon attracted support of other progressive young northerners including students and teachers led by nguyen thai hoc hoc was an alumnus of hanoi s commercial school who had been stripped of a scholarship because of his mediocre academic performance hammer 1955 p 82 duiker p 155 hoc had previously tried to initiate peaceful reforms by making written submissions to french authorities but these were ignored and his attempt to foster policy change through publication of a magazine never materialized due to refusal of a license harassment and censorship imposed by french colonial authorities led to commercial failure of nam dong thu xa by autumn of 1927 group s priorities turned towards more direct political action in a bid to appeal to more radical elements in north membership grew to around 200 distributed among 18 cells in 14 provinces across northern and central vietnam duiker p 156 at time nationalist sentiment had been on increase in vietnam french colonial authorities were bringing more vietnamese into administration and there was a small but growing proportion who were exposed to western education as a result they became aware of french ideals such as liberte egalite fraternite republicanism and democracy which sharply contrasted to racial inequality and stratified system of colonial elite ruling masses in vietnam there was also an increasing awareness of political writings of montesquieu and jean jacques rousseau which stoked a desire for civil and political rights combined with knowledge of japanese victory over russia in 1905 which gave people confidence that asians could defeat western powers luong 2010 pp 81 82 formation thumb right 222px flag of vietnamese nationalist party used from 1929 to

mutiny viet nam quoc dan dang vnqdd was formed at a meeting in hanoi on december 25 1927 with nguyen thai hoc as party s first leader it was vietnam s first home grown revolutionary party established three years before indochinese communist party party advocated socialism but at outset there was considerable debate over its other fundamental objectives many wanted it to promote worldwide revolution rather than limiting itself to campaigning for an independent vietnamese republic but there were fears that this would lead to accusations of communism putting off potential vietnamese supporters who yearned above all for independence in a bid for moderation final statement was a compromise that read a manifesto released in february 1930 showed that vnqdd heavily based its rhetoric on appealing to resentment against system of racial inequality and french imposition of capitalism luong 2010 pp 82 83 it appealed to populace to rise up against colonisation and poor treatment of vietnamese people it assailed french for restricting vietnamese people s ability to study discuss policy and associate and what it perceived as exploitative capitalist policies that enriched french enterprises while leaving vietnamese people unhealthy it criticised colonial administration which it saw as corrupt and encouraging low level vietnamese bureaucrats to mistreat their compatriots and said that ouster to french rule was necessary to stop elimination process against vietnamese race in order to attain its primary aim of independence vnqdd had three principles by which it intended to operate first was nationalism under which people of all ethnic groups in vietnam were to be citizens of a sovereign nation secondly democracy was to give citizens right to vote impeach elected officials ratify and abolish laws third and final principle was to implement socialist controls on economy and restricting capitalism through nationalisation guaranteed minimum working conditions and land reform this was ultimately aimed towards reducing income inequality luong 2010 p 85 there had been a debate over socioeconomic bent of party when it was formed with some advocating communism and others private property but position reached was not dissimilar from an existing vietnamese social norm where villagers often owned land communally although social hierarchies still existed although socioeconomic side of vnqdd agenda was not as heavily promoted at a high political level as other two principles there was a strong push at grassroots level to implement more socialist systems luong 2010 p 86 although vnqdd modelled itself on sun yat sen s chinese nationalist party kuomintang or kmt later led by chiang kai shek even down to copying nationalist party designation it had no direct relationship with its chinese counterpart and in fact did not gain much attention outside vietnam until yen bay mutiny in 1930 however in elucidating its primary objective of national independence it did rely ideologically on suns three principles of people nationalism people s welfare and human rights luong 2010 p 88 like kmt it was a clandestine organisation held together with tight discipline its basic unit was cell above which there were several levels of administration including provincial regional and central committees also like kmt vnqdd s revolutionary strategy envisaged a military takeover followed by a period of political training for population before a constitutional government could take control most party members were teachers young people who had been exposed to a western education and political theory employees of french colonial government confucian oriented village notables or non commissioned officers in colonial army in particular they sought to cultivate support among warrant officers who would then be able to mobilise their enlisted men luong 2010 p 89 this led to a membership based heavily on traditional asian and western style political elites vnqdd campaigned mainly among these facets of society there were few workers or peasants in its support base and those that were supporters of vnqdd were put into affiliated organisations that were adjunct to parent organisation party s popularity was based on a groundswell of anti french feeling in northern vietnam in 1920s many writers had assailed society for glorifying military actions against china champa siam and cambodia vietnam s historical rivals while neglecting to oppose french colonialism marr 1981 p 301 vnqdd admitted many female members which was quite revolutionary for time tucker p 489 it set about seeking alliances with other nationalist factions in vietnam in a meeting on july 4 1928 central committee appealed for unity among vietnamese revolutionary movements sending delegates to meet with other organisations struggling for independence preliminary contacts did not yield any concrete alliances duiker p 157 talks with new vietnam revolutionary party nvrp failed because nvrp wanted a more centralised and structured party organisation although vnqdd did manage to absorb nvrp branch in hung hoa vnqdd also assailed vietnamese communists of ho chi minh for betraying leading nationalist of time phan boi chau to french in return for a financial reward ho had done this to eliminate other nationalist rivals currey pp 15 16 20 vnqdd would later be on receiving end of another of ho s manoeuvres initial activities financial problems compounded vnqdd s difficulties money was needed to set up a commercial enterprise a cover for revolutionaries to meet and plot and for raising funds for this purpose a hotel restaurant named vietnam hotel was opened in september 1928 french colonial authorities were aware of real purpose of business and put it under surveillance without taking further preliminary action first notable reorganisation of vnqdd was in december when nguyen khac nhu replaced hoc as chairman three proto governmental organs were created to form legislative executive and judicial arms of government records of french secret service estimated that by early 1929 vnqdd consisted of approximately 1 500 members in 120 cells mostly in areas around red river delta intelligence reported that most members were students minor merchants or low level bureaucrats in french administration report stated that there were landlords and wealthy peasants among members but that few were of scholar gentry mandarin rank according to historian cecil b currey vnqdd s lower class origins made it in many ways closer to labouring poor than were communists many of whom were from established middle class families currey p 20 at time two other notable nationalist organisations were communists and new vietnam revolutionary party and although they had different visions of a post independence nation both competed with vnqdd in attracting support of small educated urban class in late 1920s around half of communists were from bourgeoise backgrounds luong 2010 p 87 beginning in 1928 vnqdd attracted substantial vietnamese support provoking increased attention from french colonial administration this came after a vnqdd death squad killed several french officials and vietnamese collaborators who had a reputation for cruelty towards vietnamese populace tucker p 442 assassination of bazin assassination of hanoi based french labour recruiter herve bazin on february 9 1929 was a turning point that marked beginning of vnqdd s decline a graduate of ecole coloniale in paris bazin directed recruitment of vietnamese labourers to work on colonial plantations recruiting techniques often included beating or coercion because foremen who did recruiting received a commission for each enlisted worker on plantations living conditions were poor and remuneration was low leading to widespread indignation in response vietnamese hatred of bazin led to thoughts of an assassination a group of workers approached vnqdd with a proposal to kill bazin sources disagree on whether party adopted a policy of sanctioning assassination one account is that hoc felt that assassinations were pointless because they would only prompt a crackdown by french surete thereby weakening party he felt that it was better to strengthen party until time was ripe to overthrow french viewing bazin as a mere twig on tree of colonial apparatus duiker pp 160 161 another view is that senior vnqdd leaders felt that killing bazin was necessary so that party would appear to be relevant to workers involved in industry or commerce given that communists had begun to target this demographic for their recruitment drives first account says that turned down by vnqdd leadership one of assassination s proponents it is unclear whether or not he was a party member created his own plot with an accomplice he shot and killed bazin on february 9 1929 as frenchman left his mistress s house french attributed attack to vnqdd and reacted by apprehending all party members they could find between three and four hundred men were rounded up including 36 government clerks 13 french government officials 36 schoolteachers 39 merchants 37 landowners and 40 military personnel subsequent trials resulted in 78 men being convicted and sentenced to jail terms ranging between five and twenty years arrests severely depleted vnqdd leadership most of central committee were captured though hoc and nhu were among few who escaped from a raid on their hideout at vietnam hotel internal split and change in strategy in 1929 vnqdd split when a faction led by nguyen nghiep began to disobey party orders and was therefore expelled from central committee some sources claim that nghiep had formed a breakaway party and had begun secret contacts with french authorities perturbed by those who betrayed fellow members to french and problems this behaviour caused hoc convened a meeting to tighten regulations in mid 1929 at village of lac dao along gia lam haiphong railway this was also occasion for a shift in strategy hoc argued for a general uprising citing rising discontent among vietnamese soldiers in colonial army more moderate party leaders believed this move to be premature and cautioned against it but hoc s stature meant he prevailed in shifting party s orientation towards violent struggle one of arguments presented for large scale violence was that french response to bazin assassination meant that party s strength could decline in long term marr 1981 pp 377 378 plan was to provoke a series of uprisings at military posts around red river delta in early 1930 where vnqdd forces would join vietnamese soldiers in an attack on two major northern cities of hanoi and haiphong leaders agreed to restrict their uprisings to tonkin because party was weak elsewhere duiker pp 161 162 for remainder of 1929 party prepared for revolt they located and manufactured weapons storing them in hidden depots preparation was hindered by french police particularly seizure of arms caches duiker p 162 recruitment campaigns and grassroots activist drives were put in place even though vnqdd were realistic and understood that their assault was unlikely to succeed village elders were used to mobilise neighbours into political movement their logic was even if victory is not achieved we will fully mature as human beings with our heroic efforts luong 2010 p 90 yen bai mutiny at around 01 30 on monday february 10 1930 approximately 40 troops belonging to 2nd battalion of fourth regiment de tirailleurs stationed at yen bai reinforced by around 60 civilian members of vnqdd attacked their 29 french officers and warrant officers rettig p 310 rebels had intended to split into three groups first group was to infiltrate infantry kill french ncos in their beds and raise support among vietnamese troops second supported by vnqdd civilians was to break into post headquarters and third group would enter officers quarters duiker p 163 french were caught off guard five were killed and three seriously wounded mutineers isolated a few more french officers from their men even managing to raise vnqdd flag above one of buildings about two hours later however it became apparent that badly coordinated uprising had failed and remaining 550 vietnamese soldiers helped quell rebellion rather than participate in it insurrectionists had failed to liquidate garde indigene town post and could not convince frightened townspeople to join them in a general revolt at 07 30 a french indochinese counterattack scattered mutineers two hours later order was re established in yen bai that same evening two further insurrectionary attempts failed in son duong sector a raid on garde indigene post in hung hoa was repelled by vietnamese guards who appeared to have been tipped off in nearby town of kinh khe vnqdd members killed instructor nguyen quang kinh and one of his wives after destroying garde indigene post in lam thao vnqdd briefly seized control of district seat at sunrise a new garde indigene unit arrived and inflicted heavy losses on insurgents mortally wounding nhu rettig p 311 aware of events in upper delta region pho duc chinh fled and abandoned a planned attack on son tay garrison but he was captured a few days later by french authorities on february 10 a vnqdd member injured a policeman at a hanoi checkpoint at night arts students threw bombs at government buildings which they regarded as part of repressive power of colonial state on night of february 15 16 hoc and his remaining forces seized nearby villages of phu duc and vinh bao in thai binh and hai duong provinces respectively for a few hours in second village vnqdd killed local mandarin of french colonial government tri on february 16 french warplanes responded by bombarding vnqdd s last base at co am village on same day tonkin s resident superior rene robin dispatched 200 gardes indigenes eight french commanders and two surete inspectors a few further violent incidents occurred until february 22 when governor general pierre pasquier declared that insurrection had been defeated hoc and his lieutenants chinh and nguyen thanh loi were apprehended a series of trials were held to prosecute those arrested during uprising largest number of death penalties was handed down by first criminal commission which convened at yen bay among 87 people found guilty at yen bay 46 were servicemen some argued in their own defence that they had been surprised and forced to take part in insurrection of 87 convicted 39 were sentenced to death five to deportation 33 to life sentences of forced labour nine to 20 years imprisonment and one to five years of forced labour of those condemned to death 24 were civilians and 15 were servicemen rettig p 316 presidential pardons reduced number of death penalties from 39 to 13 hoc and chinh were among 13 who were executed on june 17 1930 condemned men cried viet nam as guillotine fell hoc wrote a final plea to french in a letter that claimed that he had always wanted to cooperate with french authorities but that their intransigence had forced him to revolt hoc contended that france could only stay in indochina if they dropped their brutal policies and became more amiable towards vietnamese vnqdd leader called for universal education training in commerce and industry and an end to corrupt practices of french installed mandarins duiker p 164 exile in yunnan following yen bay vnqdd became more diffuse with many factions effectively acting virtually autonomously of one another marr 1995

some of nghiep s supporters were still active yunnan vnqdd was in fact a section of chinese kuomintang who protected its members from chinese government while funds were raised by robbery and extortion along sino vietnamese border this eventually led to a chinese government crackdown but vnqdd members continued to train at yunnan military school some enlisted in nationalist chinese army

party from his cell upon his release in 1933 nghiep consolidated party with similar groups in area including some followers of phan boi chau who had formed a canton based organisation with similar aims in 1925 chau s group had formed in opposition to communist tendencies of ho chi minh s revolutionary youth league however ho betrayed chau to eliminate a potential rival and to pocket a reward currey pp 15 20 with nationalist chinese aid chau s followers had set up a league of oppressed oriental peoples a pan asian group that ended in failure in 1932 league made point of declaring a provisional indochinese government at canton hammer 1955 p 84 in july 1933 chau s group was integrated into nghiep s yunnan organisation in 1935 nghiep surrendered to french consulate in shanghai remainder of vnqdd was paralysed by infighting and began losing political relevance with only moderate activity until outbreak of world war ii and japan s invasion of french indochina in 1940 they attempted to organise workers along yunnan railway threatening occasional border assaults with little success duiker p 165 vnqdd was gradually overshadowed as leading vietnamese independence organisation by ho s indochinese communist party icp tucker p 175 in 1940 ho arrived in yunnan which was a hotbed of both icp and vnqdd activity he initiated collaboration between icp and other nationalists such as vnqdd at time world war ii had broken out and japan had conquered most of eastern china and replaced french in vietnam ho moved east to neighbouring province of guangxi where

vnqdd chinese kmt general zhang created league to further chinese influence in indochina against french and japanese its stated goal was for unity with china under three principles of people created by kmt founder dr sun and opposition to vietnamese and french imperialists revolutionary league was controlled by nguyen hai than who was born in china and could not speak vietnamese general zhang shrewdly blocked communists of vietnam and ho chi minh from entering league as his main goal was chinese influence in indochina kmt utilized these vietnamese nationalists during world war ii against japanese forces at one stage communists made an appeal for other vietnamese anti colonialists to join forces but condemned khanh as an opportunist and fake revolutionary in their letter marr 1995 p 196 cooperation in border area lasted for only a few months before vnqdd officials complained to local kmt officials that communists led by dong and vo nguyen giap were attempting to dominate league this prompted local authorities to shut down front s activities duiker pp 272 273 post world war ii in march 1945 vnqdd received a boost when imperial japan which had occupied vietnam since 1941 deposed french administration and installed empire of vietnam a puppet regime marr 1995 pp 56 61 this resulted in release of some anti french activists including vnqdd members marr 1995 p 42 on august 15 1945 japanese surrendered to republic of china in vietnam general lu han lu han was representative of nationalist army government of republic of china favored vnqdd over viet minh which led to ho s

fearing that communists would perpetrate electoral fraud currey p 107 after seizure of power hundreds of vnqdd members returned from china only to be killed at border by vietminh nevertheless vnqdd arrived in northern vietnam with arms and supplies from kmt in addition to its prestige as a vietnamese nationalist organisation nationalist china backed vnqdd in hope of gaining more influence over its southern neighbour ho tried to broaden his support in order to strengthen himself in addition to decreasing chinese and french power he hoped that by co opting vnqdd members he could shut out kmt

patti who was based in kunming and northern vietnam reported that vnqdd were hopelessly disoriented politically and felt that they had no idea of how to run a government he speculated that vnqdd were driven by desires for personal power and economic gain giap accused them of being bandits military and newspaper attacks between groups occurred regularly but a power sharing agreement was put in place until elections occurred in order to end attacks and strengthen national unity to further goal of independence currey p 110 communists also allowed vnqdd to continue printing material marr 1981 p 409 however agreement was ineffective in meantime vnqdd kidnapped giap and propaganda minister tran huy lieu and held them for three weeks until ho agreed to remove giap and lieu from cabinet as a result vnqdd s vu hong khanh became defence minister with giap as his deputy what vnqdd and other non communist nationalists thought to be an equitable power sharing agreement turned out to be a ruse every non communist minister had a communist deputy and if former refused to approve a decree vietminh official would do so many ministers were excluded from knowing details of their portfolio khanh was forbidden to see any military statistics and some were forbidden to attend cabinet meetings in one case minister of social works became a factory worker because he was forced to remain politically idle currey p 111 meanwhile giap was able to stymie activities of vnqdd officials of higher rank in coalition government aside from shutting down ability of vnqdd officials to disseminate information he often ordered his men to start riots and street brawls at public vnqdd events ho scheduled elections for december 23 but he made a deal with vnqdd and dong minh hoi which assured them of 50 and 20
