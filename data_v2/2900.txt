japanese subsidiary sega enterprises ltd with its arcade business in decline sega enterprises ltd president nakayama advocated for company to use its hardware expertise to move into home consumer market in japan this led to sega s development of a computer sc 3000 learning that nintendo was developing a games only console famicom sega developed its first home video game system sg 1000 alongside sc 3000 rebranded versions of sg 1000 were released in several other markets worldwide due in part to sg 1000 s steadier stream of releases coupled with a recall on famicom units by nintendo sg 1000 sold 160 000 units in 1983 which far exceeded sega s projection of 50 000 in first year however by 1984 famicom began to outpace sg 1000 this was in part because nintendo expanded its game library by courting third party developers whereas sega was hesitant to collaborate with companies with which they were competing in arcades shortly after launch of sg 1000 and death of company founder charles gulf and western began to sell off its secondary businesses nakayama and rosen arranged a management buyout of japanese subsidiary in 1984 with financial backing from csk corporation a

directors disapproved but it was approved by nakayama who told kalinske i hired you to make decisions for europe and americas so go ahead and do it in large part due to popularity of sonic hedgehog

sonic hedgehog would be a dreamcast launch game company promoted game with a large scale public demonstration at tokyo forum hall however sega could not ship enough consoles for dreamcast s japanese

irimajiri estimated that an additional 200 000 to 300 000 dreamcast units could have been sold with sufficient supply he hoped to sell over 1 million dreamcast units in japan by february 1999 but less than 900 000 were sold low sales undermined sega s attempts to build up a sufficient installed base to ensure dreamcast s survival after arrival of competition from other manufacturers prior to western launch sega reduced price of dreamcast to jpy 19 900 effectively making hardware unprofitable but increasing sales on august 11 1999 sega of america confirmed that stolar had been fired peter moore whom stolar had hired as a sega of america executive only six months before was placed in charge of north american launch dreamcast launched in north america on september 9 1999 at a price of

in what one report called a highly publicized vaporware like announcement sony revealed first details of its next generation playstation same year nintendo announced that its next generation console would meet or exceed anything on market and microsoft began development of its own console xbox sega s initial momentum proved fleeting as u s dreamcast sales which exceeded 1 5 million by end of 1999 began to decline as early as january 2000 poor japanese sales contributed to sega s y 42 88 billion 404 million consolidated net loss in fiscal year ending march 2000 this followed a similar loss of y 42 881 billion previous year and marked sega s third consecutive annual loss sega s overall sales for term increased 27 4 percent and dreamcast sales in north america and europe greatly exceeded company s expectations however this coincided with a decrease in profitability due to investments required to launch dreamcast in western markets and poor software sales in japan at same time increasingly poor market conditions reduced profitability of sega s japanese arcade business prompting company to close 246 locations moore stated that dreamcast would need to sell 5 million units in u s by end of 2000 to remain a viable platform but sega fell short of this goal with some 3 million units sold moreover sega s attempts to spur dreamcast sales through lower prices and cash rebates caused escalating financial losses in march 2001 sega posted a consolidated net loss of y 51 7 billion 417 5 million while playstation 2 s october 26 u s launch was marred by shortages this did not benefit dreamcast as much as expected as many disappointed consumers continued to wait for a ps2 or purchased a psone eventually sony and nintendo held 50 and 35 percent of u s video game market
