grandmaster flash s protest rap song message lowe and hague created a obsessive rhythm punch for music replacing song s previously sparse beats and minimal keyboard lines tennant started to write song when he was staying at his cousin s house in nottingham while watching a gangster film just when he was going to sleep he came up with lines sometimes you re better off dead there s a gun in your hand and it s pointing at your head lyrics were inspired by t s eliot s poem waste land particularly in use of different narrative voices and arcane references song s lyrics are largely concerned with class inner city pressure tennant later said that some listeners had assumed song referred to prostitutes but was actually about rough boys getting a bit of posh lyric from lake geneva to finland station refers to train route taken by vladimir lenin when he was smuggled by germans to russia during world war i a pivotal event in russian revolution indeed it is highly likely lyric was inspired by book to finland station by edmund wilson a famous work on history of revolutionary thought and socialism that tennant would have at least heard of if not read as a student bobby orlando produced

west end girls has been generally well received by music critics stephen thomas erlewine from allmusic in a review of album please called song hypnotic adding that it s not only a classic dance single it s a classic pop single in a review for group s second studio album actually rob hoerburger from rolling stone magazine commented that west end girls was as catchy as anything on radio in 1986 praising its enticing bass line and foreboding synth riffs but felt that it was almost nullified by peevish spoken asides and cryptic posturing of duo s lyrics in a review of live album concrete michael hubbard from musicomh said that west end girls was one of songs that round out a collection that never feels too long or superfluous adding that it goes some way to installing tennant and lowe as national treasures nitsuh abebe from pitchfork media in a review of their compilation album pet shop boys hits commented that in song we meet tennant not as a singer but as a speaker adding that he mumbles verses to us not like a star but like a stranger in a raincoat slinking alongside you and pointing out sights in 1987 west end girls won for best single at brit awards and for best
