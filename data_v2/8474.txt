sly family stone austin chronicle corp received on 2008 10 01 recording and production sly stone mostly worked on there s a riot goin on alone in a studio that he had built for himself at plant studios also known as record plant in sausalito california or at his home studio in loft of his bel air mansion he would often lie down in bed and record his vocals with a wireless microphone system according to other family stone members most of album was performed by him alone overdubbing and sometimes using a drum machine to lay down beats lewis 2006 pp 73 75 namely maestro rhythm king 2 which featured 18 preset rhythms stone felt that rhythm box made unrealistic sounds if used as designed so he resorted to overdubbing drum sounds manually contributing to dense mix other band members contributed by overdubbing alone with sly instead of playing together as before for family affair and some other selections stone enlisted several other musicians including billy preston ike turner and bobby womack instead of his bandmates and several female vocalists mostly omitted from final mix album s muddy gritty sound was due in part to this overdubbing and erasing and mixing techniques nearly drowned out sounds miles marshall lewis stated never before on a sly and family stone album were songs open to so much interpretation and even more so dripping with cynicism on other hand you can hardly hear what he s saying for most of album like radiohead s kid a or even rolling stones exile on main st more recent to time a murkiness in mix of record inhibits complete comprehension of words in fall of 1971 stone delivered final mixes to cbs records offices relieving worried davis cbs issued family affair as first single band s first in nearly two years lewis 2006 pp 20 22 it became

thank you for talking to me africa which according to allmusic s matthew greenwald was a blues and gospel influenced examination of urban tension and end of 1960s perhaps most frightening recording

in from a distant radio somewhere thom jurek of allmusic wrote sister rose s voice is all sweet and at first so is sly s but as horns and bassline come stepping in sly s voice gets heavy and is distorting in places deliberately delicate keyboard lines luxuriant and in pocket as they are cannot keep voice contained there s a minimal instrumental break in tune and it suddenly fades just as it emerged album s title track is silent and listed as zero minutes and zero seconds long for many years it was speculated that this cryptic track listing and title of album referred to a july 27 1970 riot in chicago illinois for which sly family stone had been blamed band was to play a free show in grant park but crowd became restless before band began and started rioting over a hundred people were injured including several police officers and reason given to press was that band was late and or refused to perform lewis 2006 pp 60 64 original lp jacket featured a photo collage with a picture

in concert titles and text in an interview with jonathan dakss stone explained album cover s concept stating i wanted flag to truly represent people of all colors i wanted color black because it is absence of color i wanted color white because it is combination of all colors and i wanted color red because it represents one thing that all people have in common blood i wanted suns instead of stars because stars to me imply searching like you search for your star and there are already too many stars in this world but sun that s something that is always there looking right at you betsy ross did

hilburn expressed a mixed response towards band s stylistic change from songs such as everyday people and hot fun in summertime stating there is little on album that is worth your attention other major music publications praised this new direction in his review for rolling stone magazine vince aletti wrote that at first i hated it for its weakness and its lack of energy and i still dislike these qualities but then i began to respect album s honesty aletti cited it as one of most important fucking albums this year and new urban music not about dancing to music in streets it s about disintegration getting fucked up nodding maybe dying there are flashes of euphoria ironic laughter even some bright stretches but mostly it s just junkie death oddly and almost attractive in its effortlessness a columnist for hit parader magazine gave riot a favorable review and stated that album has a lot that makes sly in person rave that he is in village voice robert christgau said what s expressed is bitterest ghetto pessimism backed by subtle production techniques and jarring song compositions he declared riot one of those rare albums whose whole actually does exceed sum of its parts

success with two hit singles and debuting at number one on billboard pop albums and soul albums chart it later came to be viewed by critics as one of greatest and most influential albums christgau wrote in 2007 that temptations and contradictions of commercial stardom consumed sly stone and resulted in prophetic 1971 album its taped over murk presaging exile on main st its drum machine beats throwing knuckleballs at miles davis and james brown it was darker than velvet underground and nico and funkier than shit yet somehow it produced two smash hits including stark deep family affair allmusic described album as funk at its deepest and most impenetrable stating that what makes riot so remarkable is that it s hard not to get drawn in with him as you re seduced by narcotic grooves seductive vocals slurs leering electric pianos and crawling guitars zeth lundy of popmatters deemed it a challenging listen at times rambling incoherent dissonant and just plain uncomfortable with some episodic moments of pop greatness to be found lundy went on to discuss its radical departure from band s past music there s a riot goin on has been considered one of first instances of funk music

dave rosen of ink blot magazine said that album sounds unique ironically in view of its vast influence sly employed unconventional and possibly entirely original technique of mixing live drums with what was at time a primitive drum machine introspective yet political lyrics hard and dirty funk grooves inspirational yet depressing songs all of these elements would come to influence not only peers like marvin gaye and james brown but two generations of rappers and who paid homage to sly s vision by making his samples and beats an essential backbone of their own innovations sly s riot is still
