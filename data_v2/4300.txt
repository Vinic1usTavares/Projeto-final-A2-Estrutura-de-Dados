arab khazar wars were a series of conflicts fought between armies of khazar khaganate and rashidun umayyad and abbasid caliphates and their respective vassals historians usually distinguish two major periods of conflict first arab khazar war and second arab khazar war but arab khazar military confrontation also involved sporadic raids and isolated clashes from middle of 7th century to end of 8th century arab khazar wars were a result of attempts of umayyad caliphate to secure control of transcaucasia and north caucasus where khazars were already established first arab invasion in 640s and early 650s ended with defeat of an arab force led by abd ar rahman ibn rabiah outside khazar town of balanjar hostilities broke out again with caliphate in with raids back and forth across caucasus mountains led by distinguished generals al jarrah ibn abdallah and maslama ibn abd al malik arabs were able to capture derbent and even southern khazar capital of balanjar but these successes had little impact on nomadic khazars who continued to launch devastating raids deep into transcaucasia in one such raid in 730 khazars inflicted a major defeat on umayyad forces at battle of ardabil killing al jarrah but were in turn defeated next year and pushed back north maslama then recovered derbent which became a major arab military outpost and colony before being replaced by marwan ibn muhammad future caliph marwan ii in 732 a period of relatively localized warfare followed until 737 when marwan led north a massive expedition that reached khazar capital atil on volga after securing some form of submission by khagan arabs withdrew 737 campaign marked end of large scale warfare between two powers establishing derbent as northernmost muslim outpost and securing muslim dominance over transcaucasia at same time continuing warfare weakened umayyad army and contributed to eventual fall of dynasty to abbasid revolution a few years later relations between muslims of caucasus and khazars remained largely peaceful thereafter apart from two khazar raids in 760s and in 799 resulting from failed efforts to secure an alliance through marriage between arab governors or local princes of caucasus and khazar khagan occasional warfare continued in region between khazars and muslim principalities of caucasus until collapse of khazar state in late 10th century but great wars of 8th century were never repeated strategic background and motives caucasus as a frontier between steppe and settled world thumb 300px alt old geophysical map of environs of derbent with fortifications of derbent outlined map of sassanid fortifications of caspian gates at derbent by roderich von arab khazar wars were part of a long series of military conflicts between nomadic peoples of pontic caspian steppe and more settled regions south of caucasus range two primary routes over mountains darial pass alan gates in centre and pass of derbent caspian gates in east along caspian sea have been used as invasion routes since classical antiquity consequently defence of caucasus frontier against destructive raids of steppe peoples such as scythians and huns came to be regarded as one of chief duties of imperial regimes of near east this is reflected in popular belief among middle eastern cultures that alexander great had with divine assistance barred caucasus against hordes of gog and magog as historian gerald mako points out latter were stereotypical northern barbarians as conceived by settled civilizations of eurasia uncivilized savages who drank blood who ate children and whose greed and bestiality knew no limits should alexander s barrier fail and gog and magog break through apocalypse would follow starting with peroz i of sassanid empire built a line of stone fortifications to protect vulnerable frontier along caspian shore when completed under khosrau i this stretched over from eastern foothills of caucasus to caspian sea fortress of derbent was strategically crucial centre point of this fortification complex as evoked by its persian name dar band knot of gates opposing armies arabs and khazars turkic khazars appeared in area of modern in latter half of 6th century initially as subjects of turkic khaganate but following latter s collapse they emerged as an independent and dominant power in area of northern caucasus by 7th century as most recent steppe power in region early medieval writers came to identify khazars with gog and magog and sassanid fortifications at derbent as alexander s wall like other near eastern peoples arabs were already familiar with legend of gog and magog who appear even in quran ya juj wa ma juj following muslim conquests these perceptions were enhanced by incorporating many of cultural conceptions of their new subjects nascent muslim caliphate regarded itself as heir to sassanid and to a lesser extent byzantine tradition and civilizational consciousness as a result arab caliphs also adopted notion that in words of mako it was their duty to protect settled i e civilized world from northern barbarian this imperative was further reinforced by muslim division of world into house of islam or dar al islam and house of war dar al harb to which pagan turkic steppe peoples like khazars were consigned unlike their byzantine and sassanid predecessors who simply sought to contain steppe peoples through fortifications and political alliances arabs were expansionists interested in conquest from beginning they actively pursued a northward expansion quickly posing a direct threat to survival of khazars as an independent polity khazars on other hand followed a strategy common to their nomadic predecessors while raids might reach deep into transcaucasia and even into mesopotamia and anatolia they were not aimed at conquest but rather typical of nomads testing defenses of their sedentary neighbors as well as a means of gathering booty acquisition and distribution of which was fundamental to maintenance of tribal coalitions for khazars strategic stake of conflict was control of passes of caucasus eastern caucasus range became main theatre of arab khazar conflict with arab armies aiming to gain control of derbent in arabic bab al or gate of gates and khazar cities of balanjar and samandar their locations have yet to be established with certainty by modern researchers but both cities are referred to as khazar capitals by different arab writers and may have functioned as winter and summer capitals respectively it was only later under impact of arab attacks that khazars moved their capital further north to atil arabic al bayda on mouths of volga opposing armies represented different military philosophies which derived from nature of their societies arab armies contained sizeable contingents of both light and heavy cavalry but relied primarily on their infantry to extent that arab cavalry was often limited to skirmishing during initial phases of a battle before dismounting and fighting on foot while khazars had adopted elements of civilizations of south and possessed towns they remained a largely tribal and semi nomadic power like other steppe societies originating in central asia they practiced a very mobile form of warfare relying on highly skilled and hardy cavalry as historian khalid yahya blankinship writes khazars were to prove difficult opponents for muslims perhaps partly because their state was not highly organized and thus did not have a center whose fall would bring about a sudden collapse and rapid surrender connection with arab byzantine conflict to an extent arab khazar wars were also linked to long lasting struggle of caliphate against byzantine empire along eastern fringes of anatolia a theatre of war which adjoined caucasus byzantine emperors pursued close relations with khazars which amounted to a virtual alliance for most of period in question including such exceptional acts as marriage of emperor justinian ii to a khazar princess in 705 possibility of khazars linking up with byzantines through armenia was a grave threat to caliphate especially given its proximity to umayyad caliphate s metropolitan province of syria this did not materialize and armenia was left largely quiet with umayyads granting it wide ranging autonomy and byzantines likewise refraining from active campaigning there indeed given common threat posed by khazar raids umayyads found armenians and neighbouring georgians willing allies against khazars some notably dimitri obolensky suggested that arab expansion against khazars was motivated by a desire to outflank byzantine defences from north and envelop byzantine empire in a pincer movement however this idea is rejected as far fetched by modern scholars as historian david wasserstein comments it is a scheme of extraordinary ambition which requires us to accept that byzantium had succeeded already at this primary stage in persuading muslims that it could not be conquered and furthermore that muslims possessed a far greater knowledge and understanding of geography of europe than can be demonstrated for time in question mako likewise remarks that such a grand strategic plan is not borne out by rather limited nature of arab khazar conflict until 720s it is more likely that northward expansion of arabs beyond caucasus was at least initially result of onward momentum of early muslim conquests with local arab commanders seeking to exploit opportunities haphazardly and without any overall planning expansion may even have been in direct contravention to caliphal orders repeating a frequent pattern during this period from a strategic perspective it is far more probable that it was byzantines who encouraged khazars to attack caliphate to relieve mounting pressure on their own eastern frontier in early 8th century as indeed byzantium profited considerably from diversion of muslim armies northwards in 720s and 730s resulting in another alliance through marriage between future emperor constantine v and khazar princess tzitzak in 733 gaining control over northern branch of silk road by caliphate has been suggested as a further motive for conflict but mako disputes this claim by pointing out that warfare declined at precisely period of greatest expansion of traffic along silk road i e after middle of 8th century first arab khazar war and aftermath thumb 300px alt old map of western eurasia and northern africa showing expansion of caliphate from arabia to cover most of middle east with byzantine empire outlined in green expansion of muslim caliphate until 750 from william r shepherd s historical atlas khazars themselves first campaigned in caucasus during byzantine sassanid war of 602 628 as subjects of western turkic khaganate turks sacked derbent and joined byzantines in their siege of tiflis their contribution proved decisive for a few years afterwards khazars exercised some control over caucasian iberia approximately modern georgia caucasian albania arran modern republic of azerbaijan and adharbayjan modern iranian azerbaijan while western half of transcaucasia i e armenia was in byzantine hands however after death of khazar or western turkic ruler in an internal conflict khazar activity in eastern transcaucasia ceased khazars and arabs came into conflict as a result of first phase of muslim expansion by 640 arabs had reached armenia and in 642 they launched their first raid across caucasus under abd ar rahman ibn rabiah this raid reached derbent where according to history of prophets and kings of al tabari persian governor shahrbaraz offered to surrender fortress to arabs and even to aid them against unruly native caucasian peoples if he and his followers were relieved of obligation to pay jizya tax proposal was accepted and ratified by caliph umar in 645 646 arabs defeated a byzantine army reinforced with khazar and alan contingents in armenia as a result arab authority in transcaucasia was more firmly established in early 650s in 652 armenian nobility led by theodore recognized caliphate s overlordship and in 654 following an abortive armenian uprising arab authority was extended over iberia as well al tabari reports that first arab advance into khazar lands occurred as early as 642 claiming that abd ar rahman ibn rabiah reached balanjar without suffering any losses and that his cavalry raided up to 200 about to north of it but both his dating and improbable claim that arabs suffered no casualties have been disputed by modern scholars based at derbent abd ar rahman led frequent raids against khazars over following years but these were small scale affairs and no event of major note is recorded in sources in 651 652 disregarding instructions of caliph urging caution and restraint abd ar rahman led a strong army north aiming to take balanjar town was besieged for a few days until arrival of a khazar relief force coupled with a general sortie of besieged forces ended in a heavy defeat for arabs abd ar rahman or according to al baladhuri abd ar rahman s brother salman and 4 000 muslim troops were left dead on field three years later khazars repelled a retaliatory campaign under habib ibn maslama in aftermath of these attacks khazars abandoned balanjar and moved their capital further north in an attempt to evade reach of arab armies due to outbreak of first muslim civil war and priorities on other fronts arabs refrained from repeating an attack on khazars until early 8th century khazars on their part only launched a few raids into transcaucasian principalities that were loosely under muslim dominion in a raid into albania in 661 662 they were defeated by local prince but in 683 or 685 also a time of civil war in muslim world a large scale raid across transcaucasia was more successful capturing much booty and many prisoners presiding princes of iberia ii and armenia grigor i mamikonian were killed trying to oppose that raid second arab khazar war thumb right alt photograph of an ochre coloured medieval fortress on a green hilltop with higher green hills in background kala medieval citadel of derbent today relations between two powers remained relatively quiet until early years of 8th century by which time stage for a new round of conflict was set byzantine political authority had been marginalized in caucasus and caliphate tightened its grip on armenia after suppression of a large scale rebellion in 705 placing it under direct arab rule as province of arminiya arabs and khazars now directly confronted each other for control of caucasus only western parts of transcaucasia comprising modern georgia remained free from direct control by either of two rival powers conflicting notices place resumption of conflict as early as 707 with a campaign by umayyad general maslama a son of caliph abd al malik in adharbayjan and up to derbent which appears to have been under khazar control at time further attacks on derbent are reported by different sources for 708 under muhammad ibn marwan and in next year again by maslama but most likely correct date for recovery of derbent is maslama s expedition in 713 714 maslama then drove deeper into khazar territory trying to subdue huns living north of caucasus who were khazar vassals khazars opposed him under general alp but also launched raids to south into albania in response in 717 khazars raided in force into adharbayjan but they were driven back by arabs under hatin ibn al nu man hatin returned to caliph with fifty khazar prisoners first such event recorded in sources escalation of conflict in 721 722 main phase of war began in winter of this year 30 000 khazars invaded armenia and inflicted a crushing defeat on mostly syrian army of local governor mi ibn saffar al bahrani at marj al in february and march 722 in response caliph yazid ii sent one of his most celebrated generals al jarrah ibn abdallah with 25 000 syrian troops north on news of his approach khazars retreated to vicinity of derbent whose muslim garrison was still holding out advancing swiftly al jarrah was able to enter derbent without facing resistance and launched raiding columns into khazar territory following with bulk of his own army he defeated a 40 000 strong khazar army under barjik one of khazar khagans sons one day s march north of derbent advancing north arab army captured settlements of khamzin and whose inhabitants were resettled elsewhere finally arab army reached balanjar city had featured strong fortifications during first muslim attacks in mid 7th century but apparently they had been neglected in meantime for khazars chose to defend their capital by ringing citadel with a laager of wagons arabs broke it apart and stormed city on 21 august 722 most of balanjar s inhabitants were killed or enslaved but a few including its governor managed to flee north booty seized by arabs was so enormous that each of 30 000 horsemen probably an exaggeration by later historians in arab army is said to have received 300 gold dinars from it some of khazar prisoners were drowned on al jarrah s orders his army reduced neighbouring fortresses as well and continued their march north strongly garrisoned fortress of capitulated in exchange for tribute but arab advance was cut short before reaching next important khazar settlement samandar despite their success arabs had not yet defeated main khazar army which like all nomad forces was not dependent on cities for supplies presence of this force near samandar as well as reports of rebellions among mountain tribes in his rear forced arabs to retreat to warthan south of caucasus on his return al jarrah reported on his campaign to caliph but requested additional troops to defeat khazars an indication of both severity of fighting and perhaps according to blankinship that his campaign was not such a resounding success as portrayed in muslim sources thumb right alt black and white sketch of a mountain defile with a river crossed by a bridge darial pass sources are obscure on al jarrah s activity in 723 but he seems to have led another campaign north beyond balanjar which may be an echo or possibly actual date of balanjar campaign of 722 in response khazars raided south of caucasus but in february 724 al jarrah inflicted a crushing defeat on them in a battle between rivers cyrus and araxes that lasted for several days new caliph hisham ibn abd al malik promised to send reinforcements but eventually failed to do so nevertheless in 724 al jarrah captured tiflis and brought caucasian iberia and lands of alans under muslim suzerainty becoming first muslim commander to campaign through darial pass in process this secured muslims own flank against a possible khazar attack through darial and gave them a second invasion route into khazar territory in 725 caliph replaced al jarrah with his own brother maslama who already held post of governor of jazira appointment of maslama testifies to importance placed by caliph on khazar front for he was one of most distinguished generals of umayyad empire for time being maslama remained in jazira and was more concerned with operations against byzantines in his stead he sent al harith ibn amr al ta i to caucasus front in 725 al harith was engaged in consolidating muslim authority in caucasian albania campaigning along cyrus against regions of al lakz and he was probably also preoccupied with supervising that year s census next year barjik launched a major invasion of albania and adharbayjan khazars even laid siege to warthan during which they employed mangonels use of such advanced siege machines shows according to blankinship that khazars were a militarily sophisticated nation not a mere disorganized pack of barbarians al harith was able to defeat them on banks of araxes and drive them back north of river but arabs position was clearly precarious this event prompted maslama to take over personally direction of khazar front in 727 where now he was faced for first time by khagan himself as both sides escalated conflict maslama probably reinforced with more syrian and jaziran troops took offensive he recovered darial pass apparently lost in period since al jarrah s expedition in 724 and pushed on into khazar territory campaigning there until onset of winter forced him to return to adharbayjan whatever maslama s achievements in this expedition they were not enough next year when he repeated his invasion it ended in what blankinship calls a near disaster arab sources report that umayyad troops fought for thirty or even forty days in mud under continuous rainfall before scoring a victory against khagan on 17 september 728 how great that victory was however is open to question because on his return maslama was ambushed by khazars whereupon arabs simply abandoned their baggage train and fled headlong through darial pass to safety in aftermath of this campaign maslama was replaced yet again by al jarrah al for all his energy maslama s campaigning failed to produce desired results by 729 arabs had lost control of northeastern transcaucasia and been thrust once more on defensive with al jarrah again having to defend adharbayjan against a khazar invasion ardabil and arab reaction thumb right alt black and white sketch of a pear shaped jug featuring a rider in mail armour and

tiflis and darial pass arab sources report that he reached as far as khazar capital al bayda on volga but modern historians such as dunlop and blankinship consider this improbable khazars launched a counterstroke under a certain which forced al jarrah to retreat south of caucasus once again to defend albania it is unclear whether khazars came through darial pass or caspian gates but they managed to move around al jarrah s army at bardha a and lay siege to ardabil city was capital of adharbayjan and mass of muslim settlers and their families some 30 000 in total lived within its walls when al jarrah learned of this he led his army in a rapid march south and engaged khazars outside city walls there after a three day battle on 7 9 december 730 al jarrah s army of 25 000 was all but annihilated by khazars under barjik al jarrah was among fallen and command passed to his brother al hajjaj who was unable to prevent sacking of ardabil 10th century historian agapius of hierapolis reports that khazars took as many as 40 000 prisoners from city al jarrah s army and surrounding countryside khazars raided province at will sacking ganza and attacking other settlements with some detachments reaching as far as mosul in northern jazira adjacent to umayyad metropolitan province of syria defeat at ardabil was a major shock to muslims who for first time faced an enemy penetrating so deep within borders of caliphate and caliph hisham appointed veteran military leader sa id ibn amr al harashi to take command against khazars in short term while maslama prepared to march against them although forces he could muster immediately including refugees from ardabil who had to be paid ten gold dinars to be persuaded to fight were small sa id managed to recover on lake van from there he moved northeast to bardha a and south again to relieve siege of warthan near sa id came upon a 10 000 strong khazar army which he defeated killing most of khazars and rescuing 5 000 muslim prisoners they had with them surviving khazars fled north with sa id in pursuit despite this success sa id was relieved of his command in early 731 and even imprisoned for a while at and bardha a as a result of jealousy of maslama whom hisham had re appointed as governor of armenia and adharbayjan maslama came to caucasus with many jaziran troops and took offensive he restored provinces of albania to muslim allegiance after meting out exemplary punishment to inhabitants of who resisted his advance and reached derbent where he found a khazar garrison of 1 000 men with their families installed bypassing fortress maslama advanced north although details of this campaign in sources may be confused with that of 728 it appears that he took khamzin balanjar and samandar before being forced to retreat again after a confrontation with bulk of khazar army under khagan himself leaving their campfires burning arabs withdrew in middle of night and in a series of forced marches covering twice usual distance reached derbent khazars shadowed maslama s march south and attacked him near derbent but arab army augmented by local levies resisted their onslaught until a small picked force attacked khagans tent and wounded khazar ruler himself taking heart muslims attacked and defeated khazars it is probably this battle or campaign in which barjik was reportedly killed taking advantage of his victory maslama evicted khazars from derbent by poisoning their water supply and re founded city as a military colony garrisoning it with 24 000 mostly syrian troops divided into quarters by districts jund of their origin after that he returned with rest of his army mostly favoured jaziran and contingents south of caucasus for winter while khazars re occupied their abandoned towns despite capture of derbent maslama s record was apparently unsatisfactory for hisham who replaced his brother in march 732 with marwan ibn muhammad who would later reign as last umayyad caliph in 744 750 in summer of 732 marwan led 40 000 men north into khazar lands accounts of this campaign are confused ibn a tham records that he reached balanjar and returned to derbent with much captured livestock but campaign is described in terms strongly reminiscent of maslama s expeditions in 728 and 731 and its veracity is open to doubt ibn khayyat on other hand reports that marwan led a far more limited campaign on country immediately to north of derbent and then retired there to spend winter marwan was more active in south where he raised ashot iii bagratuni to position of presiding prince of armenia effectively granting country broad autonomy in exchange for service of its soldiers alongside caliphate s armies this unique concession points according to blankinship to worsening manpower crisis faced by caliphate at about same time khazars and byzantines strengthened their ties and formalized their alliance against their common enemy with marriage of constantine v to khazar princess tzitzak final phase of war marwan s invasion of khazaria after marwan s 732 expedition a period of quiet set in marwan was replaced as governor of armenia and adharbayjan in spring 733 by sa id al harashi but he undertook no campaigns during two years of his governorship blankinship attributes this inactivity to exhaustion of arab armies and draws a parallel with contemporaneous quiet phase in transoxiana in 732 734 where arabs had also suffered a series of costly defeats at hands of a turkic steppe power in meantime marwan is reported to have gone before caliph hisham and remonstrated against policy followed in caucasus recommending that he himself be sent to deal with khazars with full authority and an army of 120 000 men when sa id requested to be relieved in 735 due to his failing eyesight hisham appointed marwan to replace him marwan returned to caucasus determined to launch a decisive blow against khazars but it appears that he too was unable to launch anything but local expeditions for some time he established a new base of operations at kasak some twenty from tiflis and forty from bardha a but his initial expeditions were against minor local potentates in 735 marwan captured three fortresses in alania near darial pass and ruler of a north caucasian principality tuman shah who was restored to his lands by caliph as a client ruler in next year marwan campaigned against another local prince wartanis whose castle was seized and its defenders killed despite their surrender wartanis himself tried to flee but was captured and executed by inhabitants of khamzin indeed agapius and michael syrian record that arabs and khazars concluded peace during this period information which muslim sources ignore or downplay as a short lived ruse by marwan designed to gain time for his preparations and mislead khazars as to his intentions thumb right alt photograph of a ruined medieval stone built fortress on a green hilltop in autumn with caucasus mountains in background medieval citadel of anakopia today marwan prepared a massive strike for 737 intended to end war for good marwan apparently went to damascus in person to persuade hisham to back this project and was successful 10th century historian bal ami claims that his army numbered 150 000 men comprising regular forces of syria and jazira as well as volunteers for jihad armenian troops under ashot bagratuni and even armed camp followers and servants whatever real size of marwan s army it was a huge force and certainly largest ever sent against khazars marwan first secured his rear by subduing armenian factions who were hostile to arabs and their client ashot he then pushed into caucasian iberia driving its ruler to seek refuge in fortress of anakopia on black sea coast in byzantine protectorate of abkhazia marwan laid siege to anakopia itself but he was forced to retire due to outbreak of dysentery among his troops marwan now launched a two pronged offensive against khazars 30 000 men including most of levies from caucasian principalities under governor of derbent asid ibn zafir al sulami advanced north along coast of caspian sea while marwan himself with bulk of his forces crossed darial pass invasion met little resistance arab sources report that marwan had deliberately detained khazar envoy and only let him go with a declaration of war once he was deep in khazar territory two arab armies converged on samandar where a great review was held according to ibn a tham troops were issued new clothing in white dynastic colour of umayyads as well as new spears from there marwan pushed on reaching according to some arab sources khazar capital of al bayda on volga khagan withdrew towards ural mountains but left behind a considerable force to protect capital this was a spectacularly deep penetration according to blankinship but of little strategic value 10th century travellers ibn fadlan and istakhri describe khazar capital in their time as little more than a large encampment and there is no evidence that it had been larger or more urbanized in past thumb right alt photograph of people in shirtsleeves working amidst excavated foundations of ancient buildings excavations at identified by some archaeologists with khazar capital al bayda atil subsequent course of campaign is only provided by ibn a tham and sources drawn from his work according to this account marwan penetrated further north and attacked a slavic people called burtas whose territory extended up to that of volga bulgars and who were khazar subjects taking 20 000 families or 40 000 persons in other accounts captive khazar army under tarkhan one of highest dignitaries in turkic states shadowed arab advance from opposite shore of volga as khazars avoided battle marwan sent a detachment of 40 000 troops across volga under al kawthar ibn al aswad al which surprised khazars in a swamp in ensuing battle arabs killed 10 000 khazars including tarkhan and took 7 000 captives thereupon khazar khagan himself is said to have requested peace marwan reportedly offered islam or sword whereupon khagan agreed to convert to islam two were sent to instruct him on details of faith prohibition on consuming wine pork and unclean meat are specifically mentioned marwan also took with him large numbers of slav and khazar captives whom he resettled in eastern caucasus some 20 000 slavs were settled at kakheti according to al baladhuri while khazars were resettled at al lakz soon after slavs killed their appointed governor and fled north but marwan rode after them and killed them marwan s 737 expedition was climax of arab khazar wars but its actual results were meagre although arab campaigns after ardabil may indeed have discouraged khazars from further warfare any recognition of islam or of arab supremacy by khagan was evidently conditional upon presence of arab troops deep in khazar territory and such presence could not be sustained for long furthermore credibility of conversion of khagan to islam is disputed al baladhuri s account which probably is closer original sources suggests that it was not khagan but a minor lord who converted to islam and was placed in charge of khazars at al lakz in itself according to blankinship an indication of implausibility of conversion of khagan if khazar muslim converts had to be removed to safety in umayyad territory conversion of khagan is also apparently contradicted by fact that khazar court embraced judaism as its official faith a decision which clearly owed a great deal to determination of khazars to avoid assimilation by and emphasize their independence from both christian byzantine and muslim arab empires aftermath and impact of second arab khazar war whatever real events of marwan s campaigns warfare between khazars and arabs ceased for more than two decades after 737 arab military activity in caucasus continued until 741 with marwan launching repeated expeditions against various principalities of northern caucasus blankinship emphasizes that these campaigns appear to have been closer to raids designed to seize plunder and extract tribute to ensure upkeep of arab army rather than attempts at permanent conquest on other hand british orientalist douglas m dunlop considered that marwan came within an ace of succeeding in his conquest of khazaria and that he apparently intended to resume operations against khagan at a later date but this never materialized despite umayyads success at establishing a more or less stable frontier anchored at derbent they were unable to push any further despite repeated efforts in face of vigorous khazar resistance dunlop drew parallels between umayyad khazar confrontation at caucasus and that between umayyads and franks at roughly same time across pyrenees that ended in battle of tours noting that like franks in west khazars played a crucial role in stemming tide of early muslim conquests according to peter b golden during long conflict arabs had been able to maintain their hold over much of transcaucasia but notes that despite occasional khazar raids this had never really been seriously threatened on other hand in their failure to push border north of derbent arabs were clearly reaching outer limits of their imperial drive blankinship also highlights limited gains made by caliphate in second arab khazar war as disproportionate to resources expended arab control was in reality limited to lowlands and coast and land itself was too poor to recompense umayyad treasury more importantly need to maintain large garrison at derbent further depleted already overstretched syro jaziran army main pillar of umayyad regime eventually weakening of syrian army through its dispersion across various fronts of caliphate would be major factor in fall of umayyad dynasty during muslim civil wars of 740s and abbasid revolution that followed them later conflicts thumb right 300px alt old map of europe and mediterranean basin showing polities of year 814 in various colours map of europe and mediterranean in early 9th century from william r shepherd s historical atlas khazars resumed their raids on muslim territory after abbasid succession reaching deep into transcaucasia although by 9th century khazars had re consolidated their control over dagestan almost to gates of derbent itself they never seriously attempted to challenge muslim control of southern caucasus as thomas s noonan writes khazar arab wars ended in a stalemate first conflict between khazars and abbasids resulted from a diplomatic manoeuvre by caliph al mansur attempting to strengthen caliphate s ties with khazars in he ordered his governor of armenia yazid al sulami to marry a daughter of khagan marriage indeed took place amidst much celebration but she died in childbirth two years later along with her infant child khagan suspected muslims of poisoning his daughter and launched devastating raids south of caucasus in 762 764 under leadership of a khwarezmian tarkhan named ras khazars devastated albania armenia and iberia where they captured tiflis yazid himself managed to escape capture but khazars returned north with thousands of captives and much booty a few years later however in 780 when deposed iberian ruler tried to induce khazars to campaign against abbasids and restore him to his throne khagan refused this was probably result of a brief period of anti byzantine orientation in khazar foreign policy resulting from disputes between two powers in crimea during same period khazars helped leon ii of abkhazia throw off byzantine overlordship peace reigned in caucasus between arabs and khazars until 799 when last major khazar attack into transcaucasia took place chroniclers again attribute this attack to a failed marriage alliance according to georgian sources khagan desired to marry beautiful shushan daughter of prince of kakheti and he sent his general buljan to invade iberia and capture her most of central region of k art li was occupied and prince was taken off into captivity for a few years but rather than be captured shushan committed suicide and furious khagan had buljan executed arab chroniclers on other hand attribute this to plans of abbasid governor al fadl ibn yahya one of famous barmakids to marry one of khagans daughters who died on her journey south while a different story is reported by al tabari whereby khazars were invited to attack by a local arab magnate in retaliation against execution of his father governor of derbent by general sa id ibn salm according to arab sources khazars then raided as far as araxes necessitating dispatch of troops under yazid ibn mazyad as new governor of transcaucasia with more forces under ibn in reserve arabs and khazars continued to clash sporadically in north caucasus in 9th and 10th centuries but warfare was localized and of far lower intensity than great wars of 8th century thus ottoman historian munejjim bashi records a period of warfare lasting from until 912 perhaps linked to caspian raids of rus at about same time whom khazars allowed to pass through their lands unhindered indeed for khazars peace on southern border became more important as new threats emerged in steppes to challenge their hegemony khazar threat receded with progressive collapse of khazar power in 10th century and defeats at hands of rus and other turkic nomads like oghuz turks khazar realm contracted to its core around lower volga and became removed from reach of arab muslim principalities of caucasus thus ibn al athir s reports of a war between of ganja with khazars in 1030 probably refers to georgians instead in end last khazars found refuge among their former enemies munejjim bashi records that in 1064 remnants of khazars consisting of three thousand households arrived in somewhere in dagestan from khazar territory they rebuilt it and settled in it notes references sources category 7th century conflicts category 8th century conflicts category medieval
