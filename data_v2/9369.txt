on 14 november 2015 a tgv train derailed in eckwersheim alsace france while performing commissioning trials on second phase of lgv est high speed rail line which was scheduled to open for commercial service five months later derailment resulted in 11 deaths among those aboard while 42 others aboard train were injured it was first fatal derailment in history of tgv and third derailment since tgv entered commercial service in 1981 test train was traveling eastbound on southern track when it entered a curve at which was above its assigned speed causing rear bogie of lead power car to derail to left outside of curve due to centrifugal forces lead power car separated from rest of train and rear of lead power car struck concrete parapet on abutment to a bridge over marne rhine canal power car slid along left parapet of bridge and overturned sliding down embankment and coming to a rest beyond end of bridge cars 2 7 derailed before bridge and travelled off embankment with enough speed to overshoot canal and come to rest beyond beginning of bridge cars 8 9 came to rest on east bank of canal and rear power car ended up partially submerged in canal according to investigators late braking which led to train entering curve at excessive speed was immediate cause of accident criminal and technical investigations are french national rail operator sncf suspended test trials at high speeds until lessons learned from investigation were integrated into testing process scheduled opening of second phase of lgv est for commercial service was delayed three months from 3 april 2016 to 3 july 2016 background lgv est europeenne often shortened to lgv est is a high speed rail line connecting paris and strasbourg development has been divided into two phases first phase from vaires sur marne near paris to baudrecourt opened on 10 june 2007 construction on second phase from baudrecourt to vendenheim near strasbourg began in 2010 final weld of rails on second phase occurred in march 2015 marking completion of line although some work remained at time of derailment line was scheduled to open for commercial service on 3 april 2016 following commissioning trials and training for operators scheduled tests for line consisted of four phases factory testing of components of line completed in 2013 14 on site testing of components and functioning of subsystems completed in 2013 2014 static testing of subsystems with slow moving trains completed from late 2014 to august 2015 dynamic testing of line with trains operating at high speed began in september 2015 and scheduled to have been completed in november 2015 a specialized test train set 744 in a commemorative livery arrived to conduct fourth phase of testing which began on 28 september 2015 during this phase more than 200 test runs would be performed on line test runs would test ride smoothness performance of catenary radio communications and signalling system during some runs test train would operate at 10 above planned operational speeds for line when it enters service some automated safety systems were disabled to allow test train to operate beyond normal operating conditions orientation training for operators was scheduled to take place between january and march 2016 prior to start of commercial service on line which was scheduled for 3 april 2016 at time of accident in january 2016 sncf announced that opening of line would be delayed until to 3 july 2016 accident departure tests scheduled for 11 and 14 november were to traverse each of two tracks in both directions of travel and at a test speed 10 above speed limit when line is in commercial service on afternoon of 14 november test train was scheduled to depart meuse tgv station at 14 18 and arrive at strasbourg station at 15 17 at 14 26 authorization was given to begin test and test train left meuse tgv station two minutes later during this test test train traveled eastbound on track 2 southern track on east west oriented lgv est in direction opposite normal operation strasbourg towards paris meuse strasbourg run was last series of tests on line during fourth phase of tests train reached a maximum speed of on sections where speed limit will be as train approached flying junction in commune of vendenheim it should have slowed from before reaching kilometer point kp 403 809 where speed limit for commercial service will be as track begins a long right hand curve into flying junction it is raised on an embankment approximately high and crosses a bridge over marne rhine canal flying junction marks end of lgv est line after which train was to continue on an existing non high speed rail line leading to strasbourg station derailment thumb upright 1 3 concrete parapet on southern side of western abutment remains intact 1 while concrete parapet on northern side was impacted by train and destroyed 2 a pantograph 3 and its subassembly 4 detached from one of power cars is seen in bottom center there is also a bogie remaining on tracks 5 as train entered right hand curve into flying junction rear bogie of lead power car derailed to left outside of curve at 15 04 42 at approximately kp 404 003 violent transverse movements at rear of lead power car caused it to separate from rest of train rear of lead power car struck a concrete parapet kp 404 209 on leading abutment to bridge over marne rhine canal impact broke apart lead power car and caused oil to leak from lead power car s transformer which ignited and was spread across bridge and canal banks rear bogie of lead power car remained where it impacted concrete parapet transformer of lead power car landed on east bank of canal remainder of lead power car slid along left parapet of bridge at end of bridge it overturned slid down embankment and came to a rest beyond end of bridge cars 2 7 derailed before bridge and traveled off embankment with enough speed to overshoot canal and come to rest beyond beginning of bridge cars 8 9 came to rest on east bank of canal and rear power car ended up partially submerged in canal response and casualties at 15 05 train disappeared from approach zone for vendenheim junction on display being monitored by staff at signalling control center at 15 10 control center initiated emergency procedures for loss of a train and closed non high speed rail lines that pass through vendenheim junction at approximately same time one of companies involved in construction of line received a call from an employee aboard train who informed them of derailment shortly before 17 45 local mass casualty plan was enacted emergency medical and fire rescue services along with 100 gendarmes responded to incident at its height 104 engines from three departments responded to incident 65 from bas rhin and 39 from moselle and haut rhin those with minor injuries were treated by responders from french red cross which operated at school in eckwersheim french minister of ecology sustainable development and energy segolene royal and secretary of state for transport alain travelled to site shortly after crash president of sncf guillaume pepy and president of sncf reseau jacques rapoport also travelled to site in hours after accident train was carrying 53 persons including four children ages 10 15 who were not officially authorized to be aboard derailment resulted in 11 deaths which included four employees of sncf five technicians from engineering firm responsible for tests and two guests ten died at crash scene one died following evening and one seriously injured person remained in hospital as of february 2016 among dead was director of lgv est line for sncf reseau which owns france s railroad infrastructure despite breaking in two pieces and severe impact with parapet there were no deaths among seven people in front cab second to last car impacted canal wall and was car with highest death toll it was first fatal derailment in history of tgv and third derailment since tgv entered commercial service in 1981 investigation three investigations have been opened french land transport accident investigation bureau bea tt which is responsible for investigating rail accidents in france opened a non judicial technical investigation bea tt published its final report in march 2017 a criminal investigation and internal investigation by sncf have also been opened among subjects which sncf will investigate is whether there was a dereliction of duties by an sncf employee that resulted in unauthorized children riding on train president of sncf has exclaimed this is not a practice that sncf recognizes a test train is a test train derailment occurred day after november 2015 paris attacks initially sparking fears that derailment was work of terrorists on 19 november sncf announced initial findings of their investigation train s event recorder indicated that train entered curve at and was travelling at at moment it derailed which investigators have determined to be a result of centrifugal forces speed at moment of derailment was above train s assigned operating speed on curve according to sncf immediate cause of accident was a late braking sequence braking should have begun at least or 12 seconds earlier investigation has found no fault for accident in infrastructure train or member of technical team there were seven people in driving cab at time of accident all of whom survived investigators have suggested that this may have been a factor in late braking sncf will begin disciplinary proceedings and take punitive measures against employees responsible for among other things reckless presence of children on test train presence of seven people in cab lack of rigor in creating lists of those onboard and controlling access to train and without doubt human errors in cab aftermath thumb ceremony in remembrance of victims at strasbourg station 16 november sncf held a minute of silence for victims during course of operations on monday 16 november following day a memorial service was held in church in which was attended by sncf president guillaume pepy sncf suspended all test trials at high speeds until lessons learned from investigation can be integrated into testing processes a memorial garden and stone marker were dedicated at site on first anniversary of accident scheduled opening of second phase of lgv est for commercial service was delayed by three months from 3 april to 3 july 2016 until 11 december 2016 a short segment of line around site of derailment was limited to a single track while repairs on damaged track were completed
