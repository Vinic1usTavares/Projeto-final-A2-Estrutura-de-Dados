1880 republican national convention convened from june 2 to june 8 1880 at interstate exposition building in chicago illinois united states and nominated representative james a garfield of ohio and chester a arthur of new york as official candidates of republican party for president and vice president respectively in 1880 presidential election of 14 men in contention for republican nomination three strongest candidates leading up to convention were ulysses s grant james g blaine and john sherman grant had served two terms as president from 1869 to 1877 and was seeking an unprecedented third term in office he was backed by stalwart faction of republican party which supported political machines and patronage blaine was a senator and former representative from maine who was backed by half breed faction of republican party sherman brother of civil war general william tecumseh sherman was serving as secretary of treasury under president rutherford b hayes a former senator from ohio he was backed by delegates who did not support stalwarts or half breeds on first ballot sherman received 93 votes while grant and blaine had 304 and 285 respectively with 379 votes required to win nomination none of candidates was close to victory and balloting continued after thirty fifth ballot blaine and sherman switched their support to a new dark horse candidate james garfield on next ballot garfield won nomination by receiving 399 votes 93 higher than grant s total garfield s ohio delegation chose chester a arthur a stalwart as garfield s vice presidential running mate arthur won nomination by capturing 468 votes and longest ever republican national convention was subsequently adjourned garfield arthur republican ticket later defeated democrats winfield scott hancock and william hayden english in close 1880 presidential election background as president of united states rutherford b hayes had caused heated tensions within republican party hayes had moved away from party patronage by offering government jobs to southern democrats instead of northern republicans his actions drew heavy criticism from those inside his party such as roscoe conkling of new york and james g blaine of maine hayes had known since dispute over 1876 election that he was unlikely to win in 1880 and had announced at his 1877 inauguration that he would not run for a second term without an incumbent president in race rival factions within republican party stalwarts and half breeds eagerly anticipated 1880 presidential election ulysses s grant thumb 225px a photograph of president grant during 1870s at close of grant s two terms as president in 1877 republican controlled congress suggested that grant not return to white house for a third term grant did not seem to mind and even told his wife julia i do not want to be here in white house another four years i do not think i could stand it after grant left white house he and his wife decided to use their us 85 000 of savings to travel around world a biographer from new york herald john russell young traveled with grants and documented their journey to exotic places around world in a book later published called around world with general grant young saw that grant s popularity was soaring as he was treated with splendid receptions at his arrival in tokyo and peking china after hayes falling out with republican party and a perceived desire on part of united states electorate for a strong man in white house grant returned to united states ahead of schedule in hopes of seeking a third term in office with backing of stalwarts and calls for a man of iron to replace man of straw in white house grant was confident that he would receive republican nomination for presidency roscoe conkling leader of stalwart faction formed a triumvirate with j donald cameron of pennsylvania and john a logan of illinois to lead campaign for grant s return to white house with a grant victory conkling and other stalwarts would have great influence in white house grant knew he could count on stalwart leaders to solidify their respective states in order to guarantee a grant victory conkling was so confident in grant s nomination that he said nothing but an act of god could prevent grant s nomination an aide to ex president adam badeau commented that grant had become extremely anxious to receive nomination and did not think that there was any chance of failure however close friends of grant saw that his public support was slipping john russell young took grant aside and told him that he would lose election and should withdraw to avoid embarrassment young argued that grant was being heavily attacked by opponents who were against concept of a presidential third term young also criticized handling of campaign and told grant that if he won election he would be indebted to triumvirate grant felt that his stalwart friends had been of great assistance in his election bid and they deserved political patronage in his administration grant nonetheless listened to young s advice and wrote a letter to j donald cameron authorizing his name to be withdrawn from nomination contest after consultation with his other stalwart backers upon hearing of his letter julia grant was insistent that her husband should not withdraw his name from contest she said if general grant were not nominated then let it be so but he must not withdraw his name no never young delivered letter to triumvirate in chicago on may 31 but no action was taken to remove grant s name james g blaine thumb 225px left blaine during 1870s other main contender for republican nomination was james g blaine blaine a senator from maine who had also served in united states house of representatives including holding speaker of house position from 1869 to 1875 was in competition to prevent grant s nomination four years earlier blaine had campaigned for party s nomination in weeks prior to 1876 convention he was accused of committing fraudulent activities involving railroad stocks specifics of blaine s involvement were detailed in mulligan letters blaine pleaded his own defense on floor of house of representatives and he read aloud selected edited portions of letters that were not incriminating despite his attempt to clear his name blaine was tarnished by scandal throughout rest of his political career on sunday before balloting was to begin in cincinnati ohio blaine collapsed at steps of washington congregational church he was unconscious for two days and as a result he lost supporters who were doubtful over his health and whether he was capable of handling presidency blaine was also ridiculed by opponents who accused him of faking illness to gain sympathy new york sun headlined blaine feigns a faint on first ballot of 1876 convention blaine received 285 votes while his political enemy roscoe conkling was in second place with only 99 votes blaine and conkling had a long standing political feud that started at a debate on floor of house of representatives in 1866 after six more ballots resulted in no consensus conkling switched his support to rutherford b hayes who ultimately beat blaine for nomination after blaine s failure in 1876 his supporters believed that he needed to be nominated at 1880 convention in chicago if he was ever going to be president reasoning that if he tried for nomination twice and failed he could not count on another opportunity as his campaign manager william e chandler put it despite mulligan letters scandal blaine had succeeded remarkably in his 1880 campaign attracting nationwide support for his candidacy he argued for gold standard support for big business a tariff to protect american civil rights for freed blacks and irish independence john sherman thumb 225px right a photograph of john sherman taken while he was united states secretary of treasury john sherman was a longtime senator from ohio who also served state in house of representatives in late 1850s and early 1860s as a senator sherman led planning of national banking system he also oversaw national policy for post civil war banking system and helped restore nation s finances after panic of 1873 under president hayes sherman served as secretary of treasury advocating for gold standard and building up country s gold reserves sherman s colleagues did not have much confidence in their presidential bid sherman was known as ohio icicle for his uncharismatic personality which made him unappealing to voters his colleagues commented that in public sherman was not eloquent though a graceful speaker confining himself almost entirely to statements of fact in private he was reserved self contained a personality that many americans were not comfortable with as president sherman intended to continue his support for gold standard prior to start of convention papers had predicted sherman to receive 110 votes in balloting sherman felt that he still had a chance at nomination once grant vote broke apart after five or six ballots james garfield thumb 225px left garfield as brigadier general during civil war james garfield came into chicago as a senator elect from ohio who had represented state in united states house since 1863 in 1859 as a republican garfield was elected to ohio senate following year he was admitted to ohio bar he served as state senator until 1861 when he enlisted in union army at start of civil war garfield was assigned to command 42nd ohio volunteer infantry and had task of driving confederate forces out of eastern kentucky garfield later led an attack with a number of infantry regiments against a confederate cavalry at jenny s creek on january 6 1862 confederates retreated and for leading his men to victory garfield was promoted to rank of brigadier general in march 1862 garfield later served under major general don carlos buell at battle of shiloh and under thomas j wood at siege of corinth garfield s health deteriorated and he was sent to serve on a commission to investigate conduct of union general fitz john porter in spring of 1863 garfield returned to field as chief of staff for william s rosecrans commander of army of cumberland after disastrous chickamauga campaign in september 1863 rosecrans was relieved of his command garfield saved his own reputation by fighting bravely during battles and he was subsequently promoted to rank of major general garfield s fame spread and william dennison engineered garfield s 1863 election to congress as whitelaw reid commented garfield was most able and prominent of young politicians who entered army at outbreak of war garfield did not want to leave army so he personally visited president abraham lincoln for advice on matter lincoln told garfield that he had more generals than he could handle and what he needed was political support garfield succeeded in gaining re election for his house seat every two years in 1872 garfield faced charges for receiving 329 in tainted money from credit mobilier of america corruption scandal garfield repeatedly denied charges and even hired william e chandler to defend him in front of congressional investigators there was not much evidence against garfield so his political career was not significantly affected four years later when james g blaine moved from house to united states senate garfield became republican floor leader of house that year garfield served as a member of electoral commission that awarded 20 hotly contested electoral votes to rutherford b hayes in his contest for presidency against samuel j tilden prior to 1880 republican national convention garfield had expressed that he was a blaine supporter it was not until john sherman entered race that garfield switched sides and offered his support for ohio icicle pre convention politics thumb right 275px senator roscoe conkling of new york in january caucuses were held in local districts to pick delegates to state conventions state conventions would then select a number of these delegates to represent state at national convention prior to convention there was a great deal of machine politics conducted by candidates john sherman utilized treasury department employees who owed their jobs to him to meet up at local caucuses across south to guarantee loyal state delegations state level bosses like roscoe conkling used state conventions to pick delegates that were politically allied to a particular candidate in state delegate selection convention at utica new york grant s supporters carried only a 217 180 majority over blaine supporters but conkling passed a resolution declaring that republicans of new york believe re election of ulysses s grant as presidential candidate of urgent importance and delegates this day assembled are called upon and instructed to use their earnest and united efforts to secure his nomination conkling commanded delegates to follow resolution and if they were to violate it he guaranteed they would be victims of political revenge and personal dishonor however in chicago there were a number of new york delegates who went against resolution and publicly expressed their support for blaine j donald cameron used similar tactics to intimidate dissenters in pennsylvania state convention third member of triumvirate john a logan literally locked out blaine supporters from illinois state convention and replaced them with personally chosen grant supporters by may 29 four days before opening of convention trainloads upon trainloads of delegates lobbyists reporters and campaign followers had arrived at union and dearborn railway stations in chicago candidate supporters channeled through chicago streets with daily parades and rallies pre convention possible outcomes of voting were published by a number of sources one from albany evening journal predicted blaine with 277 votes grant with 317 sherman with 106 and 49 for other candidates all of these predicted candidate vote totals were short of 379 needed to win many in chicago knew that a victor most probably grant would only be determined if unit rule which postulated that all delegates from a particular state must vote for candidate preferred by that state s delegation was to be in effect if that was not case then a long deadlock would result until one side succumbed to other before any voting began delegates had to vote on important matter of unit rule prior to start of convention james garfield noted i regard it unit rule as being more important than even choice of a candidate if rule was supported by a majority of delegates then state party bosses like members of triumvirate would be able to solidify grant s nomination bid if conkling and other stalwart bosses had their way nearly sixty dissenters from states represented by triumvirate would be silenced unfortunately for half breeds j donald cameron was chairman of republican national committee cameron planned to exercise his power to adopt new rules for convention and also suppress any dissenters of unit rule his plan was leaked and within days almost all delegates in chicago knew about it supporters of sherman and blaine campaigns knew that they had to prevent cameron from exercising his power blaine s forces agreed that they could only prevent cameron from imposing unit rule by removing him as chair of republican national committee thumb left 300px an 1880 political cartoon depicts senator conkling over a presidential puzzle consisting of some of potential republican and democratic nominees as pieces of a sliding puzzle at 7 00 p m on may 31 j donald cameron convened republican national committee s last meeting before opening of convention of forty six men at meeting cameron counted only sixteen allies rest of men were anti grant delegates who had decided to gang up on cameron colorado senator jerome b chaffee was first to bring up unit rule at meeting chaffee handed cameron a handwritten motion that was orchestrated by william e chandler cameron expected this and knew he had to find some fault in chaffee s motion cameron called chaffee s motion out of order upon being questioned by chaffee cameron explained that committee could only appoint a temporary chairman to convention and could not vote on unit rule issue which he said belonged to rules committee cameron then used george cornelius gorham a california stalwart delegate who as secretary of united states senate had become an expert on parliamentary procedure to justify his ruling one by one anti grant delegates unsuccessfully tried to appeal cameron s motion gorham proclaimed that as committee chairman cameron could do as he saw fit marshall jewell a connecticut delegate and national committee member who had served in grant s administration as postmaster general spoke up against cameron s rulings cameron did not comment and then called for a brief recess after recess he acknowledged a motion from william e chandler to elect george frisbie hoar a neutral senator and delegate from massachusetts as convention s temporary chairman committee voted 29 17 in favor of electing hoar as temporary chairman of convention at midnight committee was adjourned and members agreed to continue meeting following morning news of cameron s behavior had spread throughout town overnight his hardliner strategy had failed and conkling and other grant managers sought to control situation before it became any worse next morning conkling asked his trusted colleague chester a arthur to solve problem arthur assessed situation and drew up a compromise he met chandler and rest of anti grant cabal at entrance of committee s suite arthur acknowledged that grant men had rejected senator hoar as temporary convention chairman day before but said that grant men might perhaps reconsider he proposed that delegates decide on unit rule in a free vote and in return don cameron would be restored as chairman of national committee after discussing for a number of minutes two men came to an agreement arthur was confident that since chandler leader of blaine s campaign had accepted deal then it would be agreed by grant men chandler then discussed compromise deal with thirty anti grant committee members and also james garfield who had previously expressed his opposition to unit rule 23 out of 30 anti grant men agreed to terms and garfield commented that proposition must be accepted in spirit of reconciliation committee reconvened again on afternoon of june 1 with j donald cameron sitting as committee chairman arthur made a number of motions indicating that grant men from new york and pennsylvania would support senator hoar s appointment as temporary chairman of convention no one objected and motions were accepted meeting was then adjourned a reporter from new york tribune later remarked that grant followers had been saved from utter ruin by excellent management of general arthur convention thumb right 300px a view inside interstate exposition building known as glass palace during convention james abram garfield center right is on podium waiting to speak at noon on wednesday june 2 j donald cameron banged his gavel to commence beginning of seventh republican national convention as instructed cameron placed nomination for senator hoar as temporary convention chairman nomination was passed unanimously later delegates john h roberts of illinois and christopher l magee of pennsylvania were made temporary convention secretaries senator eugene hale of maine submitted a resolution for a roll call in which chairman of each delegation would announce people from their delegation serving on convention s three committees committees were formed and convention was adjourned at five minutes past three in afternoon convention reconvened at 11 00 a m on june 3 roscoe conkling submitted a motion for a recess but motion was rejected another new york delegate henry r pierson from committee on permanent organization submitted a proposal to make temporary convention assignments permanent motion was adopted and convention took a four hour recess until 5 00 p m after recess a motion was made for committee on rules to be directed to report but a substitute motion from george h sharpe of new york called for committee on credentials to report substitute motion was rejected by a vote of 406 to 318 and original resolution was laid on table at 7 30 p m convention was adjourned until 10 00 a m following morning next morning conkling then submitted a resolution that bound every delegate in hall to support party s nominee conkling said that no man should hold his seat here who is not ready so to agree a voice vote was called and resolution received nearly unanimous delegate support however about a dozen or so delegates answered no conkling was shocked he asked who at a republican convention would vote no on such a resolution he then demanded a roll call to identify dissenters most of dissenters chose not to declare their disagreement in front of thousands of spectators at glass palace only three delegates all from west virginia voted no to resolution and were showered with a storm of hisses conkling then issued another resolution to strip three west virginians of their votes and squash their voices at convention west virginians revolted against conkling s resolution and heavily criticized him for his motion james garfield who was sitting at ohio delegation stood up and tried to settle matter he stated that convention would be making a big mistake if they approved conkling s motion and he asked delegates for their time in order to state his case garfield argued that three west virginians should not be disenfranchised because they thought it was not time to make such an expression about a candidate he stated that there never can be a convention that shall bind my vote against my will on any question whatever garfield had won crowd over with his speech conkling did not particularly enjoy situation he scribbled a note to garfield which read new york requests that ohio s real candidate and dark horse come forward r c afterwards fight over credentials erupted into a free for all after john a logan had barred anti grant delegates from state convention earlier in year they had decided to file credential reports at meeting between arthur and chandler both men had agreed that credentials issue could be discussed at convention a chicago lawyer who supported grant emery storrs interrupted legal argument over credentials by mocking blaine campaigners his remarks set off a barrage of comments from both blaine and grant sides convention went out of control as people started shouting and jumping throughout convention hall as garfield commented convention seemed as if it could not be in america but in sections of paris in ecstasy of revolution fracas continued until 2 00 a m when acting chairman green b raum united states commissioner of internal revenue banged gavel to end demonstration presenting nominees on saturday night alphabetical roll call of states to present nominees was conducted first candidate for republican nomination emerged when michigan delegation was in roll call james f joy seventy year old president of michigan central railroad gave speech nominating blaine joy was not a practiced public speaker and he stumbled and rushed through his nomination speech because we are all now impatient for voting joy ended his speech by nominating james s blaine for republican ticket promptly a number of delegates yelled back g g blaine you fool delegates from next state in roll call minnesota nominated senator william windom as their favorite son candidate nine states later roscoe conkling of new york stepped up to podium to present his nomination for ulysses s grant and when asked what state he hails from our sole reply shall be he hails from appomattox and its famous apple tree crowd of 15 000 responded by erupting in cheers conkling built up crowd s energy with his speech and then introduced his candidate by proclaiming new york is for ulysses s grant never defeated never defeated in peace or in war his name is most illustrious borne by living men he later spoke of grant s loyalty to american people and then scolded grant s enemies who had brought up third term issue conkling tried to show that grant was an honest person who had won delegates without patronage and without emissaries without committees and without bureaus after conkling finished his speech boos and hisses came from blaine and sherman backers while applause was heard from stalwart supporters of grant after north carolina s roll call ohio delegation brought out james garfield to give nomination speech for john sherman garfield had not actually written a speech and was nervous about speaking in front of such a large crowd before heading to chicago sherman told garfield that garfield s speech should stress sherman s courageous persistence in any course he had adopted garfield started his speech by emphasizing his overwhelming pride for his role in convention garfield then listed qualities that a president should possess and stressed importance of party unity it wasn t until near his conclusion that he mentioned sherman by name many reports of garfield s speech describe it as enthusiastic eloquent and well received some accounts indicate that it was so well received that it caused delegates to begin thinking of garfield as a contender for presidential nomination on other hand some members of sherman campaign were disappointed by garfield s speech one telegram from a sherman backer sent to sherman himself claimed that garfield has been of no service to you he was extremely lukewarm in his support rumors began to spread that ohio governor charles foster and garfield who were in adjoining suites at grand pacific hotel were conspiring to bring garfield out as a candidate news of finger pointing within sherman camp had carried into newspapers across country albany evening journal reported that t here is a general belief that ohio delegation is ready to desert sherman and go over to blaine in a body although he had become popular with delegates after his speech garfield was upset over accusations of those inside sherman group and he worried how they would affect him in future his close colleagues felt he was becoming too popular too quickly friends like lorenzo coffin felt that his time is not yet garfield heeded advice of his friends to lower his profile at convention but he had already made a deep impression on delegates late sunday night on june 6 indiana senator benjamin harrison grandson of former president william henry harrison came to garfield s hotel suite and asked him under what conditions he would accept nomination garfield replied that he had come to convention for sole purpose of supporting john sherman and told harrison that garfield s name must not be used in nomination balloting at ten o clock on monday morning convention chairman hoar banged his gavel to open convention eugene hale moved to immediately proceed to presidential nominee balloting and roscoe conkling seconded motion newspapers had predicted results of balloting and delegates knew that it would take a number of ballots before a victor could be found first surprise during balloting roll call came when john a logan of illinois announced that of his state s forty two delegates only twenty four were in support of grant this was not as solid as logan had previously advertised to rest of grant backers new york faced a similar situation of its seventy delegates fifty one supported grant seventeen were for blaine and remaining two supported sherman pennsylvania fared even worse as only thirty two of state s fifty eight delegates put in their support for grant after all states were polled results were tabulated grant received 304 votes blaine had 284 sherman had 93 vermont senator george f edmunds received 34 elihu b washburne who had served as united states ambassador to france under president grant had 30 and minnesota senator william windom received 10 of states represented by triumvirate sixty delegates did not support grant none of candidates were close to 379 needed to secure nomination so balloting continued throughout day in washington d c both blaine and sherman were disappointed by their first ballot vote totals blaine had been told that he should expect around 300 first ballot votes but his actual total fell sixteen short and it was also one vote fewer than total he received on first ballot at 1876 convention sherman was told to expect 110 votes which was significantly lower than expected totals for blaine and grant however sherman felt his chance would come later when grant vote split apart after sherman heard his first ballot vote totals he grew visibly angry that some of them votes were taken away from him before ballot began he was upset that nine ohio delegates bolted from sherman and voted instead for his opponent james g blaine sherman blamed blaine for causing delegates to bolt from ohio by methods of falsehood ridicule and treachery in galena illinois grant did not express any emotions after being told about first ballot vote totals as one newsman reported t he silent soldier was smoking his cigar with all his usual serenity grant s wife julia expected a deadlock and suggested to her husband that he surprise delegates in chicago with a visit grant thought this was unwise because it gave an appearance of bad luck and bad manners despite his wife s attempts to change his mind grant remained adamant meanwhile delegates at convention continued to cast ballots until a victor could be determined on second ballot of day a pennsylvania delegate named w a grier cast a vote for james garfield however garfield support remained with that one delegate s vote for most of day delegates cast eighteen ballots before taking a recess for dinner after dinner they came back and cast ten more ballots still no candidate was close to 379 votes needed to win after twelve hours of balloting massachusetts delegate william lovering moved to adjourn for night a few grant delegates objected but motion to adjourn was passed by a vote of 446 to 308 after twenty eight ballots grant had 307 votes blaine had 279 and sherman had 91 and rest of votes were split between favorite son candidates like william windom and george f edmunds suggestions for introducing a dark horse candidate began to take place members backing each candidate were equally determined to win nomination but some felt that deadlock could not be broken if new candidates were not introduced into balloting backers for sherman and blaine met after convention was adjourned chandler laid down his terms blaine had nearly 300 votes and could not simply withdraw as chandler explained even i f mr blaine permits his column to be broken then iowa nebraska kansas nevada california oregon twelve votes in territories will go to grant as would mr blaine s southern votes both sides argued until two or three in morning but no decision had been reached grant leaders had also met that night in roscoe conkling s suite in grand pacific hotel they discussed imposing dangers of grant s nomination bid such as third term resistors many speculated that grant was not going to receive nomination grant backers discussed other two chief candidates and found them both to be unacceptable some of men called for conkling himself as a substitute for grant they argued that with grant out of race conkling would face little resistance for republican nomination however conkling refused to accept idea of being nominated for president he said even if i were to receive every other vote in convention my own would still be lacking and that i would not give i am here as agent of new york to support general grant to end any man who would forsake him under such conditions does not deserve to be elected and could not be elected first ballot on tuesday morning june 8 saw two major breaks in voting massachusetts switched their twenty one votes from senator george edmunds to john sherman spiking his total to 116 highest thus far william chandler also convinced three minnesota delegates to switch their support from their favorite son candidate william windom to james g blaine by thirty second ballot blaine had dropped six votes from night before and grant had increased his total to 309 despite relatively small changes in votes totals roscoe conkling confidently claimed that m embers of n y delegation assert that grant will be nominated before one o clock on thirty third ballot nine wisconsin delegates shifted their support from grant to elihu washburne on next ballot sixteen of twenty wisconsin delegates changed their vote to james garfield garfield immediately called to chairman hoar to raise a question of order garfield challenge d correctness of announcement claiming that without his consent he should not be receiving votes hoar dismissed garfield s question claiming later that he denied garfield because he did not want to see a presidency be undone by a simple point of order meaning he did not want garfield to stop momentum for his own candidacy at this point vote totals for major candidates stood at 312 for grant 275 for blaine 107 for sherman and 17 for garfield then during thirty fifth ballot roll call indiana shifted all 27 of its votes mostly blaine column to garfield four maryland delegates and one delegate each from mississippi and north carolina also switched their votes to garfield bringing his total to 50 blaine seeing that his chances for winning nomination were slipping came to conclusion that james garfield was most suitable alternative nominee to himself garfield was a close friend and blaine felt that by supporting garfield he could defeat grant and conkling and possibly receive an appointment in garfield s administration similarly sherman acting upon advice from his colleagues decided to shift all his support to garfield to save republican party both candidates told their supporters to support garfield s nomination alt cartoon showing ulysses s grant handing a sword to james garfield who is holding a rolled up paper thumb left upright 1 30 a satirical puck cartoon depicting ulysses s grant surrendering to james a garfield after losing 1880 republican presidential nomination to him with blaine and sherman forces now rallying to garfield move toward ohio congressman became a stampede on next ballot convention s thirty sixth garfield won 399 votes 93 more than grant putting him over top and giving him republican nomination blaine finished with 42 washburne had 5 john sherman had 3 and remaining were split amongst other minor candidates garfield was so overwhelmed with emotion after winning nomination that an inter ocean reporter noted that he looked pale as death and seemed to be half unconsciously to receive congratulations of his friends convention was in a mad frenzy as thousands of people chanted for garfield and later joined in singing of battle cry of freedom grant followers like roscoe conkling looked on with glum faces and made no effort to conceal their disappointment conkling took great pride in 306 delegates who had supported grant throughout entire balloting with grant supporters conkling formed a three hundred and six guard society society held annual dinners and even drew up a commemorative coin with inscription old guard afterwards chairman hoar banged his gavel and announced james a garfield of ohio is nominated for president of united states garfield wrote a letter to his wife stating that if results meet your approval i shall be content with nomination garfield s wife lucretia was thrilled with her husband s nomination and gave her approval garfield subsequently resigned senate seat to which he had been elected for term beginning in 1881 and ohio legislature then elected sherman garfield and ohio delegation desired a new york stalwart as garfield s vice presidential running mate partly to placate conkling and partly to balance ticket geographically levi p morton declined after consulting with conkling who was still unhappy over grant s loss and advised morton not to accept nomination was then offered surreptitiously and without consulting garfield to chester a arthur who had close stalwart ties to conkling but who had impressed delegates with his work to broker compromise on selection of a convention chairman conkling tried to talk arthur out of accepting urging him to drop it as you would a red hot shoe from forge but arthur insisted that he would calling vice presidency a greater honor than i ever dreamed of attaining arthur won nomination after he received 468 votes next to 193 for elihu washburne and 44 for third major candidate marshall jewell former governor edmund j davis
