myriostoma is a fungal genus in family geastraceae genus is monotypic containing single species myriostoma coliforme it is an earthstar so named because spore bearing sac s outer wall splits open into shape of a star inedible fungus has a cosmopolitan distribution and has been found in africa asia north and south america and europe where it grows in humus rich forests or in woodlands especially on well drained and sandy soils a somewhat rare fungus it appears on red lists of 12 european countries and in 2004 it was one of 33 species proposed for protection under bern convention by european council for conservation of fungi fruit body initially shaped like a puffball is encased within an outer covering that splits open from top to form rays these rays curve down to expose an inner papery spore case which contains fertile spore bearing tissue gleba fungus is unique among earthstars in having a spore case that is supported by multiple stalks and is perforated by several small holes suggestive of its common names salt shaker earthstar and pepperpot it is largest of earthstar fungi and reaches diameters of up to its spherical spores have elongated warts that create a ridge like pattern on their surface spores are dispersed when falling water hits outer wall of spore sac creating puffs of air that force spores through holes taxonomy and phylogeny species was first mentioned in scientific literature by samuel doody in second edition of john ray s synopsis methodica stirpium in 1696 doody briefly described mushroom like so fungus pulverulentus coli instar perforatus cum volva a powdery mushroom perforated like a colander with a star shaped volva and went on to explain that he found it in 1695 in kent thumb right illustration from james sowerby s coloured figures of english fungi or mushrooms 1803 it was first described scientifically as a new species in 1776 from collections made in england by james dickson who named it lycoperdon coliforme he found it growing in roadside banks and hedgerows among nettles in suffolk and norfolk nicaise auguste desvaux first defined and published new genus myriostoma in 1809 with species renamed myriostoma anglicum an illegitimate renaming christian hendrik persoon had previously placed species in geastrum in 1801 while samuel frederick gray would in 1821 describe genus for it myriostoma coliforme received its current and final name when august carl joseph corda moved dickson s name to myriostoma in 1842 replacing desvaux s name in north america fungus began to be reported in late 19th century first from colorado by charles horton peck and later from florida collected by lucien underwood in 1891 both findings were reported by andrew price morgan in april 1892 in 1897 melville thurston cook also reported having collected it year before from albino beach curtis gates lloyd described simplex from a south african specimen in 1919 but in 1942 william henry long examined that specimen and concluded that it was a weathered spore sac of m coliforme that had become detached from outer star shaped exoperidium this conclusion was confirmed in a later study of material myriostoma had been classified in family geastraceae until 1973 when british mycologist donald placed it in based on presence of trabeculae stout columns that extend from peridium to central core of fruit body in gleba and absence of a true hymenium in his 1989 monograph stellan sunhede returned it to geastraceae molecular analysis of dna sequences has confirmed traditional belief that myriostoma and geastrum are closely related czech naturalist and mycologist vaclav jan stanek proposed a variety in 1958 which has been sunk back into synonymy with species m coliforme is sole species in myriostoma making genus monotypic kirk et al 2008 p 456 because original type material has been lost in 1989 sunhede suggested that dickson s illustration in his 1776 publication tab iii 4a b be used as lectotype specific epithet is derived from latin words colum meaning strainer and forma meaning shape berkeley s vernacular name puff ball also refers to a colander gray called it pill box generic name is from greek words meaning countless and meaning mouth source of technical term stoma species is commonly known as salt and pepper shaker earthstar or simply pepperpot description thumb right brown spores can be seen on surface of this fruit body fruit bodies start their development underground or buried in leaf debris linked to a strand of mycelium at base as they mature exoperidium outer tissue layer of peridium splits open into 7 to 14 rays which curve backward this pushes fruit body above substrate fully opened specimens can reach dimensions of from ray tip to tip rays are of unequal size with tips that often roll back inward they comprise three distinct layers of tissue inner pseudoparenchymatous layer so named for resemblance to tightly packed cells of plant parenchyma is fleshy and thick when fresh and initially pale beige but darkening to yellow or brown as it matures often cracking and peeling off in process exterior mycelial layer often matted with fine leaf debris or dirt usually cracks to reveal a middle fibrous layer which is made of densely packed hyphae 1 2 5 mm wide base of fruit body is concave to vaulted in shape and often covered with adhering dirt roughly spherical spore sac endoperidium measures in diameter and is supported by a cluster of short columns shaped like flattened spheres it is gray brown in color and minutely roughened with small lightly interconnected warts there are several to many evenly dispersed mouths ostioles mainly on upper half of endoperidium they are roughly circular with fimbriate edges inedible fruit bodies have no distinct taste although dried specimens develop an odor resembling curry powder or bouillon cubes like many earthstars fungus uses force of falling raindrops to help disperse spores which are ejected in little bursts when objects such as rain strike outer wall of spore sac gleba is brown to grayish brown with a cotton like texture that when compressed allows endoperidium to flex quickly and create a puff of air that is forced out through ostioles this generates a cloud of spores that can then be carried by wind there are columellae sterile structures that start at base of gleba and extend through it which are usually not evident in mature gleba but apparent at base of spore sac columellae are not connected to ostioles but rather terminate within gleba at some distance from them capillitia sterile strands within gleba are long slender free tapering unbranched and 2 5 mm thick with thickened walls spores are spherical and are ornamented with irregularly shaped flaring protuberances up to 2 mm high they measure 3 9 4 8 mm in diameter without ornamentation and 5 4 7 0 mm including ornamentation similar species myriostoma coliforme is a distinctive species easily characterized by its size being largest earthstar fungus as well as multiple openings on its spore sack and stalk supporting sack historically it was thought that holes might have been a result of insects this was discussed and rejected by thomas jenkinson woodward in 1797 it has been doubted whether these mouths might not be accidental and formed by insects after expansion of plant but this not to mention their regularity and that each is furrowed by its border of cilia is clearly disproved from marks of projections formed by mouths being seen on expanded rays when freshly opened i have likewise found an abortive plant in which seed did not ripen but which had numerous projecting papillae on head where mouths should have been formed habitat and distribution thumb right myriostoma is a saprobic species myriostoma is saprobic deriving nutrients from decomposing organic matter fruit bodies grow grouped in well drained or sandy soil often in partial shade of trees species occurs in deciduous forests and mixed forests gardens along hedges and grassy road banks and grazed grasslands in northern hemisphere it tends to grow on well drained south facing slopes while it prefers a similar habitat on north facing slopes in australia in europe its major habitat is riparian mixed forests dominated by salix alba and populus alba along great rivers in hawaii it has been collected at elevations above where it appears to favor mamane sophora chrysophylla forest species is widespread being known in its natural habitat from all five continents but is not found in abundance myriostoma coliforme is rare in europe where it appears on regional red lists of 12 countries and is one of 33 candidate species for listing in appendix i of convention on conservation of european wildlife and natural habitats bern convention although originally described from england it was considered extinct in mainland britain until it was found again in suffolk in 2006 near ipswich one of its original localities it had been last reported in country in 1880 fungus is considered extinct in switzerland its most northerly location is southern sweden although it is generally rare in northern europe it is similarly widespread but rarely encountered in north america although there may be isolated localities like new mexico where it is more abundant in australia where its range is limited to central new south wales coast it may have been introduced from exotic plant material notes references cited texts external links lectotype illustration from tab iii of james dickson s 1776 fasciculus
