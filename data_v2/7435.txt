also have tutored arsinoe ii philadelphus older sister and eventual wife later tutors of royal offspring in ptolemaic egypt generally headed library of alexandria but it is unknown whether philitas held that position philitas also taught poets hermesianax and theocritus and grammarian and after he returned to cos he seems to have spent at least ten years leading a brotherhood of intellectuals and poets that included aratus hermesianax and theocritus hermesianax wrote of philitas singing of nimble bittis and ovid twice calls her battis it is commonly thought that bittis or battis was philitas mistress and that hermesianax referred to love poetry another possibility is that her name chatterbox and that she was a humorous personification of philitas passion for words philitas was thin and frail and may have suffered and died from a wasting disease he seems to have died in cos sometime in 280s bc his pupil hermesianax wrote that a statue of him was erected under a plane tree by people of cos depicting him as frail with all glosses his contemporary posidippus wrote that philadelphus commissioned a bronze of philitas in old age from sculptor which included nothing from physique of heroes no he cast old man full of cares an alternate translation of posidippus poem is on p 31 of 3rd century ad roman author aelian skeptically passed along a story that philitas was so
