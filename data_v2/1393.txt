to stage blackhill enterprises which had already managed several successful concerts in hyde park including a festival headlined by blind faith in june 1969 attended by 150 000 people were contacted to organise one at next convenient date after organiser compere of that concert sam cutler had met jagger in vip area at concert and later at royal albert hall when asked why festival would be free jagger noted that they had not made much money from previous concert tours anyway and that he felt audience would have a better time if they did not have to pay although he ensured that cost of concert would be covered by selling exclusive television rights to granada television however gradual estrangement of brian jones and his decreasing musical contributions he had only appeared on two tracks on then in progress let it bleed made a return to touring problematic they had shelved rolling stones rock and roll circus after having been upstaged by who by june 1969 matters had finally come to a head and it was decided that jones should be replaced for gig thumb right hyde park concert was mick taylor s first gig with band mick taylor who had by this time obtained a reputation for himself by playing with john mayall bluesbreakers was invited to work on let it bleed band enjoyed his contributions and decided to make him an offer to join full time after considering this for a few days he accepted and his position was officially announced at a press conference in park s bandstand on 13 june single honky tonk women recorded on 1 june with taylor was rush released to tie in with festival date hyde park concert would be taylor s first gig with band and as they had barely had any time to rehearse with him he was understandably nervous jagger too was nervous unsure whether jones s fans would take to taylor and indeed whether they would boycott concert he did not expect crowd to match 150 000 who had come to blind faith gig in addition hot summer had sent pollen levels soaring and jagger suffered from hay fever and laryngitis in days leading up to concert jones died on 3 july two days before festival stones were in olympic studios when they were told of his death by ian stewart and although grief stricken decided they would go ahead with gig and dedicate their performance to him keith richards later wrote band rehearsed at beatles studio in basement of savile row and

festivals in california according to cutler jagger said that he was keen on doing a similar free concert in california at some time in future at hyde park fifty angels patrolled vicinity of stage though there was little resemblance other than a superficial one to their american counterparts they performed their duties in exchange for a cup of tea in event there were only twelve arrests on day and a subsequent police report claimed that angels were totally ineffective king crimson at this point still consisted of original line up of robert fripp greg lake ian mcdonald michael giles and lyricist peter sinfield they had not yet released an album and were invited to play on strength of word of mouth after their live performances in venues such as marquee club sam cutler introduced them

before concert that any butterflies released by stones should be sterilised and should certainly not be of voracious cabbage white genus pieris spp 2 500 butterflies were due to be released but due to hot weather many of them died from lack of air in storage stones then launched into i m yours and i m hers which according to philip norman was an ironic choice given that marianne faithfull and
