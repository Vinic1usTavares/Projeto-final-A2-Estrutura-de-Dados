legislature and offered his appraisal of what had occurred in baltimore undoubtedly extraordinary depression which has existed for past four years in all branches of business compelled great railway lines to make reductions in their expenditures and thus numbers of unemployed have been constantly added to want and suffering produced by such a condition of working classes is always an evil greatly to be deplored but one unfortunately that cannot be reached by immediate legislation great and only remedy for unemployed labor is revival of business and encouragement of a judicious political system by which it will be brought about in 2013 a historical marker was placed on howard street side of camden station it was state funded and coordinated by maryland historical trust and maryland state highway administration text of marker was proposed by bill barry director of labor studies at baltimore county community college see also notes references external links category 1877 labor disputes
