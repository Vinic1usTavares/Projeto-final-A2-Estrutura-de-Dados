typhoon omar of 1992 known in philippines as typhoon lusing was strongest and costliest typhoon to strike guam since typhoon pamela in 1976 cyclone formed on august 23 from monsoon trough across western pacific ocean moving westward omar slowly intensified into a tropical storm although another tropical cyclone nearby initially impeded further strengthening after two storms became more distant omar quickly strengthened into a powerful typhoon on august 28 it made landfall on guam with winds of 195 km h 120 mph typhoon reached its peak intensity next day with estimated 1 minute winds of 240 km h 150 mph making it a super typhoon according to joint typhoon warning center jtwc omar weakened significantly before striking eastern taiwan on september 4 proceeding into eastern china next day and dissipating on september 9 on guam omar caused one death and 457 million 1992 usd in damage strong gusts up to 248 km h 154 mph left nearly entire island without power for several days outages disrupted water system and prevented island based jtwc from issuing advisories for 11 days omar damaged or destroyed 2 158 houses leaving 3 000 people homeless in response to destruction island s building codes were updated to withstand winds of 250 km h 155 mph and insurance companies discontinued new policies for structures not made of concrete while passing well north of philippines typhoon killed 11 people and wrought p903 million 35 4 million worth of damage to 538 houses omar then brushed southern islands of japan with strong gusts and light rainfall causing y 476 million jpy us 3 8 million in crop losses in taiwan scattered flooding caused three deaths and 65 million in damage mostly to agriculture typhoon karen in 1962 was stronger gust to 207 wind gauge blew away may have been stronger it did not do as much dollar damage because island was not as developed meteorological history typhoon omar originated from a tropical disturbance that was first noted on august 20 over open pacific ocean which exhibited persistent convection or thunderstorms during this early phase two tropical cyclones dissipated and another became extratropical across western pacific basin this caused monsoon trough which spawned most of storms in basin to realign in a more climatologically appropriate manner according to japan meteorological agency jma omar developed into a tropical depression at 1800 utc on august 23 joint typhoon warning center jtwc assessed a slower pace of strengthening issuing a tropical cyclone formation alert at 2100 utc before initiating advisories on tropical depression 15w on august 24 as depression traveled generally westward jtwc upgraded it to tropical storm omar on august 25 and jma followed suit on next day omar began to slow as it tracked westward outflow from nearby tropical storm polly to west produced a stream of strong wind shear over omar slowing intensification jtwc noted that shear could decouple omar s wind circulation from its convection possibly weakening storm however as omar and polly moved farther apart a high pressure ridge developed between storms this caused omar to drift northward and then west northwestward into a region with decreased shear which allowed it to resume strengthening early on august 27 jtwc upgraded system to a typhoon and an eye began to appear around 23 00 utc that day omar entered a phase of rapid intensification on august 28 at which point jma also classified it as a typhoon typhoon made landfall on guam soon after with 1 minute sustained winds of about 195 km h 120 mph eye 37 km 23 mi in diameter slowly crossed northern portion of small island over a period of 2 5 hours at 1800 utc on august 29 omar reached its peak intensity with 10 minute sustained winds of 185 km h 115 mph and a minimum barometric pressure of 920 mbar hpa 27 17 inhg as estimated by jma this intensity was maintained for 24 hours before a steady weakening trend began jtwc estimated higher 1 minute winds of around 240 km h 150 mph making omar a super typhoon two days later typhoon came close enough to philippines to warrant monitoring from pagasa who named storm lusing by 1500 utc on september 3 jma downgraded omar to a tropical storm although jtwc maintained its typhoon intensity through next day heading generally westward storm made landfall on east coast of taiwan near hualien city on september 4 after traversing island in seven hours omar exited coast of yunlin county and emerged into taiwan strait storm crossed body of water and moved ashore in eastern china near xiamen fujian on september 5 inland omar quickly degenerated into a tropical depression before turning west southwest it proceeded across southern china while heavily weakening and completely dissipated over northern vietnam on september 9 preparations and impact thumb 250px damage from omar in guam alt elevated black and white photograph of businesses surrounding a shoreline road though waves and sea can

indicating destructive winds were possible within 48 hours a day later cor was raised to stage 2 all but two united states navy ships were sortied from harbor to prevent damage and remainder rode out storm southwest of guam on august 28 cor 1 was declared highest level in response all fixed wing aircraft and helicopters on island were moved into hangars or transported to japan or philippines all schools were closed for duration of omar s passage over guam flight operations were suspended for at least two days stranding 5 000 passengers on island about 3 100 people rode out storm in emergency shelters omar was strongest and most damaging typhoon to hit guam since typhoon pamela in 1976 typhoon was felt on all parts of guam tropical storm force winds affected island for 16 hours and wind gusts were estimated to have reached 248 km h 154 mph in areas beneath western eyewall however high winds caused anemometer at hagatna to fail during eye s passage and radar at andersen air force base was lost preventing accurate wind speed assessments lowest barometric pressure was at apra harbor omar s slow movement resulted in prolonged heavy rainfall peaking at at guam national weather service office in tiyan and reaching 417 mm 16 41 in at andersen afb damage on guam was heaviest from central region to northern coast in particular to tourist areas and military bases naval computer and telecommunications area master station was shut down due to power outages and water damage to generators two us navy ships uss niagara falls afs 3 and uss white plains afs 4 both naval supply ships went aground due to rough seas and strong winds and dry dock at apra harbor was washed ashore omar destroyed dozens of businesses on island high winds knocked a crane into an apartment building and downed 400 wooden and 20 concrete power poles across tumon leaving 70 of island without power throughout guam omar disrupted transportation and communication systems and led to failure of water pumping systems landslides covered roads and low lying areas were flooded about 2 000 homes were destroyed and another 2 200 were damaged to varying degrees displacing nearly 3 000 people destruction was heaviest to wooden structures buildings made of concrete fared relatively well during storm island wide damage totaled 457 million split nearly evenly between military bases and civilian damage one person died on guam and more than 200 people required emergency treatment including about 80 injured by flying debris elsewhere while over open pacific ocean omar passed well northeast of philippines just days after tropical storm polly caused flooding and deaths in country nation s chief weather specialist noted that omar was more powerful than polly and able to induce monsoon rains over a wide area omar ultimately affected northern luzon primarily cordillera administrative region ilocos region and cagayan valley across country storm killed 11 people typhoon destroyed 393 houses and damaged another 145 leaving 1 965 people homeless damage was estimated at p903 million 35 4 million much of it to agriculture after its destructive landfall in guam omar struck district in taiwan with maximum winds of 78 km h 49 mph worst effects in country were from widespread rain strongest rainfall rates remained concentrated in southern regions peaking at in kaohsiung storm flooded five counties and left 766 000 people without power high waves washed ashore four ships in kaohsiung and farmland and fisheries there as well as in yunlin city and pingtung county suffered heavy damage throughout taiwan omar resulted in three deaths two of which drownings twelve injuries and more than 65 million usd in damage fringes of typhoon dropped light rainfall in outer regions of japan peaking at on iriomote jima highest wind gust was 72 km h 45 mph on yonaguni omar damaged sugar cane and okra in southern japanese islands leading to crop losses of y 476 million jpy us 3 8 million in addition traffic was disrupted and 38 flights were canceled later omar spread rainfall along its path through southern china flooding parts of northwestern hong kong on september 7 aftermath right thumb satellite image of omar on august 31 between guam and taiwan alt black and white satellite image of typhoon omar depicting storm s well defined eye and expansive cyclonic cloud cover immediately after omar s landfall in guam former governor joseph franklin ada declared a state of emergency and former u s president george h w bush declared island a federal disaster area in wake of storm several people were arrested for looting federal emergency management agency opened up disaster assistance centers where residents were able to apply for federal aid it ultimately provided about 18 4 million in assistance including disaster housing storm related unemployment benefits and grant programs for families or businesses helping over 11 000 people federal government paid for 100 of debris removal emergency work and reconstruction of uninsured public buildings although it usually only provides 75 of cost for typical disasters this was due to sequence of three significant tropical cyclones affecting united states in three weeks in addition to omar hurricane andrew struck florida in august and hurricane iniki hit hawaii in september department of defense assisted affected areas with 27 members of guam national guard and 700 members of military military provided temporary housing generators and construction supplies at a cost of 5 75 million though most of disaster needs were handled by government local red cross provided 6 million in assistance after storm due to combined damages from andrew iniki and omar united states congress passed dire emergency supplemental appropriations act 1992 which provided additional funding for agencies responding to disasters through fiscal year ending on september 30 for 11 days jtwc on guam was unable to continue operations relying on a backup agency damage to airport radar prompted nexrad a network of high resolution weather radars to be installed earlier than scheduled in february 1993 and limited incoming and outgoing flights to daytime on august 30 a naval ship docked at apra harbor to provide a temporary mobile radar by september 15 both ships that had been washed ashore were refloated in aftermath of destruction insurance companies decided to stop issuing new policies for structures not made of concrete in january 1996 former governor carl gutierrez issued an executive order mandating that homes or storm shutters on island withstand winds of at least 250 m h 155 mph citizens left homeless by omar resided in a tent city nicknamed camp omar consisting of 200 tents holding more than 1 000 people volunteers and military efforts cleaned most of debris on island within a few weeks many important roads were reopened by three days after storm power took four weeks to be restored island wide disrupting schools and businesses although water access was expected to be restored within a few days of storm schools reopened on september 14 and most businesses resumed their work by end of month united states military ceased relief operations on september 19 though complete recovery was disrupted by passage of several subsequent typhoons these storms caused less damage than normal after omar wrecked more vulnerable structures as a result it became difficult to discern damage between omar and typhoon gay in december 1992 a 1993 study in medical journal anxiety found that 7 2 of 320 participants affected by omar developed acute stress reaction and another 15 developed early traumatic stress response especially those affected by later typhoons about 5 9 of participants displayed symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder similar to levels shown after hurricane hugo in 1989 due to destruction in guam name omar was retired and was replaced with oscar in 1993 see also typhoon
