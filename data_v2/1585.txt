neighborhood of richmond hill while he had to sell property of richmond hill golf club and 25 acres of estate he still owned a lot of land in richmond hill and therefore financially benefitted from

in advertisements to convince buyers to move to community service initially consisted of more than twenty daily trains in each direction with many trains running nonstop to penn station owing to railroad s franchise which prohibited passenger stations within of penn station in anticipation of demand for housing in community haugaard brothers purchased land from man estate and built several houses within a few minutes of station between 1910 and 1911 38 buildings were built in community old station building for maple grove was moved approximately south alongside and perpendicular to tracks for use as a real estate office of developers of kew but was razed a short time later prior to opening of new station and development accompanying it station was referred to as north richmond hill but was named kew after residents and long island rail road requested that name be changed to avoid confusion soon after in 1912 station was renamed kew gardens this name was chosen as it was name of an adjacent town to richmond hill england which was ancestral home of alrick man on july 1 1914 hillside transportation company began running a bus line along lefferts avenue connecting kew

1 1964 tri state transit commission began a year long test of a mechanical fare collection system at westbound platforms of kew gardens and forest hills fencing was installed requiring passengers to enter through station house and then insert their magnetically encoded tickets into turnstiles in november 1963 lirr announced a plan to shorten platforms at forest hills and kew gardens by railroad s justification was that ridership at stations was low and did not warrant repairing crumbling concrete these sections of platforms had been installed in about 1929 to allow stations to accommodate full length trains this move was opposed by civic groups and resulted in an investigation by public service commission however platform extensions were removed in 1965 or 1966 prior to their removal platforms extended to overpass at 82nd avenue formerly known as onslow place a staircase from each platform allowed passengers to enter and leave station from its western end compare eastbound platform used to have a waiting room but it was removed in late 1970s in early 1990s westbound platform was extended by about doubling number of cars that could platform at station to four compare on february 1 1980 lirr in response to audit released by state comptroller on november 16 1979 submitted a proposal to close 29 stations including kew gardens to save 250 000 audit evaluated ticket sales in 1976 and recommended that stations with fewer than 60 transactions per hour be closed thirty nine lirr stations fell in to this category but ten were not recommended for closure either because they were terminals or switch locations in addition to kew gardens forest hills east hampton sea cliff and locust valley would be completely closed other stations would have been closed on weekends every day but monday or closed half of day in metropolitan transportation authority mta s 2010 2014 capital program it proposed lengthening four car long platforms at kew gardens and forest hills to allow additional train cars to board at station platform extensions would reduce waiting time at station while allowing for more efficient operations between jamaica and penn station although 4 5 million was allocated for project money was ultimately redistributed to other projects on july 26 2018 it was announced that lirr planned to extend platforms at kew gardens and forest hills by to accommodate six car trains platform extensions will consist of fiberglass decking supported by steel scaffolding structures allowing extensions to be completed quickly and at a low cost while allowing lirr to plan for a permanent solution preparation work began during week of july 23 and new extensions went into service week of september 12 2018 lefferts boulevard bridge thumb all shops to right of pizzeria are on lefferts boulevard bridge over station in order to pass over long island rail road at eastern end of kew gardens station lefferts boulevard passes over on an long bridge which is lined on both sides with commercial buildings bridge was built in 1910 and stores on either side of bridge which were located on their own bridges were constructed in early 1930s bridges that hold stores in place actually run through their roofs with stores hanging from bridge bridge upon which lefferts boulevard passes over is owned by new york city department of transportation nycdot while other two bridges are owned by lirr and are leased to a master tenant which leases out buildings to local businesses building facade for stores on western side of bridge is in neo tudor design while facade for stores on eastern side is in art deco style bridge has been called ponte vecchio meaning old bridge in italian and refers to bridge in florence which has stores on either side of it bridge is heart of community of kew gardens and its residents have attributed charm of neighborhood to it it is only bridge in new york city and likely in united states that has stores on either side of it and therefore many kew gardens residents have pushed for its designation as a landmark on national registry of historical places to protect it from development demolition threats in 1991 mta drafted plans to build a twelve story condominium and parking lot on top of kew gardens station which is only from bridge but withdrew them after local civic leaders fought plan which could have threatened bridge in june 1991 nycdot began a 2 9 million project to rebuild concrete surface of bridge and to replace its steel girders and deck beams project was scheduled to be completed in 15 months due to construction sidewalks were narrowed parking was abolished and traffic was slowed with roadway narrowed to two lanes as a result business declined at stores on either side of bridge with nine of thirteen stores on bridge closing even as rents were halved however from october 1991 to january 1992 work stopped due to a design error which made new girders an inch too high completion was then delayed by three months in 1992 mta ended lease of company that had managed stores on bridge since 1981 citing company s refusal to make repairs which allowed stores to deteriorate agency for next 14 months rented stores at a discounted rate every month as it was looking for a buyer to make repairs mta did not pay for repairs as it had more pressing repairs which needed to be done to keep subway system running in may 2017 mta announced that it wanted to rebuild bridge which runs from austin street to grenfell street it told business owners on bridge that their stores would be torn down once management company s lease expired in 2020 if bridge was rebuilt it was unclear what would replace existing businesses bridge is in such bad condition that in spring 2017 a hole opened up in storage room of thyme natural market in response save kew gardens coalition was created in order to convince mta not to tear down bridge coalition is made up of local civic groups such as kew gardens civic association kew gardens improvement association and friends of maple grove cemetery in july in response to strong community opposition and pushback from city council member karen koslowitz and others mta officials changed their stance opening up to possible ideas about how to repair bridge decks which are 80 years old and decaying while keeping businesses in place mayor bill de blasio when asked said that he was against its demolition and sent dot engineers to visit site also in july three engineers one from nycdot one from mta and a retired engineer al brand determined that is might be feasible to install an additional concrete slab which would be to wide underneath bridge this alternative was deemed feasible mta announced that an engineering feasibility study which would be funded by koslowitz would be conducted but it is unclear how much it will cost and who will conduct it koslowitz had hoped to use 1 million to fund it but because it is capital money it can only be used for construction instead she started looking for funding from city and state on november 14 2017 queens community board 9 unanimously backed a resolution asking mta not to tear down bridge on july 11 2018 lirr announced that it planned to repair bridge using funds that koslowitz had obtained for a study platforms and tracks left thumb station s short platforms can be seen from 82nd avenue bridge over
