it also guarded approach to bridge that connected anacostia then known as uniontown with washington built in 1861 fort was expanded throughout war and was joined by two subsidiary forts fort ricketts and fort snyder following surrender of army of northern virginia it was dismantled and land returned to its original owner it never saw combat abandoned after war site of fort was planned to be part of a grand fort circle park system encircling city of washington though this system of interconnected parks never was fully implemented site of fort is today a park maintained by national park service

fortifications under construction new forts would defend city in all directions not just most direct route through arlington in mid july this work was interrupted by first battle of bull run as army of northeastern virginia marched south to manassas soldiers previously assigned to construction duties marched instead to battle in days that followed union defeat at bull run panicked efforts were

earthworks that resulted were largely confined to arlington and direct approaches to washington on july 26 1861 five days after battle maj gen george b mcclellan was named commander of military district of washington and subsequently renamed army of potomac upon arriving in washington mcclellan was appalled by condition of city s defenses in no quarter were dispositions for defense such as to offer a vigorous resistance to a respectable body of enemy either in position and numbers of troops or number and character of defensive works not a single defensive work had been commenced on maryland side there was nothing to prevent enemy shelling city from heights within easy range which could be occupied by a hostile column almost without resistance u s war department war of rebellion a compilation of official records of union and confederate armies 70 volumes washington dc government printing office 1880 1901 i volume 5 p 11 to remedy situation one of mcclellan s first orders upon taking command was to greatly expand defenses of washington at all points of compass forts and entrenchments would be constructed in sufficient strength to defeat any attack one area of particular concern was region of maryland south of anacostia river confederate artillery floated across potomac in secret and mounted south of river could threaten washington navy yard and washington arsenal

uniontown today known as anacostia to east not shown are forts snyder and ricketts to prevent that threat from coming to pass brig gen john g barnard chief engineer of defenses of washington directed that a line of forts be constructed on heights southeast of anacostia river from fort greble at western end to fort mahan at eastern end forts along eastern branch river as anacostia was then known were not intended to constitute a continuous defensive line as was arlington line that defended virginia approaches to city instead they were merely intended to deny confederate artillery position and to provide warning of any sneak attack upon washington from southeast general barnard illustrated this in an october 1862 report saying as enemy cannot enter city from this direction object of works is to prevent him seizing these heights and occupying them long enough to shell navy yard and arsenal for this works must be made secure against assault and auxiliary to this object is construction of roads by which succor can be readily thrown to any point menaced official records i 19 part 2 serial 28 pp 391 93 fort stanton located in garfield heights was first fort of this line to begin construction begun in september 1861 fort was located almost directly south of washington navy yard and navy yard bridge that crossed anacostia river and connected uniontown a suburb of washington with city itself work progressed rapidly and by christmas a report by general barnard indicated fort was completed and armed official records i volume 5 11 pp 678 84 despite that speed not everything went in engineers favor barnard s report indicates sites of fort stanton and others were entirely wooded which in conjunction with broken character of ground has made selection of sites frequently very embarrassing and labor of preparing them very great official records i volume 5 11 p 681 experience of surveying and preparing site of fort stanton would serve engineers well in construction of future forts around washington and in service to army of potomac clearing brush and forest away from site of fort stanton allowed for clear fields of fire for fort s cannon for several hundred yards in each direction a technique that would be applied and later used to great effect at fort stevens wartime operation by summer of 1862 fort was already being heavily used a garrison had been assigned in winter and 1862 report of commission to study defenses of washington describes fort stanton as a work of considerable dimensions well built and tolerably well armed casemates for reversed fires are recommended in northwest and southwest counterscarp angles and platforms for two or three rifled guns on east front deep ravine which flanks this work on two sides requires some additional precaution and further study of it is recommended official records i 21 serial 31 pp 915 16 commission had been ordered by secretary of war edwin m stanton to inspect each of forts surrounding washington in late 1862 and make a report on deficiencies of each in addition to examining fort stanton commission analyzed two smaller works that supported fort stanton fort ricketts was identified in report as a battery intended to see ravine in front of fort stanton which it does but imperfectly while fort snyder may be regarded as an outwork to fort stanton guarding head of one branch of ravine just mentioned except additional platforms for field guns and a ditch in front of gorge stockade and blockhouses nothing further seems necessary official records i 21 serial 31 p 915 to support fort stanton and its two subsidiary positions a military road was constructed from uniontown to fort tributary roads led from fort stanton to other forts in eastern branch line these roads were eventually widened into a large ring road that circled most of 37 mile perimeter of washington a fact that can be noted in 1865 bureau war department military map of ne virginia and washington defenses library

official records i 26 part 2 serial 68 pp 893 97 following confederate raid on washington that resulted in battle of fort stevens new assessments were made of weak spots in washington s defenses in three years between construction of fort stanton and attack on fort stevens fort stanton s perimeter had been greatly increased with addition of two subsidiary forts and additional rifle pits and trenches as well as completion of military ring road a report by maj gen christopher c augur of u s volunteers recommended fort stanton receive one 32 pounder howitzer two 4 1 2 inch rifled guns four

washington ceased to exist initial recommendations by col alexander chief engineer of washington defenses were to divide defenses into three classes those that should be kept active first class those that should be mothballed and kept in a reserve state second class and those that should be abandoned entirely third class fort stanton fell into first class category as it was thought that fort would be needed to defend washington navy yard official records serial 97 series i volume xlvi part 3 p 1130 thanks to its status as a first class fortification fort stanton continued to receive regular maintenance and was continually garrisoned even after final armistice work was even done to strengthen defenses as a stockade was added in summer of 1865 and parapets of fort were re with fresh grass

prominently in later portions of book and he uses state of fort stanton as an example of what had become of forts a decade after they had been built fort circle parks fort remained in a constantly deteriorating condition until 1919 when commissioners of district of columbia pushed congress to pass a bill that would consolidate aging forts into a fort circle system of parks that would ring growing city of washington as envisioned by commissioners fort circle would be a green ring of parks outside city owned by government and connected by a fort drive road in order to allow washington s citizens to easily escape confines of capital however bill allowing for purchase of former forts which had been turned back over to private ownership after war failed to pass both house of representatives and senate journal of house of representatives of united states 66th congress 1st session washington dc government printing office 1919 p 594 despite that failure in 1925 a similar
