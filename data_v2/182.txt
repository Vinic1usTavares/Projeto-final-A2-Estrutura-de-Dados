ambushed and murdered by achilles sophocles was one of writers to tell this tale it was also a popular theme among artists of time ancient writers treated troilus as epitome of a dead child mourned by his parents he was also regarded as a paragon of youthful male beauty in western european medieval and renaissance versions of legend troilus is youngest of priam s five legitimate sons by hecuba

number of incidents that helped provide structure to a narrative that extended over several decades and 77 books from beginning of cypria to end of telegony character s death early in war and prophecies surrounding him demonstrated that all trojan efforts to defend their home would be in vain his symbolic significance is evidenced by linguistic analysis of his greek name troilos it can be interpreted as an elision of names of tros and ilos legendary founders of troy as a diminutive or pet name little tros or as an elision of troie troy and lyo to destroy these multiple possibilities emphasise link between fates of troilus and of city where he lived boitani 1989 pp 4 5 on another level troilus fate can also be seen as foreshadowing subsequent deaths of his murderer achilles and of his nephew astyanax and sister polyxena who like troilus die at altar in at least some versions of their stories burgess 2001 pp 144 5 given this it is unfortunate that cypria part of epic cycle that

from before hellenistic age 323 30 bc that even referred to character are lost or survive only in fragments or summary surviving ancient and medieval sources whether literary or scholarly contradict each other and many do not tally with form of myth that scholars now believe to have existed in archaic and classical periods partially compensating for missing texts are physical artifacts that

antiquity and beyond death of troilus by boitani 1989 pp 1 19 brutality of this standard form of myth is highlighted by commentators such as alan sommerstein an expert on ancient greek drama who

adolescent master sophocles troilus fr 629 incestuous love is deduced by sommerstein from a fragment of strattis parody assumed to partially quote sophocles and from his understanding that sophocles

introduced by benoit de sainte maure in roman de troie and developed by guido delle colonne boccaccio s il filostrato is first book to take love story as its main theme robert henryson and john dryden are other authors who dedicate works to it story of troilus romance developed within context of male centred conventions of courtly love and thus focus of sympathy was to be troilus and not his beloved roberto antonelli 1989 pp 22 as different authors recreated romance they would interpret it in ways affected both by perspectives of their own times and their individual preoccupations story as it would later develop through works of boccaccio chaucer and shakespeare is summarised below story of troilus and cressida troilus used to mock foolishness of other young men s love affairs but one day he sees cressida in temple of athena and falls in love with her she is a young widow and daughter of priest calchas who has defected to greek camp embarrassed at having become exactly sort of person he used to ridicule troilus tries to keep his love secret however he pines for cressida and becomes so withdrawn that his friend pandarus asks why he is unhappy and eventually persuades troilus to reveal his love pandarus offers to act as a go between even though he is cressida s relative and should be guarding her honour pandarus convinces cressida to admit that she returns troilus love and with pandarus s help two are able to consummate their feelings for each other their happiness together is brought to an end when calchas persuades agamemnon to arrange cressida s return to him as part of a hostage exchange in which captive trojan antenor is freed two lovers are distraught and even think of eloping together but they finally cooperate with exchange despite cressida s initial intention to remain faithful to troilus greek warrior diomedes wins her heart when troilus learns of this he seeks revenge on diomedes and greeks and dies in battle just as cressida betrayed troilus antenor was later to betray troy benoit and guido in roman de troie daughter of calchas whom troilus loves is called briseis their relationship is first mentioned once hostage exchange has been agreed whoever had joy or gladness troilus suffered affliction and grief that was for daughter of calchas for he loved her deeply he had set his whole heart on her so mightily was he possessed by his love that he thought only of her she had given herself to him both her body and her love most men knew of that gordon 1934 p 8 translation in guido troilus and diomedes love is now called briseida his version a history is more moralistic and less touching removing psychological complexity of benoit s a romance and focus in his retelling of love triangle is firmly shifted to betrayal of troilus by briseida although briseida and diomedes are most negatively caricatured by guido s moralising even troilus is subject to criticism as a fatuous youth prone as in following to youthful faults roberto antonelli 1989 pp 46 8 troilus however after he had learned of his father s intention to go ahead and release briseida and restore her to greeks was overwhelmed and completely wracked by great grief and almost entirely consumed by tears anguished sighs and laments because he cherished her with great fervour of youthful love and had been led by excessive ardour of love into intense longing of blazing passion there was no one of his dear ones who could console him e m meek translation ixx 127 133 briseis at least for now is equally affected by possibility of separation from her lover troilus goes to her room and they spend night together trying to comfort each other troilus is part of escort to hand her over next day once she is with greeks diomedes is immediately struck by her

a battle soon takes place and diomedes unseats troilus from his horse greek sends it as a gift to briseis briseida with an explanation that it had belonged to her old lover in benoit briseis complains

take him as her lover because she does not know if she will ever meet troilus again in later medieval tellings of war episode of troilus and briseida cressida is acknowledged and often given as a

features of story that were to be taken up by chaucer most obvious is that troilus love is now called or cressida according to frazer 1966 p 170 this is possibly influence by a similar change in of bologna s an innovation in narrative is introduction of go between pandarus troilus is characterised as a young man who expresses whatever moods he has strongly weeping when his love is unsuccessful generous when it is boccaccio fills in history before hostage exchange as follows troilus mocks lovelorn glances of other men who put their trust in women before falling victim to love himself when he sees cressida here a young widow in palladium temple of athena troilus keeps his love secret and is made miserable by it pandarus troilus best friend and cressida s cousin in this version of story

worldly wise and more active in what happens and so troilus is more passive windeatt 1989 p 128 this passivity is given comic treatment when troilus passes out in criseyde s bedroom and is lifted into her bed by pandarus troilus repeated emotional paralysis is comparable to that of hamlet who may have been based on him it can be seen as driven by loyalty both to criseyde and to his homeland but has also been interpreted less kindly jennifer r goodman nature as destiny in troilus and criseyde style fall 1997 another difference in troilus characterisation from filostrato is that he is no longer

cressida of troilus virtues over those of hector before uncle and niece witness troilus returning from battle to public acclaim with much damage to his helmet chaucer also includes details from earlier narratives so reference is made not just to boccaccio s brooch but to glove captured horse and battles of two lovers in benoit and guido because of great success of troilus love story was popular as a free standing tale to be retold by english language writers throughout 15th and 16th centuries and into 17th century theme was treated either seriously or in burlesque for many authors

shakespeare s retelling diomedes captures troilus horse in first fight and sends it to cressida then trojan triumphs in second though diomedes escapes but in a deviation from this narrative it is hector not troilus whom myrmidons surround in climatic battle of play and whose body is dragged behind achilles horse troilus himself is left alive vowing revenge for hector s death and rejecting pandarus troilus story ends as it began in medias res with him and remaining characters in his love triangle remaining alive some seventy years after shakespeare s troilus was first presented john dryden re worked it as a tragedy in his view strengthening troilus character and indeed whole play by removing many of unresolved threads in plot and ambiguities in shakespeare s portrayal of protagonist as a believable youth rather than a clear cut and thoroughly sympathetic hero m e novak 1984 p 521 rufini 1989 pp 245 6 dryden described this as that heap of rubbish under which many excellent thoughts lay bury d dryden preface to troilus and cressida in novak 1984 p 226 his troilus is less passive on stage about hostage exchange arguing with hector over handing over of cressida who remains faithful her scene with diomedes that troilus witnesses is her attempt to deceive dryden troilus and cressida iv ii 314 she throws herself at her warring lovers feet to protect troilus and commits suicide to prove her loyalty unable to leave a still living troilus on stage as shakespeare did dryden restores his death at hands of achilles and myrmidons but only after troilus has killed diomedes according to p boitani dryden goes to opposite extreme of shakespeare s all problems and therefore tragedy boitani 1989 p 286 modern versions after dryden s shakespeare troilus is almost

engagement in recovery of all sorts of past myths boitani 1989 p 289 as contributing to a rekindling of interest in troilus as a human being destroyed by events beyond his control similarly foakes

symbol of troy s own destruction therefore are two core elements of troilus myth for editor of first book length survey of it from ancient to modern times he sees character as incapable of transformation on a heroic scale in manner of ulysses and also blocked from possibility of development as an archetypal figure of troubled youth by hamlet troilus appeal for 20th and 21st century is his very humanity belief in medieval tradition of trojan war that followed dictys and dares survived revival of learning in renaissance and advent of first english translation of iliad in form of chapman s homer shakespeare used both homer and lefevre as sources for his troilus however two supposedly eye witness accounts were finally discredited by jacob in early years of 18th century frazer

following her around after turning down opportunity to kiss her when she offers and when confronted by paris he eventually accepts kiss at end of play just as troy has committed to war he is thus a symbol of whole city s fatal fascination with helen boitani 1989 p 290 troilus in one of his ancient manifestations as a boy soldier overwhelmed reappears both in works boitani discusses and those he does not christa wolf in her kassandra features a seventeen year old troilus first to die of all sons of priam novel s treatment of character s death has features of both medieval and ancient versions boitani 1989 p 301 troilus has just gained his first love once more called briseis it is only after his death that she is to betray him on first day of war achilles seeks troilus out and forces him into battle with help of myrmidons troilus tries to fight in way he has been taught princes should do but achilles strikes boy down and leaps on top of him before attempting to throttle him troilus escapes and runs to sanctuary of temple of apollo where he is helped to take his armour off then in some of most powerful and hair raising words ever written on troilus death boitani 1989 p 304 wolf describes how achilles enters temple caresses then half throttles terrified boy who lies on altar before finally beheading him like a sacrificial victim after his death trojan council propose that

suggested by ancient vases where an erotic aura seems to pervade representations of a fully armed achilles pursuing or butchering a naked boyish troilus boitani 1989 p 17 colleen mccullough is another author who incorporates both medieval achilles seeking troilus out in battle and ancient butchery at altar her song of troy includes two characters troilos and ilios no son of priam with this or a similar name is discussed in sources on greek mythology such as those by gantz or graves nor does ilios appear in apollodorus or hyginus lists of priam s children who are priam s youngest children both with prophecies attached and both specifically named for city s founders they are eight and seven respectively when paris leaves for greece and somewhere in their late teens when killed troilos is made priam s heir after hector s death against boy s will odysseus s spies learn of prophecy that troy will not fall if troilos comes of age achilles therefore seeks him out in next battle and kills him with a spear cast to his throat in a reference to medieval concept of troilus as second hector observes that with a few more years added he might have made another hektor mccullough c 1998 song of troy london orion p 402 ilios is last son of priam to die killed at altar in front of his parents by marion zimmer bradley s firebrand features an even younger troilus just twelve when he becomes hector s charioteer his brother wants to keep a protective eye on him now he is ready for war troilus helps kill patroclus although he manages to escape immediate aftermath of hector s death he is wounded after trojans witness achilles treatment of hector s body troilus insists on rejoining battle despite his wounds and hecuba s attempts to stop him achilles kills him with an arrow mourning hecuba comments that he did not want to live because he blamed himself for hector s death reinventing love story a feature already present in treatments of love story by chaucer henryson shakespeare and dryden is repeated reinvention of its conclusion boitani sees this as a continuing struggle by authors to find a satisfying resolution to love triangle major difficulty is emotional dissatisfaction resulting from how tale as originally invented by benoit is embedded into pre existing narrative of trojan war with its demands for characters to meet their traditional fates this narrative has troilus sympathetic protagonist of love story killed by achilles a character totally disconnected from love triangle diomedes survive to return to greece victorious and cressida disappear from consideration as soon as it is known that she has fallen for greek modern authors continue to invent their own resolutions boitani 1989 pp 297 300 william walton s troilus and cressida is best known and most successful of a clutch of 20th century operas on subject after composers of previous eras had ignored possibility of setting story boitani 1989 pp 287 289 294 christopher hassall s libretto blends elements of chaucer and shakespeare with inventions of its own arising from a wish to tighten and compress plot desire to portray cressida more sympathetically and search for a satisfactory ending boitani 1989 p 294 antenor is as usual exchanged for cressida but in this version of tale his capture has taken place while he was on a mission for troilus cressida agrees to marry diomedes after she has not heard from troilus his apparent silence however is because his letters to her have been intercepted troilus arrives at greek camp just before planned wedding when faced with her two lovers cressida chooses troilus he is then killed by calchas with a knife in back diomedes sends his body back to priam with calchas in chains it is now greeks who condemn false cressida and seek to keep her but she commits suicide before cressida kills herself she sings to troilus to turn on that cold river s brim beyond sun s far setting look back from silent stream of sleep and long forgetting turn and consider me and all that was ours you shall no desert see but pale flowers walton hassall troilus and cressida quoted by boitani 1989 p 297 this is one of three references in 20th century literature to troilus on banks of river styx that boitani has identified louis macneice s long poem stygian banks explicitly takes its name from shakespeare who has troilus compare himself to a strange soul upon stygian banks and call upon pandarus to transport him to those fields where i may wallow in lily beds shakespeare troilus and cressida iii ii 7 11 in macneice s poem flowers have become children a paradoxical use of traditionally sterile 1989 p 293 who patrols stygian banks eager to cross but value is not on further side of river value lies in his eagerness no communion in sex or elsewhere can be reached and kept perfectly for ever closed window river of styx wall of limitation beyond which word beyond loses its meaning are fertilising paradox grille that severing joins end to make us begin again and again infinite dark that sanctions our growing flowers in light our having children third reference to styx is in christopher morley s trojan horse a return to romantic comedy of chaucer is solution that boitani sees to problem of how love story can survive shakespeare s handling of it boitani 1989 p 288 morley gives us such a treatment in a book that revels in its anachronism young lieutenant soon to be captain troilus lives his life in 1185 bc where he has carefully timetabled everything from praying to fighting to examining his own mistakes he falls for cressida after seeing her as ever in temple of athena where she wears black as if mourning defection of her father economist dr calchas flow of plot follows traditional story but ending is changed once again troilus discovery of cressida s change of heart happens just before troy falls morley uses boccaccio s version of story of a brooch or in this case a pin attached to a piece of diomedes armour as evidence that convinces trojan troilus kills diomedes as he exits trojan horse stabbing him in throat where captured piece of armour should have been then achilles kills troilus book ends with an epilogue trojan and greek officers exercise together by river styx all enmities forgotten a new arrival cressida sees troilus and diomedes and wonders why they seem familiar to her what boitani calls a rather dull if pleasant eternity replaces chaucer s christian version of afterlife boitani 1989 p 292 in eric shanower s graphic novel age of bronze currently still being serialised troilus is youthful but not youngest son of priam and hecuba in first two collected volumes of this version of trojan war shanower provides a total of six pages of sources covering story elements of his work alone these include most of fictional works discussed above from guido and boccaccio down to morley and walton shanower begins troilus love story with youth making fun of polyxena s love for hector and in process accidentally knocking aside cressida s veil he follows latter into temple of athena to at her pandarus is widow cressida s uncle encouraging him cressida rejects troilus initial advances not because of wanting to act in a seemly manner as in chaucer or shakespeare but because she thinks of him as just a boy however her uncle persuades her to encourage his affection in hope that being close to a son of priam will protect against hostility of trojans to family of traitor calchas troilus unrequited love is used as comic relief in an otherwise serious retelling of trojan war cycle character is portrayed as often indecisive and ineffectual as on second page of this episode sample at official site it remains to be seen how shanower will further
