been speculation regarding possibility of a third album and band s future owing to members working on other musical projects after album was completed band said these side projects saved band and helped them break out of box they were in coming back together and working out their differences hindered writing process initially in 2008 drummer joey jordison said we didn t talk to each other for three months we just sat there wasting money in fucking houdini mansion percussionist shawn crahan stated eventually we got sick of waiting for shit to happen we got together had a few beers and wrote a really artsy fucked up song called happy ending in a q a for his book you re making me hate you corey stated that first verse and chorus of circle were written and recorded during iowa tour in 2001 and that it was same take that ended up on album https www youtube com watch v in a 2003 interview jordison explained that despite initial problems more than enough material was written for album and added that it s better to have stuff to pick from than to settle for shit in contrast to how slipknot settled too soon with fewer songs on previous albums band members were divided over their experience of working with producer rubin some doubted his commitment to slipknot as he split his time between many artists at once lead vocalist corey taylor admitted in an interview that he drank heavily throughout their time in mansion saying i would drink from moment i got up until moment i passed out he explained that everything i did while i was drinking sounded like shit while expressing how unhappy he was with choice of vocal takes which ended up on album during this time percussionist crahan worked on inside nine a video documenting creation process of album and touring which would follow in 2008 taylor said he met rubin only four times during entire recording of vol 3 and that rubin barely showed up to studio we were being charged horrendous amounts of money and for me if you re going to produce something you re fucking there i don t care who you are he added he is overrated he is overpaid and i will never work with him again conversely guitarist jim root said in that same interview a lot of guys in band say rick was unavailable and yeah he takes on a lot of projects at one time but he also does things that are beneficial he would listen to what we d done then have us things that needed work he s kind of like big brother up on hill even though he wasn t there physically every day he was that s my favorite record we ve done musical and lyrical themes before release of vol 3 band members had promised a more experimental album drummer jordison said that it s almost as if slayer was tapping on radiohead for first time in slipknot s career songs such as circle and vermilion pt 2 were led by an acoustic rather than an electric guitar according to todd burns of stylus songs such as pulse of maggots and before i forget incorporate a pounding metal style allmusic wrote that tracks such as blister exists three nil and opium of people combine two extremes of their recognizable metal edge with melody and most apparent shifts being in taylor s vocal style with relatively few songs relying solely on screamed vocals in comparison to their earlier work entertainment weekly wrote that album bounced between over powering speed metal and haunting acoustic rock vol 3 subliminal verses is slipknot s first album that does not warrant a parental advisory label mainly because lyrics of vol 3 compared to other slipknot albums are much less explicit in terms of profanity and obscure dark themes special edition still has a parental advisory label in a 2008 interview guitarist mick thomson explained that vocalist corey taylor made a point of avoiding use of profanity in response to claims that he relied on use of it only two instances of profanity occur use of word bitched in duality and bastards which appears in monologue leading into pulse of maggots according to allmusic lyrics of vol 3 subliminal verses include metaphors and touch on themes that include anger disaffection and psychosis taylor s diversity in his vocal delivery was praised burns considered tracks like vermilion pt 2 to have stately vocal harmonies taylor s performance on closing track danger keep away was specifically praised stylus called it most depressing and emotional track on album burns concluded that overall riffs have lost none of their impact but it seems like finally group also wants you to appreciate their vocal and lyrical impact artwork cover of album

album not just another flashy alt metal billboard praising band s dedication to making it a slipknot album todd burns of stylus wrote that people who accuse band of having softened are mistaking

deranged hippie update of slayer s masterpiece reign in blood which was also produced by rubin q hailed vol 3 subliminal verses as a triumph john robb of playlouder complimented slipknot s unexpected rise to become one of biggest groups in world dubbing before i forget a classic slipknot anthem robb added that album is better than iowa citing its differing textures rolling stone gave album a rating of 3 out of 5 stating album presented newer extremes for band which in slipknot s case means tunefulness and traditional song structures a review from bbc praised album declaring that there is no finer metal band on planet it cited group s integration of hyperactive bass drums complex compelling riffs and ridiculously fast fretwork with more melodic styles and described vermilion as key track an emotional melodramatic utterly convincing rollercoaster ride alternative press criticized album writing that it plays out like a tepid second rate version of iowa which pretty much makes it a third rate anything else yahoo s chris heath also reviewed album negatively writing that nameless combines ludicrously vicious and ridiculously placid and that by doing so makes track feel awkward heath added themes are predictably absurd yet mildly comical given inclusion of such disparate styles stationed side by side vol 3 subliminal verses peaked at position number two on us billboard 200
