heck horse is a horse breed that is claimed to resemble tarpan equus ferus ferus an extinct wild equine breed was created by german zoologist brothers heinz heck and lutz heck in an attempt to breed back tarpan although unsuccessful at creating a genetic copy of extinct species they developed a breed with grullo coloration and primitive markings after nazi invasion of poland they were introduced to bialowieza forest where a small herd still survives heck horses were subsequently exported to united states where a breed association was created in 1960s breed characteristics heck horses are dun or grullo a dun variant in color with no white markings breed has primitive markings including a dorsal stripe and horizontal striping on legs heck horses generally stand between tall head is large withers low and legs and hindquarters strong hooves are strong often not needing shoeing gait of heck horse is high stepping which makes them comfortable to ride and which is considered attractive while being driven breed is described as being calm friendly curious and intelligent although very independent physical description of tarpans was very similar strong approximately same height and with same coloration and primitive markings history thumb left heck horses at hellabrunn zoo with less influence from konik tarpan was a eurasian wild horse that became extinct in wild in 1879 due to hunting and crossbreeding with domesticated horses and in 1909 last captive horse died in russia heck horse was created by german zoologist brothers heinz heck and lutz heck director of berlin zoo at tierpark hellabrunn munich zoo in germany in their attempt to breed back tarpan hecks believed they could recreate extinct tarpan subspecies by back breeding living descendants they believed they could combine and rearrange genetic material from these living descendants into a recreation of extinct horse other breeders had same idea and used different genetic stock to attempt to recreate tarpan or a reasonable look alike one result was a line of horses bred from american mustangs by a breeder named harry heck brothers bred together several european small horse and pony breeds hypothesized to be descended from tarpan they eventually integrated mares of konik icelandic horse and gotland breeds these mares were bred to stallions of a wild horse type known as przewalski s horse hecks believed wild przewalski blood would help to draw out wild characteristics they felt lay dormant in domesticated pony breed mares initial crosses were made between gotland and icelandic mares who visually closely resembled tarpan especially in shape of head and przewalski s horse stallions who provided desired dun coloration and upright mane and offspring were then bred to each other first foal born from program who had desired coloration was a colt born on may 22 1933 at tierpark hellabrunn breeding program continued using only those horses who showed desired skull shape bone structure and coloration relatively quickly breed s conformation and coloration became set with parents reliably passing their characteristics onto their offspring during world war ii horses of desired type were taken from german occupied countries to use in hecks breeding program tadeusz vetulani a polish biologist had been working with konik horses at that point believed to be descended from tarpans with goal like hecks of recreating tarpan some of horses from his program had been reintroduced to forests of bialowieza poland during war hecks removed animals from forest and used them in their own breeding programs vetulani considered this a baffling campaign of destruction and hecks actions effectively ended his breeding program some of resulting heck horses closely resembling tarpans were sent back to bialowieza to become part of a hunting preserve for nazi government officials land and horses were returned to polish management after war ended as of 2007 a small herd of horses remained living with little interference from humans in bialowieza forest europe s last remaining area of primeval lowland forest hecks had conducted a similar breeding program in hopes of recreating aurochs resulting in what would become heck cattle export and crossbreeding thumb heck horse in germany 2004 first heck horse in united states was a stallion named duke imported in 1954 by chicago zoological park in illinois followed by two mares in 1955 a third mare was imported by fort worth zoological park in texas in 1962 all four horses came from munich zoo and in early 1990s all heck horses in united states traced back to these animals several private breeders in united states now use these horses for riding and light driving in early 1960s north american tarpan association was founded by heck horse enthusiasts to promote breed in 2002 there were fewer than 100 heck horses in united states most of them having descended from six foundation horses all imported from germany as of 2013 a small number of heck horses lived in a feral state in latvia several breeders have crossed heck horse with other breeds to get a larger horse with some of primitive characteristics breeds commonly crossed with heck horse are welsh pony and arabian horse and a new breed of pony called canadian rustic pony has been developed from these three breeds in europe many breeders cross heck
