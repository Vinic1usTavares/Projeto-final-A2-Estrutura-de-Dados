development original idea behind millennium came from an episode of x files chris carter had written about a serial killer episode got carter thinking about monsters who lurked in shadows later he started to flesh out a character which would become frank black but he was busy working with other projects at time in mid 1990s after success of x files fox network asked carter if he could create another show for them originally show was planned to include a new murder mystery each week at same time having a comprehensive storyline so carter created idea of new millennium which could give show its own feel he felt he could capitalise and at same time have a new murder mystery every week with a millennial twist to it he also wanted to explore evil not scientific approach which was psychological explanation of evil carter wanted to explore evil through an unscientific approach an exploration where bible played an important role while clearly stating that show was not supposed to be heavily grounded in religious text he felt in many ways that bible explained things on various levels and not just in modern scientific way casting and characters chris carter had envisioned lance henriksen portraying character of frank black long before he was ever contacted although carter s colleagues responded positively to selection fox network wanted someone younger to take lead part fox asked william hurt to play lead role but after finding out that hurt had no interest in acting on television henriksen got part when henriksen first got script he mistook it for a film because of its powerful story he was not fond of idea of participating in a television project henriksen contacted carter about character his first question was how are you going to make this hero a hero i mean it is so dark how are you going to handle this carter replied saying that frank was a hero because he was able to stand up against all of this henriksen was also worried about dark feel of show saying that all shows needs some glimpse of light at end of tunnel according to carter yellow house was light which henriksen later agreed upon studio executive ken horton was very pleased with megan
