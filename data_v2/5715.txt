thumb alt a bespectacled hiroki kikuta in a plaid shirt and a stocking cap hiroki kikuta pictured in 2011 was heavily involved in game s development acting as producer director writer and composer koudelka was created by hiroki kikuta who composed secret of mana seiken densetsu 3 and soukaigi at square kikuta wanted to direct his own game but square s corporate structure prevented him from moving beyond a composer searching for a way to expand his role kikuta was introduced to chairman of snk during their talk he outlined many perceived pitfalls in role playing genre leaving square he formed sacnoth in 1997 with other square employees and snk s funding as sacnoth s ceo and game s main creative lead kikuta wanted to create a horror rpg koudelka began development after sacnoth was founded and kikuta was its producer director writer and composer although koudelka used turn based combat on a grid and random encounters similar to traditional rpgs this was not kikuta s original intention he originally planned a real time battle system with free movement within environment combining mechanics from simulation and adventure games interactive environments such as furniture were also planned to play a part in combat kikuta wanted to break away from rpg conventions but other sacnoth staff were reluctant to follow his example and retained traditional ideas from square kikuta later regretted his lack of direct influence on game design about battle system design art director matsuzo machida credited as matsuzo itakura said that it was designed to be easy so adults who did not normally play games could see game s ending in hindsight team could have increased challenge game had english voice work for all characters with japan using native subtitles rather than a japanese dub to create an authentic atmosphere kikuta used advanced motion capture technology to give realistic physical mannerisms to character models during cutscenes kikuta s decision to use motion capture which he called epoch making was part of his attempt to move away from rpg conventions by adding drama story required capture of up to four people in each scene impossible with technology available in japan through original staff of soukaigi kikuta contacted santa monica based special effects company futurelight intrigued by kikuta s concept futurelight agreed to help record cutscenes in a later interview he said that techniques used for motion capture sessions were on a par with those used by hollywood studios at time game s cast provided motion capture and character voices they were chosen from 100 actors who auditioned for roles including twelve year old sara paxton as charlotte vivianna bateman who played koudelka was chosen to give her character a cool unique air kikuta called edward s actor michael bradberry mood maker for recording motion capture sessions took place in january 1998 at futurelight s local studios motion capture and animation processes were handled by futurelight and sacnoth staff with kikuta sessions executive producer rehearsals supervised by kikuta were held in a nearby hotel recording sessions were in a converted sound studio since studio was not fully soundproofed recording was sometimes halted due to exterior noises equipment around soundstage was used as props for actors so in game immersion would not be broken scenario and art design according to kikuta his research for narrative and basic elements of koudelka took three months one night timescale and singular location were due to game s limited staff and development time aberystwyth was chosen because he wanted a location across sea from ireland due to a lack of japanese resources on british architecture kikuta and several staff members made a research trip to pembrokeshire to see local scenery and church architecture region s coastal cliffs ancient ruins and weather conditions influenced koudelka setting and design kikuta s choice of 1898 was influenced by his wish for a story blending realism and fantasy end of 19th century symbolised to him intermingling of superstition and next century s technological advances kikuta wanted to explore uneasy coexistence of magic and science in game he bought over 100 books on british history during his research from medieval to victorian eras his inspirations for story included umberto eco s name of rose and its film adaptation william hope hodgson s carnacki ghost finder h p lovecraft s case of charles dexter ward and novels by lord dunsany koudelka setting and story were primarily inspired by carnacki ghost finder kikuta incorporated a number of historical events and figures including sinking of princess alice and fictionalized versions of lord dunsany and roger bacon charlotte s mother was based on sophia dorothea of celle story also included references to celtic irish and welsh mythology and folklore its characters were designed by yuji iwahara who created over 100 character sketches for game visuals were inspired by work of bob carlos clarke jan and holly warburton koudelka was among first elements of game created by kikuta with iwahara s first character drafts created in march 1998 koudelka s given name was taken from photographer josef koudelka kikuta liked its mysterious sound and lack of any specific ethnic origin kikuta s wish for a lonely character resulted in koudelka s background as an exiled gypsy her design required several redrafts to be carried over into game which had severe polygon and memory restrictions machida s design of nemeton was intended to compress variety of a typical rpg world map into a limited exploration space and permit detailed backgrounds within console s hardware limitations nemeton used a blend of architectural styles with elements ranging from its origins as a gothic monastery inspired by st davids to contemporary additions koudelka s cgi model was created by sacnoth and a company founded by artist watanabe whom kikuta chose for his passion for good work model went through multiple redrafts with kikuta making adjustments in creating koudelka storyline kikuta conceived a potential four part series following her family through 20th century with events and themes from original clash of science and magic in first sequel koudelka would attend 1900 exposition universelle second would move to chicago in 1973 during late vietnam war and follow koudelka s grandson rodmell through an urban fantasy scenario in third rodmell would travel to kyoto in 1984 where magic and modern life were still closely connected music kikuta found composing score easiest part of development since he primarily worked on his own his concept for koudelka musical elements were created with setting and narrative score was arranged by kikuta and nick ingman to compose most of game s tracks kikuta used atari notator sound software while he found lack of compression an issue better sequencing software was useful in creating score for cgi cutscenes with less music than average rpg score was completed within six months instead of looping tracks of kikuta s work with square koudelka used ambient sounds and short tracks related to cutscenes outside battle themes and featured influences from church music its opening theme requiem was performed by catherine bott ending theme ubi caritas et amor taken from a larger composition by maurice durufle was performed by london oratory school a cd soundtrack album was released in december 1999 by pony canyon and scitron digital contents with over an hour of music and 34 tracks album which included all tracks from game and live versions of three battle themes arranged by naoya akimoto received generally positive reviews from music critics its music was praised and criticized by reviewers of game
