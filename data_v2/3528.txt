evacuation program operation angel received minimal press coverage in uk and financial times suggested that such human interest stories captured popular imagination only during british press s summer silly season when parliament was in recess susan douglas in october 1993 edition of american magazine progressive said british papers had indulged in a ghoulish competition to scoop each other over irma s condition and to use her evacuation to salve british guilt about standing apart from carnage in bosnia british government was widely depicted as having launched operation irma in direct response to level of press interest rescuers themselves joked that operation irma was an acronym for instant response to media attention a council of europe publication later noted that european governments had been criticized for regarding exercise as having more to do with a political and media operation than with humanitarian relief mission also received some criticism in domestic press mark lawson in independent called prime minister major s efforts with mission a failure to silence hostile snipers based on a misunderstanding of popular indecision about bosnia and on a failure to manage domestic press skepticism meanwhile within former yugoslavia operation irma was regarded as evidence that british government had taken sides in conflict favouring bosnian muslims over croats or serbs evacuation or local treatment some un aid workers immediately criticized operation arguing that very sick children were poorly served by programmes that obliged them to travel hundreds of miles they argued too that with costs of around ps100 000 per evacuated child programme was devouring funds that could have been used to improve local facilities and treatment head of kosevo hospital s plastic surgery department said it would be much better if you sent tools to do our jobs properly than for you to make a big show of a few token evacuations countering this a d redmond of overseas development administration predecessor to department for international development wrote in november 1993 to british medical journal overseas development administration has been foremost in supplying medical and humanitarian aid to people of bosnia throughout conflict in some circumstances medical teams are needed requested and supplied but in others medical supplies alone are most appropriate form of aid i have also however received personal pleas from doctors whom i know well to evacuate patients who cannot be treated in sarajevo no solution will suffice we are all trying to help aftermath thumb bosnian refugees photographed in 1993 press coverage surrounding evacuation was later cited as an example of disaster pornography in academic analyses concerned with portrayal of child victims of violence and disaster in ways that reaffirm those victims remoteness from and subjectivity to western here northwestern european agency in a similar vein dominic has presented press interest in operation irma as evidence of a popular appetite for news stories that resemble structure and tone of fictional narratives on war war films work most effectively by stripping back too easily confusing contextual details of a conflict and focusing instead on existential problem of protagonist s experience problem of being human in dehumanising circumstances news reporting in this case from balkans then has to compete even at level of basic comprehension with this already established way of understanding things it may not be surprising therefore that one of most memorable news stories to come out of bosnia was that of irma a rescued child operation has also been portrayed as representative of a trend whereby public reaction to media coverage of disasters leads and shapes official state response even precipitating creation of policy where none has existed before erica burman developing this theme has argued that irma hadzimuratovic became an emotional focus for a british public dismayed by its government s ambiguous and cautious attitude to conflict in bosnia widespread anxieties and consternation over government inactivity throughout crisis could be deflected and resolved by rescuing a handful of children in terms of recovering a sense of agency in a conflict characterised by protestations of powerlessness by political and military authorities alike desire to do and be seen to do something was expressed and assuaged by transporting and incorporating some of need and distress into uk where it could be tended to and made better a textbook on public
