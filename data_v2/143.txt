grieving squidward expresses his disappointment in all of them and goes home in distress over his failure however spongebob convinces other band members to go through with performance for squidward s

shock and faints leaving squidward to celebrate as he leaps into air production band geeks was directed by aaron springer and was written by springer c h greenblatt and merriwether williams frank weiss served as animation director and greenblatt worked as storyboard artist episode originally aired on nickelodeon in united states on september 7 2001 with a tv y7 parental rating writers started to work for band geeks with idea of a rival williams said we always wanted to do a rival show and i think we tried to do a rival show for spongebob and it wasn t working so we came up with idea of a rival for squidward and in some ways it s squidward s story and spongebob and patrick are just kind of around idea of having a band was unspecified williams remarked i forget who was in band i was not in a band but i think maybe doug lawrence was in a band i think steve hillenburg was in a band too when storyboard artist greenblatt with writers was storyboarding band geeks they thought of a big number at end where everyone would rally together for squidward greenblatt said story outline called for making it a really great marching band sequence and it usually helps to have music ahead of time to board to so we started searching around writers were able to find music as nickelodeon has a library of royalty free music writers listened to various marching band tunes greenblatt said and more we heard it didn t seem terribly funny that finale was just them playing marching band music well however david glen eisley s song sweet victory stood out from other tracks in library greenblatt said it was different than what we were looking for but it was so amazing that we knew we had to use it so we boarded sequence to music and it felt like such a better ending than any song we could have written on our own writers gave it a freeze frame shot for ending greenblatt s favorite part was director springer s drawings of patrick on electric drums and spongebob saying it s thrill of one more kill an excerpt from sweet victory live action bubble bowl crowd is footage from a united states football league game featuring memphis and birmingham stallions on june 16 1984 thumb left 145px david glen eisley s song sweet victory was featured in episode music used in segment of episode where squidward s marching band is playing while coming down street was from nick carr series music editor he found a piece of marching band music that was a band intentionally playing poorly but sound designer jeff hutchins said you could still discern tune hutchins thought well let s take this one step further what if they couldn t even play their instruments let alone a tune he brought his portable dat recorder to a musical instrument retail store and met two men who worked on its loading dock packaging and shipping instruments hutchins made two men play most of instruments terribly he said i got these two guys to squeak blast and squawk on most of instruments they sold upon returning to studio with sound effects he built a marching band one instrument at a time hutchins said they weren t in any key and had no rhythm whatsoever when you heard it you just had to say ouch hutchins played sound effects for series creator hillenburg for review hillenburg rejected it saying it was too far over edge hutchins said a lot of effort for something that lasts only 15 seconds on screen in this case whole thing never made it on air featured song sweet victory was later released in series soundtrack album called spongebob squarepants yellow album on november 15 2005 album featured 25
