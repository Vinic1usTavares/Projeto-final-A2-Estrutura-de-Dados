thumb upright 1 25 title page of 1751 original publication experiments and observations on electricity is a mid eighteenth century book consisting of letters from benjamin franklin these letters concerned franklin s discoveries about behavior of electricity based on experimentation and scientific studies book came in pamphlet form for first three english editions last two editions were in a book volume with hard covers and a book spine there were eleven european editions of book five english editions three french editions and a german italian and latin edition publication was well received worldwide it was considered america s most important scientific book of eighteenth century book came about through activities of scientists at royal society of london franklin sent letters to members of society about his experiments on electricity and observations he had made most of these letters went to peter collinson some of these were read at society s meetings there was much interest shown so some of them were sent to a printer to be published in a magazine public interest in franklin s letters about electricity led society to gather together many of letters to collinson from franklin over a two year period and send them to printer for publication this first collection of letters was published in a ninety page pamphlet in 1751 it was soon followed by other parts that were supplemental to existing edition and eventually a new publication was sold from total of all parts produced each edition expanded by additional franklin letters being added it ultimately became a 496 page volume by 1769 book inspired others to follow in franklin s footsteps to do further in depth research on electricity background thumb upright 0 9 franklin s electrostatic machine display at franklin institute museum franklin was first attracted to study of electricity when he saw showman archibald spencer do magic demonstrations in boston 1743 and in philadelphia 1744 he purchased spencer s equipment and used it for his electricity experiments after these demonstrations were completed he referred to spencer as dr spence from scotland in 1746 at age of forty years franklin began turning over affairs of his printing company to his business partner david hall and went into semi retirement so he could carry out research on electricity initially using spencer s equipment peter collinson a wealthy quaker cloth merchant a fellow of royal society and one of founders of society of antiquaries of london donated in 1746 a leyden jar battery a glass tube and an account of new german experiments in electricity to library company of philadelphia founded by franklin account described how to make electricity from glass tube franklin first experimented with static electricity in middle of 1747 referring to it as these new wonders in conducting his initial electrical research franklin made use of unique battery and glass tube provided by collinson thomas penn son of william penn made an electrostatic machine that supplemented collinson s equipment to these franklin added an electrostatic generating machine of his own design that was more efficient than one given to him by penn it was convenient because it was constructed with a handle like that of a common grindstone and turned by operator simple mechanical machine mechanism then spun an axle that had mounted on it a glass sphere that rubbed on a cloth pad glass sphere bulb generated electric fire an electric charge that was transferred through conductors to a leyden jar capacitor that held electric charge that was then used for experimentation franklin formed a research core team that consisted of ebenezer kinnersley thomas hopkinson and philip syng and developed first scientific research laboratory in america he repeated his experiments to obtain same results and recorded this observation in this process he showed that anyone could repeat and prove these results themselves of electrical principle if they did experiment he detailed franklin spent much time studying this new field of electricity and from 1747 through 1750 sent many letters to collinson on his findings book consists of a collection of these letters book came in pamphlet form for first three editions last two editions were a book volume with hard covers franklin s letters explained his experiments and observations he made from them he sent these to collinson to show that equipment put into hands of group of men associated with library company of philadelphia was being put to good use william watson a scientist specializing in study of electricity theorized that perhaps electricity was attracted to conductors that were pointed watson received in 1746 from dr john mitchell a lengthy franklin letter on theories about thunderstorms and pointed conductors as related to electricity he read part of letter to fellow members of royal society of london on november 9 1749 a week later he finished reading on december 4 watson received another similar franklin letter dated april 29 1749 from collinson and read it to society on december 21 1749 over next two years collinson had transmitted to society more of franklin s letters he had received describing electrical experiments done by franklin and his team of experimenters many talked about tendency of an electrical discharge to be attracted to a pointed conductor that was grounded basics to his lightning rod invention to protect wooden buildings such as houses and churches watson turned over some of these franklin letters to local publisher edward cave who had them printed in gentleman s magazine in 1750 in april 1751 cave printed in a publication more of letters collinson had received and they included corrections personally added by franklin this publication was titled experiments and observations on electricity made in philadelphia in america by mr benjamin franklin and communicated in several letters to mr p collinson of london f r s london it was a 90 page pamphlet of 86 numbered pages pamphlet included an unsigned preface written by dr john fothergill this first publication of experiments and observations on electricity sold for expensive price of two shillings and sixpence british money contents thumb right upright 1 12 typical letter in book july 27 1750 letter v in first three english editions is letter vi in fourth and fifth english editions eighteenth century book consists of a collection of letters and essays written by franklin most of 25 letters in collection were to collinson some had personal content but most were about his experiments with electricity and what he had observed from them these talked about conclusions he came to after doing scientific experimentation on leyden jars and lightning storm clouds he many times related similarities of how each of these acted and that principles they followed were identical this connection ultimately led franklin to lightning rod and that electricity could be diverted harmlessly away from houses and wooden buildings making it a protection device there were five english editions to this book first three editions were not hard cover volumes but rather just pamphlets with paper covers of collected letters of franklin they were carelessly put together when published each of these pamphlet editions had supplements of additional letters that were added later and then republished first publication of 1751 was supplemented in 1753 with 20 more pages and called supplemental experiments and observations part ii it was numbered 89 to 109 and published by e cave this was again supplemented with an additional 44 pages in 1754 numbered 110 to 154 and titled new experiments and observations part iii it was published by r cave son of e cave second edition published in 1754 was a reprint of parts i and ii of first edition third edition published in 1760 1762 and 1764 was a reprint of all three parts of first edition and numbered 1 154 in this first set of letters franklin talked about electrical fire later 1749 changing terminology to electrical fluid he wrote to collinson on june 5 1747 that his experiments showed that electrical fire was a new element of matter existing as particles in all ordinary matter franklin determined that a friction rubbing process like that of rubbing glass with a cloth does not create these particles but only groups them together so that they can be collected and held in a leyden jar of water and metal according to franklin one side of leyden jar had an accumulation of electrical fire which he labeled as positive plus and other side had a deficiency of electrical fire labeled negative minus these losses and gains of electrification were exactly equal and are essentially modern law of charge conservation except that it is now recognized that negative charges exist in their own right not just as a deficiency of positive charges it is an important principle in modern science that explains microphysics of electrification of gross bodies in these letters franklin introduced technical words that we use today for things related to electricity such as plus minus positive negative charge discharge armature electric shock electrician condenser conductor and battery thumb upright 0 8 right leyden jar electric battery franklin s first experiments explained in this first set of letters to collinson that leyden jar a type of capacitor had equal and opposite charges on inner and outer conductors this was shown in illustrations in his book significant franklin theory introduced to collinson in a letter dated april 29 1747 was concept of condenser today we call this distribution of charges in a device a capacitor he observed that a charge was built up on both sides between a piece of nonconducting material in case of leyden jar this was glass nonconducting matter and on each side of it was a metal material conducting matter these opposite metal layers had exact opposite electric charges positive and negative he observed that when wire on inside of jar was electrised positively by a certain amount that outer conductor simultaneously became electrised negatively in same proportion franklin explained in these letters that in an experiment he did show that charge was in glass itself and not in water within jar as had been theorized by others after a leyden jar was charged he poured water from it into another leyden jar that was not charged it turned out electric force was not condensed in water itself as new leyden jar had no charge with this water from first leyden jar then first jar was refilled with fresh water and it was discovered that there was a charge in this jar conclusion then was that it was glass itself that was condenser of electric force it was further determined by more experimentation that it did not matter what shape glass was in or if an object was shaped like a glass bottle it was finally determined that a property of glass itself was this force of equal and opposite charges franklin further explains in these letters that jar did not electrically balance itself but a wire of some conducting material had to make contact from inner conductor plus to outer conductor minus this way franklin observed balancing and combining of two different states of electricity in miraculous bottle in later editions of book franklin explained in his letters and showed in illustrations an assembly of leyden jars that he termed electrical battery following military term of time of a battery being a group of cannons assembled together franklin assembled a number of parallel plate condensers consisting of 11 plates of glass and each were armed with a lead metal sheet on each side he hooked them together with wires in a series and then a master wire was attached that could then discharge balance battery when touched to both sides thumb right upright 1 21 fourth edition volume increased to 496 pages had hard covers and additions to third edition franklin s glasses shown on book fourth edition published in 1769 is first complete edition in one volume and had hard covers he added footnotes to make certain issues clearer in this edition he also added several of his own philosophical essays and completed volume with an index fourth edition was a book volume with hard covers that increased number of pages from 154 to 496 franklin added papers on his lightning rod invention meteorological observations human nature worldwide population increase waterspouts experiments on amber and information on his pennsylvania fireplace invention this edition had copper plate illustrations of his lightning rod design new fireplace and electrical experiments fifth english edition was published in 1774 there was little difference between fourth edition and fifth edition only new document added in fifth edition that was not in fourth edition was french experiment with lightning done in 1752 there was an advertisement in public advertiser london newspaper of september 9 1774 that promoted fifth edition fourth english edition published in 1769 was personally supervised by franklin while visiting london from philadelphia he made several corrections on different parts of first three editions and wrote explanatory notes one important correction franklin noted in forward was that letters 1 and 2 had been transposed and he had corrected that he added a letter that was important to him it was a letter to collinson dated march 28 1747 franklin had thanked him for gift of german electric tube with directions on how to use it to make electricity he was much appreciative of this so he made that particular one letter 1 this then advanced numbering sequence of letters by one from first three editions editions thumb right upright 1 60 second edition 1754 of new experiments of part i and part ii there were eleven editions of experiments and observations on electricity there were five english editions three french editions and an edition each in german italian and latin first three english editions were similar but not identical and consisted of two or three parts each of these separate parts were printed and sold individually as a pamphlet each had a slight title change i e new supplemental apparently to promote selling additional copies to people that had bought before

suggesting that a long pointed iron rod would attract a lightning bolt from a thunderstorm cloud in 1750 hopkinson suggested to franklin concept that electricity is attracted to points franklin then carried idea a step forward and surmised that a pointed iron rod high above a rooftop would attract a lightning bolt if bolt was of electricity frenchman thomas francois d did actual experiment may 10 1752 as franklin had suggested and lightning struck iron rod in london it was repeated in spital square on july 20 1752 and again in chelmsford essex on august 12 1752 electricity attraction from a lightning storm was also done by franklin himself in kite experiment that he talked about in a letter to collinson dated october 19 1752 a man by name of g w richman was killed in 1753 from electrocution doing kite experiment franklin had proven that lightning bolts and electricity were one and same he also showed that this electric fluid was attracted to a sharply pointed object high in sky an iron rod could have other end put into ground to create a path for safe conduction of high voltage electricity thus a way of diverting lightning bolts from wooden buildings and preventing them from going aflame due to lightning hits had been discovered franklin s lightning conductor invention with its lightning rod uppermost point became a model for lightning protection system used in america in eighteenth century king louis xv honored franklin after seeing some of electrical experiments done in royal palace at st germain near paris france however physicist jean antoine 1700 1770 a skeptic who had published his own theory on electricity declared franklin s ideas were wrong he claimed in 1753 that franklin s lightning rod was not only dangerous but useless and would attract lightning bolts to wooden buildings causing them to be hit more often franklin in time proved to scientific community that his lightning rod invention not only was a protective device but it also served as a preventive way to divert destructive lightning bolts away from hitting buildings legacy all editions of book were being printed in europe until 1941 when first publication of it was done in united states by i bernard cohen book is franklin s only scientific work and is recognized by historians gary f kurutz and dennis smith as america s most important scientific book of eighteenth century publication for his scientific observations on electricity made franklin famous throughout europe as a serious scientist eighteenth century british polymath joseph priestley writes in his book history and present state of electricity 1767 that nobody had written an in depth study of electricity with use of scientific experimentation like this of franklin s that had been translated into most european languages in eighteenth century benjamin franklin was given copley medal by royal society in 1753 in recognition of his work in electricity as reported in this book he became a fellow of society after his name was submitted required ten times one included society s president lord macclesfield also he was given an honorary degree at college of william and mary in 1756 and elected into french academy of science in 1772 because of this book theories that franklin developed in book formed basis for subsequent research on electricity see also american philosophical society references
