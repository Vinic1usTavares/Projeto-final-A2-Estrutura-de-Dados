become toxic with renewed calls to tone down political rhetoric after shooting keith olbermann said violence or threat of violence has no place in our democracy and i apologize for and repudiate any act or any thing in my past that may have even inadvertently encouraged violence jon stewart stated that he did not know whether or not political environment contributed to shooting but for all hyperbole and vitriol that s become a part of our political process when reality of that rhetoric when actions match disturbing nature of words we haven t lost our capacity to be horrified maybe it
