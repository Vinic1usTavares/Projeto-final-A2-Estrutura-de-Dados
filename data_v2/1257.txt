baryonyx is a genus of theropod dinosaur which lived in barremian stage of early cretaceous period about 130 125 million years ago first skeleton was discovered in 1983 in weald clay formation of surrey england and became holotype specimen of b walkeri named by palaeontologists alan j charig and angela c milner in 1986 generic name baryonyx means heavy claw and alludes to animal s very large claw on first finger specific name walkeri refers to its discoverer amateur fossil collector william j walker holotype specimen is one of most complete theropod skeletons from uk and remains most complete spinosaurid and its discovery attracted media attention specimens later discovered in other parts of united kingdom and iberia have also been assigned to genus holotype specimen which may not have been fully grown was estimated to have been between long and to have weighed between baryonyx had a long low and narrow snout which has been compared to that of a gharial tip of snout expanded to sides in shape of a rosette behind this upper jaw had a notch which fitted into lower jaw which curved upwards in same area it had a triangular crest on top of its nasal bones baryonyx had a large number of finely serrated conical teeth with largest teeth in front neck formed an s shape and neural spines of its dorsal vertebrae increased in height from front to back one elongated neural spine indicates it may have had a hump or ridge along centre of its back it had robust forelimbs with eponymous first finger claw measuring about long now recognised as a member of family spinosauridae baryonyx affinities were obscure when it was discovered some researchers have suggested that suchosaurus cultridens is a senior synonym being an older name and that suchomimus tenerensis belongs in same genus subsequent authors have kept them separate baryonyx was first theropod dinosaur demonstrated to have been piscivorous fish eating as evidenced by fish scales in stomach region of holotype specimen it may also have been an active predator of larger prey and a scavenger since it also contained bones of a juvenile iguanodon creature would have caught and processed its prey primarily with its forelimbs and large claws baryonyx may have had semiaquatic habits and coexisted with other theropod ornithopod and sauropod dinosaurs as well as pterosaurs crocodiles turtles and fishes in a fluvial environment history of discovery thumb upright left alt replica of a large thick claw cast of hand claw that name baryonyx was based on in palais de la decouverte paris in january 1983 british plumber and amateur fossil collector william j walker explored smokejacks pit a clay pit in weald clay formation near ockley in surrey england he found a rock wherein he discovered a large claw but after piecing it together at home he realised tip of claw was missing walker returned to same spot in pit some weeks later and found missing part after searching for an hour he also found a phalanx bone and part of a rib walker s son in law later brought claw to natural history museum of london where it was examined by british palaeontologists alan j charig and angela c milner who identified it as belonging to a theropod dinosaur palaeontologists found more bone fragments at site in february but entire skeleton could not be collected until may and june due to weather conditions at pit a team of eight museum staff members and several volunteers excavated of matrix in 54 blocks over a three week period walker donated claw to museum and ockley brick company owners of pit donated rest of skeleton and provided equipment area had been explored for 200 years but no similar remains had been found before most of bones collected were encased in siltstone nodules surrounded by fine sand and silt with rest lying in clay bones were and scattered over a 5 x 2 m 17 x 8 ft area but most were not far from their natural positions position of some bones was disturbed by a bulldozer and some were broken by mechanical equipment before they were collected preparing specimen was difficult due to hardness of siltstone matrix and presence of siderite acid preparation was attempted but most of matrix was removed mechanically it took six years of almost constant preparation to get all bones out of rock and by end dental tools and air mallets had to be used under a microscope specimen

fossilised skull snout of holotype specimen from left and below in 1986 charig and milner named a new genus and species with skeleton as holotype specimen baryonyx walkeri generic name derives from ancient greek barys means heavy or strong and onyx means claw or talon specific name honours walker for discovering specimen at that time authors did not know if large claw belonged to hand or foot as in dromaeosaurs which it was then assumed to be dinosaur had been presented earlier same year during a lecture at a conference about dinosaur systematics in drumheller due to ongoing work on bones 70 percent had been prepared at time they called their article preliminary and promised a more detailed description at a later date baryonyx was first large early cretaceous theropod found anywhere in world by that time before discovery of baryonyx last significant theropod find in united kingdom was in 1871 and in a 1986 interview charig called baryonyx best find of century in europe baryonyx was widely featured in international media and was nicknamed claws by journalists punning on title of film jaws its discovery was subject of a 1987 bbc documentary and a cast of skeleton is mounted at natural history museum in london in 1997 charig and milner published a monograph describing holotype skeleton in detail holotype specimen remains most completely known spinosaurid skeleton fossils from other parts of uk and iberia mostly isolated teeth have subsequently been attributed to baryonyx or similar animals isolated teeth and bones from isle of wight including hand bones reported in 1998 and a vertebra reported by british palaeontologists steve hutt and penny newbery in 2004 have been attributed to this genus in 2017 british palaeontologist martin c munt and colleagues reported cranial remains of two baryonyx individuals from isle of wight and stated they would be examined and described in future a maxilla fragment from la rioja spain was attributed to baryonyx by spanish palaeontologists luis i viera and jose angel torres in 1995 although american palaeontologist thomas r holtz and colleagues raised possibility that it could have belonged to suchomimus in 2004 in 1999 a postorbital bone a squamosal bone a tooth vertebral remains metacarpals and a phalanx from sala de los infantes deposit in burgos province spain were attributed to an immature baryonyx though some of these elements are unknown in holotype by spanish palaeontologist carolina fuentes and colleagues dinosaur tracks near burgos have also been suggested to belong to baryonyx or a similar theropod in 2011 a specimen ml1190 from papo seco formation in boca do chapim portugal with a fragmentary dentary teeth vertebrae ribs hip bones a scapula and a phalanx bone was attributed to baryonyx by portuguese palaeontologist octavio mateus and colleagues most complete iberian remains of animal skeletal elements of this specimen are also represented in more complete holotype which was of similar size except for mid neck vertebrae in 2018 british palaeontologist thomas m s arden and colleagues found that portuguese skeleton did not belong to baryonyx since front of its dentary bone was not strongly upturned some additional spinosaurid remains from iberia may belong to taxa other than baryonyx including from which appears to be closer to spinosaurus and possible synonyms thumb upright alt two drawings side and back view of a large dinosaur tooth 1878 lithograph showing holotype tooth of suchosaurus cultridens which may represent same animal as b walkeri in 2003 milner noted that some teeth at natural history museum previously identified as belonging to genera suchosaurus and megalosaurus probably belonged to baryonyx type species of suchosaurus s cultridens was named by british biologist richard owen in 1841 based on teeth discovered by british geologist gideon a mantell in tilgate forest sussex owen originally thought teeth to have belonged to a crocodile he was yet to name group dinosauria which happened following year a second species s girardi was named by french palaeontologist henri emile sauvage in 1897 based on jaw fragments and a tooth from boca do chapim portugal in 2007 french palaeontologist eric buffetaut considered teeth of s girardi very similar to those of baryonyx and s cultridens except for stronger development of tooth crown flutes or ribs lengthwise ridges suggesting that remains belonged to same genus buffetaut agreed with milner that teeth of s cultridens were almost identical to those of b walkeri but with a surface former taxon might be a senior synonym of latter since it was published first depending on whether differences were within a taxon or between different ones according to buffetaut since holotype specimen of s cultridens is a single tooth and that of b walkeri is a skeleton it would be more practical to retain newer name in 2011 mateus and colleagues agreed that suchosaurus was closely related to baryonyx but considered both species in former genus nomina dubia dubious names since their holotype specimens were not considered diagnostic lacking distinguishing features and could not be definitely equated with other taxa in any case identification of suchosaurus as a spinosaurid makes it first named member of family in 1997 charig and milner noted that two fragmentary spinosaurid snouts from elrhaz formation of niger reported by french palaeontologist philippe taquet in 1984 were similar enough to baryonyx that they considered them to belong to an indeterminate species of genus despite their much younger aptian geological age in 1998 these fossils became basis of genus and species cristatusaurus named by taquet and american palaeontologist dale russell american palaeontologist paul sereno and colleagues named new genus and species suchomimus tenerensis later in 1998 based on more complete fossils from elrhaz formation in 2002 german palaeontologist hans dieter sues and colleagues proposed that suchomimus tenerensis was similar enough to baryonyx walkeri to be considered a species within same genus as b tenerensis and that suchomimus was identical to cristatusaurus milner concurred that material from niger was indistinguishable from baryonyx in 2003 in a 2004 conference abstract hutt and newberry supported synonymy based on a large theropod vertebra from isle of wight which they attributed to an animal closely related to baryonyx and suchomimus later studies have kept baryonyx and suchomimus separate whereas cristatusaurus has been proposed to be either a nomen dubium or possibly distinct from both a 2017 review paper by brazilian palaeontologist carlos roberto a candeiro and colleagues stated that this debate was more in realm of semantics than science as it is generally agreed that b walkeri and s tenerensis are distinct related species description thumb size of spinosaurids baryonyx in orange compared with a human baryonyx is estimated to have been between long in hip height and to have weighed between fact that elements of skull and vertebral column of b walkeri holotype specimen nhm r9951 do not appear to have co ossified fused suggests that individual was not fully grown and mature animal may have been much larger as is case for some other spinosaurids on other hand specimen s fused sternum indicates that it may have been mature skull thumb left alt colour drawing of a long tailed dinosaur walking on its hind legs life restoration skull of baryonyx is incompletely known and much of middle and hind portions are not preserved full length of skull is estimated to have been long based on comparison with that of related genus suchomimus which was 20 larger it was elongated and front 170 mm 6 6 in of premaxillae formed a long narrow and low snout rostrum with a smoothly rounded upper surface bony nostrils were long low and placed far back from snout tip front 130 mm 5 1 in of snout expanded into a spatulate spoon like terminal rosette a shape similar to rostrum of modern gharial front 70 mm 2 7 in of lower margin of premaxillae was downturned or hooked whereas that of front portion of maxillae was upturned this morphology resulted in a sigmoid or s shaped margin of lower upper tooth row in which teeth from front of maxilla were projecting forward snout was particularly narrow directly behind rosette this area received large teeth of mandible maxilla and premaxilla of baryonyx fit together in a complex articulation and resulting gap between upper and lower jaw is known as a downturned premaxilla and a sigmoid lower margin of upper tooth row was also present in distantly related theropods such as dilophosaurus snout had extensive pits which would have been exits for blood vessels and nerves and maxilla appears to have housed sinuses thumb alt skeletal dinosaur head with jaws open reconstruction of holotype skull hague baryonyx had a rudimentary secondary palate similar to crocodiles but unlike most theropod dinosaurs a rugose roughly wrinkled surface suggests presence of a horny pad in roof of mouth nasal bones were fused which distinguished baryonyx from other spinosaurids and a sagittal crest was present above eyes on upper mid line of nasals this crest was triangular narrow and sharp in its front part and was distinct from those of other spinosaurids in ending hind wards in a cross shaped process lacrimal bone in front of eye appears to have formed a horn core similar to those seen for example in allosaurus and was distinct from other spinosaurids in being solid and almost triangular was narrow with paroccipital processes pointing outwards horizontally and were lengthened descending far below basioccipital lowermost bone of occiput sereno and colleagues suggested that some of baryonyx cranial bones had been misidentified by charig and milner resulting in occiput being reconstructed as too deep and that skull was instead probably as low long and narrow as that of suchomimus front 140 mm 5 5 in of dentary in mandible sloped upwards towards curve of snout dentary was very long and shallow with a prominent meckelian groove on inner side mandibular symphysis where two halves of lower jaw connected at front was particularly short rest of lower jaw was fragile hind third was much thinner than front with a blade like appearance front part of dentary curved outwards to accommodate large front teeth and this area formed mandibular part of rosette dentary had many openings which were passages for nerves and blood vessels most of teeth found with holotype specimen were not in articulation with skull a few remained in upper jaw and only small replacement teeth were still borne by lower jaw teeth had shape of recurved cones where slightly flattened from sideways and their curvature was almost uniform roots were very long and tapered towards their extremity carinae sharp front and back edges of teeth were finely serrated with denticles on front and back and extended all along crown there were around six to eight denticles per millimetre 0 039 in a much larger number than in large bodied theropods like torvosaurus and tyrannosaurus some of teeth were fluted with six to eight ridges along length of their inner sides and fine grained enamel while others bore no flutes their presence is probably related to position or ontogeny developing during growth inner side of each tooth row had a bony wall number of teeth was large compared to most other theropods with six to seven teeth in each premaxilla and thirty two in each dentary based on closer packing and smaller size of dentary teeth compared to those in corresponding length of premaxilla difference between number of teeth in upper and lower jaws appears to have been more pronounced than in other theropods terminal rosette in upper jaw of holotype had thirteen dental alveoli tooth sockets six on left and seven on right side showing tooth count asymmetry first four upper teeth were large with second and third largest while fourth and fifth progressively decreased in size diameter of largest was twice that of smallest first four alveoli of dentary corresponding to tip of upper jaw were largest with rest more regular in size small subtriangular interdental plates were present between alveoli postcranial skeleton thumb alt photos of three irregularly shaped bones three cervical vertebrae from neck of holotype in left side view third also shown from front above initially thought to have lacked sigmoid curve typical of theropods neck of baryonyx does appear to have formed an s shape though straighter than in other theropods cervical vertebrae of neck tapered towards head and became progressively longer front to back their zygapophyses processes that connected vertebrae were flat and their epipophyses processes to which neck muscles attached were well developed axis vertebra second neck vertebra was small relative to size of skull and had a well developed hyposphene neural arches of cervical vertebrae was not always sutured to centra bodies of vertebrae and neural spines there were low and thin cervical ribs were short similar to those of crocodiles and possibly overlapped each other somewhat centra of dorsal vertebrae of back were similar in size like in other theropods skeleton of baryonyx showed skeletal pneumaticity reducing its weight through fenestrae openings in neural arches and hollow depressions in centra primarily near transverse processes from front to back neural spines of dorsal vertebrae changed from short and stout to tall and broad one isolated dorsal neural spine was moderately elongated and slender indicating that baryonyx may have had a hump or ridge along centre of its back though incipiently developed compared to those of other spinosaurids baryonyx was unique among spinosaurids in having a marked constriction from side to side in a vertebra that either belonged to sacrum or front of tail coracoid tapered hind wards when viewed in profile and uniquely among spinosaurids connected with scapula in a peg and notch articulation scapulae were robust and bones of forelimb were short in relation to animal s size but broad and sturdy humerus was short and stout with its ends broadly expanded and flattened upper side for and muscle attachment and lower for articulation with radius and ulna radius was short stout and straight and less than half length of humerus while ulna was a little longer ulna had a powerful and an expanded lower end hands had three fingers first finger bore a large claw measuring about along its curve in holotype specimen claw would have been lengthened by a keratin horny sheath in life apart from its size claw s proportions were fairly typical of a theropod i e it was bilaterally symmetric slightly compressed smoothly rounded and sharply pointed a groove for sheath ran along length of claw other claws of hand were much smaller ilium main hip bone of pelvis had a prominent an anterior process that was slender and vertically expanded and a posterior process that was long and straight ilium also had a prominent and a deep grove that faced downwards socket for femur was long from front to back ischium lower and rearmost hip bone had a well developed at upper part margin of pubic blade at lower end was turned outward and pubic foot was not expanded femur lacked a groove on fibular condyle and uniquely among spinosaurids fibula had a very shallow fibular fossa depression classification thumb left snouts of cristatusaurus a c suchomimus d i and baryonyx j l in their original description charig and milner found baryonyx unique enough to warrant a new family of theropod dinosaurs baryonychidae they found baryonyx to be unlike any other theropod group and considered possibility that it was a a grouping of early archosaurs now considered unnatural due to having apparently primitive features but noted that articulation of maxilla and premaxilla was similar to that in dilophosaurus they also noted that two snouts from niger which later became basis of cristatusaurus assigned to family spinosauridae by taquet in 1984 appeared almost identical to that of baryonyx and they referred them to baryonychidae instead in 1988 american palaeontologist gregory s paul agreed with taquet that spinosaurus described in 1915 based on fragmentary remains from egypt that were destroyed in world war ii and baryonyx were similar and due to their snouts possibly late surviving buffetaut also supported this relationship in 1989 in 1990 charig and milner dismissed spinosaurid affinities of baryonyx since they did not find their remains similar enough in 1997 they agreed that baryonychidae and spinosauridae were related but disagreed that former name should become a synonym of latter because completeness of baryonyx compared to spinosaurus made it a better type genus for a family and because they did not find similarities between two significant enough holtz and colleagues listed baryonychidae as a synonym of spinosauridae in 2004 discoveries in 1990s shed more light on relationships of baryonyx and its relatives in 1996 a snout from morocco was referred to spinosaurus and irritator and from brazil two are possible synonyms were named cristatusaurus and suchomimus were named based on fossils from niger in 1998 in their description of suchomimus sereno and colleagues placed it and baryonyx in new subfamily baryonychinae within spinosauridae spinosaurus and irritator were placed in subfamily spinosaurinae baryonychinae was distinguished by small size and larger number of teeth in dentary behind terminal rosette deeply keeled front dorsal vertebrae and by having serrated teeth spinosaurinae was distinguished by their straight tooth crowns without serrations small first tooth in premaxilla increased spacing of teeth in jaws and possibly by having their nostrils placed further back and presence of a deep neural spine sail they also united spinosaurids and their closest relatives in superfamily spinosauroidea but in 2010 british palaeontologist roger benson considered this a junior synonym of megalosauroidea an older name in a 2007 conference abstract american palaeontologist denver w fowler suggested that since suchosaurus is first named genus in its group clade names spinosauroidea spinosauridae and baryonychinae should be replaced by and regardless of whether or not name baryonyx is retained a 2017 study by brazilian palaeontologists marcos a f sales and cesar l schultz found that clade baryonychinae was not well supported since serrated teeth may be an ancestral trait among spinosaurids thumb alt bones which were found against a background of animal s body drawn to scale skeletal diagram of holotype specimen below compared with closely related genus suchomimus following cladogram shows position of baryonyx within spinosauridae after ronan allain and colleagues 2012 evolution thumb alt map of europe and north africa distribution of spinosaurids in europe and north africa during cretaceous 1 is baryonyx spinosaurids appear to have been widespread from barremian to cenomanian stages of cretaceous about 130 to 95 million years ago while oldest known spinosaurid remains date to middle jurassic they shared features such as long narrow crocodile like skulls sub circular teeth with fine to no serrations terminal rosette of snout and a secondary palate that made them more resistant to torsion in contrast primitive and typical condition for theropods was a tall narrow snout with blade like teeth with serrated carinae skull adaptations of spinosaurids converged with those of crocodilians early members of latter group had skulls similar to typical theropods later developing elongated snouts conical teeth and secondary palates these adaptations may have been result of a dietary change from terrestrial prey to fish unlike crocodiles post cranial skeletons of spinosaurids do not appear to have aquatic adaptations supplementary information sereno and colleagues proposed in 1998 that large thumb claw and robust forelimbs of spinosaurids evolved in middle jurassic before elongation of skull and other adaptations related to fish eating since former features are shared with their relatives they also suggested that spinosaurines and baryonychines diverged before barremian age of early cretaceous several theories have been proposed about biogeography of spinosaurids since suchomimus was more closely related to baryonyx from europe than to spinosaurus although that genus also lived in africa distribution of spinosaurids cannot be explained as vicariance resulting from continental rifting sereno and colleagues proposed that spinosaurids were initially distributed across supercontinent pangea but split with opening of tethys sea spinosaurines would then have evolved in south africa and south america in gondwana and baryonychines in north europe in laurasia with suchomimus result of a single north to south dispersal event buffetaut and tunisian palaeontologist mohamed also suggested in 2002 that baryonychines could be ancestors of spinosaurines which appear to have replaced former in africa milner suggested in 2003 that spinosaurids originated in laurasia during jurassic and dispersed via iberian land bridge into gondwana where they radiated in 2007 buffetaut pointed out that studies had demonstrated that iberia was near northern africa during early cretaceous which he found to confirm milner s idea that iberian region was a stepping stone between europe and africa which is supported by presence of baryonychines in iberia direction of dispersal between europe and africa is still unknown and subsequent discoveries of spinosaurid remains in asia and australia indicate that it may have been complex in 2016 spanish palaeontologist alejandro serrano martinez and colleagues reported oldest known spinosaurid fossil a tooth from middle jurassic of niger which they found to suggest that spinosaurids originated in gondwana since other known jurassic spinosaurid teeth are also from africa but they found subsequent dispersal routes unclear candeiro and colleagues suggested in 2017 that spinosaurids of northern gondwana were replaced by other predators such as abelisauroids since no definite spinosaurid fossils are known from after cenomanian anywhere in world they attributed disappearance of spinosaurids and other shifts in fauna of gondwana to changes in environment perhaps caused by transgressions in sea level palaeobiology thumb alt colour drawing of a long tailed dinosaur walking on its hind legs with a fish in its mouth restoration of baryonyx with a fish diet and feeding in 1986 charig and milner suggested that its elongated snout with many finely serrated teeth indicated that baryonyx was piscivorous fish eating speculating that it crouched on a riverbank and used its claw to gaff fish out of water similar to modern grizzly bear two years earlier taquet pointed out that spinosaurid snouts from niger were similar to those of modern gharial and suggested a behaviour similar to herons or storks in 1987 scottish biologist andrew kitchener disputed piscivorous behaviour of baryonyx and suggested that it would have been a scavenger using its long neck to feed on ground its claws to break into a carcass and its long snout with nostrils far back for breathing for investigating body cavity kitchener argued that baryonyx jaws and teeth were too weak to kill other dinosaurs and too heavy to catch fish with too many adaptations for piscivory according to irish palaeontologist robin e h reid a scavenged carcass would have been broken up by its predator and large animals capable of doing so such as grizzly bears are also capable of catching fish at least in shallow water thumb left alt photo of long narrow skull with many teeth skull of modern gharial has been compared with that of baryonyx in 1997 charig and milner demonstrated direct dietary evidence in stomach region of b walkeri holotype it contained first evidence of piscivory in a theropod dinosaur acid etched scales and teeth of common fish scheenstia mantelli then classified in genus and abraded bones of a young iguanodon an apparent gizzard stone was also found they also presented circumstantial evidence for piscivory such as crocodile like adaptations for catching and swallowing prey long narrow jaws with their terminal rosette similar to those of a gharial and downturned tip and notch of snout in their view these adaptations suggested that baryonyx would have caught small to medium sized fish in manner of a crocodilian gripping them with notch of snout giving teeth a stabbing function tilting head backwards and swallowing them headfirst larger fish would be broken up with claws that teeth in lower jaw were smaller more crowded and numerous than those in upper jaw may have helped animal grip food charig and milner maintained that baryonyx would primarily have eaten fish although it would also have been an active predator and opportunistic scavenger but it was not equipped to be a macro predator like allosaurus they suggested that baryonyx mainly used its forelimbs and large claws to catch kill and tear apart larger prey in 2004 a pterosaur neck vertebra from brazil with a spinosaurid tooth embedded in it reported by buffetaut and colleagues confirmed that latter were not exclusively piscivorous thumb thumbtime 0 00 alt link to video video showing a ct scan 3d model of holotype snout in rotation a 2007 finite element analysis of ct scanned snouts by british palaeontologist emily j rayfield and colleagues indicated that biomechanics of baryonyx were most similar to those of gharial and unlike those of american alligator and more conventional theropods supporting a piscivorous diet for spinosaurids their secondary palate helped them resist bending and torsion of their tubular snouts a 2013 beam theory study by british palaeontologists andrew r cuff and rayfield compared biomechanics of ct scanned spinosaurid snouts with those of extant crocodilians and found snouts of baryonyx and spinosaurus similar in their resistance to bending and torsion baryonyx was found to have relatively high resistance in snout to bending compared with spinosaurus and gharial authors concluded in contrast to 2007 study that baryonyx performed differently than gharial spinosaurids were not exclusive piscivores and their diet was determined by their individual size a preceding 2005 beam theory study by canadian palaeontologist francois therrien and colleagues was unable to reconstruct force profiles of baryonyx but found that related suchomimus would have used front part of its jaws to capture prey and suggested that jaws of spinosaurids were adapted for hunting smaller terrestrial prey in addition to fish they envisaged that spinosaurids could have captured smaller prey with rosette of teeth at front of jaws and finished it by shaking it larger prey would instead have been captured and killed with their forelimbs instead of their bite since their skulls would not be able to resist bending stress they also agreed that conical teeth of spinosaurids were well developed for impaling and holding prey with their shape enabling them to withstand bending loads from all directions in a 2014 conference abstract american palaeontologist danny anduza and fowler pointed out that grizzly bears do not gaff fish out of water as was suggested for baryonyx and also ruled out that dinosaur would not have darted its head like herons since necks of spinosaurids were not strongly s curved and their eyes were not well positioned for binocular vision instead they suggested jaws would have made sideways sweeps to catch fish like gharial with hand claws probably used to stamp down and impale large fish whereafter they manipulated them with their jaws in a manner similar to grizzly bears and fishing cats they did not find teeth of spinosaurids suitable for dismembering prey due to their lack of serrations and suggested they would have swallowed prey whole while noting they could also have used their claws for dismemberment a 2016 study by belgian palaeontologist christophe hendrickx and colleagues found that adult spinosaurs could displace their mandibular rami halves of lower jaw sideways when jaw was depressed which allowed pharynx opening that connects mouth to oesophagus to be widened this jaw articulation is similar to that seen in pterosaurs and living pelicans and would likewise have allowed spinosaurids to swallow large prey such as fish and other animals they also reported that possible portuguese baryonyx fossils were found associated with isolated iguanodon teeth and listed it along with other such associations as support for opportunistic feeding behaviour in spinosaurs another 2016 study by french palaeontologist romain and colleagues found that jaws of spinosaurids were convergent with those of pike conger eels these fish also have jaws that are compressed side to side whereas jaws of crocodilians are compressed from top to bottom an elongated snout with a terminal rosette that bears enlarged teeth and a notch behind rosette with smaller teeth such jaws likely evolved for grabbing prey in aquatic environments with low light and may have helped in prey detection motion and aquatic habits thumb alt painted restoration resting baryonyx being groomed by small pterosaurs and birds in their original description charig and milner did not consider baryonyx to be aquatic due to its nostrils being on sides of its snout far from tip and form of post cranial skeleton but thought it was capable of swimming like most land vertebrates they speculated that elongated skull long neck and strong humerus of baryonyx indicated that animal was a facultative quadruped unique among theropods in their 1997 article they found no skeletal support for this but maintained that forelimbs would have been strong enough for a quadrupedal posture and it would probably have caught aquatic prey while crouching or on all fours near or in water a 2014 re description of spinosaurus by german palaeontologist nizar ibrahim and colleagues based on new remains suggested that it was a quadruped based on its anterior centre of body mass authors found quadrupedality unlikely for baryonyx since better known legs of closely related suchomimus did not support this posture various theories have been proposed for tall neural spines or sails of spinosaurids such as use in thermoregulation fat storage in a hump or display and in 2015 german biophysicist jan and colleagues suggested that this feature could also have aided aquatic movement by improving manoeuvrability when submerged and acted as fulcrum for powerful movements of neck and tail similar to those of sailfish or thresher sharks in 2017 british palaeontologist david e hone and holtz pointed out that like other theropods there was no reason to believe that forelimbs of baryonyx were able to pronate crossing radius and ulna bones of lower arm to turn hand and thereby make it able to rest or walk on its palms resting on or using forelimbs for locomotion may have been possible as indicated by tracks of a resting theropod but if this was norm forelimbs would probably have showed adaptations for this hone and holtz furthermore suggested that forelimbs of spinosaurids do not seem optimal for trapping prey but instead appear similar to forelimbs of digging animals they suggested that ability to dig would have been useful when excavating nests digging for water or to reach some kinds of prey hone and holtz also believed that spinosaurids would have waded and dipped in water rather than submerging themselves due to their sparsity of aquatic adaptations a 2018 study of buoyancy through simulation with 3d models by canadian palaeontologist donald m henderson found that distantly related theropods floated as well as tested spinosaurs and instead supported they would have stayed by shorelines or shallow water rather than being semi aquatic thumb left spatial distribution of abelisaurids carcharodontosaurids and spinosaurids latter strongly associated with coastal environments a 2010 study by french palaeontologist romain and colleagues proposed that spinosaurids were semiaquatic based on oxygen isotope composition of spinosaurid teeth from around world compared with that of other theropods and extant animals spinosaurids probably spent much of day in water like crocodiles and hippopotamuses and had a diet similar to former both were opportunistic predators since most spinosaurids do not appear to have anatomical adaptations for an aquatic lifestyle authors proposed that submersion in water was a means of thermoregulation similar to that of crocodiles and hippopotamuses spinosaurids may also have turned to aquatic habitats and piscivory to avoid competition with large more terrestrial theropods in 2016 sales and colleagues statistically examined fossil distribution of spinosaurids abelisaurids and carcharodontosaurids and concluded that spinosaurids had strongest support for association with coastal spinosaurids also appear to have inhabited inland environments with their distribution there being comparable to carcharodontosaurids which indicates they may have been more generalist than usually thought sales and schultz agreed in 2017 that spinosaurids were semiaquatic and partially piscivorous based on skull features such as conical teeth snouts that were compressed from side to side and retracted nostrils they interpreted fact that histological data indicates some spinosaurids were more terrestrial than others as reflecting ecological niche partitioning among them as some spinosaurids have smaller nostrils than others their olfactory abilities were presumably lesser as in modern piscivorous animals and they may instead have used other senses such as vision and when hunting fish olfaction may have been more useful for spinosaurids that also fed on terrestrial prey such as baryonychines a 2018 study by french palaeontologist auguste hassler and colleagues of calcium isotopes in teeth of north african theropods found that spinosaurids had a mixed diet of fish and herbivorous dinosaurs whereas other theropods examined abelisaurids and carcharodontosaurids mainly fed on herbivorous dinosaurs this indicates ecological partitioning between these theropods and that spinosaurids were semi aquatic predators a 2017 histological study of growth lines by german palaeontologist katja and mateus found that possible portuguese baryonyx specimen had died between age of 23 and 25 years old and was close to its maximum size and skeletal maturity this contradicted a younger age indicated by neurocentral sutures not being fused and presence of both mature and sub adult traits may be due to where juvenile traits are retained into adulthood traits may be related to swimming locomotion as they have been suggested in other extinct animals thought to have been aquatic such as plesiosaurs and temnospondyls study also found that animal had reached sexual maturity at age of 13 to 15 years due to a decrease in growth rate at this point in 2018 brazilian palaeontologist tito aureliano and colleagues reported a spinosaurid tibia from brazil which exhibited high compactness of bone a feature which is correlated with semi aquatic habits in tetrapods it is used for ballast to reduce buoyancy caused by air filled lungs mammal groups with such bone compactness are adapted for living in shallow water palaeoenvironment thumb alt painting of baryonyx by a lake restoration of baryonyx by a lake weald clay formation consists of sediments of hauterivian lower weald clay to barremian upper weald clay age about 130 125 million years old b walkeri holotype was found in latter in clay representing non marine still water which has been interpreted as a fluvial or mudflat environment with shallow water lagoons and marshes during early cretaceous weald area of surrey sussex and kent was partly covered by large fresh to brackish water wealden lake two large rivers drained northern area where london now stands flowing into lake through a river delta anglo paris basin was in south its climate was sub tropical similar to present mediterranean region since smokejacks pit consists of different stratigraphic levels fossil taxa found there are not necessarily contemporaneous dinosaurs from locality include ornithopods mantellisaurus iguanodon and small sauropods other vertebrates from weald clay include crocodiles pterosaurs lizards such as amphibians sharks such as and bony fishes including scheenstia members of ten orders of insects have been identified including and other invertebrates include ostracods isopods and bivalves plants and aquatic herbaceous were common other plants found include ferns horsetails club mosses and conifers other dinosaurs from wessex formation of isle of wight include theropods neovenator aristosuchus thecocoelurus and ornithopods iguanodon hypsilophodon and valdosaurus sauropods and and ankylosaur polacanthus papo seco formation of portugal where baryonyx has possibly been identified is composed of marl representing a lagoon environment other dinosaur remains from area include fragments tentatively assigned to mantellisaurus a macronarian sauropod and megalosaurus taphonomy thumb left alt dead dinosaur lying on its side model carcass based on position of holotype bones nhm charig and milner presented a possible scenario explaining taphonomy changes during decay and fossilisation of b walkeri holotype specimen fine grained sediments around skeleton and fact that bones were found close together skull and forelimb elements at one end of excavation area and pelvis and hind limb elements at other indicates that environment was quiet at time of deposition and water currents did not carry carcass far possibly because water was shallow area where specimen died seems to have been suitable for a piscivorous animal it may have caught fish and scavenged on mud plain becoming mired before it died and was buried since bones are well preserved and had no gnaw marks carcass appears to have been undisturbed by scavengers suggesting that it was quickly covered by sediment disarticulation of bones may have been result of soft tissue decomposition parts of skeleton seem to have weathered to different degrees perhaps because water levels changed or sediments shifted exposing parts of skeleton girdle and limb bones dentary and a rib were broken before fossilisation perhaps from trampling by large animals while buried most of tail appears to have been lost before fossilisation perhaps due to scavenging or having rotted and floated off orientation of bones indicates that carcass lay on its back perhaps tilted slightly to left with right side upwards which may explain why all lower teeth had fallen out of their sockets and some upper teeth were still in place most of bones of portuguese specimen ml1190 were damaged and some scratches may be marks from small scavengers specimen s disarticulation indicates it was transported from a more terrestrial environment since many bones are missing but those found were close together references external links natural history museum baryonyx discovery of an amazing fish eating dinosaur four
