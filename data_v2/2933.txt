fiji parrotfinch erythrura pealii is a species of estrildid finch endemic to fiji that was formerly considered to be a subspecies of red headed parrotfinch this parrotfinch is a small mainly green bird with a red head and tail and a stubby dark grey bill it is found in both forested and open habitats and has adapted well to man made environments such as grasslands pasture and gardens pairs have a courtship display in which they fly above trees in an undulating flight calling constantly breeding birds build a domed grass nest with a side entrance and lay a clutch normally of four white eggs newly hatched chicks are naked and pink with blue balls at upper and lower corners of gape and black markings inside mouth older fledglings resemble adults but lack red head colouring fiji parrotfinch eats seeds especially of grasses and also readily feeds on insects and nectar it forms small flocks of up to six birds after breeding season parrotfinches may be preyed upon by indigenous birds of prey such as endemic fiji goshawk or by introduced mammals such as small asian mongoose rats and mice and they may be susceptible to disease fiji species despite being both uncommon and endemic to one island group appears to be stable in numbers it is therefore classified as least concern on iucn red list and it is protected under fijian law taxonomy parrotfinches are a genus of estrildid finches found in southeast asia and australasia they are small birds with short rounded wings and tails most species have green bodies and all but one have red tail that gives genus its scientific name erythrura clements 1993 p 397 which is derived from ancient greek red brookes 2006 p 306 and oura oura tail brookes 2006 p 1058 english name of fijian fire tail finch was used in early writings fiji parrotfinch was initially described by american naturalist and entomologist titian peale as chief naturalist for united states exploring expedition of 1838 1842 led by charles wilkes peale collected and preserved many specimens including red throated parrotfinch from samoa and fiji parrotfinch from vanua levu peale named latter species as prasina peale s birds were reviewed by german physician and ornithologist gustav hartlaub hartlaub moved fiji species to genus erythrura and then had to change specific name since another bird pin tailed parrotfinch already had binomial e prasina he renamed fiji bird as e pealii in honour of its finder clements 1993 pp 207 208 fijian common names and are derived from kula red fiji parrotfinch and royal parrotfinch of northern vanuatu are now again usually considered to be distinct species watling 2003 pp 166 167 but they were formerly frequently treated as subspecies of samoan red headed parrotfinch e clements 1993 pp 403 405 description thumb left upright thumb use of carpet grass for lawns has helped fiji parrotfinch to use human modified habitats like gardens alt tropical garden with palms by sea fiji parrotfinch is a small finch 10 cm 4 in in length adult male has a bright green body and wings red head and scarlet rump and tail blackish feathering of chin becomes dark blue on lower throat and turquoise on upper breast before fading into green of underparts stubby bill is blackish grey eyes are reddish brown and legs and feet are pinkish brown female is very similar to male but possibly slightly duller and with paler flanks young birds have a dark tipped yellow bill and sometimes a bluish face which gradually turns red but rest of plumage is like adult full mature plumage is achieved at about 20 months some rare individuals of this parrotfinch have entire head and face blue apparently due to a natural mutation fergus 1984 birds of fiji bush fiji museum suva flight of fiji parrotfinch is fast and undulating with rapid wingbeats and frequent calling it tends to fly fairly high landing in tree tops then descending to seek food its call is a high thin seep or peep similar to those of other parrotfinches such as blue faced and red throated and is often repeated in bursts of varying length song is a long whistled double note similar to but less urgent than that of orange breasted a fijian endemic honeyeater watling 2003 pp 170 171 fiji has another erythrura species rare and endangered pink billed parrotfinch this is a larger bird with a green head blue crown and black face and a very large pink bill fiji parrotfinch resembles closely related royal and red headed parrotfinches and rare blue headed variant is very like blue faced parrotfinch but these three species do not occur in fiji distribution and habitat fiji parrotfinch is endemic to fiji where it is found on four largest islands viti levu vanua levu taveuni and kadavu and also in smaller western islands of and groups it is uncommon but widespread found in both forested and open habitats from sea level to at least 1 200 m 3 900 ft on viti levu it appears to be less common on taveuni than larger islands it has adapted well to man made habitats and is seen in grasslands pasture rice paddies parks and gardens many parrotfinch species are mainly forest birds but american ornithologist jared diamond has suggested that in central pacific where there are no seed eating occupying open habitats species such as vanuatu s blue faced parrotfinch and its fijian relative have expanded into grassy areas of their islands to exploit supply of seeds behaviour thumb parrotfinch chicks have blue papillae at corners of gape and distinctive mouth markings alt a chick s open mouth showing yellow interior black marking and blue balls in corners this species has a courtship flight conducted above trees pair fly on a strongly oscillating path with one bird ascending while other is descending both calling constantly after display birds land on a branch for a mating ritual which starts with locking bills followed by female hanging upside down for a variable period of time and then copulation while male holds female s neck flight and mating rituals have been recorded for three coloured and red throated parrotfinches and may be typical for genus nest is built with fresh grass blades and is domed with a side entrance it is always hidden in thick foliage but can be at any height from ground normal clutch is four spherical whitish eggs chicks are naked and have pinkish skin distinctive gape has blue nodular spots technically termed as papillae or tubercles at upper and lower corners and yellow palate has a ring of five black spots most young estrildid finches beg for food with their wings held against side but juvenile parrotfinches lift wing on side away from feeding parent this behaviour may restrict competition for food from other nestlings when not breeding fiji parrotfinch is gregarious and is usually found in small flocks of up to six birds it feeds on seeds usually at milk watery ripe stage a favourite is guinea grass maximus finch will also take seed from rice ears and its spread into gardens has been aided by another preferred food plant carpet grass which is a common lawn grass in fiji this finch readily takes insects often extracted from under loose bark or tree crevices it also feeds on nectar and small berries in some areas this finch s diet may bring it into conflict with rice growers but there is no evidence that this protected species is seen as a serious agricultural threat either in fiji or in australia where it is kept in captivity in small numbers retrieved 15 march 2011 predators and parasites thumb upright endemic fiji goshawk is a specialist predator of small birds alt perched grey bird of prey common endemic fiji goshawk is a specialist predator of small and medium sized birds and swamp harrier is also a widespread predator often taking fledglings local subspecies of peregrine falcon falco peregrinus will hunt finches but is itself rare and declining watling 2003 pp 108 110 barn owls eat mainly rats but sometimes take small birds watling 2003 p 133 rats and mice use fiji parrotfinch nests and may be significant predators of species and small asian mongoose will prey on birds feeding on ground fan tailed cuckoo which has an endemic fijian subspecies is a brood parasite but parrotfinch does not appear to be a host of this large cuckoo watling 2003 pp 131 132 no specific parasites of fiji parrotfinch have been recorded but and avian malaria both spread by parasites have been found in captive populations of other parrotfinch species status fijian parrotfinch is endemic to a single country although its population is unknown it is described as uncommon or locally common in absence of evidence for any decline in numbers its population is believed to be stable and it is therefore classed as least concern on iucn red list it is protected under schedule 2 of fiji s endangered and protected species act 2002 which regulates import and trade of species that are not thought to be at a high risk of extinction but may be threatened if trade in those species is not regulated fiji islands endangered and protected species act 2002 parliament of fiji islands schedule 2 in early 20th century europeans in fiji kept these finches as cagebirds calling them croton finches because of their liking for croton bush but pet trade appears not to be a significant factor at present fiji s native birdlife has been badly affected by agriculture deforestation and introduced pests like rats and mongooses although important bird areas have been established on taveuni and forest east of vanua levu conservation problems persist fiji parrotfinch has adapted well to man made landscapes retrieved 13 march 2011 it is neither a ground nor hole nester so it avoids predation from mongoose and competition for nest sites with introduced common and jungle introduced rodents are able to access nests and may affect breeding productivity potential introduction of other species such as snakes or diseases like avian malaria could lead to major losses among bird species watling 2003 pp 52 59 references cited texts external links category birds described in 1852 category birds of fiji category endemic fauna of fiji category erythrura
