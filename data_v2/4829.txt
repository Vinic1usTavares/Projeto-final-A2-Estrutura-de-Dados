trocaz pigeon madeira laurel pigeon or long toed pigeon columba trocaz is a pigeon which is endemic to island of madeira it is a mainly grey bird with a pinkish breast its silvery neck patch and lack of white wing markings distinguish it from its close relative and probable ancestor common wood pigeon its call is a characteristic six note cooing weaker and lower pitched than that of wood pigeon despite its bulky long tailed appearance this pigeon has a fast direct flight a scarce resident breeder in laurisilva forests trocaz pigeon lays one white egg in a flimsy twig nest its numbers fell sharply after human colonisation of madeira archipelago and it vanished altogether from porto santo island major cause of its population decline was habitat loss from forest clearance but hunting and nest predation by introduced rats were also contributory factors protection of laurel forests and a ban on hunting have enabled numbers to increase so that species is no longer endangered description thumb left upright c l bonaparte described trocaz pigeon as in 1855 trocaz pigeon is a rather plain dark grey bird long with a wingspan upper back has a violet sheen becoming green on back of neck and neck sides are patterned with silver white tail is blackish with a wide pale grey band and flight feathers are mainly black upper breast is pinkish eye is yellow bill has a yellow tip and a reddish purple base and legs are red sexes are similar in appearance but juvenile has generally browner plumage with limited or no development of silvery neck patch its closed wings have a scaly appearance due to pale buff feather edges trocaz pigeon s voice is weaker and deeper than that of common wood pigeon typically consisting of six syllables with middle pair of notes extended and stressed mullarney 1999 p 216 when flying it appears heavy and large tailed although its flight is rapid and direct common wood pigeon had a poorly defined madeiran subspecies columba palumbus maderensis this was paler than trocaz pigeon and had white wing patches and a more extensive green iridescence on nape but it became extinct before 1924 bolle s pigeon is more similar in appearance to trocaz pigeon although it lacks whitish neck patch and has a more extensively pink breast however that species is endemic to canary islands so there is no range overlap only other pigeon currently present on madeira is feral pigeon this is slimmer has more pointed wings and a much smaller tail it often has dark wing markings and a lighter flight taxonomy thumb left old illustration based on a specimen obtained by mr carruthers of madeira in 1827 genus columba is largest within pigeon family and has widest distribution its members are typically pale grey or brown often with white head or neck markings or iridescent green or purple patches on neck and breast neck feathers may be stiffened and aligned to form grooves one of several subgroups within columba consists of widespread eurasian common wood pigeon bolle s pigeon trocaz pigeon and african pigeon two macaronesian endemic pigeons bolle s and trocaz are thought to be derived from isolated island populations of c palumbus gibbs 2000 p 175 atlantic archipelagos of canaries azores and madeira have a volcanic origin and they have never been part of a continent formation of madeira started in miocene and island was substantially complete by 700 000 years ago retrieved 20 july 2010 at various times in past major islands of these archipelagos were all colonised by ancestral wood pigeons which evolved on their respective islands in isolation from mainland populations mitochondrial and nuclear dna sequences suggest that ancestor of bolle s pigeon may have arrived in canaries about 5 mya but an older lineage that gave rise to another canarian endemic laurel pigeon c may date from 20 mya most recent wood pigeon arrival on madeira was that which gave rise to subspecies c palumbus maderensis trocaz pigeon was formally described in 1829 by karl heineken a german medical doctor and ornithologist who was living on madeira at time he recognised it as different from now extinct local form of common wood pigeon which he called palumbus and noted that two pigeons never interbred or habitually associated together he suggested designating new species by its local name trocaz trocaz is a variant of portuguese common wood pigeon both words are ultimately derived from latin a collar and refer to bird s coloured neck patches this is a monotypic species although in past bolle s pigeon was sometimes regarded as a subspecies of trocaz pigeon distribution and habitat trocaz pigeon is endemic to mountainous subtropical atlantic main island of madeira although it formerly also bred on neighbouring porto santo island it mainly occurs on northern slopes of mountains but smaller numbers are found in south where suitable patches of laurel forest remain natural habitat is tall laurisilva forest or dense tree heaths which are cloud covered for much of year snow 1998 p 848 forests consist mainly of azores laurel til madeira mahogany canary laurel faya lily of valley tree and trocaz pigeon prefers primary forests but secondary growth is used for feeding and agricultural land is also visited especially at times of fruit shortage most of pigeons are found below and their prime environment appears to be steep ravine indented slopes along artificial watercourses with occasional large dead laurel tree and much tree heath this species is highly mobile between different areas at different times of year behaviour breeding pigeons can breed from their first year and nesting occurs throughout year although mainly from february to june displays are similar to those of common wood pigeon male climbs quickly in flight gives a loud wing clap and then glides down with his wings and tail spread display may be repeated two or three times before bird returns to a perch on ground male performs a bowing display with his neck inflated to show off iridescent neck patches meanwhile tail is raised fanned then closed again this display is usually accompanied by calling nest is a typical pigeon construction a flimsy structure of twigs and grasses usually placed high in a tree in thick forest one rarely two smooth white eggs are laid although no nest with two chicks has ever been found eggs in size are incubated for 19 20 days young are able to fly in 28 days and are independent within eight weeks feeding trocaz pigeon is exclusively herbivorous nearly 60 of its diet is fruit with most of rest being leaves and just 1 is flowers fruits of til azores laurel and indica and fruits and leaves of small leaved holly are most frequently detected food items most seeds pass through digestive system intact apart from those of azores laurel which are usually damaged fruit is main component of diet when it is readily available in autumn and winter and leaves are consumed in spring and summer when fruits are scarce in one study 27 of leaves consumed came from native trees especially small leaved holly 61 from herbs and shrubs and nearly 10 from introduced trees mainly apples and peaches this pigeon will feed in agricultural areas where cabbage is most commonly taken crop plant pigeon faeces from agricultural areas contain few native plants and samples from forests have few crop species so some individual birds may concentrate on crops feeding in cultivated land is commonest in winter when fruit is readily available so it appears not to be a shortage of natural foods that causes them to leave forest but is mostly opportunistic resulting from birds movements through nearby forest however when fruit crop of til and azores laurel is poor large numbers of pigeons may leave forest to feed on cabbage flowering cherries and vine shoots gibbs 2000 pp 188 189 competition for food with rats can be significant in parts of island status trocaz pigeon formerly bred on both main island of madeira and nearby porto santo island it was very abundant when islands were first colonised by humans but was extirpated on porto santo and by 1986 had declined to about 2 700 birds hunting was banned in that year and there are now between 7 500 and 10 000 individuals in approximately of suitable habitat losses on two islands only inhabited ones in archipelago were largely result of deforestation for wood and to create agricultural and grazing land exclusion of livestock from native forest allows forest to regenerate and create more suitable habitat some illegal hunting and poisoning continues because of damage this pigeon can do to crops and government allowed a cull in 2004 perhaps main limiting factor on rate at which pigeon increases its numbers is predation by introduced black rats on its eggs and young parque natural da madeira national park has a management plan for trocaz pigeon and it is hoped that an education campaign and promotion of bird scarers may reduce persecution its increasing population means that it is now classed as least concern on iucn red list an improvement on its threatened status in 1988 this species is protected under european union birds directive and laurel forests under habitats directive references cited text external links madeira birds trocaz pigeon category birds described in 1829 category birds of madeira category
