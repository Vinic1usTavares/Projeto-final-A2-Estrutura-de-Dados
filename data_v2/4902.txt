least y 890 million yen jpy 6 million usd in damage was caused meteorological history tropical disturbance which would eventually intensify to become typhoon abe was first noted by joint typhoon warning center jtwc in a significant tropical weather advisory as an area of persistent atmospheric convection on august 23 at 01 00 utc located near end of what jtwc considered to be an active monsoon trough initial minimum sea level pressure was estimated to be approximately following this mention disturbance tracked in a mostly west northwestward direction traveling beneath a subtropical ridge with a tropical cyclone formation alert being issued at 06 00 utc based on improving state of low following an increase in storm s central convection jtwc determined at 00 00 utc august 24 that

enhanced convection associated with surge on east side of abe s main convective cloud mass wrapped around north storm s center of circulation reorganized to north between competing convective masses at 06 00 utc august 27 jma upgraded abe to a severe tropical storm with winds of 95 km h 60 mph and as a ragged eye developed in storm jtwc upgraded abe to typhoon status six hours later late on

category 2 equivalent typhoon at 12 00 utc on august 29 a weakness appeared in subtropical ridge in association with a short wave trough and typhoon abe recurved through this weakness taking it along coast of china prior to making landfall abe attained a minimum atmospheric pressure of 955 millibars hpa 28 20 inhg on august 29 at 18 00 utc as determined by jma it was found by jtwc that abe s one minute sustained winds peaked at 165 km h 105 mph at 00 00 utc august 30 and jma determined that its ten minute sustained winds peaked at 140 km h 85 mph at 18 00 utc on august 29 as a direct result of this interaction with land abe weakened to a tropical storm at 12 00 utc on august 31 entering yellow sea and crossing south korea in 30 hours that followed it was determined at 18 00 utc on september 1 that storm had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone jtwc ceased tracking system at 06 00 utc september 2 and jma followed suit 36 hours later impacts in philippines where abe was
