haumea minor planet designation 136108 haumea is a likely dwarf planet located beyond neptune s orbit it was discovered in 2004 by a team headed by mike brown of caltech at palomar observatory in united states and independently in 2005 by a team headed by jose luis ortiz moreno at sierra nevada observatory in spain though latter claim has been contested on september 17 2008 it was recognized as a dwarf planet by international astronomical union iau and named after haumea hawaiian goddess of childbirth though subsequent observations cast doubt on its shape being consistent with hydrostatic equilibrium and thus perhaps not a dwarf planet haumea s mass is about one third that of pluto and 1 1400 that of earth although its shape has not been directly observed calculations from its light curve indicate that it is a jacobi ellipsoid with its major axis twice as long as its minor its gravity was until recently thought to be sufficient for it to have relaxed into hydrostatic equilibrium haumea s elongated shape together with its rapid rotation and high albedo from a surface of crystalline water ice are thought to be consequences of a giant collision which left haumea largest member of a collisional family that includes several large trans neptunian objects tnos and haumea s two known moons hi iaka and namaka haumea is currently third largest known trans neptunian object after eris and pluto history discovery two teams claim credit for discovery of haumea mike brown and his team at caltech discovered haumea in december 28 2004 on images they had taken on may 6 2004 on july 20 2005 they published an online abstract of a report intended to announce discovery at a conference in september 2005 at around this time jose luis ortiz moreno and his team at instituto de astrofisica de andalucia at sierra nevada observatory in spain found haumea on images taken on march 7 10 2003 ortiz emailed minor planet center with their discovery on night of july 27 2005 brown initially conceded discovery credit to ortiz michael e brown how i killed pluto and why it had it coming chapter 9 tenth planet but came to suspect spanish team of fraud upon learning that his observation logs were accessed from spanish observatory day before discovery announcement these logs included enough information to allow ortiz team to precover haumea in their 2003 images and they were accessed again just before ortiz scheduled telescope time to obtain confirmation images for a second announcement to mpc on july 29 ortiz later admitted he had accessed caltech observation logs but denied any wrongdoing stating he was merely verifying whether they had discovered a new object precovery images of haumea have been identified back to march 22 1955 iau protocol is that discovery credit for a minor planet goes to whoever first submits a report to mpc minor planet center with enough positional data for a decent determination of its orbit and that credited discoverer has priority in choosing a name however iau announcement on september 17 2008 that haumea had been accepted as a dwarf planet did not mention a discoverer location of discovery was listed as sierra nevada observatory of spanish team but chosen name haumea was caltech proposal ortiz s team had proposed ataecina ancient iberian goddess of spring which did not meet iau naming criteria name until it was given a permanent name caltech discovery team used nickname santa among themselves because they had discovered haumea on december 28 2004 just after christmas spanish team were first to file a claim for discovery to minor planet center in july 2005 on july 29 2005 haumea was given provisional designation 2003 el61 based on date of spanish discovery image on september 7 2006 it was numbered and admitted into official minor planet catalogue as 136108 2003 el61 following guidelines established by iau that classical kuiper belt objects be given names of mythological beings associated with creation in september 2006 caltech team submitted formal names from hawaiian mythology to iau for both 136108 2003 el61 and its moons in order to pay homage to place where satellites were discovered names were proposed by david rabinowitz of caltech team haumea is matron goddess of island of hawaii where mauna kea observatory is located in addition she is identified with papa goddess of earth and wife of wakea space which at time seemed appropriate because haumea was thought to be composed almost entirely of solid rock without thick ice mantle over a small rocky core typical of other known kuiper belt objects lastly haumea is goddess of fertility and childbirth with many children who sprang from different parts of her body this corresponds to swarm of icy bodies thought to have broken off dwarf planet during an ancient collision two known moons also believed to have formed in this manner are thus named after two of haumea s daughters hi iaka and namaka proposal by ortiz team ataecina did not meet iau naming requirements because names of chthonic deities are reserved for plutinos that resonate 3 2 with neptune which was not case for this body which is in 7 12 resonance see ataecina ss dwarf planet classification haumea is a plutoid a dwarf planet located beyond neptune s orbit it is classified as a dwarf planet because it is presumed to be massive enough to have been rounded by its own gravity into a shape in hydrostatic equilibrium but not massive enough to have cleared its neighbourhood of similarly sized objects haumea was initially listed as a classical kuiper belt object in 2006 by minor planet center but no longer nominal trajectory suggests that haumea is in a weak 7 12 orbital resonance with neptune which would make it a resonant object instead although there are precovery images of haumea dating back to march 22 1955 from palomar mountain digitized sky survey further observations of orbit will be required to verify its dynamic status orbit left 320px thumb haumea s orbit outside of neptune is similar to makemake s positions are as of 1 january 2018 haumea has an orbital period of 284 earth years a perihelion of 35 au and an orbital inclination of 28deg it passed aphelion in early 1992 and is currently more than 50 au from sun haumea s orbit has a slightly greater eccentricity than that of other members of its collisional family this is thought to be due to haumea s weak 7 12 orbital resonance with neptune gradually modifying its initial orbit over course of a billion years through kozai effect which allows exchange of an orbit s inclination for increased eccentricity with a visual magnitude of 17 3 haumea is third brightest object in kuiper belt after pluto and and easily observable with a large amateur telescope however because planets and most small solar system bodies share a common orbital alignment from their formation in primordial disk of solar system most early surveys for distant objects focused on projection on sky of this common plane called ecliptic as region of sky close to ecliptic became well explored later sky surveys began looking for objects that had been dynamically excited into orbits with higher inclinations as well as more distant objects with slower mean motions across sky these surveys eventually covered location of haumea with its high orbital inclination and current position far from ecliptic rotation haumea displays large fluctuations in brightness over a period of 3 9 hours which can only be explained by a rotational period of this length this is faster than any other known equilibrium body in solar system and indeed faster than any other known body larger than 100 km in diameter while most rotating bodies in equilibrium are flattened into oblate spheroids haumea rotates so quickly that it is distorted into a triaxial ellipsoid if haumea were to rotate much more rapidly it would distort itself into a dumbbell shape and split in two this rapid rotation is thought to have been caused by impact that created its satellites and collisional family physical characteristics because haumea has moons mass of system can be calculated from their orbits using kepler s third law result is 28 mass of plutonian system and 6 that of moon nearly all of this mass is in haumea size shape and composition size of a solar system object can be deduced from its optical magnitude its distance and its albedo objects appear bright to earth observers either because they are large or because they are highly reflective if their reflectivity albedo can be ascertained then a rough estimate can be made of their size for most distant objects albedo is unknown but haumea is large and bright enough for its thermal emission to be measured which has given an approximate value for its albedo and thus its size however calculation of its dimensions is complicated by its rapid rotation rotational physics of deformable bodies predicts that over as little as a hundred days a body rotating as rapidly as haumea will have been distorted into equilibrium form of a triaxial ellipsoid it is thought that most of fluctuation in haumea s brightness is caused not by local differences in albedo but by alternation of side view and end view as seen from earth thumb left calculated ellipsoid shape of haumea 1 960x1 518x996 km assuming an albedo of 0 73 at left are minimum and maximum equatorial silhouettes 1 and 1 518x996 km at right is view from pole 1 960x1 518 km rotation and amplitude of haumea s light curve were argued to place strong constraints on its composition if haumea were in hydrostatic equilibrium and had a low density like pluto with a thick mantle of ice over a small rocky core its rapid rotation would have elongated it to a greater extent than fluctuations in its brightness allow such considerations constrained its density to a range of 2 6 3 3 g cm3 by comparison moon which is rocky has a density of 3 3 g cm3 whereas pluto which is typical of icy objects in kuiper belt has a density of 1 86 g cm3 haumea s possible high density covered values for silicate minerals such as olivine and pyroxene which make up many of rocky objects in solar system this also suggested that bulk of haumea was rock covered with a relatively thin layer of ice a thick ice mantle more typical of kuiper belt objects may have been blasted off during impact that formed haumean collisional family thumb right haumea is thought to rotate in just under 4 hours this rapid rotation causes it to be elongated several ellipsoid model calculations of haumea s dimensions have been made first model produced after haumea s discovery was calculated from ground based observations of haumea s light curve at optical wavelengths it provided a total length of 1 960 to 2 500 km and a visual albedo pv greater than 0 6 most likely shape is a triaxial ellipsoid with approximate dimensions of 2 000 x 1 500 x 1 000 km with an albedo of 0 71 observations by spitzer space telescope give a diameter of and an albedo of from photometry at infrared wavelengths of 70 mm subsequent light curve analyses have suggested an equivalent circular diameter of 1 450 km in 2010 an analysis of measurements taken by herschel space telescope together with older spitzer telescope measurements yielded a new estimate of equivalent diameter of haumea about 1300 km these independent size estimates overlap at an average geometric mean diameter of roughly 1 400 km however observations of a stellar occultation in january 2017 cast a doubt on all those conclusions measured shape of haumea while elongated as presumed before appeared to have significantly larger dimensions according to data obtained from occultation haumea is approximately diameter of pluto along its longest axis and about half that at its poles so resulting density of about 1 8 g cm3 is more in line with densities of other large tnos this resulting shape is inconsistent with a homogenous body in hydrostatic equilibrium although it is expected to be differentiated it is not known whether that would make its shape consistent with hydrostatic equilibrium nevertheless haumea appears to be one of largest trans neptunian objects discovered smaller than similar to and possibly and larger than and surface in 2005 gemini and keck telescopes obtained spectra of haumea which showed strong crystalline water ice features similar to surface of pluto s moon charon this is peculiar because crystalline ice forms at temperatures above 110 k whereas haumea s surface temperature is below 50 k a temperature at which amorphous ice is formed in addition structure of crystalline ice is unstable under constant rain of cosmic rays and energetic particles from sun that strike trans neptunian objects timescale for crystalline ice to revert to amorphous ice under this bombardment is on order of ten million years yet trans neptunian objects have been in their present cold temperature locations for timescales of billions of years radiation damage should also redden and darken surface of trans neptunian objects where common surface materials of organic ices and tholin like compounds are present as is case with pluto therefore spectra and colour suggest haumea and its family members have undergone recent resurfacing that produced fresh ice however no plausible resurfacing mechanism has been suggested haumea is as bright as snow with an albedo in range of 0 6 0 8 consistent with crystalline ice other large tnos such as appear to have albedos as high or higher best fit modeling of surface spectra suggested that 66 to 80 of haumean surface appears to be pure crystalline water ice with one contributor to high albedo possibly hydrogen cyanide or phyllosilicate clays inorganic cyanide salts such as copper potassium cyanide may also be present however further studies of visible and near infrared spectra suggest a homogeneous surface covered by an intimate 1 1 mixture of amorphous and crystalline ice together with no more than 8 organics absence of ammonia hydrate excludes cryovolcanism and observations confirm that collisional event must have happened more than 100 million years ago in agreement with dynamic studies absence of measurable methane in spectra of haumea is consistent with a warm collisional history that would have removed such volatiles in contrast to in addition to large fluctuations in haumea s light curve due to body s shape which affect all colours equally smaller independent colour variations seen in both visible and near infrared wavelengths show a region on surface that differs both in colour and in albedo more specifically a large dark red area on haumea s bright white surface was seen in september 2009 possibly an impact feature which indicates an area rich in minerals and organic carbon rich compounds or possibly a higher proportion of crystalline ice thus haumea may have a mottled surface reminiscent of pluto if not as extreme ring thumb haumea s 3 hour rotation within its discovered ring click for animation thumb a scale diagram of size of haumea its ring and 2 moons a stellar occultation observed on 21 january 2017 and described in an 11 october 2017 nature article indicated presence of a ring around haumea this represents first ring system discovered for a tno surprise dwarf planet haumea has a ring sky and telescope october 13 2017 ring has a radius of about 2 287 km a width of 70 km and an opacity of 0 5 it is well within haumea s roche limit which would be at a radius of about 4 400 km if it were spherical being pushes limit out farther ring plane approximately coincides with haumea s equatorial plane and orbital plane of its larger outer moon hi iaka ring is also close to 3 1 resonance with haumea s rotation which is at a radius of 2 285 8 km ring is estimated to contribute 5 to total brightness of haumea in a study about dynamics of ring particles published in 2019 othon cabo winter and colleagues have shown that 1 3 resonance with haumea s rotation is dynamically unstable but that there is a stable region in phase space consistent with location of haumea s ring this indicates that ring particles originate on circular periodic orbits that are close to but not inside resonance satellites thumb artist s conception of haumea with its moons hi iaka and namaka moons are much more distant than depicted here two small satellites have been discovered orbiting haumea 136108 haumea i hi iaka and 136108 haumea ii namaka darin ragozzine and michel brown discovered both in 2005 through observations of haumea using w m keck observatory hi iaka at first nicknamed rudolph by caltech team was discovered january 26 2005 it is outer and at roughly 310 km in diameter larger and brighter of two and orbits haumea in a nearly circular path every 49 days strong absorption features at 1 5 and 2 micrometres in infrared spectrum are consistent with nearly pure crystalline water ice covering much of surface unusual spectrum along with similar absorption lines on haumea led brown and colleagues to conclude that capture was an unlikely model for system s formation and that haumean moons must be fragments of haumea itself namaka smaller inner satellite of haumea was discovered on june 30 2005 and nicknamed blitzen it is a tenth mass of hiiaka orbits haumea in 18 days in a highly elliptical non keplerian orbit and is inclined 13deg from larger moon which perturbs its orbit relatively large eccentricities together with mutual inclination of orbits of satellites are unexpected as they should have been damped by tidal effects a relatively recent passage by a 3 1 resonance with hi iaka might explain current excited orbits of haumean moons at present orbits of haumean moons appear almost exactly edge on from earth with namaka periodically occulting haumea observation of such transits would provide precise information on size and shape of haumea and its moons as happened in late 1980s with pluto and charon tiny change in brightness of system during these occultations will require at least a medium aperture professional telescope for detection hi iaka last occulted haumea in 1999 a few years before discovery and will not do so again for some 130 years however in a situation unique among regular satellites namaka s orbit is being greatly torqued by hi iaka which preserved viewing angle of namaka haumea transits for several more years collisional family haumea is largest member of its collisional family a group of astronomical objects with similar physical and orbital characteristics thought to have formed when a larger progenitor was shattered by an impact this family is first to be identified among tnos and includes beside haumea and its moons 364 km 174 km 200 km 230 km and 252 km brown and colleagues proposed that family were a direct product of impact that removed haumea s ice mantle but a second proposal suggests a more complicated origin that material ejected in initial collision instead coalesced into a large moon of haumea which was later shattered in a second collision dispersing its shards outwards this second scenario appears to produce a dispersion of velocities for fragments that is more closely matched to measured velocity dispersion of family members presence of collisional family could imply that haumea and its offspring might have originated in scattered disc in today s sparsely populated kuiper belt chance of such a collision occurring over age of solar system is less than 0 1 percent family could not have formed in denser primordial kuiper belt because such a close knit group would have been disrupted by neptune s migration into belt believed cause of belt s current low density therefore it appears likely that dynamic scattered disc region in which possibility of such a collision is far higher is place of origin for object that generated haumea and its kin because it would have taken at least a billion years for group to have diffused as far as it has collision which created haumea family is believed to have occurred very early in solar system s history exploration it was calculated that a flyby mission to haumea could take 14 25 years using a jupiter gravity assist based on a launch date of 25 september 2025 haumea would be 48 18 au from sun when spacecraft arrives a flight time of 16 45 years can be achieved with launch dates on 1 november 2026 23 september 2037 and 29 october 2038 haumea could become a target for an exploration mission and an example of this work is a preliminary study on a probe to haumea and its moons at 35 51 au paul fast orbiter to haumea centauri dreams news of tau zero foundation july 14 2009 retrieved january 15 2011 probe mass power source and propulsion systems are key
