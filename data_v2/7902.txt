fat man was codename for nuclear bomb that was detonated over japanese city of nagasaki by united states on 9 august 1945 it was second of only two nuclear weapons ever used in warfare first being little boy and its detonation marked third nuclear explosion in history it was built by scientists and engineers at los alamos laboratory using plutonium from hanford site and it was dropped from boeing b 29 superfortress bockscar piloted by major charles sweeney name fat man refers to early design of bomb because it had a wide round shape it was also known as mark iii fat man was an implosion type nuclear weapon with a solid plutonium core first of that type to be detonated was gadget in trinity nuclear test less than a month earlier on 16 july at alamogordo bombing and gunnery range in new mexico two more were detonated during operation crossroads nuclear tests at bikini atoll in 1946 and some 120 were produced between 1947 and 1949 when it was superseded by mark 4 nuclear bomb fat man was retired in 1950 early decisions robert oppenheimer held conferences in chicago in june 1942 prior to army taking over wartime atomic research and in berkeley california in july at which various engineers and physicists discussed nuclear bomb design issues they chose a gun type design in which two sub critical masses would be brought together by firing a bullet into a target richard c tolman suggested an implosion type nuclear weapon but proposal attracted little interest feasibility of a plutonium bomb was questioned in 1942 wallace akers director of british tube alloys project told james bryant conant on 14 november that james chadwick had concluded that plutonium might not be a practical fissionable material for weapons because of impurities conant consulted ernest lawrence and arthur compton who acknowledged that their scientists at berkeley and chicago respectively knew about problem but they could offer no ready solution conant informed manhattan project director brigadier general leslie r groves jr who in turn assembled a special committee consisting of lawrence compton oppenheimer and mcmillan to examine issue committee concluded that any problems could be overcome simply by requiring higher purity oppenheimer reviewed his options in early 1943 and gave priority to gun type weapon but he created e 5 group at los alamos laboratory under seth neddermeyer to investigate implosion as a hedge against threat of pre detonation implosion type bombs were determined to be significantly more efficient in terms of explosive yield per unit mass of fissile material in bomb because compressed fissile materials react more rapidly and therefore more completely nonetheless it was decided that plutonium gun would receive bulk of research effort since it was project with least amount of uncertainty involved it was assumed that uranium gun type bomb could be easily adapted from it naming gun type and implosion type designs were codenamed thin man and fat man respectively these code names were created by robert serber a former student of oppenheimer s who worked on manhattan project he chose them based on their design shapes thin man was a very long device and name came from dashiell hammett detective novel thin man and series of movies fat man was round and fat and was named after sydney greenstreet s character in maltese falcon little boy came last as a variation of thin man development neddermeyer discarded serber and tolman s initial concept of implosion as assembling a series of pieces in favor of one in which a hollow sphere was imploded by an explosive shell he was assisted in this work by hugh bradner charles critchfield and john streib l t e thompson was brought in as a consultant and discussed problem with neddermeyer in june 1943 thompson was skeptical that an implosion could be made sufficiently symmetric oppenheimer arranged for neddermeyer and edwin mcmillan to visit national defense research committee s explosives research laboratory near laboratories of bureau of mines in pennsylvania a pittsburgh suburb where they spoke to george kistiakowsky and his team but neddermeyer s efforts in july and august at imploding tubes to produce cylinders tended to produce objects that resembled rocks neddermeyer was only person who believed that implosion was practical and only his enthusiasm kept project alive upright 1 25 thumb left alt fat man replica replica mockup of a fat man displayed in national museum of united states air force beside bockscar b 29 that dropped original device black liquid asphalt sealant was sprayed over original bomb casing s seams simulated on mockup oppenheimer brought john von neumann to los alamos in september 1943 to take a fresh look at implosion after reviewing neddermeyer s studies and discussing matter with edward teller von neumann suggested use of high explosives in shaped charges to implode a sphere which he showed could not only result in a faster assembly of fissile material than was possible with gun method but which could greatly reduce amount of material required because of resulting higher density idea that under such pressures plutonium metal itself would be compressed came from teller whose knowledge of how dense metals behaved under heavy pressure was influenced by his pre war theoretical studies of earth s core with george gamow prospect of more efficient nuclear weapons impressed oppenheimer teller and hans bethe but they decided that an expert on explosives would be required kistiakowsky s name was immediately suggested and kistiakowsky was brought into project as a consultant in october 1943 implosion project remained a backup until april 1944 when experiments by emilio g segre and his p 5 group at los alamos on newly reactor produced plutonium from x 10 graphite reactor at oak ridge and b reactor at hanford site showed that it contained impurities in form of isotope plutonium 240 this has a far higher spontaneous fission rate and radioactivity than plutonium 239 cyclotron produced isotopes on which original measurements had been made held much lower traces of plutonium 240 its inclusion in reactor bred plutonium appeared unavoidable this meant that spontaneous fission rate of reactor plutonium was so high that it would be highly likely that it would predetonate and blow itself apart during initial formation of a critical mass distance required to accelerate plutonium to speeds where predetonation would be less likely would need a gun barrel too long for any existing or planned bomber only way to use plutonium in a workable bomb was therefore implosion thumb flash x ray images of converging shock waves formed during a test of high explosive lens system impracticability of a gun type bomb using plutonium was agreed at a meeting in los alamos on 17 july 1944 all gun type work in manhattan project was directed at little boy enriched uranium gun design and los alamos laboratory was reorganized with almost all of research focused on problems of implosion for fat man bomb idea of using shaped charges as three dimensional explosive lenses came from james l tuck and was developed by von neumann to overcome difficulty of synchronizing multiple detonations luis alvarez and lawrence johnston invented exploding bridgewire detonators to replace less precise primacord detonation system robert christy is credited with doing calculations that showed how a solid subcritical sphere of plutonium could be compressed to a critical state greatly simplifying task since earlier efforts had attempted more difficult compression of a hollow spherical shell after christy s report solid plutonium core weapon was referred to as christy gadget task of metallurgists was to determine how to cast plutonium into a sphere difficulties became apparent when attempts to measure density of plutonium gave inconsistent results at first contamination was believed to be cause but it was soon determined that there were multiple allotropes of plutonium brittle a phase that exists at room temperature changes to plastic b phase at higher temperatures attention then shifted to even more malleable d phase that normally exists in range it was found that this was stable at room temperature when alloyed with aluminum but aluminum emits neutrons when bombarded with alpha particles which would exacerbate pre ignition problem metallurgists then hit upon a plutonium gallium alloy which stabilized d phase and could be hot pressed into desired spherical shape as plutonium was found to corrode readily sphere was coated with nickel thumb left a pumpkin bomb fat man test unit being raised from pit into bomb bay of a b 29 for bombing practice during weeks before attack on nagasaki size of bomb was constrained by available aircraft only allied aircraft considered capable of carrying fat man without major modification were british avro lancaster and american boeing b 29 superfortress at time b 29 represented epitome of bomber technology with significant advantages in mtow range speed flight ceiling and survivability without availability of b 29 dropping bomb would likely have been impossible however this still constrained bomb to a maximum length of width of and weight of removing bomb rails allowed a maximum width of drop tests began in march 1944 and resulted in modifications to silverplate aircraft due to weight of bomb high speed photographs revealed that tail fins folded under pressure resulting in an erratic descent various combinations of stabilizer boxes and fins were tested on fat man shape to eliminate its persistent wobble until an arrangement dubbed a california parachute a cubical open rear tail box outer surface with eight radial fins inside of it four angled at 45deg and four perpendicular to line of fall holding outer square fin box to bomb s rear end was approved in drop tests in early weeks fat man missed its target by an average of but this was halved by june as bombardiers became more proficient with it early y 1222 model fat man was assembled with some 1 500 bolts this was superseded by y 1291 design in december 1944 this redesign work was substantial and only y 1222 tail design was retained later versions included y 1560 which had 72 detonators y 1561 which had 32 and y 1562 which had 132 there were also y 1563 and y 1564 which were practice bombs with no detonators at all final wartime y 1561 design was assembled with just 90 bolts on 16 july 1945 a y 1561 model fat man known as gadget was detonated in a test explosion at a remote site in new mexico known as trinity test it gave a yield of about some minor changes were made to design as a result of trinity test philip morrison recalled that there were some changes of

nagasaki on 9 august 1945 first plutonium core was transported with its polonium beryllium modulated neutron initiator in custody of project alberta courier raemer schreiber in a magnesium field carrying case designed for purpose by philip morrison magnesium was chosen because it does not act as a tamper it left kirtland army air field on a c 54 transport aircraft of 509th composite group s 320th troop carrier squadron on 26 july and arrived at north field on tinian on 28 july three fat man high explosive pre assemblies designated f31 f32 and f33 were picked up at kirtland on 28 july by three b 29s luke spook and laggin dragon from 509th composite group s 393d bombardment squadron and another from 216th aaf base unit cores were transported to north field arriving on 2 august when f31 was partly disassembled in order to check all its components f33 was expended near tinian during a final rehearsal on 8 august and f31 was bomb dropped on nagasaki f32 presumably would have been used for a third attack or its rehearsal in august 1945 fat man was assembled on tinian by project alberta personnel and physics package was fully assembled and wired it was placed inside its ellipsoidal aerodynamic bombshell and wheeled out where it was signed by nearly 60 people including rear admiral william r purnell brigadier general thomas f farrell and captain william s parsons it was then wheeled to bomb bay of b 29 superfortress named bockscar after plane s command pilot captain frederick c bock who flew great artiste with his crew on mission bockscar was flown by major charles w sweeney and his crew with commander frederick l ashworth from project alberta as weaponeer in charge of bomb bockscar lifted off at 03 47 on morning of 9 august 1945 with kokura as primary target and nagasaki secondary target weapon was already armed but with green electrical safety plugs still engaged ashworth changed them to red after ten minutes so that sweeney could climb to in order to get above storm clouds during pre flight inspection of bockscar flight engineer notified sweeney that an inoperative fuel transfer pump made it impossible to use of fuel carried in a reserve tank this fuel would still have to be carried all way to japan and back consuming still more fuel replacing pump would take hours moving fat man to another aircraft might take just as long and was dangerous as well as bomb was live colonel paul tibbets and sweeney therefore elected to have bockscar continue mission thumb right effects of fat man s detonation on nagasaki original target for bomb was city of kokura but it was found to be obscured by clouds and drifting smoke from fires started by a major firebombing raid by 224 b 29s on nearby yahata previous day this covered 70 of area over kokura obscuring aiming point three bomb runs were made over next 50 minutes burning fuel and repeatedly exposing aircraft to heavy defenses of yahata but bombardier was unable to drop visually by time of third bomb run japanese anti aircraft fire was getting close second lieutenant jacob beser was monitoring japanese communications and he reported activity on japanese fighter direction radio bands sweeney then proceeded to alternative target of nagasaki it was obscured by cloud as well and ashworth ordered sweeney to make a radar approach at last minute however bombardier captain kermit k beahan found a hole in clouds fat man was dropped and exploded at 11 02 local time following a 43 second free fall at an altitude of about there was poor visibility due to cloud cover and bomb missed its intended detonation point by almost two miles so damage was somewhat less extensive than that in hiroshima an estimated 35 000 40 000 people were killed outright by bombing at nagasaki a total of 60 000 80 000 fatalities resulted including from long term health effects strongest of which was leukemia with an attributable risk of 46 for bomb victims columbia center for nuclear studies hiroshima and nagasaki long term health effects updated 7 3 2014 others died later from related blast and burn injuries and hundreds more from radiation illnesses from exposure to bomb s initial radiation most of direct deaths and injuries were among munitions or industrial workers mitsubishi s industrial production in city was also severed by attack dockyard would have produced at 80 percent of its full capacity within three to four months steel works would have required a year to get back to substantial production electric works would have resumed some production within two months and been back at capacity within six months and arms plant would have required 15 months to return to 60 to 70 percent of former capacity mitsubishi urakami ordnance works was factory that manufactured type 91 torpedoes released in attack on pearl harbor it was destroyed in blast post war development right thumb espionage information procured by klaus fuchs theodore hall and david greenglass led to first soviet device rds 1 above which closely resembled fat man even in its external shape after war two y 1561 fat man bombs were used in operation crossroads nuclear tests at bikini atoll in pacific first was known as gilda after rita hayworth s character in 1946 movie gilda and it was dropped by b 29 dave s dream it missed its aim point by second bomb was nicknamed helen of bikini and was placed without its tail fin assembly in a steel caisson made from a submarine s conning tower it was detonated beneath landing craft uss lsm 60 two weapons yielded about each los alamos laboratory and army air forces had already commenced work on improving design north american b 45 tornado convair xb 46 martin xb 48 and boeing b 47 stratojet bombers had bomb bays sized to carry grand slam which was much longer but not as wide as fat man only american bombers that could carry fat man were b 29 and convair b 36 in november 1945 army air forces asked los alamos for 200 fat man bombs but there were only two sets of plutonium cores and high explosive assemblies at time army air forces wanted improvements to design to make it easier to manufacture assemble handle transport and stockpile wartime project w 47 was continued and drop tests resumed in january 1946 mark iii mod 0 fat man was ordered into production in mid 1946 high explosives were manufactured by salt wells pilot plant which had been established by manhattan project as part of project camel and a new plant was established at iowa army ammunition plant mechanical components were made or procured by rock island arsenal electrical and mechanical components for about 50 bombs were stockpiled at kirtland army air field by august 1946 but only nine plutonium cores were available production of mod 0 ended in december 1948 by which time there were still only 53 cores available it was replaced by improved versions known as mods 1 and 2 which contained a number of minor changes most important of which was that they did not charge x unit firing system s capacitors until released from aircraft mod 0s were withdrawn from service between march and july 1949 and by october they had all been rebuilt as mods 1 and 2 some 120 mark iii fat man units were added to stockpile between 1947 and 1949 when it was superseded by mark 4 nuclear bomb mark iii fat man was retired in 1950 a nuclear strike would have been a formidable undertaking in post war 1940s due to limitations of mark iii fat man lead acid batteries which powered fuzing system remained charged for only 36 hours after which they needed to be recharged to do this meant disassembling bomb and recharging took 72 hours batteries had to be removed in any case after nine days or they corroded plutonium core could not be left in for much longer because its heat damaged high explosives replacing core also required bomb to be completely disassembled and reassembled this required about 40 to 50 men and took between 56 and 72 hours depending on skill of bomb assembly team and armed forces special weapons project had only three teams in june 1948 only aircraft capable of carrying bomb were silverplate b 29s and only group equipped with them was 509th bombardment group at walker air force base in roswell new mexico they would first have to fly to sandia base to collect bombs and then to an overseas base from which a strike could be mounted soviet union s first nuclear weapon was based closely on fat man s design thanks to spies klaus fuchs theodore hall and david greenglass who provided them with secret information concerning
