1991 perfect storm also known as no name storm especially in years immediately after it took place and halloween gale storm was a nor easter that absorbed hurricane grace and ultimately evolved into a small unnamed hurricane itself late in its life cycle initial area of low pressure developed off coast of atlantic canada on october 29 forced southward by a ridge to its north it reached its peak intensity as a large and powerful cyclone storm lashed east coast of united states with high waves and coastal flooding before turning to southwest and weakening moving over warmer waters system transitioned into a subtropical cyclone before becoming a tropical storm it executed a loop off mid atlantic states and turned toward northeast on november 1 system evolved into a full fledged hurricane with peak sustained winds of 75 miles per hour 120 km h although national hurricane center left it unnamed to avoid confusion amid media interest in precursor extratropical storm it later received name perfect storm playing off common expression after a conversation between boston national weather service forecaster robert case and author sebastian junger system was twelfth and final tropical cyclone eighth tropical storm and fourth hurricane in 1991 atlantic hurricane season tropical system weakened striking nova scotia as a tropical storm before dissipating damage from storm totaled over 200 million 1991 usd and death toll was thirteen most of damage occurred while storm was extratropical after waves up to struck coastline from canada to florida and southeastward to puerto rico in massachusetts where damage was heaviest over 100 homes were destroyed or severely damaged to north more than 100 homes were affected in maine including vacation home of then president george h w bush more than 38 000 people were left without power and along coast high waves inundated roads and buildings in portions of new england damage was worse than that caused by hurricane bob two months earlier aside from tidal flooding along rivers storm s effects were primarily concentrated along coast a buoy off coast of nova scotia reported a wave height of highest ever recorded in province s offshore waters in middle of storm fishing vessel andrea gail sank killing her crew of six and inspiring book and later movie perfect storm off shore of new york s long island an air national guard helicopter ran out of fuel and crashed four members of its crew were rescued and one was killed two people died after their boat sank off staten island high waves swept two people to their deaths one in rhode island and one in puerto rico and another person was blown off a bridge to his death tropical cyclone that formed late in storm s duration caused little impact limited to power outages and slick roads one person was killed in newfoundland from a traffic accident related to storm meteorological history perfect storm originated from a cold front that exited east coast of united states on october 28 front spawned an extratropical low to east of nova scotia around that time a ridge extended from appalachian mountains northeastward to greenland with a strong high pressure center over eastern canada blocking ridge forced extratropical low to track toward southeast and later to west hurricane grace was swept aloft by its cold front into warm conveyor belt circulation of deep cyclone on october 29 cyclone significantly strengthened as a result of temperature contrast between cold air to northwest and warmth and humidity from remnants of hurricane grace low pressure system continued deepening as it drifted toward united states it had an unusual retrograde motion for a nor easter beginning a set of meteorological circumstances that occur only once every 50 to 100 years most nor easters affect new england from southwest thumb right tropical storm making landfall west of halifax nova scotia canada on november 2 while situated about south of halifax nova scotia storm attained its peak intensity with winds of up to nor easter reached peak intensity at approximately 12 00 utc on october 30 with its lowest pressure of 972 millibars interaction between extratropical storm and high pressure system to its north created a significant pressure gradient which created large waves and strong winds between southern new england coast and storm s center gradient was a buoy located south of halifax reported a wave height of on october 30 this became highest recorded wave height on scotian shelf which is oceanic shelf off coast of nova scotia east of cape cod a noaa buoy located at reported maximum sustained winds of with gusts to and a significant wave height average height of highest one third of all waves of around 15 00 utc on october 30 another buoy located at reported maximum sustained winds of with gusts to and a significant wave height of near 00 00 utc on october 31 upon peaking in intensity nor easter turned southward and gradually weakened by november 1 its pressure had risen to low moved over warm waters of gulf stream where bands of convection around center began to organize around this time system attained subtropical characteristics on november 1 while storm was moving in a counter clockwise loop a tropical cyclone had been identified at center of larger low although these conditions are rare hurricane karl during 1980 formed within a larger non tropical weather system by around 14 00 utc on november 1 an eye feature was forming and tropical cyclone reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of these estimates combined with reports from an air force reserve unit flight into storm and confirmation that a warm core center was present indicated that system had become a category 1 hurricane on saffir simpson hurricane scale hurricane accelerated toward northeast and quickly weakened back into a tropical storm it made landfall near halifax nova scotia at 14 00 utc on november 2 with sustained winds of while storm was approaching coast weather radars depicted curved rainbands on western side of system after crossing over prince edward island storm fully dissipated late on november 2 preparations and naming left thumb perfect storm to south of nova scotia on october 30 for several days weather models forecast development of a significant storm off new england however models were inadequate in forecasting coastal conditions which in one instance failed to provide adequate warning in addition a post storm assessment found an insufficient number of observation sites along coast on october 27 ocean prediction center noted that a dangerous storm would form within 36 hours with its wording emphasizing unusual nature of storm national weather service likewise issued warnings for potential storm providing information to emergency service offices as well as media public however was skeptical and did not recognize threat timely warnings ultimately lowered death toll whereas perfect storm caused 13 deaths blizzard of 1978 killed 99 people and 1938 new england hurricane killed 564 people from massachusetts to maine thousands of people evacuated their homes and sought shelter a state of emergency was declared for nine counties in massachusetts including suffolk county as well as two in maine in north carolina national weather service offices in hatteras and

warning hatteras nws office ultimately released 19 coastal flood statements as well as media reports explaining threat from wind and waves and a state of emergency was declared for dare county north carolina warnings and lead times in region were described as very good in canada threat from storm prompted cancellation of ferry service from bar harbor maine to yarmouth nova scotia as well as from

disaster survey report called storm halloween nor easter of 1991 perfect storm moniker was coined by author and journalist sebastian junger after a conversation with nws boston deputy meteorologist robert case in which case described convergence of weather conditions as being perfect for formation of such a storm other national weather service offices were tasked with issuing warnings for this storm in lieu of typical nhc advisories opc posted warnings on unnamed hurricane in its high seas forecasts national weather service state forecast office in boston issued offshore marine forecasts for storm local nws offices along east coast covered storm in their coastal waters forecasts beginning in 1950 national hurricane center named officially recognized tropical storms and hurricanes unnamed hurricane was reported to have met all criteria for a tropical cyclone but it was purposefully left unnamed this was done to avoid confusion among media and public who were focusing on damage
