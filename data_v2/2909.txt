meat in addition to killing any residents that are armed reaching a vault is always possible with enough skill game forces players to escape their own traps before other players can access them being caught in one s own traps has same consequence as any other trap in game permadeath development conception and design castle doctrine was created by indie developer jason rohrer its ideas were drawn from rohrer s childhood anxieties about his family s house being burgled and his adult sense of responsibility over protecting his family game s central theme is castle doctrine and includes issue of gun rights rohrer created it partially as an artistic statement on defending one s family through violence he summarized his goals with game as creating something that makes you feel violated and makes you want to protect stuff that s yours and puts you in process of securing what s yours however he has remarked that consequence of making players feel hypocritical since they are invading others homes as well was partially intentional and an elegant idea rohrer noted in an interview his aversion to creating a ridiculous caricature of some post apocalyptic man s world where we ll all just robbing each other and instead called his game pre apocalyptic in setting and style in terms of aesthetics rohrer aimed for a very clean no frills no fluff no filler kind of design that emphasized function in all of its objects he has noted that some players have complained about not being able to decorate their houses non functionally but is unsympathetic saying that game is not farmville game was however influenced by minecraft which while heavily tied to cosmetic decoration involves similar themes of protecting one s creations from other players as in castle doctrine rohrer thought of adding family members for player s character early in game s development but scrapped it at first because of extra complexity and not knowing how to make them more than inanimate objects after a dream however he was inspired to see if there was a practical way to implement them that would further game s moral dimension testing and releases castle doctrine was first released as a paid alpha and sold at half price from march 2013 until its official release on january 29 2014 as was visible through its history of updates during beta testing it went through several changes primarily increase of gameplay difficulty one was addition of dedicated perma perma death servers where players could not even re create characters after dying in contrast to game s generic perma death servers another was blueprints which allow players to get a general sense of a house s layout before entering and thus encourage setting up puzzle based rather than luck based vault defenses rohrer did not however want game to be impossible so he took step of forcing players to evade their own traps before houses would be accessible to others game has been placed in public domain and is hosted on sourceforge upon release game s 50 discount was scaled back to 25 for one week it has not gone on sale since as rohrer believes that sales screw your fans as they discourage buying games one wants during non sale periods following game s release rohrer used 3 000 usd of alpha release earnings to fund a competition in which players could win money paintings gift cards and other prizes by having highest worth in game houses highest prize awarded was 316 usd reception castle doctrine received mixed reviews from critics with a score on review aggregator metacritic of 58 100 patrick carlson of pc gamer reviewed game well responding positively to game rewarding experimentation and being easy to understand describing it as thoughtfully designed game informer s daniel tack also rated game well commenting particularly on its creativity stating though that he did not think game was deep enough to stay interesting for long writing for destructoid patrick hancock shared tack s opinion that game was a good experience but said he would find it hard to recommend web video series extra credits recommended it on one of their games you might not have tried episodes praising it for challenging player to examine their beliefs and commenting that being good at game itself requires same sort of paranoid genius that game itself is trying to warn against polygon s russ pitts found game a frustrating exercise his experience determined by arbitrary quality of player designed houses and further obstructed by harsh consequences of failure pitts felt game valued its message over player s time and yet found message hard to take seriously he would describe game as most disturbing he had ever played keza macdonald in her review at ign shared these frustrations finding that tackling player constructed houses made game over reliant on trial and error she also found it hard to empathize with small pixelated characters leading her to believe that game failed in communicating much of a message nick capozzoli of gamespot also gave game a largely negative review criticising nihilistic feel and saying that it did not bring out emotions it was aimed to see also tower defense list of
