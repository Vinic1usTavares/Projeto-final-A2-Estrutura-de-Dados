hurricane karl was a large and powerful cape verde hurricane during 2004 atlantic hurricane season it was eleventh named storm eighth hurricane and sixth major hurricane of 2004 season karl formed on september 16 originating from a strong tropical wave that emerged off coast of africa it rapidly intensified becoming a major hurricane on two occasions karl peaked as a strong category 4 hurricane on saffir simpson hurricane scale on september 21 with 145 mph 230 km h winds it weakened as it moved northward becoming extratropical on september 24 in north atlantic before it was absorbed by another system on september 28 extratropical storm affected faroe islands but no damage was reported there nor were there any fatalities meteorological history karl originated in a strong tropical wave that moved off coast of africa on september 13 wave gradually became better organized and it was declared tropical depression twelve about 670 miles 1 080 km west southwest of cape verde islands on morning of september 16 as it headed westward in open tropical atlantic following periphery of subtropical ridge that afternoon depression continued to rapidly organize and was upgraded to tropical storm karl due to healthy outflow around an upper level anticyclone over karl and a favorable environment with warmest sea surface temperatures of year rapid deepening began on evening of september 17 with storm developing a small eye and being upgraded to hurricane karl with water around and low wind shear cyclone continued to rapidly intensify on morning of september 18 intensity leveled off somewhat that afternoon as a strong category 2 hurricane with winds of 110 mph 175 km h late in evening of september 18 karl attained category 3 status becoming sixth major hurricane of 2004 on september 19 karl continued to strengthen maintaining a well defined eye and strengthening late that day into a category 4 hurricane with winds of 135 mph 215 km h and a minimum pressure of 948 mbar early on september 20 storm weakened slightly as a result of an eyewall replacement cycle weakening back to a strong category 3 hurricane at this time karl began to turn sharply northward into a weakness in subtropical ridge after intensification stopped on september 20 due to eyewall cycle and slightly increased wind shear karl quickly restrengthened that evening over very warm water and early on september 21 reached its peak intensity as a powerful category 4 hurricane with 145 mph 230 km h winds and a minimum central pressure of 938 mbar that morning as karl was moving northward another eyewall replacement cycle began to take place and vertical shear increased again weakening storm temporarily trend continued into evening and storm weakened to a category 2 hurricane by early on september 22 weakening trend slowed down and eventually leveled off that afternoon with karl remaining a category 2 hurricane as storm turned towards north northeast late that evening karl began to restrengthen once again as wind shear diminished intensification continued into morning of september 23 as karl became a major hurricane a second time reaching a final peak of 125 mph 205 km h winds thumb hurricane karl becoming extratropical on september 24 cooler waters and increased shear soon prevailed however and storm quickly weakened dropping to a category 1 hurricane by late that evening as low level circulation became detached from mid level circulation due to strong southwesterly vertical wind shear early on september 24 karl continued its north northeast track over open north central atlantic and continued to gradually weaken it started to come in contact with baroclinic zone and began to lose tropical characteristics while still a category 1 hurricane karl became extratropical shortly afterward over northern atlantic at about with its winds dropping below hurricane strength shortly thereafter extratropical storm made landfall on faroe islands with hurricane force wind gusts as an extratropical low cyclone moved northeastward and eastward across north atlantic ocean and north sea eventually reaching norway before it was absorbed into another extratropical low late on september 28 impact karl made landfall on norway as an extratropical storm with sustained winds near 70 mph 110 km h and with wind gusts up to 89 mph 144 km h no damages or deaths were reported and no ships came directly into contact with karl strongest winds reported were from ship rotterdam which reported 52 mph 83 km h sustained winds in north atlantic while karl was a category 1 storm in extratropical transition see also list of category 4 atlantic hurricanes hurricane kate 2003 hurricane maria 2005 hurricane katia 2011 hurricane lorenzo 2019 references external links nhc s on hurricane karl karl 2004 karl 2004 karl 2004 karl 2004
