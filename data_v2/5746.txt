brown commented that paltrow brought a massive spark to what could have been a one note role and her co author kevin fallon wrote that her energetic performance saved an episode that might have been in shambles without her presence robert canning of ign noted that paltrow s casting could have been distracting but instead she fit role seamlessly brett berk of vanity fair found her surprisingly great and james poniewozik of time stated that while her casting was somewhat distracting she was able to make holly a sympathetic character without overdoing her neediness and commitment phobia however national alliance on mental illness nami took exception paltrow s history classroom scene where she role plays as mary todd lincoln which it stated mocked and trivialized bipolar disorder several critics preferred paltrow s return in sexy installment to her initial appearance washington post emily yahr felt that she was better integrated into this episode and raymund flandez of wall street journal called her return infinitely better than her first appearance back then she was a puzzle a loony bin here she s sly and quick witted appropriately adult and seductively saucy in an episode that showcased more of her comedic timing than her stiff dance skills all better for us fallon wrote that paltrow was if possible even sassier and than before and felt that she served to anchor a busy episode in contrast sandra gonzalez of entertainment weekly had mixed feelings about holly and believed that she dominated screen time vanderwerff liked paltrow s acting but disliked holly s interaction with will saying they lacked chemistry soraya roberts of daily news disliked her return for prolonging will and emma s separation branding holly a home wrecker she commented that while paltrow s appearance in substitute was relatively fresh in sexy she was acting almost like a cardboard cutout version of her former self overly enunciating her lines and treading carefully around her choreography poniewozik found all of paltrow s scenes labored and ridiculous and wrote that actress failed to bring an element of realism to her character canning said that moment she came on screen whole episode lit up and episode was a fun and funny showcase for everybody s favorite recurring character and futterman echoed him when she called paltrow our new favorite cast member

following glee cover with sales rising 94 in a week most reviewers agreed that performance of do you wanna touch me oh yeah was sexy benigno was one of these and was entertained by number but he thought holly s vocals seem oddly subdued trying to imitate joan jett s voice and gave it a b grade gonzalez gave same grade and also took issue with vocals though she enjoyed energy futterman had a different view of singing and said that holly can t quite muster jett s vocal power berk gave song four stars out of five and noted amazing hairography while roberts called performance a leather clad

and commended it visually and vocally he noted that paltrow lacks adele s veracity futterman named it her least favorite of paltrow s covers to date and said that her vocals lacked texture that made adele s version so heartbreaking gonzalez gave performance her lowest grade of episode a b and semigran opined that while paltrow is a nice enough singer she in no way has chops piece requires mcnutt
