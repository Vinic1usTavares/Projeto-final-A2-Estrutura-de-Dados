operation brevity was a limited offensive conducted in mid may 1941 during western desert campaign of second world war conceived by commander in chief of british middle east command general archibald wavell brevity was intended to be a rapid blow against weak axis front line forces in sollum capuzzo bardia area of border between egypt and libya although operation got off to a promising start throwing axis high command into confusion most of its early gains were lost to local counter attacks and with german reinforcements being rushed to front operation was called off after one day egypt had been invaded by libyan based italian forces in september 1940 but by february of following year a british counter offensive had advanced well into libya destroying italian tenth army in process british attention then shifted to greece which was under threat of axis invasion while allied divisions were being diverted from north africa italians reinforced their positions and were supported by arrival of german afrika korps under generalleutnant erwin rommel rapidly taking offensive against his distracted and over stretched opponent by april 1941 rommel had driven british and commonwealth forces in cyrenaica back across egyptian border although battlefront now lay in border area port city of tobruk inside libya had resisted axis advance and its substantial australian and british garrison constituted a significant threat to rommel s lengthy supply chain he therefore committed his main strength to besieging city leaving front line only thinly held wavell defined operation brevity s main objectives as acquisition of territory from which to launch a further planned offensive toward tobruk and depletion of german and italian forces in region with limited battle ready units to draw on in wake of rommel s recent successes on 15 may brigadier william gott attacked in three columns with a mixed infantry and armoured force strategically important halfaya pass was taken against stiff italian opposition and deeper inside libya fort capuzzo was captured but german counter attacks under colonel maximilian von herff regained fort during afternoon causing heavy casualties amongst its defenders gott concerned that his forces were in danger of being caught by german armour in open ground conducted a staged withdrawal to halfaya pass on 16 may and brevity was closed down importance of halfaya pass as a safe supply route was highlighted to rommel and 11 days later it was recaptured during operation skorpion a german counter attack background in early september 1940 italian 10th army based in libya conducted italian invasion of egypt and three months later british and commonwealth troops of western desert force began a counter offensive codenamed operation compass in two months british advanced occupying italian province of cyrenaica and destroying 10th army advance was halted in february 1941 because of supply shortages and to give priority to battle of greece renamed xiii corps and reorganised under hq cyrenaica command troops of former western desert force adopted a defensive posture over next few months hq cyrenaica lost its commander lieutenant general sir henry maitland wilson followed by 2nd new zealand division and 6th australian division when they were sent to greece in operation lustre 7th armoured division with virtually no serviceable tanks left was also withdrawn and sent to nile delta for rest and refitting wilson was replaced by lieutenant general philip neame parts of 2nd armoured division and 9th australian division were deployed to cyrenaica but both formations were inexperienced ill equipped and in case of 2nd armoured division well under strength after detachments to greece thumb left alt a four

and 102nd motorised to north africa from february 1941 until early may operation sonnenblume saw arrival of german afrika korps in tripoli to reinforce their italian allies commanded by generalleutnant erwin rommel and consisting of 5th light and 15th panzer division afrika korps was to block allied attempts to drive italians out of region rommel seized on weakness of his opponents and without waiting for his forces fully to assemble rapidly went on offensive during march and april remaining units of 2nd armoured division were destroyed as axis forces advanced which also forced british and commonwealth forces into retreat neame and general officer commanding british troops egypt lieutenant general richard o connor were captured and british command structure had to be reorganised hq cyrenaica was dissolved on 14 april and its command functions taken over by a new hq western desert force lieutenant general noel beresford peirse 9th australian infantry division fell back to fortress port of tobruk and remaining british forces withdrew a further east to sollum on libyan egyptian border with main axis force conducting siege of tobruk a small battlegroup kampfgruppe commanded by colonel maximilian von herff continued to press eastward capturing fort capuzzo and bardia in passing it then advanced into egypt by end of april had taken sollum and tactically important halfaya pass rommel garrisoned these positions reinforced kampfgruppe and ordered it onto defensive tobruk garrison received supplies from royal navy and rommel was unable to take port this failure was significant his front line positions at sollum were at end of an extended supply chain that stretched back to tripoli and was threatened by tobruk garrison substantial commitment required to invest tobruk prevented him from building up his forces at sollum making further advances into egypt impractical by maintaining possession of tobruk allies had regained initiative prelude right thumb

battlefield over which operation brevity was fought general archibald wavell commander in chief of british middle east command conceived operation brevity as a rapid blow in sollum area wavell intended to create advantageous conditions from which to launch operation battleaxe main offensive that he was planning for june operation brevity s primary objectives were to recapture halfaya pass to drive enemy from sollum and capuzzo areas and to deplete rommel s forces a secondary objective was to advance toward tobruk although only as far as supplies would allow and without risking force committed to operation allied force operation brevity would be carried out by 22nd guards brigade and elements of 7th armoured division its armoured component consisted of 29 cruiser tanks of 2nd royal tank regiment 2rtr and 24 infantry tanks of 4th royal tank regiment 4rtr royal air force raf allocated all available fighters and a small force of bombers to operation left thumb alt several tanks parked on sandy desert surface british cruiser mk iv foreground and matilda infantry tanks brigadier william gott in command of all allied front line forces since retreat was to lead operation

en route this group included three small mobile forces jock columns of 7th support group cruiser tanks of 2rtr and armoured cars of 11th hussars whose task was to patrol open desert on left flank and monitor sidi azeiz bardia road in centre 22nd guards brigade group was to clear top of halfaya pass secure bir wair musaid and fort capuzzo and conduct a company sized probe toward bardia group included two infantry formations 1st battalion durham light infantry and 2nd battalion scots guards and infantry tanks of 4rtr in north coast group was to advance along coast road capturing lower

positioned on desert plateau it included 30 50 tanks of 2nd battalion panzer regiment 5 an italian motorised infantry battalion of trento division and supporting arms front line area around halfaya pass was defended by two companies of bersaglieri well trained italian motorised infantry with artillery support on 9 may germans intercepted a british weather report over radio afrika korps war diary noted that in past such reports had always been issued prior to important enemy offensives to capture sidi barrani bardi tobruk and gebel rommel s response was to strengthen eastern side of his cordon around tobruk as a precaution against sorties from garrison and to order kampfgruppe von herff to adopt a more aggressive posture on 13 may axis aircraft bombed british tank concentrations and herff expected an imminent british attack however following day aircraft were unable to locate british and it was reported that enemy intentions to attack were not known battle on 13 may wavell s infantry battalions began to concentrate at their start lines followed by tank regiments during early hours of 15 may at 06 00 three columns began their advance supported overhead by a standing patrol of hawker hurricane fighters centre column reaching top of halfaya pass 22nd guards brigade group ran into heavy opposition from an italian bersaglieri infantry company supported by anti tank guns under command of colonel ugo montemurro this unit fought tenaciously doing much to repair poor impression rommel had of his italian allies opening fire upon attacking british tanks bersaglieri found their anti tank guns to be unable to penetrate armour of matilda infantry tanks at gunners shifted targets now aiming at tracks and when tanks raised up crossing low stone walls and rocks seven tanks were disabled for his conduct during this action rommel recommended that montemurro be awarded iron cross first class at cost of these seven tanks position was taken by c squadron 4rtr and g company 2nd

squadron 4rtr and reinforced by a and b companies 1dli eventually took position d company 1dli which had been in reserve during attack then made a wide left hook to capture a small landing ground to north of fort in afternoon one company of 2nd scots guards probed toward bardia infantry coming under heavy machine gun fire from three positions as they neared sollum barracks a group of universal carriers commanded by sergeant f riley charged gun positions and quickly neutralised them but one carrier was disabled when group was subsequently engaged by anti tank guns riley executed a second charge silencing these too and taking their crews prisoner his carrier was hit three times for his actions riley was awarded military medal battalion s first decoration of war desert column on desert flank 2rtr advanced with 7th armoured brigade group during morning reports were received of up to 30 german armoured vehicles operating nearby and a squadron 2rtr moved to investigate most of german force had pulled back but three tanks were located and brought under fire one panzer iv was disabled and other two driven off for loss of one british tank due to mechanical failure a second force of 15 german tanks was engaged by two tanks of no 2 troop destroying a panzer iii and forcing remainder to withdraw by midday brigade group had reached a position west of fort capuzzo and in afternoon nine remaining cruisers of a squadron 2rtr began a reconnaissance patrol towards sidi azeiz coastal column advance along coastal road which lacked tank support was held up all morning by determined italian resistance at bottom of halfaya pass this objective was finally achieved toward evening when s company 2nd rifle brigade supported by australian anti tank gunners fighting as infantry overran italian positions taking around 130 prisoners axis reactions although german and italian commands in north africa knew that a british offensive was imminent operation brevity nevertheless caught them unprepared and rommel recorded in his diary that initial attacks had caused him considerable losses by midday on 15 may axis command was showing signs of confusion it was erroneously believed that offensive involved more than 100 tanks and repeated requests were made to both luftwaffe and regia aeronautica for a concerted effort to defeat it forces around tobruk were redeployed east of besieged city to block any attempt at relief and to prevent garrison from breaking out to meet british advance lieutenant colonel hans cramer was sent to reinforce kampfgruppe von herff with a tank battalion from panzer regiment 8 and a battery of anti aircraft guns and additional reinforcements under general hans karl freiherr von were despatched following day left thumb alt several tanks advance to right across brush covered desert a panzer ii right and a panzer iii left main tanks in use by afrika korps during 1941 advance across open desert germans concentrated their riposte against central

1dli at landing ground was overrun and with no anti tank support more capable than boys anti tank rifle remaining troops of 1dli were forced to fall back toward musaid a fortuitous dust cloud aided their withdrawal but by 14 45 panzer regiment 5 was reporting that it had recaptured capuzzo inflicting heavy casualties on british and taking 70 prisoners on desert flank a squadron 2rtr s patrol toward sidi azeiz was being monitored by panzer regiment 5 but germans misidentified light cruiser tanks as heavily armoured matilda infantry tanks and reported that an attack was not possible herff believing british had two divisions operating in area had grown uneasy a squadron s patrol was interpreted as an attempt to concentrate south of sidi azeiz in preparation for a thrust north next day such a move threatened to sweep aside herff s force and completely unhinge german front in sollum bardia area in response herff broke contact with british his plan was to join up with cramer s panzer regiment 8 to mount a concentrated counter attack following morning british withdrawal right thumb alt several hills dominate mostly barren landscape in foreground a road moves from foreground into a

ordered to remain west of fort capuzzo for time being cramer s reinforcements arrived in sidi azeiz area at 03 00 and reached fort capuzzo at 06 30 at around 08 00 he made contact with kampfgruppe von herff but by mid morning both groups had run out of fuel german advance resumed at 16 00 before being stopped by around 17 tanks of 2rtr british reported one german tank set alight and another disabled and that an advance of up to fifty tanks had been halted while germans believed that they had repulsed a strong british tank attack as nightfall approached herff broke off action and went on to defensive he intended to repair his damaged machines reorganise and resume offensive operations on 18 may 2rtr pulled back to bir el khireigat initially followed by two german tanks one of which withdrew after other was destroyed regiment arrived at bir el khireigat from where it had set out two days previously at around 02 30 on 17 may aftermath operation brevity failed to achieve most of its objectives succeeding only in retaking halfaya pass british lost five tanks destroyed and a further 13 were damaged but tank regiments suffered no losses in personnel total casualties amounted to at least 206 men 1st durham light infantry suffered most during operation losing 196 men killed wounded or captured 2nd scots guards lost one man killed and four wounded 3rd coldstream guards lost one man killed and 11th hussars suffered four men wounded losses among 2nd rifle brigade are unknown german casualties numbered three tanks a panzer ii and two panzer iiis although several more suffered minor damage and 258 men killed wounded or captured jack greene and alessandro massignani place total italian losses at 395 allied accounts record capture of 347 of these men on 5 august herff praised bersaglieri who had defended halfaya pass with lionlike courage until last man against stronger enemy forces greatest part of them died faithful to flag lieutenant giacinto cova a platoon commander in 8th bersaglieri regiment received a posthumous gold medal of military valour italy s highest award for bravery medal citation reported that cova had organised a counter attack and was killed attempting to throw a hand held bomb at a british tank british received plaudits from winston churchill who sent a telegram to wavell betraying his ignorance of events by stating without using tiger cubs you have taken offensive advanced captured halfaya and sollum taken 500 german prisoners and inflicted heavy losses in men and tanks for this twenty i tanks and 1 000 or 1 500 casualties do not seem too heavy a cost churchill ended message by asking wavell what are your dates for bringing tiger cubs into action in reference to reinforcements that had arrived at alexandria on 12 may as part of a convoy code named operation tiger 11th hussar s regimental history notes that it was clear that no further offensive action would be possible before 7 th arm division was fully prepared tiger convoy brought 238 tanks and made it possible to refit 7th armoured division which had been out of action since february as a result of losses it sustained during operation compass preparations could now be made for operation battleaxe and relief of tobruk in system of british and commonwealth battle honours units that served in halfaya pass area between 15 and 27 may were awarded honour halfaya 1941 in 1957 historian thomas jentz suggests that brevity could have ended in victory for british while their tank forces were fighting ineffectively gutsy actions by 2rtr and their patrol toward sidi azeiz had convinced germans that battle was lost by evening of 15 may because of their failure to engage 2rtr late that day several german commanders from panzer regiment 5 including its commanding officer were removed from their posts after battle jentz notes that a feint by 1st and 7th rtr out of tobruk might have caused a realignment of axis forces weakening their overall position and perhaps even forcing them to give up sollum area operation brevity highlighted to rommel importance of halfaya pass whichever side held it would have a comparatively safe route for his supplies during offensives in area on 27 may he launched operation skorpion during which herff recaptured pass and reversed last british territorial gain from brevity see also operation brevity order of battle north
