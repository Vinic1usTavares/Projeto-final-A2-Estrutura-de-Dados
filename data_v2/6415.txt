south into australian and new zealand waters american fleet numbered 675 ships and lord howe was located in a region known as middle ground noted for sperm whales and southern right whales eubalaena australis island was subsequently visited by many government and whaling ships sailing between new south wales and norfolk island and across pacific including many from american whaling fleet so its reputation as a provisioning port preceded settlement with some ships leaving goats and pigs on island as food for future visitors between july and october 1791 third fleet ships arrived at sydney and

george ashdown james bishop and chapman who were employed by a sydney whaling firm to establish a supply station men were initially to provide meat by fishing and by raising pigs and goats from feral stock they landed with or acquired from a visiting ship their maori wives and two maori boys huts were built in an area now known as old settlement which had a supply of fresh water and a garden was established west of blinky beach this was a cashless society settlers bartered their stores of water wood vegetables meat fish and bird feathers for clothes tea sugar tools tobacco and other commodities not available on island but it was whalers valuation that had to be accepted these first settlers eventually left island when they were bought out for ps350 in september 1841 by

was discovered on mainland australia where crews would abandon their ships preferring to dig for gold than to risk their lives at sea as a consequence many vessels avoided mainland and lord howe island experienced an increasing trade which peaked between 1855 and 1857 in 1851 about 16 people were living on island vegetable crops now included potatoes carrots maize pumpkin taro watermelon and

assistant william carron who forwarded plant specimens to ferdinand mueller at botanic gardens in melbourne who by 1875 had catalogued and published 195 species also on ship was william fitzgerald a surveyor and mr masters from australian museum together they surveyed island with findings published in 1870 when population was listed as 35 people their 13 houses built of split palm battens thatched on roof and sides with palm leaves see around this time a downturn of trade began with demise of whaling industry and sometimes six to 12 months passed without a vessel calling with provisions rotting in storehouses older families lost interest in market gardening from 1860 to 1872 43 ships had collected provisions but from 1873 to 1887 fewer than a dozen had done so this prompted some activity from mainland in 1876 a government report on island was submitted by surveyor william fitzgerald based on a visit in same year he suggested that coffee be grown but kentia palm was already catching world attention in 1878 island was declared a forest reserve and captain richard armstrong became first resident government administrator he encouraged schools tree planting and palm trade dynamited north passage to lagoon and built roads he also managed to upset residents and parliamentarian john wilson was sent from mainland in april 1882 to investigate situation with

migrating past island of lord howe are much smaller than those migrating along australian continent historically migratory whales such as blue fin and sei whales were very abundant in island waters but were severely reduced in numbers to near extinction by commercial and illegal hunts including mass illegal hunts by soviet union and japan in 1960s to 1970s southern right and sperm whales were

about 10 of lord howe island s forests has been cleared for agriculture and another 20 has been disturbed mostly by domestic cattle and feral sheep goats and pigs as a result 70 of island remains relatively untouched with a variety of plants and animals many of which are endemic and some of which are rare or threatened see two species of plants nine terrestrial birds one bat and at least four

1981 lord howe island amendment act proclaimed a permanent park preserve over north and south ends of island administration of preserve was outlined in a management plan for sustainable development of island prepared by nsw national parks and wildlife service which has a ranger stationed on island island was cited under unesco world heritage list in 1982 offshore environmental assets are protected by lord howe island marine park this consists of a state marine park managed by marine parks authority of new south wales in waters out to three nautical miles around island and including ball s pyramid it also includes a commonwealth marine park extending from 3 to 12 nautical miles out and managed by federal department of environment and heritage in total marine park covers about feral animals and plants pigs and goats were released on island as potential food in early 1800s goats destroyed shrubs and grasses used as nesting sites and pigs ate eggs and chicks and disturbed land by rooting for food several birds have become extinct on island since arrival of humans first round of extinctions included lord howe swamphen or white gallinule white throated pigeon red crowned parakeet and tasman booby which were eliminated by visitors and settlers during 19th century either from overhunting for food or protection of crops black rats were released from provisioning whaling ships in 1840s and mice from norfolk island in 1860 in 1918 black rat was accidentally introduced with shipwreck of ss makambo which ran aground at ned s beach this triggered a second wave of extinctions including vinous tinted thrush robust white eye lord howe starling lord howe fantail and lord howe gerygone as well as destruction of native and decimation of palm fruits bounties were offered for rat and pig tails and ratting became a popular pursuit subsequent poisoning programs have kept populations low lord howe boobook may have become extinct through predation by or competition with tasmanian masked owls which were introduced in 1920s in a failed attempt to control rat population stray dogs are also a threat as they could harm native woodhen and other birds invasive plants such as crofton weed and formosa lily occur in inaccessible areas and probably cannot be eradicated but others are currently being managed in 1995 first action was taken to control spread of introduced plants of island chiefly ground asparagus and bridal creeper but also cherry guava madeira vine cotoneaster and this has been followed by weeding tours and formation of friends of lord howe island group in 2000 programs have also been started to remove weeds from private properties and revegetate some formerly cultivated areas an environmental unit was created by board and it includes a flora management officer and a permanent weed officer weeds have been mapped and an eradication program is in place supported by improved education and quarantine procedures despite large number of introduced species that harm lord howe s native flora and fauna feral pigs and cats were eradicated by early 2000s goat population has been reduced to just a few animals and efforts are ongoing to control rodents and introduced plants in july 2012 australian federal environment minister tony burke and new south wales environment minister robyn parker announced that australian and nsw governments would each contribute 50 of estimated a 9 million cost of implementing a rodent eradication plan for island using aerial deployment of poison baits plan was put to a local vote and is

being at risk to effects of global warming on australia and same analysis applies to reefs of lord howe island see cool climate flora and fauna are at risk from rises in temperature because scope for
