episode titles utilize terminology from chess and game appears throughout series see list of last exile episodes for details on specific chess terms that are used conceptual designs were created by range murata who was given complete freedom to create setting he began drawing detailed sketches of machines and everyday objects from a daily newspaper his research was given no constraints with exception of production deadlines gonzo initially intended for last exile to be shown in a space setting but producers did not want characters to wear sterile space suits instead final product was described by jonathan mays as an ugly world of rusting bolts lots of blues and grays murata believed design took course story had laid out his character conceptualization included a great amount of time spent on costume design wanting to portray each character s personality more fully he tried to draw in kind of material that would have been used in creating their clothes and try to represent stitches connecting fabric in contrast to crewmembers of battleship silvana who wear modern and utilitarian uniforms other characters wear traditionally aristocratic attire high amount of attention was given to character animation animators especially experienced difficulties with alex row s hair and flowing cape production of last exile relied heavily on 3d computer animation of 350 shots used in first episode more than 200 included computer generated animation in comparison gonzo s previous work used an average of 40 to 50 computer generated shots per episode animation was also supplemented with victorian era flourishes in order to combine hand drawn animation with computer generated ones production team used a technique for non photorealistic rendering which could not be used for blue submarine no 6 because of a stylistic conflict at 2003 anime expo maeda who also worked with studio ghibli s production of castle in sky commented that last exile is very advanced in how it will incorporate two mediums historical references real world historical designs were also adapted for fictional world flying battleships of anatoray and disith nations included components of japanese dreadnoughts in commission at turn of twentieth century uniform designs for anatoray s musketeers were based on napoleon bonaparte s army and american civil war soldiers on other hand soviet
