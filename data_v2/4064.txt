forensic chemistry is application of chemistry and its subfield forensic toxicology in a legal setting a forensic chemist can assist in identification of unknown materials found at a crime scene specialists in this field have a wide array of methods and instruments to help identify unknown substances these include high performance liquid chromatography gas chromatography mass spectrometry atomic absorption spectroscopy fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and thin layer chromatography range of different methods is important due to destructive nature of some instruments and number of possible unknown substances that can be found at a scene forensic chemists prefer using nondestructive methods first to preserve evidence and to determine which destructive methods will produce best results along with other forensic specialists forensic chemists commonly testify in court as expert witnesses regarding their findings forensic chemists follow a set of standards that have been proposed by various agencies and governing bodies including scientific working group on analysis of seized drugs in addition to standard operating procedures proposed by group specific agencies have their own standards regarding quality assurance and quality control of their results and their instruments to ensure accuracy of what they are reporting forensic chemists routinely check and verify that their instruments are working correctly and are still able to detect and measure various quantities of different substances role in investigations thumb left upright alt aftermath of oklahoma city bombing chemists were able to identify explosive anfo at scene of oklahoma city bombing forensic chemists analysis can provide leads for investigators and they can confirm or refute their suspicions identification of various substances found at scene can tell investigators what to look for during their search during fire investigations forensic chemists can determine if an accelerant such as gasoline or kerosene was used if so this suggests that fire was intentionally set forensic chemists can also narrow down suspect list to people who would have access to substance used in a crime for example in explosive investigations identification of rdx or c 4 would indicate a military connection as those substances are military grade explosives on other hand identification of tnt would create a wider suspect list since it is used by demolition companies as well as in military during poisoning investigations detection of specific poisons can give detectives an idea of what to look for when they are interviewing potential suspects for example an investigation that involves ricin would tell investigators to look for ricin s precursors seeds of castor oil plant forensic chemists also help to confirm or refute investigators suspicions in drug or alcohol cases instruments used by forensic chemists can detect minute quantities and accurate measurement can be important in crimes such as driving under influence as there are specific blood alcohol content cutoffs where penalties begin or increase in suspected overdose cases quantity of drug found in person s system can confirm or rule out overdose as cause of death history early history thumb upright right alt refer to caption a bottle of strychnine extract was once easily obtainable in apothecaries throughout history a variety of poisons have been used to commit murder including arsenic nightshade hemlock strychnine and curare until early 19th century there were no methods to accurately determine if a particular chemical was present and poisoners were rarely punished for their crimes in 1836 one of first major contributions to forensic chemistry was introduced by british chemist james marsh he created marsh test for arsenic detection which was subsequently used successfully in a murder trial it was also during this time that forensic toxicology began to be recognized as a distinct field mathieu orfila father of toxicology made great advancements to field during early 19th century a pioneer in development of forensic microscopy orfila contributed to advancement of this method for detection of blood and semen orfila was also first chemist to successfully classify different chemicals into categories such as narcotics and next advancement in detection of poisons came in 1850 when a valid method for detecting vegetable alkaloids in human tissue was created by chemist jean stas stas s method was quickly adopted and used successfully in court to convict count hippolyte de of murdering his brother in law by nicotine poisoning stas was able to successfully isolate alkaloid from organs of victim stas s protocol was subsequently altered to incorporate tests for caffeine quinine morphine strychnine atropine and opium wide range of instrumentation for forensic chemical analysis also began to be developed during this time period early 19th century saw invention of spectroscope by joseph von fraunhofer in 1859 chemist robert bunsen and physicist gustav kirchhoff expanded on fraunhofer s invention their experiments with spectroscopy showed that specific substances created a unique spectrum when exposed to specific wavelengths of light using spectroscopy two scientists were able to identify substances based on their spectrum providing a method of identification for unknown materials in 1906 botanist mikhail invented paper chromatography an early predecessor to thin layer chromatography and used it to separate and examine plant proteins that make up chlorophyll ability to separate mixtures into their individual components allows forensic chemists to examine parts of an unknown material against a database of known products by matching retention factors for separated components with known values materials can be identified modernization thumb left alt a gas chromatography mass spectrometry instrument that can be used to determine identify of unknown chemicals a gc ms unit with doors open gas chromatograph is on right and mass spectrometer is on left modern forensic chemists rely on numerous instruments to identify unknown materials found at a crime scene 20th century saw many advancements in technology that allowed chemists to detect smaller amounts of material more accurately first major advancement in this century came during 1930s with invention of a spectrometer that could measure signal produced with infrared ir light early ir spectrometers used a and could only measure light absorption in a very narrow wavelength band it was not until coupling of an interferometer with an ir spectrometer in 1949 by peter fellgett that complete infrared spectrum could be measured at once fellgett also used fourier transform a mathematical method that can break down a signal into its individual frequencies to make sense of enormous amount of data received from complete infrared analysis of a material since then fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir instruments have become critical in forensic analysis of unknown material because they are nondestructive and extremely quick to use spectroscopy was further advanced in 1955 with invention of modern atomic absorption aa by alan walsh aa analysis can detect specific elements that make up a sample along with their concentrations allowing for easy detection of heavy metals such as arsenic and cadmium advancements in field of chromatography arrived in 1953 with invention of gas chromatograph by anthony t james and archer john porter martin allowing for separation of volatile liquid mixtures with components which have similar boiling points nonvolatile liquid mixtures could be separated with liquid chromatography but substances with similar retention times could not be resolved until invention of high performance liquid chromatography hplc by csaba horvath in 1970 modern hplc instruments are capable of detecting and resolving substances whose concentrations are as low as parts per trillion one of most important advancements in forensic chemistry came in 1955 with invention of gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms by fred and roland coupling of a gas chromatograph with a mass spectrometer allowed for identification of a wide range of substances gc ms analysis is widely considered gold standard for forensic analysis due to its sensitivity and versatility along with its ability to quantify amount of substance present increase in sensitivity of instrumentation has advanced to point that minute impurities within compounds can be detected potentially allowing investigators to trace chemicals to a specific batch and lot from a manufacturer methods forensic chemists rely on a multitude of instruments to identify unknown substances found at a scene different methods can be used to determine identity of same substance and it is up to examiner to determine which method will produce best results factors that forensic chemists might consider when performing an examination are length of time a specific instrument will take to examine a substance and destructive nature of that instrument they prefer using nondestructive methods first to preserve evidence for further examination nondestructive techniques can also be used to narrow down possibilities making it more likely that correct method will be used first time when a destructive method is used spectroscopy thumb left alt refer to caption atr ftir spectrum for hexane showing percent transmittance t versus cm 1 two main standalone spectroscopy techniques for forensic chemistry are ftir and aa spectroscopy ftir is a nondestructive process that uses infrared light to identify a substance attenuated total reflectance sampling technique eliminates need for substances to be prepared before analysis combination of and zero preparation makes atr ftir analysis a quick and easy first step in analysis of unknown substances to facilitate positive identification of substance ftir instruments are loaded with databases that can be searched for known spectra that match unknown s spectra ftir analysis of mixtures while not impossible presents specific difficulties due to cumulative nature of response when analyzing an unknown that contains more than one substance resulting spectra will be a combination of individual spectra of each component while common mixtures have known spectra on file novel mixtures can be difficult to resolve making ftir an unacceptable means of identification however instrument can be used to determine general chemical structures present allowing forensic chemists to determine best method for analysis with other instruments for example a methoxy group will result in a peak between 3 030 and 2 950 cm 1 atomic absorption spectroscopy aas is a destructive technique that is able to determine elements that make up analyzed sample aas performs this analysis by subjecting sample to an extremely high heat source breaking atomic bonds of substance leaving free atoms radiation in form of light is then passed through sample forcing atoms to jump to a higher energy state forensic chemists can test for each element by using a corresponding wavelength of light that forces that element s atoms to a higher energy state during analysis for this reason and due to destructive nature of this method aas is generally used as a confirmatory technique after preliminary tests have indicated presence of a specific element in sample concentration of element in sample is proportional to amount of light absorbed when compared to a blank sample aas is useful in cases of suspected heavy metal poisoning such as with arsenic lead mercury and cadmium concentration of substance in sample can indicate whether heavy metals were cause of death chromatography thumb right alt refer to caption hplc readout of an excedrin tablet peaks from left to right are acetaminophen aspirin and caffeine spectroscopy techniques are useful when sample being tested is pure or a very common mixture when an unknown mixture is being analyzed it must be broken down into its individual parts chromatography techniques can be used to break apart mixtures into their components allowing for each part to be analyzed separately thin layer chromatography tlc is a quick alternative to more complex chromatography methods tlc can be used to analyze inks and dyes by extracting individual components this can be used to investigate notes or fibers left at scene since each company s product is slightly different and those differences can be seen with tlc only limiting factor with tlc analysis is necessity for components to be soluble in whatever solution is used to carry components up analysis plate this solution is called mobile phase forensic chemist can compare unknowns with known standards by looking at distance each component traveled this distance when compared to starting point is known as retention factor rf for each extracted component if each rf value matches a known sample that is an indication of unknown s identity high performance liquid chromatography can be used to extract individual components from a mixture dissolved in a solution hplc is used for nonvolatile mixtures that would not be suitable for gas chromatography this is useful in drug analysis where pharmaceutical is a combination drug since components would separate or elute at different times allowing for verification of each component from hplc column are then fed into various detectors that produce a peak on a graph relative to its concentration as it off column most common type of detector is an ultraviolet visible spectrometer as most common item of interest tested with hplc pharmaceuticals have uv absorbance gas chromatography gc performs same function as liquid chromatography but it is used for volatile mixtures in forensic chemistry most common gc instruments use mass spectrometry as their detector gc ms can be used in investigations of arson poisoning and explosions to determine exactly what was used in theory gc ms instruments can detect substances whose concentrations are in range however in practice due to signal to noise ratios and other limiting factors such as age of individual parts of instrument practical detection limit for gc ms is in picogram range gc ms is also capable of quantifying substances it detects chemists can use this information to determine effect substance would have on an individual gc ms instruments need around 1 000 times more of substance to quantify amount than they need simply to detect it limit of quantification is typically in range forensic toxicology forensic toxicology is study of pharmacodynamics or what a substance does to body and pharmacokinetics or what body does to substance to accurately determine effect a particular drug has on human body forensic toxicologists must be aware of various levels of drug tolerance that an individual can build up as well as therapeutic index for various pharmaceuticals toxicologists are tasked with determining whether any toxin found in a body was cause of or contributed to an incident or whether it was at too low a level to have had an effect while determination of specific toxin can be time consuming due to number of different substances that can cause injury or death certain clues can narrow down possibilities for example carbon monoxide poisoning would result in bright red blood while death from hydrogen sulfide poisoning would cause brain to have a green hue toxicologists are also aware of different metabolites that a specific drug could break down into inside body for example a toxicologist can confirm that a person took heroin by presence in a sample of 6 which only comes from breakdown of heroin constant creation of new drugs both legal and illicit forces toxicologists to keep themselves apprised of new research and methods to test for these novel substances stream of new formulations means that a negative test result does not necessarily rule out drugs to avoid detection illicit drug manufacturers frequently change chemicals structure slightly these compounds are often not detected by routine toxicology tests and can be masked by presence of a known compound in same sample as new compounds are discovered known spectra are determined and entered into databases that can be downloaded and used as reference standards laboratories also tend to keep in house databases for substances they find locally standards swgdrug analysis categories category a category b category c infrared spectroscopy mass spectrometry nuclear spectroscopy raman spectroscopy x ray capillary electrophoresis gas chromatography ion mobility spectrometry liquid chromatography microcrystalline tests pharmaceutical identifiers thin layer chromatography cannabis only macroscopic examination color tests fluorescence spectroscopy immunoassay melting point analysis ultraviolet spectroscopy guidelines have been set up by various governing bodies regarding standards that are followed by practicing forensic scientists for forensic chemists international scientific working group for analysis of seized drugs swgdrug presents recommendations for quality assurance and quality control of tested materials in identification of unknown samples protocols have been grouped into three categories based on probability for false positives instruments and protocols in category a are considered best for uniquely identifying an unknown material followed by categories b and then c to ensure accuracy of identifications swgdrug recommends that multiple tests using different instruments be performed on each sample and that one category a technique and at least one other technique be used if a category a technique is not available or forensic chemist decides not to use one swgdrug recommends that at least three techniques be used two of which must be from category b combination instruments such as gc ms are considered two separate tests as long as results are compared to known values individually for example gc elution times would be compared to known values along with ms spectra if both of those match a known substance no further tests are needed standards and controls are necessary in quality control of various instruments used to test samples due to nature of their work in legal system chemists must ensure that their instruments are working accurately to do this known controls are tested consecutively with unknown samples by comparing readouts of controls with their known profiles instrument can be confirmed to have been working properly at time unknowns were tested standards are also used to determine instrument s limit of detection and limit of quantification for various common substances calculated quantities must be above limit of detection to be confirmed as present and above limit of quantification to be quantified if value is below limit value is not considered reliable testimony standardized procedures for testimony by forensic chemists are provided by various agencies that employ scientists as well as swgdrug forensic chemists are ethically bound to present testimony in a neutral manner and to be open to reconsidering their statements if new information is found chemists should also limit their testimony to areas they have been qualified in regardless of questions during direct or cross examination individuals called to testify must be able to relay scientific information and processes in a manner that lay individuals can understand by being qualified as an expert chemists are allowed to give their opinions on evidence as opposed to just stating facts this can lead to competing opinions from experts hired by opposing side ethical guidelines for forensic chemists require that testimony be given in an objective manner regardless of what side expert is testifying for forensic experts that are called to testify are expected to work with lawyer who issued summons and to assist in their understanding of material they will be asking questions about education forensic chemistry positions require a bachelor s degree or similar in a natural or physical science as well as laboratory experience in general organic and analytical chemistry once in position individuals are trained in protocols that are performed at that specific lab until they can prove they are competent to perform all experiments without supervision practicing chemists already in field are expected to have continuing education to maintain their proficiency references category chemistry chemistry
