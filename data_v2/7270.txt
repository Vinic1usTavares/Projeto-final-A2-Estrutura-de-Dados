agnosticism is view that existence of god of divine or supernatural is unknown or unknowable page 56 in 1967 edition another definition provided is view that human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify either belief that god exists or belief that god does not exist english biologist thomas henry huxley coined word agnostic in 1869 and said it simply means that a man shall not say he knows or believes that which he has no scientific grounds for professing to know or believe earlier thinkers however had written works that promoted agnostic points of view such as sanjaya a 5th century bce indian philosopher who expressed agnosticism about any afterlife bhaskar 1972 and protagoras a 5th century bce greek philosopher who expressed agnosticism about existence of gods agnosticism is doctrine or tenet of agnostics with regard to existence of anything beyond and behind material phenomena or to knowledge of a first cause or god and is not a religion defining agnosticism being a scientist above all else huxley presented agnosticism as a form of demarcation a hypothesis with no supporting objective testable evidence is not an objective scientific claim as such there would be no way to test said hypotheses leaving results inconclusive his agnosticism was not compatible with forming a belief as to truth or falsehood of claim at hand karl popper would also describe himself as an agnostic edward karl popper on god lost interview skeptic 6 2 1998 according to philosopher william l rowe in this strict sense agnosticism is view that human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify either belief that god exists or belief that god does not exist george h smith while admitting that narrow definition of atheist was common usage definition of that word george h smith atheism case against god pg 9 and admitting that broad definition of agnostic was common usage definition of that word george h smith atheism case against god pg 12 promoted broadening definition of atheist and narrowing definition of agnostic smith rejects agnosticism as a third alternative to theism and atheism and promotes terms such as agnostic atheism view of those who do not believe in existence of any deity but do not claim to know if a deity does or does not exist and agnostic theism view of those who do not claim to know of existence of any deity but still believe in such an existence etymology agnostic was used by thomas henry huxley in a speech at a meeting of metaphysical society in 1869 to describe his philosophy which rejects all claims of spiritual or mystical knowledge early christian church leaders used greek word gnosis knowledge to describe spiritual knowledge agnosticism is not to be confused with religious views opposing ancient religious movement of gnosticism in particular huxley used term in a broader more abstract sense huxley identified agnosticism not as a creed but rather as a method of skeptical evidence based inquiry in recent years scientific literature dealing with neuroscience and psychology has used word to mean not knowable oxford english dictionary additions series 1993 in technical and marketing literature agnostic can also mean independence from some parameters for example platform agnostic or hardware agnostic qualifying agnosticism scottish enlightenment philosopher david hume contended that meaningful statements about universe are always qualified by some degree of doubt he asserted that fallibility of human beings means that they cannot obtain absolute certainty except in trivial cases where a statement is true by definition e g tautologies such as all bachelors are unmarried or all triangles have three corners hume david an enquiry concerning human understanding 1748 types strong agnosticism also called hard closed strict or permanent agnosticism view that question of existence or nonexistence of a deity or deities and nature of ultimate reality is unknowable by reason of our natural inability to verify any experience with anything but another subjective experience a strong agnostic would say i cannot know whether a deity exists or not and neither can you weak agnosticism also called soft open empirical or temporal agnosticism view that existence or nonexistence of any deities is currently unknown but is not necessarily unknowable therefore one will withhold judgment until evidence if any becomes available a weak agnostic would say i don t know whether any deities exist or not but maybe one day if there is evidence we can find something out apathetic agnosticism view that no amount of debate can prove or disprove existence of one or more deities and if one or more deities exist they do not appear to be concerned about fate of humans therefore their existence has little to no impact on personal human affairs and should be of little interest an apathetic agnostic would say i don t know whether any deity exist or not and i don t care if any deity exists or not rauch jonathan let it be three cheers for apatheism atlantic monthly may 2003 history hindu philosophy throughout history of hinduism there has been a strong tradition of philosophic speculation and skepticism rig veda takes an agnostic view on fundamental question of how universe and gods were created sukta creation hymn in tenth chapter of rig veda says hume kant and kierkegaard aristotle anselm aquinas descartes and godel presented arguments attempting to rationally prove existence of god skeptical empiricism of david hume of immanuel kant and existential philosophy of soren kierkegaard convinced many later philosophers to abandon these attempts regarding it impossible to construct any unassailable proof for existence or non existence of god in his 1844 book philosophical fragments kierkegaard writes kierkegaard soren philosophical fragments ch 3 hume was huxley s favourite philosopher calling him prince of agnostics a hundred years of british philosophy by rudolf metz pg 111 diderot wrote to his mistress telling of a visit by hume to baron d holbach and describing how a word for position that huxley would later describe as

generally an agnostic would be most correct description of my state of mind thomas henry huxley thumb upright thomas henry huxley agnostic views are as old as philosophical skepticism but terms agnostic and agnosticism were created by huxley 1825 1895 to sum up his thoughts on contemporary developments of metaphysics about unconditioned william hamilton and unknowable herbert spencer though huxley began to use term agnostic in 1869 his opinions had taken shape some time before that date in a letter of september 23 1860 to charles kingsley huxley discussed his views extensively and again to same correspondent may 6 1863 of origin of name agnostic to describe this attitude huxley gave following account in 1889 huxley wrote therefore although it be as i believe demonstrable that we have no real knowledge of authorship or of date of composition of gospels as they have come down to us and that nothing better than more or less probable guesses can be arrived at on that subject william

1872 1970 declared why i am not a christian in 1927 a classic statement of agnosticism he calls upon his readers to stand on their own two feet and look fair and square at world with a fearless attitude and a free intelligence in 1939 russell gave a lecture on existence and nature of god in which he characterized himself as an atheist he said however later in same lecture discussing modern non anthropomorphic concepts of god russell states collected papers vol 10 p 258 in russell s 1947 pamphlet am i an atheist or an agnostic subtitled a plea for tolerance in face of new dogmas he

1976 published christian agnostic in which he argues although radical and unpalatable to conventional theologians weatherhead s agnosticism falls far short of huxley s and short even of weak agnosticism united states robert g ingersoll thumb robert g ingersoll robert g ingersoll 1833 1899 an illinois lawyer and politician who evolved into a well known and sought after orator in 19th century america has been referred to as great agnostic in an 1896 lecture titled why i am an agnostic ingersoll related why he was an agnostic in conclusion of speech he simply sums up agnostic position as in 1885 ingersoll explained his comparative view of agnosticism and atheism as follows bernard iddings bell canon bernard iddings bell 1886 1958 a popular cultural commentator episcopal priest and author lauded necessity of agnosticism in beyond agnosticism a book for tired mechanists calling it foundation of all intelligent christianity agnosticism was a temporary mindset in which one rigorously questioned truths of age including way in which one believed god his view of robert ingersoll and thomas paine was that they were not denouncing true christianity but rather a gross perversion of it part of misunderstanding stemmed from ignorance of concepts of god and religion historically a god was any real perceivable force that ruled lives of humans and inspired admiration love fear and homage religion was practice of it ancient peoples worshiped gods with real counterparts such as mammon money and material things nabu rationality or ba al violent weather bell argued that modern peoples were still paying homage with their lives and their children s lives to these old gods of wealth physical appetites and self deification thus if one attempted to be agnostic passively he or she would incidentally join worship of world s gods in unfashionable convictions 1931 he criticized enlightenment s complete faith in human sensory perception augmented by scientific instruments as a means of accurately grasping reality firstly it was fairly new an innovation of western world which aristotle invented and thomas aquinas revived among scientific community secondly divorce of pure science from human experience as manifested in american industrialization had completely altered environment often disfiguring it so as to suggest its insufficiency to human needs thirdly because scientists were constantly producing more data to point where no single human could grasp it all at once it followed that human intelligence was incapable of attaining a complete understanding of universe therefore to admit mysteries of unobserved universe was to be actually scientific bell believed that there were two other ways that humans could perceive and interact with world artistic experience was how one expressed meaning through speaking writing painting gesturing any sort of communication which shared insight into a human s inner reality mystical experience was how one could read people and harmonize with them being what we commonly call love in summary man was a scientist artist and lover without exercising all three a person became lopsided bell considered a humanist to be a person who cannot rightly ignore other ways of knowing however humanism like agnosticism was also temporal and would eventually lead to either scientific materialism or theism he lays out following thesis truth cannot be discovered by reasoning on evidence of scientific data alone modern peoples dissatisfaction with life is result of depending on such incomplete data our ability to reason is not a way to discover truth but rather a way to organize our knowledge and experiences somewhat sensibly without a full human perception of world one s reason tends to lead them in wrong direction beyond what can be measured with scientific tools there are other types of perception such as one s ability know another human through loving one s loves cannot be dissected and logged in a scientific journal but we know them far better than we know surface of sun they show us an undefinable reality that is nevertheless intimate and personal and they reveal qualities lovelier and truer than detached facts can provide to be religious in christian sense is to live for whole of reality god rather than for a small part gods only by treating this whole of reality as a person good and true and perfect rather than an impersonal force can we come closer to truth an ultimate person can be loved but a cosmic force cannot a scientist can only discover peripheral truths but a lover is able to get at truth there are many reasons to believe in god but they are not sufficient for an agnostic to become a theist it is not enough to believe in an ancient holy book even though when it is accurately analyzed without bias it proves to be more trustworthy and admirable than what we are taught in school neither is it enough to realize how probable it is that a personal god would have to show human beings how to live considering they have so much trouble on their own nor is it enough to believe for reason that throughout history millions of people have arrived at this wholeness of reality only through religious experience aforementioned reasons may warm one toward religion but they fall short of convincing however if one presupposes that god is in fact a knowable loving person as an experiment and then lives according that religion he or she will suddenly come face to face with experiences previously unknown one s life becomes full meaningful and fearless in face of death it does not defy reason but exceeds it because god has been experienced through love orders of prayer fellowship and devotion now matter they create order within one s life continually renewing missing piece that had previously felt lost they empower one to be compassionate and humble not small minded or arrogant no truth should be denied outright but all should be questioned science reveals an ever growing vision of our universe that should not be discounted due to bias toward older understandings reason is to be trusted and cultivated to believe in god is not to forego reason or to deny scientific facts but to step into unknown and discover fullness of life demographics thumb percentage of people in various european countries who said i don t believe there is any sort of spirit god or life force 2005 demographic research services normally do not differentiate between various types of non religious respondents so agnostics are often classified in same category as atheists or other non religious people a 2010 survey published in encyclopaedia britannica found that non religious people or agnostics made up about 9 6 of world s population a november december 2006 poll published in financial times gives rates for united states and five european countries rates of agnosticism in united states were at 14 while rates of agnosticism in european countries surveyed were considerably higher italy 20 spain 30 great britain 35 germany 25 and france 32 a study conducted by pew research center found that about 16 of world s people third largest group after christianity and islam have no religious affiliation according to a 2012 report by pew research center agnostics made up 3 3 of us adult population in u s religious landscape survey conducted by pew research center 55 of agnostic respondents expressed a belief in god or a universal spirit whereas 41 stated that they thought that they felt a tension being non religious in a society where most people are religious thumb upright 1 8 left proportion of atheists and agnostics around world 2006 according to 2011 australian bureau of statistics 22 of australians have no religion a category that includes agnostics between 64 and 65 of japanese and up to 81 of vietnamese are atheists agnostics or do not believe in a god an official european union survey reported that 3 of eu population is unsure about their belief in a god or spirit criticism agnosticism is criticized from a variety of standpoints some religious thinkers see agnosticism as limiting mind s capacity to know reality to materialism some atheists criticize use of term agnosticism as functionally indistinguishable from atheism this results in frequent criticisms of those who adopt term as avoiding atheist label theistic theistic critics claim that agnosticism is impossible in practice since a person can live only either as if god did not exist etsi deus non daretur or as if god did exist etsi deus daretur religious scholars such as laurence b brown criticize misuse of word agnosticism claiming that it has become one of most misapplied terms in metaphysics brown raises question you claim that nothing can be known with certainty how then can you be so sure christian according to pope benedict xvi strong agnosticism in particular contradicts itself in affirming power of reason to know scientific truth he blames exclusion of reasoning from religion and ethics for dangerous pathologies such as crimes against humanity and ecological disasters agnosticism said ratzinger is always fruit of a refusal of that knowledge which is in fact offered to man knowledge of god has always existed he asserted that agnosticism is a choice of comfort pride dominion and utility over truth and is opposed by following attitudes keenest self criticism humble listening to whole of existence persistent patience and self correction of scientific method a readiness to be purified by truth catholic church sees merit in examining what it calls partial agnosticism specifically those systems that do not aim at constructing a complete philosophy of unknowable but at excluding special kinds of truth notably religious from domain of knowledge however church is historically opposed to a full denial of capacity of human reason to know god council of vatican declares god beginning and end of all can by natural light of human reason be known with certainty from works of creation blaise pascal argued that even if there were truly no evidence for god agnostics should consider what is now known as pascal s wager infinite expected value of acknowledging god is always greater than finite expected value of not acknowledging his existence and thus it is a safer bet to choose god peter kreeft and ronald tacelli cited 20 arguments for god s existence twenty arguments for existence of god from handbook of christian apologetics by peter kreeft and fr ronald tacelli sj intervarsity press 1994 archived from original on june 29 2014 asserting that any demand for evidence testable in a laboratory is in effect asking god supreme being to become man s servant atheistic according to richard dawkins a distinction between agnosticism and atheism is unwieldy and depends on how close to zero a person is willing to rate probability of existence for any given god like entity about himself dawkins continues i am agnostic only to extent that i am agnostic about fairies at bottom of garden god delusion 2006 bantam press p 51 dawkins also identifies two categories of agnostics temporary agnostics in practice taps and permanent agnostics in principle paps he states that agnosticism about existence of god belongs firmly in temporary or tap category either he exists or he doesn t it is a scientific question one day we may know answer and meanwhile we can say something pretty strong about probability and considers pap a deeply inescapable kind of fence sitting god delusion 2006 bantam press pp 47 48 ignosticism a related concept is ignosticism view that a coherent definition of a deity must be put forward before question of existence of a deity can be meaningfully discussed if chosen definition is not coherent holds view that existence of a deity is meaningless or empirically untestable a j ayer theodore drange and other philosophers see both atheism and agnosticism as incompatible with ignosticism on grounds that atheism and agnosticism accept a deity exists as a meaningful proposition that can be argued for or against ayer language 115 there can be no way of proving that existence of a god is even probable for if existence of such a god were probable then proposition that he existed would be an empirical hypothesis and in that case it would be possible to deduce from it and other empirical hypotheses certain experimental propositions which were not deducible from those other hypotheses alone but in fact this is not possible drange atheism see also
