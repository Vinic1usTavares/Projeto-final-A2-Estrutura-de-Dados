engleromyces sinensis is a species of fungus in family xylariaceae it was described as new to science in 2010 based on specimens collected in 1958 and incorrectly identified as engleromyces goetzii fungus is known only from china where it grows on bamboo culms it forms fruit bodies in shape of two roughly circular buff colored lobes measuring up to in diameter that envelop bamboo e sinensis has been used as a folk remedy against cancer and infection in tibet yunnan and sichuan provinces several bioactive metabolites have been isolated and identified from fungus discovery engleromyces sinensis was described as a new species in 2010 authors were studying members of family xylariaceae that were housed in mycological herbarium of chinese academy of sciences in beijing and discovered that five specimens labeled as e goetzii collected from jade dragon snow mountain yunnan province in 1958 did not match descriptions of species published by paul christoph hennings 1900 curtis gates lloyd 1917 r w g dennis 1961 or jack rogers 1981 these species descriptions which were based on collections made in africa convinced authors that chinese collections were sufficiently different from e goetzii to warrant describing a new species prior to this discovery engleromyces was a monotypic genus specific epithet sinensis means chinese description fruit bodies of engleromyces sinensis form two roughly spherical lobes that partially envelop bamboo substrate official description gives dimensions of by and in height although specimens in markets measuring in diameter have been noted when young surface is buff colored with a pinkish hue and slightly dimpled surface color changes to grayish brown and surface becomes smoother as fungus matures internal flesh is buff colored with a firm texture that later becomes woody ostioles minute openings through which spores are released which are scattered about surface of fruit bodies are somewhat nipple like when young but later become sharper punctate situated under a crust with a thickness of about 1 mm are arranged in rows they are spherical to flask shaped with eight spored asci asci are funnel or t shaped somewhat like a golf tee and measure about 4 by 4 mm they have an apical apparatus a region at ascus tip that forms spore shooting mechanism that stains blue in melzer s reagent smooth black ascospores are lined up in a single row and feature drop like appendages that are visible when still in ascus measuring 15 19 by 11 5 12 5 mm they are broadly inequilateral with one or both ends shortened and lack a germ pore in contrast to e goetzii type species of engleromyces e sinensis has smaller spores and an apical apparatus that is t shaped rather than cuboid e goetzii fruit bodies can grow quite large to size of a football and weigh up to they only grow on african alpine bamboo alpina siamese jelly ball fungus siamensis produces fruit bodies that are superficially similar to those of e sinensis however former are smaller have a gelatinous texture and are only found in thailand where they grow on bamboo culms and branches at elevations ranging from habitat and distribution engleromyces sinensis is known only from china including its type location in yunnan china in yulong county fungus has also been collected from county tibet where it was found growing in a coniferous forest it has been collected at elevations between fruit bodies grow on and partially envelop bamboo culms specifically e sinensis has been recorded from a species of bamboo variously known as or f depending on authority engleromyces collections made in nepal initially identified as e goetzii are likely to be e sinensis research engleromyces sinensis is used in china in traditional medicine for its antibiotic and antiinflammatory properties and is sold in market stalls in yunnan several bioactive metabolites have been isolated and identified from fungus it produces a cytochalasin this compound which is also made by e goetzii has antibiotic and cytotoxic activity additional metabolites include novel compound neoengleromycin and previously known cytochalasin d and 19 20 d neoengleromycin has an unusual chemical structure featuring a rare amine substituted hydroxamic acid skeleton references external links category category fungi of china category fungi described in 2010 category medicinal fungi
