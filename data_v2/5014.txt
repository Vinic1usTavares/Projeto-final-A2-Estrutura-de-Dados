telegraph gave day of doctor five stars calling it charming eccentric and very very british den of geek s simon brew praised special calling it terrific and stating that it was pulsating with comedy ambition and top to bottom entertainment guardians viv criticised various elements of episode though concluded that it was all worth it jim shelley of daily mail called episode a clever chaotic infuriating combination of nifty knowing tiny detail and big hollow pompous bluster he disliked effects accusing bbc on pandering to american audience as well as disliking zygons deeming them not scary enough and naming matt smith and david tennant irritating though he praised john hurt s performance and tom baker s cameo dan martin of guardian praised time of doctor as awfully good he wrote that steven moffat had performed fourth remix of show s mythology in a row tying up strands that date back to beginning of matt smith s run he added perfectly rebooting of his regeneration cycle was done simply who could have guessed doctor s renewed regeneration cycle would be dealt with as simply as his best friend just asking nicely mark snow of ign gave episode a score of 8 4 great writing that time of doctor was an exemplary exercise in celebrating departure of a loved one if you managed to stay dry eyed during doctor s goodbye to clara itself a not entirely transparent goodbye from smith to role he embodied then you should probably double check your heart s still working also lauding karen gillan s rather crowd pleasing tear inducing cameo while criticising its rapid almost breathless pace he concluded it was a melancholic yet ultimately merry end to one of show s best doctors to date awards and nominations year award category nominee s result 2014 bafta awards radio
