right symbolizes women s industry and was based on a sketch by assistant engraver george t morgan quarter s design was deprecated in numismatic press coin did not sell well at exposition its price of 1 was same as for columbian half dollar and quarter was seen as worse deal nearly half of authorized issue was returned to mint to be melted thousands more were purchased at face value by lady managers and entered coin market in early 20th century today they are popular with collectors and are valued in hundreds to thousands of dollars depending on condition legislation in august 1892 congress passed an act authorizing first united states commemorative coin a half dollar to be sold at a premium by managers of world s columbian exposition in chicago event had been authorised by congress two years previously that legislation created a board of lady managers and a board of gentleman managers to oversee fair board of lady managers was headed by bertha palmer whose husband potter owned palmer house leading hotel in chicago decisions of lady managers were often reversed by their male counterparts on controversial matters for example palmer sought to shut fair s egyptian girls dancing show after deeming it obscene show was one of exposition s few successful moneymakers and lady managers were overruled by men thumb bertha palmer led exposition s board of lady managers authorization for board of lady managers had been included in 1890 law giving federal authority for exposition at insistence of women s advocate susan b anthony who was determined to show that women could successfully assist in management of fair to that end lady managers sought a coin to sell in competition with commemorative half dollar at exposition which congress had approved in 1892 passage of half dollar legislation had been difficult and lady managers decided to wait until next session of congress to make their request when half dollar appeared in november 1892 lady managers considered it inartistic and determined to do better palmer wanted lady managers to have credit of being authors of first really beautiful and artistic coin that has ever been issued by government of united states in january 1893 palmer approached house appropriations committee asking that 10 000 of funds already designated to be paid over to lady managers by federal government be in form of souvenir quarters which they could sell at a premium on march 3 1893 congress duly passed an act authorising souvenir coin which was to be to specifications of quarter struck for circulation and with a design to be approved by secretary of treasury total mintage of special quarter would be limited to 40 000 specimens inception desiring a beautiful coin to sell palmer asked artist kenyon cox to produce sketches she was however determined to have a woman actually design coin she also consulted with sara hallowell who was both secretary to fair s director of fine arts and was helping palmers amass a major art collection hallowell contacted sculptor augustus saint gaudens who recommended his onetime student caroline peddle who was already engaged in exposition work having been commissioned by tiffany s to produce an exhibit palmer agreed to have peddle do work after congress authorized souvenir quarter director of bureau of mint edward o leech wrote to palmer on march 14 1893 although he expressed a willingness to have lady managers select design mint chief engraver charles e barber and philadelphia mint superintendent oliver bosbyshell had already urged leech to keep design process in house at mint palmer replied that lady managers had decided that quarter would bear a portrait of isabella i queen of castile in spain whose assistance had helped pay for columbus s expedition palmer indicated that she was consulting artists and suggested that mint submit a design for consideration she also met with illinois congressman allen chairman of house of representatives fair committee and a former colleague of secretary of treasury john g carlisle leech s superior palmer suggested to congressman that he advocate for lady managers with carlisle and leech palmer by letter hired peddle to do design work in late march she instructed artist that coin was to have a figure of isabella on obverse and inscription commemorative coin issued for board of lady managers of world s columbian exposition by act of congress 1492 1892 on reverse as well as denomination and name of country chairwoman did not request that peddle provide lady managers with design before sending it to mint palmer informed carlisle and leech of her instructions carlisle had no objection to a coin being designed by a woman or to use of isabella s head secretary told palmer that reverse with its long inscription would appear like a business advertising token and he asked that it be revised leech sent a note to superintendent bosbyshell informing him that lady managers would likely have an outside sculptor create obverse and asking him to have mint chief engraver charles e barber create some designs for reverse for possible use left thumb upright peddle s sketch obedient to palmer s instructions peddle sent leech sketches of a seated isabella with long inscription on reverse she hoped mint director would allow her to shorten it leech was unhappy with reverse and decided that barber would design that side of coin barber and bosbyshell wrote to leech that isabella s legs would appear distorted if seated figure were used and advocated a head in profile carlisle agreed stating that he had only given permission for a head of isabella peddle was informed that barber would produce reverse though design would be sent to her for approval and she would have to change her obverse meanwhile palmer was growing increasingly anxious with a timeline of two months from design approval to availability of actual coins she feared that pieces would not be available for sale until well into fair s may to october run under pressure from all sides peddle threatened to quit project writing that she could not consent to do half of a piece of work what finally wore down peddle s patience were two letters dated april 7 one from leech asserted his right as mint director to prescribe coin designs and told peddle that obverse would be a head of isabella while reverse would be based on sketches by a mint engraver which she would be free to model second from bosbyshell imposed additional requirement that isabella not wear a crown which he deemed inappropriate on an american coin on april 8 1893 caroline peddle withdrew from project following peddle s resignation leech wrote a conciliatory letter to palmer who responded regretting that three of them had not worked together rather than at cross purposes palmer had written to suggest an alternative to inscription reverse that coin depict women s building at fair barber prepared sketches and rejected idea stating that building would appear a mere streak on coin in required low relief instead he favored a sketch prepared by assistant engraver george t morgan showing a kneeling woman spinning flax with a distaff in her hands leech was not fully satisfied with proposal stating that juxtaposition of isabella on obverse and morgan reverse was too much woman before accepting morgan s design leech wanted barber to produce some reverses himself which chief engraver did and bosbyshell forwarded them to leech on april 11 and 12 these showed various uses of a heraldic eagle after considering these efforts leech decided on morgan s design and wrote to palmer accordingly stating that distaff is used in art to symbolize patient industry and especially industry of women in response lady managers suggested use of building s portal and asked if it was possible to place a living person on coin leech stated that secretary carlisle had selected distaff reverse and his determination was binding bosbyshell informed leech by letter that stewart curator at university of pennsylvania possessed a number of medals depicting isabella and former general oliver o howard was engaged in writing a biography of late queen and possessed likenesses of her leech agreed that these men be consulted carlisle was reluctant to allow an inscription which made distinctions by sex such as board of lady managers to appear on coin but he eventually agreed to that wording on april 24 mint director sent palmer a box containing two plaster models of obverse one of isabella as a young queen other showing her more mature he also informed her that distaff reverse would be used with wording agreed to by carlisle obverse models were supposedly made by barber based on an engraving of isabella forwarded by peddle to mint at palmer s request but moran suggests that period of only a day between receipt of engraving and completion of models during which barber also attended funeral of bosbyshell s grandson means that barber was working on them before that board of lady managers on may 5 selected young queen design and reception thumb upright right 1838 anti slavery token am i not a woman and a sister obverse of isabella quarter depicts a crowned and richly clothed bust of that spanish queen according to art historian cornelius vermeule barber s obverse design follow s gilbert scott s victorian gothic tradition of photographic classicism best summed up by groups of continents and reliefs of famous persons on albert memorial in london reverse depicts a kneeling woman with distaff and spindle vermeule traces that imagery to figure of a young female servant carved upon east pediment of temple of zeus at olympia in 5th century b c nevertheless a contemporary account in american journal of numismatics compared reverse to an anti slavery token with a kneeling woman and legend am i not a woman and a sister art historian writing in 1971 noted that nowadays coin seems charming for its quaintness and its victorian flavor a mixture of cold hellenism and renaissance romance perhaps one of its greatest joys is that none of customary inscriptions mottoes and such appear on it numismatic historian don taxay in his study of early u s commemoratives dismissed contemporary accounts such as in fair s official book that kenyon cox had provided a design for quarter he noted that artist s son had strongly denied that his father was involved in coin s creation taxay deemed design commonplace and typical of barber s style stating that modeling though somewhat more highly relieved than on half dollar is without distinction american journal of numismatics had other criticisms of quarter release and collecting minting of what barber dubbed showy quarters began at philadelphia mint on june 13 1893 six weeks after exposition opened leech had planned to strike pieces using polished blanks or planchets and workers at that mint handled coins carefully unlike half dollar surviving specimens display relatively few contact marks from other coins first piece struck along with numbers 400 1 492 and 1 892 were struck in proof condition and sent to lady managers along with certificates attesting to their status a total of 40 023 pieces were struck with 23 coins over authorized mintage retained by mint for inspection by 1894 assay commission pieces did not sell well at exposition they were for sale only at women s building at fair or by mail half dollar could be purchased at several outlets some 15 000 quarters were sold to collectors dealers and fairgoers including several thousand of them purchased by scott stamp and coin company fairgoers viewed quarter as not as good a deal as half dollar as both sold for same price of 1 of remainder approximately 10 000 quarters were bought at face value by palmer and other lady managers 15 809 were returned to government for melting after deducting pieces returned for melting a total of 24 214 coins were distributed to public large quantities possessed by lady managers made their way into market through dealers and other vendors in 1920s by 1930 prices had risen to original issue price by 1955 uncirculated specimens sold for 20 pieces are
