newspaper new solidarity and a bi monthly science magazine fusion at least one publication fusion was reborn with a new name but same editor and material attorneys who represented larouche entities in bankruptcy trial filed a brief stating that action was unprecedented and improper alleging that it deviated from standard rules of involuntary bankruptcy and that members of alexandria prosecution

to u s supreme court during bankruptcy trial in september 1989 an fbi agent destroyed evidence credit card receipts cancelled checks and fec filings immediately after he had promised court he would preserve them on october 25 1989 judge martin v b bostetter dismissed government s involuntary bankruptcy petition finding that two of entities involved were nonprofit fund raisers and therefore not subject to involuntary bankruptcy actions according to larouche movement bostetter said government s actions amounted to bad faith regardless of whether government agents and attorneys had intended this outcome he found that government s actions and representations in obtaining bankruptcy had effect of misleading court as to status of organization leading to a constructive fraud on court in 1993 an appeals court decision said that bostetter had specifically rejected that view and said that defendants had greatly distorted character of much of evidence appeals that went all way up to u s supreme court found that matter of involuntary bankruptcy would not change outcome of larouche s conviction larouche organization asserts that it has proof obtained under freedom of information act which shows that purpose of bankruptcy was simply to shut down affected entities rather than to collect fines search turned up a memo by james reynolds of general litigation and legal advice section of department of justice in which he writes benefit is that a trustee is immediately appointed they are ordered to shut down business immediately u s attorney said essentially court holds that we did not abuse bankruptcy filing just that we should have filed differently he also noted that only a minimal amount of money had been collected boston trials trial of frankhouser united states district judge robert keeton presided in boston jury selection was completed in september 1987 before trial could begin keeton granted a motion to sever case of roy frankhouser whose case was tried first in front of a different jury frankhouser had been an informant for atf and other law enforcement agencies in addition to being a neo nazi and a former pennsylvania ku klux klan grand dragon frankhouser became a security consultant for larouche after convincing him that he was actively connected to u s intelligence agencies in u s v frankhauser court records spell name frankhauser while most other sources spell it frankhouser frankhouser testified that he and larouche security employee forrest lee fick had invented a connection to cia in order to justify his 700 a week salary they persuaded a friend to play a former top cia official mr ed in meetings with larouche associates who according to larouche group lawyers came to believe that they had a direct line of communication to white house and kremlin through mr ed and as a national resource in security matters were immune from prosecution when larouche found out about grand jury investigation he reportedly told frankhouser to get cia to quash it frankhouser told larouche that cia wanted him to destroy evidence and hide witnesses frankhouser claimed that on another occasion larouche sent him to boston to check on grand jury investigation instead of going to boston he went to a star trek convention in scranton pennsylvania and called to warn larouche that fbi had his phones larouche was called as a defense witness in frankhouser s trial but he refused to testify exercising his fifth amendment right to avoid self incrimination frankhouser was found guilty of obstruction of federal investigation into credit card fraud he was sentenced to three years and a 50 000 fine after his conviction he was granted immunity against further prosecution and compelled to testify against larouche in boston trial frankhouser appealed his conviction on april 3 1989 arguing that his case should not have been severed from main case that his counsel had inadequate time to prepare and that he was not provided with allegedly exculpatory evidence appeal was rejected in july trial of larouche et al trial of larouche and his six co defendants u s v larouche campaign began on december 17 1987 with jury that had been picked in september before frankhouser trial 12 defense lawyers made 400 pretrial motions prosecution argued that pressure to fill fund raising quotas had led to 2 000 instances of credit card fraud and that organization members had sought to obstruct investigation defense presented case that prosecution was culmination of a 20 year campaign of harassment by fbi and cia and that prosecution was acting on orders of cia when they destroyed evidence and hid witnesses during trial a search of personal files of oliver north was ordered by judge keeton to look for evidence that north had led an effort to harass and infiltrate larouche movement causing an additional delay in trial search produced a may 1986 telex from iran contra defendant general richard secord to north discussing gathering of information against larouche after this memo surfaced judge keeton ordered a search of vice president george bush s office for documents relating to larouche another delay came when trial was halted to give time for fbi to search their files for exculpatory documents trial was delayed again when federal agents seized larouche properties as part of involuntary bankruptcy procedure in 1988 originally expected to last from three to six months trial stretched out much longer one local reporter called boston trial a long complex and costly extravaganza after several jurors asked to be excused due to length of trial defense refused to proceed with fewer than 12 jurors forcing judge to declare a mistrial on may 4 1988 according to one of jurors all defendants including larouche would have been found not guilty he told a reporter it seemed some of government s people caused problem and that people working on behalf of government may have been involved in some of this fraud to discredit campaign at time of mistrial a spokesperson said that constitutional defense fund a larouche organization had spent over 2 million on legal and administrative expenses defense attorneys said they would appeal if government sought a new trial a retrial in boston was scheduled for january 3 1989 but charges were dismissed after alexandria convictions this was over objections of larouche lawyers who said they were seeking vindication assistant u s attorney who handled both boston and alexandria cases said after dismissal it was boston prosecuting effort which led to evidence which allowed indictment and convictions in alexandria and i think justice was served by substantial sentences received throughout trial three of indicted individuals were fugitives michael gelber charles park and richard sanders according to roy frankhouser they had been sent to europe they surrendered to court in 1990 and were sentenced by judge keeton to one year each for obstructing investigation related appeals on july 3 1986 first circuit court of appeals upheld contempt of court fines from boston grand jury that decision was appealed to u s supreme court which let it stand first circuit

seized improperly during october 1986 search court denied appeal following january jeffrey steinberg said on december 11 1987 that 100 notebooks compiled by himself and his wife should not have been included in grand jury subpoena or search he lost that appeal following january court heard an appeal from nbc on january 5 1988 over a lower court subpoena of nbc outtakes of a videotaped interview with a witness forrest lee fick lower court ruled subpoenaed outtakes were to be placed under seal and subject to in camera review only giving court discretion whether to release any portion to defendants larouche had asserted outtakes could be used to impeach fick s testimony court affirmed lower court s ruling in march following mistrial in boston prosecution moved to schedule a new trial larouche and other defendants appealed that effort on october 5 1988 saying that a new trial would create double jeopardy appeal was denied four months later contempt of court fines were appealed again on january 9 1989 and affirmed again on march 29 following convictions in alexandria court prosecutors moved to dismiss charges from boston court canceling retrial larouche lawyers appealed that decision on march 13 1989 arguing that they needed trial to exonerate larouche alexandria trial judge albert v bryan jr presided over u s v larouche in u s district court for eastern district of virginia where larouche resided that court was known as a rocket docket for its speed in disposing of cases larouche and six associates were indicted on october 14 1988 on charges of mail fraud and conspiracy to commit mail fraud trial was scheduled for six weeks after indictment defense lawyers made an unusual appeal asking for a delay which was rejected judge bryan granted a prosecution motion in limine ruling that defense would not be permitted to discuss or even allude to fact that indebted entities had been placed in involuntary bankruptcy it also excluded claims of vindictive prosecution and political harassment by government government s motion in limine united states v larouche criminal no 88 00243 a e d va 1988 reprinted in spannaus 1989 bryan wrote court will not allow a delving into any details of alleged infiltration for reason that this would divert jury from issues raised in indictment thumb federal courthouse in alexandria virginia prosecution led by assistant u s attorney kent robinson presented evidence that larouche and his staff solicited us 34 million in loans since 1983 with false assurances to potential lenders and showed reckless disregard for truth in his opening statement to trial robinson said members of jury this case is about money it s about how defendants got money and to a lesser extent what they did with that money when they got it defendants all seven of them are charged in engaging in a scheme to defraud that is to obtain those loans by making false promises false pretences saying things to potential lenders which they knew weren t true transcript of record united states v larouche criminal no 88 00243 a e d va 1988 reprinted in spannaus 1989 most important evidence was testimony of lenders many of them elderly retirees who had loaned a total of 661 300 to help larouche fight war on drugs but only received 10 000 in repayment one of prosecutors john markham said those loans represented just a very small portion of unrepaid borrowing other testimony asserted that as of 1987 half of 4 million borrowed by 1984 presidential campaign was unpaid and that only 5 million had been repaid out of 30 million in non campaign loans larouche supporters claim unrepaid amount was 294 000 but according to testimony at trial amount owed by 1987 topped 25 million several witnesses were larouche followers who testified under immunity from prosecution a former fundraiser testified that he was told no matter what person you are talking to says get money if you are talking to an unemployed worker who says he has got to feed a dozen children forget it get money most of these people are immoral anyway this is most moral thing they have ever done is to give you money none of defendants testified outside of court larouche denied all charges calling them an all out frame up by a state and federal task force and said that federal government was trying to kill him purpose of this frame up is not to send me to prison it s to kill me larouche said in prison it s fairly easy to kill me if this sentence goes through i m dead income tax one of charges against larouche was that he had conspired to avoid paying income tax not having filed a return in ten years larouche claimed to have had no income larouche lived on a 172 acre 700 000 m2 estate near leesburg virginia with a pond and horse ring it was

government argued that security expenditures were misplaced priorities spannaus 1989 p 51 in 1985 a judge in a separate case had described larouche s testimony about being almost penniless as completely lacking in credibility in 1986 in same case larouche said that he did not know who had paid rent on estate or for his food lodging clothing transportation bodyguards or lawyers since 1973

counts of actual mail fraud involving 294 000 in defaulted loans and one count of conspiring to defraud u s internal revenue service judge said that claim of a vendetta was arrant nonsense and that idea that this organization is a sufficient threat to anything that would warrant government bringing a prosecution to silence them just defies human experience jury foreman buster horton told washington post that it was failure of larouche aides to repay loans which swayed jury in virginia case he said that jury all agreed larouche was not on trial for his political beliefs we did not convict him for that he was convicted for those 13 counts he was on trial for as part of trial in alexandria six of larouche s associates were also found guilty his chief fund raiser william wertz was

bakker also wrote that his cellmate was convinced that their cell was bugged in bakker s view to say larouche was a little paranoid would be like saying that titanic had a little leak bakker 1996 p

department during last ten years or so of that period some u s officials and others have challenged relevant agencies with some of evidence which shows that those prosecutions and correlated harassment of me and my associates had been clearly fraudulent politically motivated targeting larouche and his lawyers asserted that anti defamation league adl sought to destroy his organization and that prosecution was result of a conspiracy between adl government and media this claim stemmed from a series of meetings that larouche publications refer to as john train salon in testimony submitted to senate judiciary committee on july 13 1998 larouche affiliated schiller institute claimed that t he inability to repay lenders and other crediters sic was consequence of an unprecedented involuntary bankruptcy proceeding initiated by justice department against those companies in 1987 initiated in an ex parte in camera proceeding friedrich august freiherr von der heydte a professor of constitutional and international law at university of mainz in germany compared larouche trial to dreyfus affair which he called a classical example of a political trial he wrote just as larouche was
