beautiful when she was asked by interviewer who her favorite people were to collaborate with she responded by solely mentioning furler and explained what led to her to enjoy working with her sia is one of them she comes in singer songwriter she just writes most beautiful amazing ballads now she is making a name for herself on a more broad commercial scale with a lot of more dance driven stuff and she is just an incredible singer she came in and she just writes such serious songs i was like oh she is be such a serious person and i m nervous to meet her and i just want her to get me and understand that i m not a cheesy pop star she comes in and she was all nervous and she is most person in world but once she starts singing and getting into her thing you re just sucked into this world of wow and it s inspiring to be around people with such creative energy i love that that s best experience composition and lyrics blank page is a simplistic piano arranged ballad which lasts for a duration of four minutes and four seconds her vocal range spans from f3 to g5 lyrically song is about how aguilera wishes to wipe slate clean with a former lover and reconcile an old romance she knows that she has wronged him but is asking to be given a second chance andrew hampp for billboard noted that this sentiment is revealed by aguilera in lyrics if i could do undo that i hurt you i would do anything for us to make it through song begins with chords of a piano as aguilera sings i know there s hurt i know there s pain but people change lord knows i ve been no saint in my own way regret choices i ve made how i do i say i m sorry how do i say i m sorry on chorus lyrics are hopeful that she can right any wrongs she may have committed draw me a smile and save me tonight i ll be your blank page waiting for you to bring me to life paint me a heart let me be your art i am a blank page waiting for life to start let our hearts start and beat as one together let our hearts start and beat as one forever arrangement of minimalist piano composition is fiery yet spare aside from garnering innumerable comparisons to aguilera s own song beautiful composition of blank page was subject to critique by jim farber writing for new york daily news he criticised song for replicating structure and lyrical content of someone like you a song performed by english singer songwriter adele only two of disc s 11 tracks attempt a genuine expression of vulnerability just one blank page finds her looking inside and taking some blame it s a pretty song if one that blatantly rides adele s coattails not only does page employ same piano voice arrangement as that star s someone like you aguilera apes precise length of adele s notes critical reception blank page garnered strong critical acclaim from music critics many of whom praised its simplicity writing on behalf of 4music chris younie wrote that although blank page is followed by sing for me another ballad former is utterly brilliant and is ten times better than latter continued to describe blank page as being elegant and confessional he praised her raw vocal performance and thought that should it be released as a single it would have no problem matching success of beautiful stephen thomas erlewine of allmusic complimented simplicity of song writing that aguilera seizes spotlight and is accompanied by a spare piano arrangement popcrush critic michael gallucci described song as a showstopper and compared it to beautiful due to its minimalist structure he further that it is a classic aguilera performance as she employs vocal acrobatics writing for billboard andrew hampp thought that blank page is more likely to reach a wider audience rather than songs aguilera wrote with furler on bionic you lost me and i am which he described as underrated because of how both of their celebrity profiles have been raised since bionics release in 2010 mesfin fekadu for huffington post concurred with hampp in respect that she also thought that blank page was reminiscent of songs co written by furler on bionic which she also described that album s highlight jon caramanica of new york times thought that blank page along with sing for me depicted flashes of old aguilera and that her voice veers volcanic on songs as she raise key as songs progress annie zaleski of a v club praised blank page and sing for me writing that they are minimal piano ballads on which aguilera discusses working through regret and reclaiming her sense of self respectively spare music lets her still powerful voice dominate and her impassioned delivery conveys how meaningful these songs are to her sarah godfrey of washington post commented that song is about hackneyed metaphors and big notes just sort of combination that will appeal to fans of aguilera s signature song beautiful idolator critic mike wass complimented aguilera s ability to tone it down on song but he was surprised at level of simplicity considering furler s alternative leanings he did however describe it as album s most straightforward ballad and as a song which could have been written in 1972 with its with its yearning lyrics and sparse production live performance aguilera performed blank page for first time live at 39th people s choice awards on january 9 2013 she was surrounded by white candles and she wore a white blaze with black leggings according to reports published by us weekly aguilera was very emotional prior to her performance and that audience was in tears during her rehearsals of song lauren of cbs news called it a heart wrenching performance amy sciarretto for popcrush wrote that it was a simple and unfettered performance that allowed her to show off her vocals she continued to write that although she occasionally sounded strained she sounded better than most singers on their good day after her performance she was presented with people s voice award where she also gave an acceptance speech credits and personnel
