washington v texas 388 u s 14 1967 is a united states supreme court case in which court decided that compulsory process clause of sixth amendment to constitution guaranteeing right of a criminal defendant to force attendance of witnesses for their side is applicable in state courts as well as federal courts jackie washington had attempted to call his co defendant as a witness but was blocked by texas courts because state law prevented co defendants from testifying for each other under theory that they would be likely to lie for each other on stand supreme court reasoned that due process clause of fourteenth amendment made right to be able to compel defense witnesses to testify necessary for a defendant s due process rights to fair proceedings which applies to states only justice john marshall harlan ii parted from court s due process focus though he agreed with outcome as he regularly did in cases involving whether to apply federal rights to state courts impact of washington was narrowed by a later case taylor v illinois 1988 taylor v illinois in which court said that countervailing public interests like need to move through cases quickly could be balanced against a defendant s right to present witnesses in taylor supreme court upheld a judge s order blocking defense witnesses from testifying due to defense attorney s deliberate failure to disclose evidence to prosecutors earlier in trial defense attorney s actions resulted in a lengthy delay in proceedings which trial judge felt was unjustified legal scholars have seen this new grant of discretion to trial judges as a change to relying on efficient justice a more limited vision of trial rights than right to present a defense created in washington background history of compulsory process clause jurisprudence ratification of sixth amendment compulsory process clause was ratified as part of sixth amendment to united states constitution in bill of rights in 1791 it accords a criminal defendant right to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor clause was included among other rights e g right to a notice of charges as a foundation for how federal criminal justice would operate faretta v california originally sixth amendment was only applicable to federal government despite ratification of clause compulsory process was not originally interpreted to permit co defendants to testify for each other washington 388 u s at 18 20 states relied on a fear that two defendants would both swear other out of charge to prevent either defendant from being convicted benson v united states in benson v united states 1892 supreme court explained underlying common law theory for this prohibition namely that only witnesses who were unaffected as a party by result and free from any of temptations of interest could testify benson 146 u s at 336 federal courts accepted these common law rules and expressly applied them in united states v reid 1852 in reid court held that common law pertaining to criminal procedure in force at time of constitution s ratification would be applied in federal courts this effectively kept bar on co defendant testimony united states v reid while reid was overruled on different grounds in 1918 it stated general practice for co defendants as witnesses that existed before fourteenth amendment application to states after passage of fourteenth amendment in 1868 supreme court dealt with a series of cases regarding scope of that amendment s due process clause this clause says that nor shall any state deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law court initially rejected an argument that due process clause applied to state governments in hurtado v california 1884 a case concerning right to a grand jury hearing justice matthews writing for majority of court reasoned that amendment prescribing due process of law is too vague and indefinite to operate as a practical restraint hurtado v california while this decision rejected an expanded reach of due process clause court stated that clause did protect against state encroachment on fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at base of all our civil and political institutions hurtado left open question of what fundamental principles of liberty and justice would be protected in 1897 court held in chicago burlington quincy railroad v chicago 1897 that fifth amendment s just compensation clause relating to eminent domain takings was an essential element of due process of law ordained by fourteenth amendment to point that a chicago taking of railroad property was within meaning of that amendment chicago burlington quincy railroad v chicago in finding that application of due process clause court said that just compensation constituted a vital principle of republican institutions without which almost all other rights would become worthless in same year as railroad takings case court evaluated what procedural trial rights implicated fundamental principles of liberty expressed in hurtado in hovey v elliot supreme court specifically applied due process clause to some fair trial guarantees holding that due process secures an inherent right of defense hovey v elliott despite that broad statement court emphasized that due to procedural issues with case itself our opinion is therefore exclusively confined to case before us hovey 167 u s at 444 445 a decade after hovey supreme court announced its first rule for how due process clause of fourteenth amendment would be applied in twining v new jersey 1908 court held that it is possible that some of personal rights safeguarded by first eight amendments against national action may also be safeguarded against state action because a denial of them would be a denial of due process of law twining v new jersey this understanding of meaning of due process opened up possibility that bill of rights could be applied to states specifically court said in twining that test was whether right was embedded in very idea of free government this test endorsed a selective incorporation approach meaning one that would evaluate whether to apply a right to states on a case by case basis selective incorporation principle was expanded on further in palko v connecticut 1937 where court examined whether right against double jeopardy should be incorporated against states in palko court stated that specific guarantees in bill of rights could be applied to states if right was found to be implicit in concept of ordered liberty palko v connecticut though eight justices agreed that double jeopardy right was not implicit in concept of ordered liberty palko test has remained standard for incorporating rights against state and local governments expansion of procedural trial rights after palko court examined bill of rights protections one by one despite this incremental approach court would eventually apply most rights to states in realm of criminal procedure this doctrine eventually came to protect defendant s ability to present exculpatory evidence and testimony of witnesses for example court in brady v maryland 1963 used due process clause to require state prosecution authorities to disclose evidence that is favorable to a defendant prior to trial court s due process jurisprudence was expanded with 1948 decision in in re oliver which revised breadth of fundamental fairness right court wrote washington s trial jackie washington was charged with first degree murder in dallas at trial washington testified on his own behalf and he put a great deal of blame on an accomplice named charles fuller he testified that fuller had been carrying murder weapon a shotgun at scene when he sought to have fuller testify to back up his story trial judge blocked him on basis of a texas statute which provided that persons charged or convicted as co participants in same crime could not testify for one another law however did not block a co participant from testifying for state washington was convicted and sentenced to 50 years in prison his conviction was subsequently upheld by texas court of criminal appeals texas s highest criminal court in 1966 court of criminal appeals which reasoned that compulsory process clause did not affect how state treated competency of a witness rejected washington s plea that fuller should have been allowed to testify washington then petitioned u s supreme court to hear his case and supreme court granted review opinion of court thumb right upright chief justice earl warren wrote majority opinion in washington alt chief justice earl warren chief justice earl warren wrote opinion of court which spoke for eight justices in reversing texas court of criminal appeals warren began by stating that court had never been previously called upon to decide whether right of accused to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor is so fundamental that it is incorporated in due process clause because of incorporation to states of other procedural guarantees right to offer testimony of witnesses could be given no less weight warren wrote that it was critical to ability to present a defense a defendant s version of facts this broad right was necessary to detail thoroughly he wrote because ignoring how right would actually be applied would risk making right to compel witnesses futile after determining that sixth amendment s right to compulsory process is applicable in this state proceeding i e that compulsory process clause applied to states question became whether specific instance of washington s trial was an unconstitutional deprivation of that right despite common law restriction against co defendants testifying for each other warren noted that federal courts had refused to be bound by dead hand of common law since 1918 rosen v united states along with precedent of prior federal court decisions fact that there were a great deal of exceptions to this rule demonstrated absurdity of rule itself washington 388 u s at 22 specifically under texas statute which allowed a defendant acquitted at a separate trial to testify for other defendant at other s trial law leaves co defendant free to testify when he has a great incentive to perjury but bars his testimony in situations where he has a lesser motive to lie warren concluded that nature of texas law at issue denied washington right for a fair trial using witnesses who could testify to relevant and material facts in case here while not entirely relying on finding court saw law as arbitrary because its discrimination between prosecution and defense served no rational relationship to any goal of preventing perjury further idea that a competent witness was barred from testifying in and of itself was held to be an unconstitutional on part of state legislature court s decision upheld importance of juries in evaluating truth and credibility of witnesses statements despite adopting a broad principle court did not list any specific rules for how trial judges were to balance evidentiary standards and right of defendant to secure witnesses in his or her favor harlan s concurrence thumb right upright associate justice john marshall harlan ii wrote a separate concurring opinion in washington justice harlan who agreed with decision to reverse texas court s judgment but not with majority s reasoning wrote a short separate concurring opinion he repeated his position that due process clause did not incorporate bill of rights to states rather bill of rights was a rational continuum which broadly speaking includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints he isolated texas law s distinction between co defendant testifying for state while being barred from testifying for defendant as having no justification thus he rejected holding trial unconstitutional on compulsory process clause grounds he argued instead that state s arbitrary bar against a criminal defendant s calling a co defendant as a witness for his side while allowing co defendant to testify for prosecution violated due process clause subsequent developments in two cases after washington court pulled back from its broad principle that a defendant in a criminal proceeding has a right to a defense in united states v valenzuela bernal 1982 court held that an argument by government that it had an interest in deporting illegal aliens some witnesses in case outweighed defendant s right to eye witness testimony united states v valenzuela bernal additionally in taylor v illinois 1988 court held that countervailing public interests could also outweigh defendant s compulsory process rights in taylor a series of deliberate discovery violations by defense counsel at trial led trial judge to block attempts at postponing proceedings to allow a further undisclosed defense witness chance to testify judge had held that there must be some sanction against defense for their failure to disclose witnesses earlier in case a divided court upheld trial judge s preclusion of witness adding a new framework for balancing a defendant s right to a robust defense with a series of other factors namely new framework required looking at state s interest in efficient justice state s interest in excluding evidence lacking integrity state s interest in a strong judicial authority with followed rules and prosecution interest in avoiding prejudice due to a defendant s discovery violation analysis and commentary analysis of washington has focused on decision in broader context of procedural trial rights a 2007 article in georgetown law review by martin hewett was critical of decision hewett s main criticism was based on court s lack of a standard on which to evaluate whether certain evidence was material to a defendant s case hewett noted that in a post washington decision in 1973 court applied a case specific decision rather than a general constitutional standard this line of decisions hewett argued led to a standard which allows a trial judge authority to determine actual reliability of evidence in cases where a witness is not present newly seized power was limited to cases at hand in a manner which suggested ambiguous calculus court was using was flawed this vagueness in standard came from cases where situations involved reliability of excluded evidence that could factfinder hewett concluded by arguing that all of these cases had diminished protections of jury and of defendant s right to have his own defense an article in american criminal law review published in 2011 by stacey kime disagreed with some of hewett s arguments kime argued that it is well settled that criminal defendants have a constitutional right to present exculpatory evidence disagreeing with idea that basis for a robust defense had been gutted instead she blamed incoherent standard today on a lack of understanding of where source of this constitutional right to have a strong defense lies unlike hewett who targeted post washington decisions kime believed that there were flaws in washington opinion itself specifically she argued that court s reasoning was not only unnecessary but washington doctrine itself is inconsistent with sixth amendment s history and text in her review of history behind sixth amendment kime argued that james madison could have drafted a more comprehensive right to call for evidence as existed in virginia declaration of rights but failed to do so with this context in mind she said compulsory process clause likely enshrined right to subpoena witnesses and have a fair trial rather than a broader right to have a defense kime s analysis concluded by stating that decision in washington had put unnecessary tension between two
