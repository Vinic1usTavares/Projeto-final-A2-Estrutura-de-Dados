divine healing and premillennial second coming of christ justification by faith pentecostal holiness church believes that no amount of good works can achieve justification or salvation this is achieved only on basis of our faith in shed blood resurrection and justifying righteousness of christ good works however are a product of salvation when we believe on jesus christ as our savior our

holiness church phc believes that for christian there is not only justification and forgiveness for actual transgressions but also complete cleansing of justified believer from all indwelling sin and from its pollution 9 cleansing our beliefs accessed january 14 2011 this cleansing is not maturity but a crisis experience and a definite instantaneous work of grace obtainable by faith church

clean and consecrated life free from sin strife and pride and must avoid attitudes and actions that tend to grieve or quench holy spirit pentecostal holiness church distinguishes initial evidence of spirit baptism which all believers experience when spirit baptized from gift of tongues which is not given to every spirit filled believer speaking in tongues is only first sign of spirit baptism other evidence that will follow spirit baptism include fruit of spirit power to witness for christ and power to endure of faith and oppositions of world besides speaking in tongues other spiritual
