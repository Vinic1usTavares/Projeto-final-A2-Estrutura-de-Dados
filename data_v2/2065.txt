in 1896 william mckinley was elected president of united states mckinley a republican and former governor of ohio defeated joint democratic and populist nominee william jennings bryan as well as minor party candidates mckinley s decisive victory in what is sometimes seen as a realigning election ended a period of close presidential contests and ushered in an era of dominance for republican party mckinley was born in 1843 in niles ohio after service as an army officer in civil war he became a lawyer and settled in canton ohio in 1876 he was elected to congress and he remained there most of time until 1890 when he was defeated for re election in a gerrymandered district by this time he was considered a likely presidential candidate especially after being elected governor in 1891 and 1893 mckinley had incautiously co signed loans of a friend and demands for repayment were made on him when his friend went bankrupt in panic of 1893 personal insolvency would have removed mckinley as a factor in 1896 campaign but he was rescued from this by businessmen who supported him led by his friend and political manager mark hanna with that obstacle removed hanna built mckinley s campaign organization through 1895 and 1896 mckinley refused to deal with eastern bosses such as thomas platt and matthew quay and they tried to block his nomination by encouraging state favorite son candidates to run and prevent mckinley from getting a majority of delegate votes at republican national convention which might force him to make deals on political patronage their efforts were in vain as large efficient mckinley organization swept him to a first ballot victory at convention with new jersey s garret hobart as his running mate mckinley was a noted protectionist and was confident of winning an election fought on that question but it was free silver that became issue of day with bryan capturing democratic nomination as a foe of gold standard hanna raised millions for a campaign of education with trainloads of pamphlets to convince voters that free silver would be harmful and once that had its effect even more were printed on protectionism mckinley stayed at home in canton running a front porch campaign and reaching millions through newspaper coverage of speeches he gave to organized groups of people this contrasted with bryan who toured nation by rail in his campaign supported by well to do urban dwellers and prosperous farmers mckinley won a majority of popular vote and an easy victory in electoral college mckinley s approach to gaining presidency laid groundwork for modern campaigns and he forged an electoral coalition that would keep republicans in power most of time until 1932 background thumb left upright william mckinley william mckinley was born in niles ohio in 1843 he left college to work as a teacher and enlisted in union army when american civil war broke out in 1861 he served throughout war ending it as a brevet major afterwards he attended albany law school in new york state and was admitted to bar in ohio he settled in canton ohio after practicing law there he was elected to congress in 1876 and except for short periods served there until 1891 in 1890 he was defeated for re election but he was elected governor following year serving two two year terms in latter part of 19th century ohio was deemed a crucial battleground state taking its electoral votes was thought essential for a republican to win white house one way of hopefully assuring victory there was to nominate a son of ohio between 1865 and 1929 every republican president who first gained his office by election that is rather than succeeding on death of his predecessor was born in ohio deadlocked republican conventions in 1876 1880 and 1888 turned to men born in ohio and in each case nominee won presidency thus any successful ohio republican was a plausible president one of mckinley s rivals among ohio contenders was governor joseph b foraker but foraker s light dimmed when he was defeated for a third two year term in 1889 there were strong factional conflicts within ohio republican party one source of bitterness was 1888 republican national convention ohio republicans had endorsed state s senior senator john sherman for president this was sherman s third attempt at republican nomination among his supporters were cleveland industrialist mark hanna and governor foraker whom hanna had to that point strongly supported after repeated balloting sherman did not get close to number of delegate votes needed to nominate and when rumors swept convention that party s 1884 nominee former maine senator james g blaine might enter race foraker expressed willingness to support blaine this dealt a serious blow to sherman s candidacy by showing division in his home state and nomination went to former indiana senator benjamin harrison who was ohio born and went on to be elected mckinley had received some delegate votes and his action in refusing to consider a candidacy while pledged to support sherman impressed mark hanna industrialist was outraged at foraker and abandoned him mckinley and hanna shared similar political views including support for a tariff to protect and encourage american industry and in years following 1888 hanna became a strong supporter of mckinley thumb upright although mckinley did not run in 1892 duke tobacco company considered him a presidential possibility that year and issued a card for him alt a cigarette card bearing a colour image of a politician denoted to be william mckinley jr of ohio grey haired man s head points to left with a neutral expression revenue from tariffs was then a major source of income for federal government there was no federal income tax and tariff debates were passionate 1888 presidential election had them as a major issue many democrats supported a tariff for revenue only that is purpose of tariffs should be to finance government not to encourage american manufacturers mckinley disagreed with that and sponsored mckinley tariff of 1890 this act passed by republican dominated congress raised rates on imports to protect american industry mckinley s tariff proved unpopular among many people who had to pay increased prices and was seen as a reason not only for his defeat for re election to congress in 1890 but also for republicans losing control of both house and senate in that year s midterm elections nevertheless mckinley s defeat did not in end damage his political prospects as democrats were blamed for gerrymandering him out of his seat sometime between 1888 and 1890 mckinley decided to run for president but to have a realistic chance of attaining that goal he needed to regain office foraker s ambition then was senate he planned to challenge sherman in legislative election to be held in january 1892 and he agreed to nominate mckinley for governor at state convention in columbus mckinley was elected and sherman narrowly turned back foraker s challenge with considerable help from hanna harrison had proven unpopular even in his own party and by start of 1892 mckinley was talked about as a potential presidential candidate mckinley s name was not offered in nomination at 1892 republican national convention where he served as permanent chairman but some delegates voted for him anyway and he finished third behind harrison who won a first ballot victory and blaine hanna had sought support from delegates but his and mckinley s strategy is uncertain due to lack of surviving documents according to hanna biographer william t horner mckinley s behavior at convention supports idea that he liked attention but was not ready for a campaign according to mckinley biographer h wayne morgan many delegates saw in mckinley their nominee for 1896 gaining nomination preparing for a run 350px thumb right pioneer cleveland puck magazine cartoon shows republicans following path of gold standard which president grover cleveland right has

1893 president harrison left office proclaiming nation s prosperity but in may amid economic uncertainty that caused many people to convert assets into gold stock market crashed and many firms went bankrupt depression that ensued became known as panic of 1893 among those who became insolvent in 1893 was a mckinley friend robert walker mckinley had co signed promissory notes for walker and thought total to be 17 000 walker had deceived mckinley telling governor that fresh loans were renewals of old ones and total indebtedness for which mckinley had made himself liable was over 130 000 that sum was beyond mckinley s means and he planned to resign and earn money as a lawyer he was rescued by hanna and other wealthy supporters who raised money to pay loans according to mckinley biographer kevin phillips governor s backers paid off cosigned notes so that mckinley by now probable next president did not need to go back to practicing law public sympathized with mckinley for his financial trouble and he was easily re elected as governor in late 1893 at that time united states for all practical purposes was on gold standard many democrats and some republicans felt that gold standard limited economic growth and supported bimetallism making silver legal tender as it had been until passage of coinage act of 1873 doing so would likely be inflationary permitting holders of silver to deposit bullion at mints and receive payment for about twice silver s 1896 market value many farmers faced with long decline in agricultural prices that persisted through first half of 1890s felt that bimetallism would expand money supply and make it easier to pay their debts cleveland was a firm supporter of gold standard and believed massive amounts of silver backed currency issued pursuant to sherman silver purchase act of 1890 had helped crash economy in 1893 he forced through act s repeal outraging western democrats such as nebraska congressman william jennings bryan democratic congress in 1894 passed wilson gorman tariff significantly lowering many rates from mckinley tariff of 1890 economy did not improve in 1894 and other cleveland actions such as federal intervention to halt pullman strike further split his party 1894 election campaign saw democrats divided and electorate further split by new people s party or populists which had emerged from agricultural discontent there were more demands for mckinley to speak than he could possibly fulfill campaigning throughout eastern half of country on behalf of republican candidates and venturing even to new orleans in democratic solid south mckinley spoke to large enthusiastic crowds as often as 23 times in a day according to his biographer margaret leech mckinley s fervor was irresistible to his audiences he was better than a he was a vote getter whirlwind campaign of governor of ohio was a sensation of autumn 1894 elections saw democrats suffer greatest losses by a majority party in congressional history as republicans again took control of both houses first modern primary campaign thumb upright mckinley s close friend and adviser mark hanna outcome of 1894 elections made it increasingly likely that a republican would be next president at time presidential nominating process started much later than it subsequently would and mckinley in quietly organizing his campaign with hanna s aid in early months of 1895 was alone among candidates in acting so early other potential republican candidates were former president harrison incoming speaker of house thomas brackett reed of maine iowa senator william b allison and several state favorite sons such as illinois senator shelby cullom if former president harrison entered race he would immediately become a major contender and uncertainty over his status hung over race in 1895 at time unless there was an incumbent elected republican president nomination was generally not decided until convention with state political bosses and delegates exacting a price for their support a candidate s efforts to gain nomination did not begin until shortly before state delegate conventions in spring of election year where fights over makeup of delegation often focused on who would be on it rather than who delegates would support mckinley and hanna decided on a systematic nationwide effort to gain nomination employing what onetime presidential adviser karl rove author of a 2015 book on 1896 race called first modern primary campaign to devote himself full time to mckinley s presidential campaign hanna in 1895 turned over management of his companies to his brother leonard and rented a house in thomasville georgia expressing a dislike for cleveland s winters he was joined there by william and ida mckinley in early 1895 location was a plausibly nonpolitical vacation spot for mckinley and also permitted him to meet many southern republicans including blacks although southern republicans rarely had local electoral success they elected a substantial number of delegates to national convention mckinley and hanna hosted many southern republican leaders in thomasville subsidizing those who did not have money to come and made many converts governor also traveled in south in savannah at end of march 1895 he became first presidential hopeful in american history to address an audience of blacks when he spoke at an african american church by time he left thomasville he had gained support of majority of likely southern delegates platt wrote mournfully in his autobiography that hanna had south practically solid before some of us awakened in giving attention to national affairs mckinley neglected his home front in ohio and when republican state convention met in zanesville in may 1895 it proved to be controlled by resurgent foraker who sought senate seat to be filled by ohio general assembly in january 1896 that convention endorsed mckinley for president and foraker for senate and nominated foraker supporters for state and party offices including asa bushnell to succeed mckinley as governor mckinley realized that it would be risky to have a faction hostile to presidential candidate within his home state and sought an alliance campaigning for bushnell and for a republican legislature that would send foraker to washington voters chose bushnell and gave state republicans a large majority in legislature in january 1896 foraker was overwhelmingly elected to take office in march 1897 and mckinley gained foraker s agreement to support him for president assuring party political peace at home thumb upright iowa senator william b allison was a contender for 1896 republican presidential nomination during 1895 hanna journeyed east to meet with political bosses there including pennsylvania senator matthew quay and thomas c platt of new york he returned to report that bosses were willing to assure mckinley s nomination in exchange for a pledge to give them control over patronage in their states and a promise in writing that platt would be treasury secretary mckinley was unwilling to deal seeking a nomination without strings and hanna though noting that this made his task much harder undertook to get it mckinley decided on a theme for his nomination campaign people against bosses with hanna s aid mckinley found talented men to run state organizations who would in turn find locals to ensure mckinley triumphed at series of conventions that would elect delegates to june 1896 republican convention in st louis notable among these appointments was charles g dawes in illinois a young banker and entrepreneur who had recently moved to chicago from nebraska where he had known congressman bryan in trying to organize illinois for mckinley dawes faced enmity of local republican bosses who preferred to take a delegation to st louis that would support senator cullom until bosses made right deal mckinley left office as governor in january 1896 in february harrison made it clear that he would not seek a third nomination hanna s operatives immediately organized harrison s home state of indiana for mckinley with a haste that former president privately found unseemly by early 1896 reed and allison campaigns were beginning to form themselves but they had little luck in indiana mckinley challenged his rivals everywhere except in states such as iowa that he deemed had serious candidates like senator allison favorite son candidacies of minnesota senator cushman k davis and former nebraska senator charles f fell victim to mckinley forces well financed by hanna who took their states away from them mckinley was disliked by american protective association an anti catholic group angered that as governor he had appointed to office members of that faith their wide caused hanna to act against falsehoods that his candidate was a catholic according to historian stanley jones in his account of 1896 campaign another feature common to reed and allison campaigns was their failure to make headway against tide which was running toward mckinley in fact both campaigns from moment they were launched were in retreat in march and april 1896 state conventions in ohio michigan california indiana and other states elected delegates to national convention instructed to vote for mckinley in new england mckinley made inroads into reed s regional support as new hampshire proclaimed no preference between speaker and mckinley and vermont convention expressed support for mckinley ohioan was not successful everywhere iowa remained loyally behind allison morton won a majority of new york delegation and bosses were successful in denying mckinley in new mexico territory and oklahoma territory contest was still undetermined going into april 29 illinois state convention with mckinley forces led by dawes against local bosses mckinley gained most of illinois delegates giving him a sizable lead and influencing remaining state conventions to jump on his bandwagon mckinley remained well ahead when state conventions concluded leaving his opponents only hope republican national committee rnc which would make initial rulings on which delegates would be seated there were contested seats or rival delegations in several states and rulings against mckinley could still deprive him of a first ballot majority when rnc met in mid june just prior to convention mckinley was easily victorious in almost all cases republican convention 1896 republican national convention convened at wigwam a temporary structure in st louis on june 16 with most credentials battles settled in mckinley s favor roll of delegates drawn up by rnc heavily favored ohioan though reed allison morton and quay remained in race credentials report served as a test vote which mckinley forces won easily hanna who was a delegate from ohio was in full control of convention thumb left 300px louis dalrymple cartoon from puck magazine june 24 1896 shows mckinley

supporters of free silver mckinley s advisors had anticipated there would be strong feelings about currency question and pressed candidate for a decision on what party platform should say on subject mckinley had hoped to avoid this issue his surrogates had presented him as firmly for gold standard in east where support for that policy was strong western supporters who often favored silver were told he was sympathetic to bimetallic cause in following years several mckinley associates including publisher h h kohlsaat and wisconsin s henry c payne took credit for including an explicit mention of gold standard in platform s currency plank for they deemed it vital to republican victory in november but it was not inserted in draft until hanna consulted with mckinley by telephone silver republicans from west were led by colorado senator henry m teller who drafted a plank promoting free silver only to see it voted down in drafting committee and in full platform committee teller was determined to have full convention vote on his language although it was certain he would lose as most republican delegates favored gold standard debate was held on june 18 after teller s minority report was voted down and gold plank adopted by an overwhelming majority 23 delegates including teller and his senate colleagues frank cannon of utah and fred dubois of idaho walked out of convention and thus left republican party amid a tumultuous scene an angry hanna was seen standing on a chair shouting at departing men go go go although platt desired a recess hanna refused wanting convention to complete its work that day and delegates proceeded to presidential nomination mckinley had insisted that foraker nominate him to demonstrate unity of ohio republican party and after some reluctance by senator elect who feared blame if anything went wrong foraker agreed mckinley was waiting with family and friends at his house in canton being kept up to date by telegraph and telephone he was able to listen to part of foraker s speech and tremendous reception that met it over phone line mckinley was easily nominated on first ballot with reed his nearest competitor canton erupted in celebration with mckinley making speech after speech to townsfolk and to those who poured in that day by rail from across ohio even from his birthplace of niles thumb garret hobart of new jersey mckinley s running mate this left question of vice presidential candidate mckinley had offered second place on ticket to reed who had refused it platt wanted morton who had been vice president under harrison new york governor did not want it and mckinley did not want him it was usual at that time for major party tickets to have one candidate from ohio or indiana and other from new york but with that state having supported morton for nomination putting a new yorker on ticket would be an unmerited reward rnc vice chairman garret hobart was from paterson new jersey near to new york city he was a businessman lawyer and former state legislator and was acceptable to hanna and other republican backers while being popular among party activists several days before convention mckinley chose him as running mate though no announcement was made at convention hobart expressed surprise in a letter to his wife but his selection had been strongly rumored and buttons with his name and mckinley s seen in st louis delegates ratified selection of hobart nominating him on first ballot general election campaign getting an opponent in days after republican convention mckinley remained in canton hanna had been elected chairman of rnc during convention he established campaign headquarters in chicago in electorally crucial midwest appointed an executive committee and began to organize campaign which as chairman was his responsibility mckinley oversaw activities of hanna and other key managers and addressed delegations of workers who came to visit him he met with hobart who came to canton on a brief visit on june 30 1896 and who joined his running mate in speaking to a crowd of visitors in his speeches mckinley concentrated on tariffs which he expected to dominate campaign and gave short shrift to currency question as mckinley awaited his opponent he privately commented on nationwide debate over silver stating to his canton crony judge william r day this money matter is unduly prominent in thirty days you won t hear anything about it future secretary of state and supreme court justice responded in my opinion in thirty days you won t hear of anything else at time mckinley was nominated it was not clear who his democratic rival would be cleveland s opponents within his party had mobilized into an organized effort to take over democratic party and pass a platform supporting free silver platform was deemed of highest priority and only once that fight was won was a candidate for president to be considered despite this resolution several democrats sought nomination with foremost being former missouri representative richard p bland and former iowa governor horace boies others either seeking or spoken of for nomination included south carolina senator benjamin tillman senator joseph c blackburn of kentucky and former nebraska representative william jennings bryan thumb left upright william jennings bryan seen during 1896 campaign alt a man in his thirties wearing a dark suit holds his hands together in front of him as he looks to his right in background can be seen stars and stripes dawes had known bryan in nebraska and predicted that if former congressman got to address convention he would use his skills as a speaker to stampede it to a nomination mckinley and hanna mocked dawes telling him that bland would be democratic choice 1896 democratic national convention opened in chicago on july 7 with silverites in full control they drafted a platform supporting free silver final speaker during debate on platform was former congressman bryan who with dawes in gallery delivered a speech decrying gold standard that to democrats according to phillips was messianic a call to arms dawes deemed his friend s cross of gold speech magnificent though with weak logic but it won bryan presidential nomination and phillips noted that address unnerved midwestern republicans mindful of their own distrust of east and threw a weighty stone into quiet pool of june gop electoral assumptions when journalist murat halstead telephoned mckinley from chicago to inform him that bryan would be nominated he responded dismissively and hung up phone bryan s nomination briefly gratified republicans believing that his selection would lead to an easy victory for mckinley in those days when presidential campaign did not begin in earnest until september hanna had planned a vacation while mckinley anticipated a quiet summer republicans were caught by surprise by wave of enthusiasm that bryan s speech and nomination caused and scuttled these plans as hanna wrote to mckinley on july 16 chicago convention has changed everything fundraising and organization thumb upright mckinley lower right running his campaign from library of his canton home hanna quickly realized that currency issue struck an emotional chord in many americans and decided on a campaign to persuade voter that sound money gold standard unless modified by international agreement was much preferable to bimetallism such propaganda would not be cheap as before age of television and radio most effective way of reaching electorate was through written word and through public speakers who would address meetings on behalf of candidate this would take money and hanna undertook to secure it from his corporate connections as hanna began his fundraising efforts in late july populists met in st louis faced with splitting silver vote they chose to endorse bryan beginning their dissolution as a party large sums had to be spent quickly and hanna energetically built a businesslike campaign bryan s surge contributed to a sense of crisis that enabled hanna to make peace in his party eventually uniting all behind mckinley with exception of some silver republicans but as campaign began operations and began them on a huge scale money was short hanna initially spent much of his time in new york where many financiers were based he faced resistance at first both because he was not yet widely known on national scene and because some moneymen although appalled at democratic position on currency issue felt bryan was so extreme that mckinley was sure to win others were disappointed new york governor morton was not presidential nominee but their support became warmer as they came to know mckinley and hanna reports of bryan support in crucial midwest and intervention by hanna s old schoolmate john d rockefeller his standard oil gave 250 000 made executives more willing to listen after a gloomy august for campaign s fundraising in september corporate moguls opened their purse strings to hanna j p morgan gave 250 000 dawes recorded an official figure for fundraising of 3 570 397 13 twice what republicans had raised in 1892 and as much as ten times what bryan may have had to spend dawes figure did not include fundraising by state and local committees nor in kind donations such as railroad fare discounts which were heavily subsidized for republican political travelers including delegations going to see mckinley estimates of what republicans may have raised in total have ranged as high as 16 5 million from his house on north market street in canton mckinley ran his campaign with telephone and telegraph at his disposal hanna was busy meeting with executives to extract funds and delegated much of day to day policymaking to others most prominently dawes who was a member of campaign executive committee and was responsible for distributing much of money that hanna raised payne was nominally in charge of chicago office but dawes a member of mckinley inner circle had more influence pamphlets were sent from chicago in carload lots across country campaign spent almost 500 000 on printing alone which stanley jones in his account of 1896 campaign estimated paid for hundreds of millions of pamphlets campaign paid for hundreds of speakers to stump on mckinley s behalf efforts were made to keep expenses down dawes insisted on competitive bidding and most of his top level hires were business associates not political operatives others prominent in chicago office included charles dick secretary of organization and later a senator front porch campaign from moment he was nominated mckinley was beset by supporters coming to canton to hail him hoping to hear him give a political speech mckinley remained in canton available to public every day but sunday continuously from his june nomination until election day in november excepting one trip in july to give previously arranged nonpolitical speeches in cleveland and at mount union college he also took one weekend of rest in late august need to greet and speak to supporters made it difficult for mckinley to get campaign work done one political club interrupted his conference with hobart in late june mckinley complained that his time was not being well managed bryan s announcement after gaining democratic nomination that he would undertake a nationwide tour by rail something then unusual for presidential candidates put pressure on mckinley to match him hanna especially urged his candidate to hit road mckinley decided against this feeling that he could not outdo bryan who was a brilliant stump speaker and that he would be foolish to try i might as well put up a trapeze on my front lawn and compete against some professional athlete as go out speaking against bryan i have to think when i speak furthermore no matter how mckinley traveled bryan would upstage him by choosing a less comfortable manner mckinley was unwilling to compete with bryan on democrat s terms and sought to find his own way to reach people front porch campaign that mckinley decided on was a natural extension of pilgrimages to canton by mckinley devotees that were already occurring after a few initial stumbles things settled into routine by mid september while any group could visit mckinley by writing in advance his campaign arranged for many of them and they came from towns small and large if possible group s leader was brought to canton in advance to confer with mckinley on what each would say if not group would be met at canton railroad station by a mckinley representative who would discuss what would be said with group s leader there were parades every day in canton that campaign season as groups marched through bunting draped streets escorted by a mounted troop known as mckinley home guards who saw to it that groups arrived at mckinley residence on a prearranged schedule there group leader would deliver his remarks and mckinley would deliver a reply often prepared in advance afterwards there might be refreshments or opportunity to shake hands with mckinley before delegation was escorted off for their return journey

logging and in his estimated 600 speeches reached some 5 000 000 listeners mckinley did not match those numbers speaking 300 times to 750 000 visitors but in remaining at home he avoided fatigue of bryan s exhausting tour republican was better able to provide fresh material for next day s newspapers without making gaffes bryan made several according to r hal williams in his book on 1896 campaign front porch campaign was a remarkable success issues and tactics bryan s nomination caused defections and divisions in republican party many farmers in midwest even in mckinley s ohio found inflation

families received mckinley campaign materials on a weekly basis among surrogates sent out on mckinley s behalf was newspaper editor warren g harding paid to make speeches across ohio future president made a positive impression and three years later was elected to ohio state senate beginning his political rise on his front porch mckinley urged sound money though he never ceased to promote protectionism to support american industry horner noted campaign effectively linked both gold and protectionism with patriotism mckinley felt that he could not campaign entirely on money issue as many midwestern republicans who supported silver considered protection major issue of campaign and would stay with party if it promoted tariffs these issues were given different emphases in east and south money issue was stressed most strongly while tariffs were given more attention in midwest mckinley had little support in mining dominated rocky mountain states where even most republicans were for silver and bryan on pacific coast where there was strong silver sentiment but where mckinley had some hope of winning tariff was made major issue mckinley soothed ruffled feathers of party by mail and in person though former president harrison refused to tour he gave a speech in new york where he railed against free silver stating first dirty errand that a dirty dollar does is to cheat workingman public was closely following campaign and republican efforts had their effect in september polls showed midwestern states leaning republican though silver supporting iowa was still close mckinley s running mate hobart continued to look after his law practice and business interests and was apparently a major contributor to republican campaign he helped to run new york office gave some speeches from his own front porch in paterson and in october went on a short campaign tour of new jersey though he was a reluctant public speaker hobart was much stronger for gold standard than was mckinley and made clear his views in his speeches thumb upright homer davenport s portrayal of mckinley hanna relationship william randolph hearst s new york journal was hostile to mckinley throughout campaign prior to republican convention alfred henry lewis accused hanna of acting on behalf of a syndicate controlling mckinley during general election campaign democratic newspapers especially papers owned by hearst attacked hanna for his supposed role as mckinley s political master these articles and cartoons have contributed to a lasting popular belief that mckinley was not his own man but that he was effectively owned by corporations through hanna homer davenport s cartoons for hearst papers were especially effective in molding public opinion about hanna who was often depicted as dollar mark in a suit decorated with dollar signs a term for which dollar mark was a common alternative mckinley s 1893 personal financial crisis allowed him to be convincingly depicted as a child helpless in hands of businessmen and their mere tool in 1896 campaign hearst and journal gave 41 000 to bryan s campaign one of largest democrats received but that amount was dwarfed by sums raised by hanna september saw maine and vermont go heavily republican in their state elections meaning northeast was likely safe for mckinley early in that month dissident democrats who favored gold standard and president cleveland s policies formed national democratic party or gold democrats meeting in indianapolis nomination of illinois senator john m palmer for president and former kentucky governor simon bolivar buckner for vice president meant bryan would have to overcome an electoral split in his party hanna applauded selection and predicted it would get large numbers of votes there was no chance palmer would win election and hanna saw to it that gold democrats were aided with quietly provided funds midwest was crucial battleground and both parties poured in their resources with bryan spending most of his time there as did hanna mckinley and hanna began to sense that flood of materials and speakers on silver question had had their effect in midwest dawes began to slow flow of pamphlets against silver and set loose a flood of material favoring mckinley s tariff policies events favored republicans wheat prices rose considerably in final weeks of campaign lessening enthusiasm of farmers for free silver democrats alleged that republicans were coercing workers into voting for mckinley on threat of losing their jobs hanna denied it and offered a reward for evidence that was not claimed to bryan s outrage hanna called for a flag day for final saturday october 31 as campaign again sought to link support for mckinley to patriotism a theme echoed by candidate as he addressed his final delegations hundreds of thousands marched through streets of nation s cities in honor of flag new york city saw its largest parade since 1865 election day was november 3 on its eve hanna and dawes predicted overwhelming victory election stanley jones wrote of 1896 campaign voters cast their ballots on november 3 and that evening gathered in cities and around telegraph offices in places like new york results were projected by onto sides of newspaper buildings election was considered by many to be most crucial since 1860 and large numbers of voters followed returns all night mckinley cast his ballot early going with his brother abner to polling place and met hanna for lunch that evening mckinley sat in his library as returns came in by telegraph it was quickly apparent that mckinley was leading and by midnight he had pencilled figure 241 on a pad number of electoral votes of states that were certain enough for victory hanna wired from cleveland to canton feeling here beggars description i will not attempt bulletins you are elected to highest office of land by a people who always loved and trusted you thumb left 350px map showing results of 1896 campaign with electoral votes won noted states won by mckinley are in red mckinley won entire northeast and midwest and broke into border states to win delaware maryland kentucky and west virginia he won north dakota and came close in south dakota kansas and in bryan s nebraska mckinley was also successful in california and oregon mckinley won with 7 1 million votes to bryan s 6 5 million 51 to 47 electoral vote was not as close 271 for mckinley to 176 for bryan mckinley increased republican vote by 2 000 000 from harrison s defeat in 1892 though bryan also increased democratic total bryan had hoped to sweep rural vote and make inroads on urban labor but he was not successful mckinley became first republican candidate to win in new york city and won in its rival city of brooklyn as well he lost only one city with a population of over 45 000 in midwest and won many rural counties in crucial states although bryan won all states south of kentucky and from texas east mckinley won most urban centers there irish immigrants generally remained loyal to democratic party but mckinley s promises of sound money attracted german americans who were appalled by bryan s inflationary proposals german americans had long been democratic efforts by that party to rebut mckinley including circulating a statement by bismarck in support of bimetallism were ineffective many catholics and recent immigrants favored mckinley because of dislike american protective association had for him appraisal karl rove saw several reasons for mckinley s triumph mckinley campaigned on big issues tariff and sound money candidate went after bryan s strongest issue silver arguing that bimetallism would harm americans and hit working class hardest mckinley s theme was that it was morally wrong to debase currency he linked his stand for sound money with tariff and with patriotism appealing to crucial voter blocs who gave mckinley biggest victory in a presidential election since grant in 1872 he reached out to immigrants and urban factory workers recognizing their importance in a changing america and to implement these strategies mckinley with hanna s aid created a larger more organized campaign structure than had previously been seen in presidential campaigns jones noted republican party under skillful leadership of mckinley and hanna produced a combination of votes which gave it victory in 1896 and which promised republican ascendency for many years in future 1896 presidential race is often considered a realigning election when there is a major shift in voting patterns upsetting political balance mckinley was supported by middle class and wealthy voters urban laborers and prosperous farmers this coalition would keep republicans mostly in power until 1930s mckinley s wooing of midwest would pay ample dividends in years to come as it remained solidly republican in most years until 1932 williams suggested that mckinley s campaign of education of voter through speakers and literature brought him victory but with a cost to close identification between voters and political parties that was typical in 19th century voter turnout was almost 80 percent in 1896 about average for presidential elections in late 19th century but then dropped substantially and remained at lower levels as voters who once participated in rallies and torchlight processions for candidates were distracted by radio and by professional sports nevertheless later campaigns tried to recapture magic of 1896 warren g harding conducted his own front porch campaign in 1920 even borrowing flagpole from mckinley s old front yard william d harpine studying mckinley s rhetoric during front porch campaign argued that mckinley s campaign was in some ways ahead of its time even in age of broadcasting most candidates for nationwide office embark on a campaign tour in 1896 long before advent of broadcasting mckinley accomplished same purpose as a modem candidate and did so without making a campaign tour visits of delegations to mckinley home in canton constituted a series of media events that mckinley used to get his speeches into newspapers in speaking from his front porch mckinley was not principally addressing delegations but many americans who would not visit canton and who would read speeches in newspapers williams agreed remarkable front porch campaign used modern technology to bring 750 000 visitors to his small hometown and dispatched his message nationwide rove while an advisor to texas governor george w bush during 2000 election campaign often spoke of parallels he saw between mckinley and his 1896 campaign and 2000 election going so far as to fax copies of books on mckinley media took parallels further than rove intended making comparisons between him and hanna hinting that rove controlled bush like it was said hanna controlled mckinley williams also saw lasting effect of mckinley s 1896 campaign a new approach to campaigning educational or merchandising style continues to mold campaigns today as does mckinley s focus on message hanna s use of money and dawes s reliance on efficiency and education more than a century later americans and their political leaders can still learn from events of 1890s whose lessons echo down years today harpine saw mckinley s personal touch as key to his successful race results a includes 222 583 votes as people s nominee b sewall was bryan s democratic running mate c watson was bryan s people s running mate source national archives usa election atlas notes and references notes references bibliography
