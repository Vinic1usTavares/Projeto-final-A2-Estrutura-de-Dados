1977 pacific hurricane season stands alongside 2010 as least active pacific hurricane season since reliable records began in 1971 only eight tropical storms formed throughout year four further intensified into hurricanes yet none strengthened into major hurricanes a category 3 or stronger on saffir simpson scale an occurrence not seen again until 2003 most tropical cyclones remained over open eastern pacific however remnants of hurricanes doreen and heather led to heavy rainfall which damaged or destroyed structures and flooded roadways throughout southwest united states notably hurricane anita which originally formed in gulf of mexico made rare trek across mexico into eastern pacific briefly existing as a tropical depression eight deaths were recorded while damage reached 39 6 million 1977 usd seasonal summary 1977 pacific hurricane season was an inactive season with first cyclone forming on may 26 and final system dissipating on october 23 only eight named storms were documented throughout year of those eight four intensified into hurricanes and none became major hurricanes defined as category 3 storms or stronger on saffir simpson scale number of tropical storms and major hurricanes stood solely as record lows until tied by 2010 and 2003 respectively additionally accumulated cyclone energy index for season was lowest in recorded history low activity seen in east pacific was a common occurrence around globe in 1977 with fewest tropical cyclones worldwide at 69 until 2010 recorded one fewer may june july and august all saw one named storm per month with one hurricane each in latter two months september was more active with three named storms of which one became a category 2 hurricane season came to an end in october with one named storm which intensified into a hurricane despite record low number of tropical storms numerous short lived tropical depressions existed throughout eastern pacific in 1977 like most of other cyclones however these caused little or no impact to land systems tropical storm ava an area of disturbed weather first formed within a larger thunderstorm complex well south southwest of acapulco mexico early on may 24 it moved northwest and slowly organized becoming a tropical depression by 00 00 utc on may 26 and further intensifying into tropical storm ava approximately twelve hours later system remained over warm waters as it moved west and then north allowing ava to reach a peak intensity of 65 mph 100 km h early on may 28 a series of subsequent reconnaissance aircraft missions documented an incomplete eye in association with storm although this organization soon began to fade amidst increasing wind shear and cooler ocean temperatures ava weakened to a tropical depression around 18 00 utc on may 29 and dissipated less than 24 hours later tropical storm bernice a tropical disturbance was first identified early on june 25 well southwest of acapulco mexico it quickly organized into a tropical depression twelve hours later while moving west northwest after strengthening into tropical storm bernice around 12 00 utc on june 26 cyclone was restricted from further development by entrainment of low level clouds from north instead bernice transitioned into an extratropical cyclone early on june 28 hurricane claudia a tropical disturbance embedded within a larger area of convective activity formed early on july 1 while well south of acapulco mexico on a westward heading disturbance coalesced into a tropical depression by 00 00 utc on june 3 and strengthened into tropical storm claudia six hours later rapid development ensued thereafter as an eye became evident on satellite imagery and claudia attained its peak intensity as a strong category 1 hurricane with winds of 90 mph 150 km h early on july 4 progression over colder waters caused system to weaken below hurricane strength by 00 00 utc on july 5 coincident with eye becoming obscured on satellite cyclone was downgraded to a tropical depression around 00 00 utc on july 7 and it ultimately dissipated six hours later hurricane doreen a tropical disturbance first formed early on august 11 it drifted west and organized into a tropical depression around 00 00 utc on august 13 before intensifying into tropical storm doreen a little under a day later data from a reconnaissance aircraft was used to upgrade system to a category 1 hurricane with winds of 75 mph 120 km h around 18 00 utc on august 14 this constituted storm s peak strength doreen turned north northwest thereafter briefly drifting onshore coastline of baja california near san carlos as a minimal hurricane it continued generally northwestward weakening to a tropical storm around 06 00 utc on august 16 before making a second landfall around punta eugenia baja california sur six hours later colder waters caused system to fall to tropical depression intensity early on august 17 and dissipate around 00 00 utc next day while located just south of california as doreen moved parallel to southwestern coastline of mexico it produced heavy rainfall there with accumulations peaking at 14 80 inches 375 9 mm near los cabos municipality farther northwest mexicali baja california was particularly hard hit with more than 2 000 people left homeless after their shanty style homes were demolished by rain despite dissipating as a tropical cyclone remnants of doreen continued into southwest united states resulting in maximum rainfall accumulations of 7 45 inches 189 mm in san jacinto mountains of california approximately 325 homes and businesses throughout desert southwest were destroyed and several roads were covered or washed out by floodwater across california and arizona throughout san diego california and nearby imperial county storm accrued 25 million in crop damage extensive damage to streets washes levees and dikes occurred throughout mohave valley particularly in bullhead city arizona where more than 50 people were evacuated and over 12 homes and businesses were heavily damaged strong thunderstorms with winds reaching up to 60 mph 95 km h downed trees and caused intermittent power outages in palm springs california farther east in las vegas nevada meanwhile less than 2 inches 51 mm of rain flooded major intersections and caused roofs to collapse throughout region eight people were reported dead tropical depression eleven anita on august 29 a tropical depression formed over gulf of mexico and tracked slowly west it quickly strengthened reaching hurricane strength within 30 hours of formation it eventually achieved category 5 status before striking northern mexico on september 2 mountainous terrain of mexico nearly caused anita to dissipate however its circulation survived crossing and emerged over pacific on september 3 as a tropical depression system featured a 300 miles 485 km wide area of convection and traveled west in response to a ridge over baja california depression traversed islas marias and soon moved over cooler waters prompting weakening lacking thermal support depression degenerated into a remnant low on september 3 off southern tip of baja california sur tropical storm emily emily first began as a disturbance early on september 12 it moved west northwest and developed into a tropical depression around 00 00 utc on september 13 surface observations from nearby ships were used to upgrade depression to a tropical storm twelve hours later despite persistent deep convective activity a trek over colder waters prevented emily from further intensifying and system instead transitioned into an extratropical cyclone around 12 00 utc on september 14 hurricane florence strongest cyclone of 1977 season began as a tropical disturbance over open eastern pacific it developed into a tropical depression around 12 00 utc on september 20 and strengthened into tropical storm florence twelve hours later newly formed system moved west northwest until reaching hurricane strength by 00 00 utc on september 22 at which point florence sharply curved toward north northeast with a well defined eye on satellite imagery storm reached peak winds of 105 mph 165 km h around 18 00 utc on september 22 a category 2 hurricane florence accelerated over increasingly cool ocean temperatures causing it to weaken to a tropical storm early on september 23 weaken to a tropical depression early on september 24 and transition to an extratropical cyclone by 12 00 utc that day tropical storm glenda tropical storm glenda formed around 00 00 utc on september 24 from a previously established area of disturbed weather well southwest of acapulco storm did not intensify beyond minimal tropical storm strength and instead fell to tropical depression strength around 00 00 utc on september 25 a north to northwestward forward motion brought cyclone over progressively cooler waters and it transitioned to an extratropical cyclone by 06 00 utc on september 27 while located near punta eugenia baja california sur hurricane heather final named storm of season began as a tropical disturbance late on october 3 it moved west northwest organizing into a tropical depression around 00 00 utc on october 4 and further intensifying into tropical storm heather six hours thereafter a sprawling storm heather reached hurricane strength early on october 5 and attained peak winds of 85 mph 140 km h by 12 00 utc that day a turn toward north northwest however brought storm over increasingly cool waters prompting a weakening trend heather fell to tropical storm strength late on october 6 and further to a tropical depression by 12 00 utc as its low and mid level circulations became dislocated marking an end to its time as a tropical cyclone remnants continued into arizona where measurable rainfall peaked at 8 30 in 211 mm with unspecified reports of up to 14 inches 356 mm in mountainous locales as a result santa cruz river near tucson witnessed its highest discharge since at least 1892 and san pedo river saw its sixth highest crest since 1913 at least 16 000 acres 6 500 hectares of farmland were inundated and about 90 homes were damaged mainly near nogales arizona though some property damage occurred throughout amado green valley and sahuarita as well in addition about 175 families were evacuated from nogales in aftermath of rains residents were asked to conserve water after city s wells were inundated with mud and rendered unusable two bridges were destroyed while an additional twelve to fifteen were damaged in addition to telephone lines and other utilities damage equated to about 14 6 million other systems despite season featuring lowest number of tropical storms on record at time there were numerous tropical depressions that failed to intensify into named storms first two tropical depressions existed from may 25 30 and from may 30 june 1 both west of honduras nicaragua border tropical depressions six and seven occurred in quick succession from july 8 9 and july 9 10 respectively tropical depression eight occurred solely on july 25 while tropical depression nine existed from august 1 2 yet another cyclone existed from september 3 4 while seventeenth and final unnamed system formed on october 22 and dissipated on next day storm names following list of names was used for named storms that formed in eastern north pacific in 1977 this is same list used in 1973 season this is also final year that this list was used as practice of using all female names for tropical cyclones was replaced with a mixture of male and female names beginning in 1978 ava bernice claudia doreen emily florence glenda heather see also list of pacific hurricanes list of pacific hurricane seasons 1977 atlantic hurricane season 1977
