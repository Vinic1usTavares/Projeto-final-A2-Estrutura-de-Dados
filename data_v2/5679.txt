guitar hero 5 initially referred to as guitar hero v is a music rhythm game and fifth main entry in guitar hero series and twelfth overall ninth on home consoles game was developed by neversoft and published by activision and released internationally in september 2009 for playstation 2 playstation 3 wii and xbox 360 consoles similar to preceding title guitar hero world tour guitar hero 5 is geared towards playing in a four person band experience including lead and bass guitar drums and vocals game is available as a standalone title allowing players to use existing compatible instrument controllers and as a bundle that provides these controllers guitar hero 5 adds several new features such as drop in drop out play bands composed of any combination of available instruments a rockfest competitive mode consisting of several various scoring mechanisms and both song specific and general challenges to unlock new avatars clothing and other extras in game many of these changes were added to make game a more social experience allowing players across a range of skill levels to be able to play cooperatively and competitively against each other both locally and online guitar hero 5 s track list contains 85 songs by 83 separate artists and like previous guitar hero games several musicians with works in game have been modeled through motion capture for playable characters in game including johnny cash carlos santana shirley manson matthew bellamy and kurt cobain players can also create their own character and instrument to play with game continues to support user created music studio introduced in world tour through ghtunes and additional downloadable content for game was also made available a majority of existing downloadable tracks from world tour are forward compatible with guitar hero 5 along with selected on disc tracks from world tour and guitar hero smash hits and songs from game could also be exported for a fee to play in its sequel guitar hero warriors of rock and spin off game band hero game was well received by reviewers who appreciated improvements in accessibility of game allowing players to immediately jump in and play without spending excessive time in game s menus game also sold well however it sold about less than 50 percent of guitar hero world tour s sales specifically selling 1 2 million copies across all platforms improvements to both career and competitive multiplayer modes were also highlights of game however game s track list was considered to be too broad and controversy arose over ability to use avatar of kurt cobain to perform in any other song within game gameplay gameplay in guitar hero 5 is similar to previous games in series using a special game controller players attempt to match scrolling notes as they appear on screen along a note track to mimic playing of rock music and other songs hitting correct notes in time with music increases player s score and builds up performance meter while missing notes will cause meter to drop should meter fall below a certain threshold song will end prematurely with player booed off stage by a virtual audience correctly hitting ten consecutive notes will add to player s score multiplier by one up to a maximum of four times original multiplier specially marked sections of song if completed correctly help to build up star power which can then be activated through an action with controller to further double current multiplier up to 8x as with guitar hero world tour guitar hero 5 supports playing of lead and bass guitar through guitar controllers drums through a drum controller and vocals through a microphone players can also play in groups of up to four local or remote players to form a band co operatively playing through a song whereas in world tour a band could only have one of each instrument guitar hero 5 allows players to arrange for any combination of instruments including all four players on same instrument if they so choose while playing in a band star power is now tracked separately for each player as opposed to collectively for band as in world tour a new play mechanic called band moments will require all members of band to play sections of a song successfully to gain rewards both in a temporary scoring multiplier and visual effects on screen band revival meter will appear when a player fails out of song requiring other band members to play well as a group together in order to bring failed player back into game failing to do so will end song prematurely game modes guitar hero 5 allows players to start in a band lobby from where they can then launch into any of game s modes add other local and remote players to a party and switch between game modes without having to leave party or lobby a significant change in response to difficulties players found in world tour game supports a career mode described below a mode where players can create a set list of numerous songs and play through them all songs on disc and through downloadable content are immediately available to play in this mode game also carries over competitive modes from previous guitar hero games two new multiplayer modes are in game first is a party play mode which is immediately launched once game is started during party play game will automatically play randomly through available songs at any time players can jump in with any instrument and start playing that song after selecting their difficulty and handedness additional players can also jump in drop out or change their difficulty levels once someone is playing in this mode second feature is a rockfest mode which can be played by four players locally or eight online with several sub modes that influence how game is played and scored in general each song is divided into roughly 30 second long sections and players earn points for their performance over that section based on specific mode these points are shown to all players to know how they are faring against others players are able to create a playlist in rockfest and assign a different mode to each song rockfest include momentum starting at medium difficulty players can increase their difficulty and score more points by hitting twenty consecutive notes but will fall back in difficulty if they miss three notes in a row points are awarded for making streaks a series of consecutive notes with value further increasing for longer streaks perfectionist for each section of a song players are ranked by percentage of correct notes hit with top player getting most points do or die a player is forced to wait out until next section if they miss three notes in current section of song elimination after each section of a song lowest scoring player is eliminated however if scoring player decided to stay in they may do so pro face off a standard score attack mode with highest score winning points career mode and challenges guitar hero 5 features a combined single and multi player both off and on line career mode similar to guitar hero metallica songs in game are distributed across 13 venues with all but first locked at start each venue contains 5 or more specific songs and 1 or more special sponsored gigs each with challenges that can be completed along with playing through song to unlock other venues players must collect a number of stars based on their performance playing individual songs with each song offering up to 9 stars up to 5 for general scoring performance an additional star for a perfect performance and up to 3 for completing song s challenge players share benefits of earning stars for their own respective profiles thus a player that may have difficulty completing one song on their own could join with a band that is able to complete it benefiting from gain in stars should they then play by themselves or with another group thumb 200px right guitar hero 5 introduces both song specific and open gig challenges that offer player more rewards for completing certain feats while playing a song this screenshot shows challenge for song gamma ray by beck guitar hero 5 introduces career mode challenges that are either tied to specific songs or allow players to select a song to meet challenge requirement in open gigs these were created by neversoft to allow developers to take advantage of unique features of many of songs and provide another layer of gameplay according to neversoft s brian bright each challenge features three possible completion levels gold platinum and diamond mimicking music recording sales certification levels with diamond being most difficult to complete song specific challenges include both instrument specific challenges such as correctly vocalizing repeated fame lyric at end of david bowie s fame as it moves down in pitch and more general scoring or performance challenges on either specific instruments or for whole band open gig challenges are presented by sponsors within game and are based on performance aspects such as scoring a certain number of points using star power or using guitar controller s whammy bar continuously for a length of time these allow player to select any song to complete with some songs potentially being better suited for completing that challenge progress towards these challenges is shown in game by a record meter that appears when challenge is active and fills up similarly to overall scoring meter as player successfully completes towards challenge higher completion levels particularly diamond may only be possible by playing expert difficulty of a song but players can take advantage of mid song difficulty adjustment feature to complete these if needed all players are awarded for completing a challenge if one of members is able to do so and will be reflected in individual players career progress in addition players can unlock new avatars outfits and other content by completing challenges rewards of challenges are used to replace previous in game money reward in previous guitar hero games however playstation 2 version does not include this challenge feature rather than doing challenges to unlock avatars content all one must do is complete gig by successfully completing all songs not all gigs have content to unlock rather just those to which a particular unlockable applies for example johnny cash gig allows johnny cash to be unlocked as a playable avatar music studio music studio feature which allows players to create their own songs and distribute them through ghtunes music service has been improved 0 mode allows one to precisely create songs up to 10 min and includes pre defined sample tracks that can be modified on a note by note basis as desired new jam mode lets players select one of several standard pre set rhythms and then play along with it on instrument controllers in a free form mode however players can then capture any segment of this music and move it to mix mode to compile a song user songs are then uploaded and downloaded through ghtunes mode of music studio while songs that violate copyright will still be removed from service neversoft will be less aggressive about this and will rely more on user feedback on such issues ps2 version does not support this feature characters and customization thumb 180px right after three years of negotiations kurt cobain is a playable character in guitar hero 5 avatars of famous musicians are part of game performing for songs by that artist and available as unlockable characters notably kurt cobain of nirvana is a playable avatar activision had sought to gain permission to use cobain s image for game for three years including obtaining necessary agreements with courtney love who controls cobain s estate and dave grohl and universal publishing who control nirvana s catalog cobain s avatar was designed with input from love who provided photos and videos for design team to use and emphasized how she would like cobain to appear starting from his appearance in smells like teen spirit and modifying it from there avatar includes t shirt design based on daniel johnston s frog that cobain had popularized johnny cash is also a playable character with tribute artist terry lee helping to provide motion capture for his character carlos santana shirley manson of garbage and matthew bellamy of muse are also playable avatars all of whom performed motion capture for their own avatars there are also unlockable fictional characters like skeleton golden god shadow and gerald contest winner though activision approached jon bon jovi to appear in game bon jovi turned down offer while standard character creator is available for all versions of game xbox 360 version allows players to import their xbox live avatar into game while freestyle mode on wii version of game allows use of players miis in game nine of characters from previous installments return in this game they all have a costume that they start with and 3 more can be unlocked by completing challenges doing this will unlock also new pieces of clothing for costume to use for user generated rockers also while gibson no longer sponsors game other guitar manufacturers like ibanez esp paul reed smith and schecter lent likenesses of their instruments allowing for new combinations on assembling custom guitars and basses for first time also sponsored clothing pieces can be used in customization these being shoes from vans dr martens and converse there is no money in game leaving everything available to use including unlockables instruments can also be unlocked to use also some clothing now can be changed in style there are four styles for each one shown two others that were separate items in previous games with exceptions and one new one with exceptions characters outfits can only be changed and users can only decide which outfit they wear however they can still edit their instruments virtual avatars of real life rockers can also not be changed in any way including instruments console specific variations wii version of game developed by vicarious visions is full feature parity with xbox 360 and playstation 3 versions including support for up to eight players online each possibly on their own console guitar hero 5 is first wii game to support high capacity sd cards allowing up to about 800 songs to be stored on a 32 gb card while existing wii guitar hero games allow players to purchase downloadable content one song at a time guitar hero 5 includes ability to download complete albums and song packs players are also able to manage content of their wii memory cards through game s interface game does not require players to enter game specific friends codes but instead uses global wii address book to locate friends mii freestyle mode introduced in world tour is also present and with changes to address some of issues with less skilled players trying to play well together a guitar hero nintendo ecosystem is introduced in guitar hero 5 letting wii version communicate with nintendo ds including a stage manager video editor ds controller feature in conjunction with mii freestyle mode and a new game mode called roadie battle in roadie battle four players play as two teams each team has one player performing on an instrument through wii while other player uses a ds to connect to wii and act as roadie during play roadie players attempt to sabotage other team by completing mini games on ds that affect other team s music performance in a manner similar to guitar hero iiis battle mode these can only be cleared by other ds player performing another mini game playstation 2 version of game developed by budcat creations features less functionality in comparison to other versions besides lacking online play or downloadable content game does not include drop in drop out play multiplayer rockfest nor song challenges a multitap cannot be used to expand number of controller ports limiting game to two guitars one drum set and one microphone development right thumb four player gameplay where all four are playing same instrument on three different difficulties fifth main entry to guitar hero series was announced in december 2008 with confirmation of its release by end of 2009 coming in may 2009 along with announcement of other new guitar hero titles some industry analysts questioned whether proliferation of guitar hero games would soon glut market http www nbcnews com id ns technology and science games t how much guitar hero too much guitar hero spokesman eric said consumer research showed continued strong demand for various versions party play mode was inspired by recognizing that past guitar hero games made it difficult to jump into without maneuvering through a number of menus and selection screens mode was designed to be used at social gatherings and was adopted to use whatever instrument controllers that players already had available thus allowing for various other combinations beyond standard four person band this aspect of game was then brought to other band modes to allow game to remain flexible a new guitar controller was developed for guitar hero 5 sold with bundles with game though option for standalone versions has not yet been determined like other guitar hero controllers guitar shaped unit features five colored fret buttons on neck of guitar a strum bar to mimic act of strumming a whammy bar to alter pitch of a note and additional buttons specific to game console for maneuvering through game s menus unit is mostly a redesign of world tour model with a new red finish and includes touchpad that is farther up neck of controller allowing player to play notes via tapping or to slide along its surface for specially marked sections on note track guitar hero 5 unit features a more accurate and responsive touchpad due to it being tracked digitally and with added tactile responses a more accurate strum bar and a controller finish that makes it easier to handle with sweaty hands game remains compatible with previous guitar hero game controllers as well as those from rock band and selected other rhythm games promotion as part of game s early promotion a scavenger hunt contest was announced in last week of may 2009 players would need to search for articles on specific game related sites to find information on bands that are to be in guitar hero 5 and then enter those bands at game s official website for a chance to win a series of concert tickets in their area through this promotion a large number of artists in final track list were revealed a viral video in late july 2009 announced last handful of songs for game features four naked women walking down a public street with black censor bars used to cover their bodies but also used to announce song names video attracted anger of bill o reilly calling video shameless and models as pinheads for month of september 2009 players in us that purchase guitar hero 5 would be able to redeem a code with game to receive a free copy of guitar hero van halen prior to its retail release with packaging s offer sticker printable if lost a copy of receipt and a barcode received upon registration also in uk when pre ordering guitar hero 5 on

door soundtrack guitar hero 5 features 85 songs by 83 different artists tracks from 30 artists represent their music rhythm video game debut brian bright project director for game has called track list fresh with 25 of songs released in last 18 months and more than 50 from current decade unlike previous versions of guitar hero series where players must work through a career mode to unlock all songs in game all songs in guitar hero 5 are unlocked and available to play in any mode from start bright noted that previously while under pressure by queen and david bowie was always a song they wanted in guitar hero they could not find masters for it however for guitar hero 5 masters have since magically appeared and are part of game s track list for nirvana s lithium master recordings did not have appropriate tracks to build note track from and they opted to use live version of song from 1992 reading festival notably famous for cobain appearing on a wheelchair at first amid rumors of his failing health but shown to be a ruse as cobain took stage and celebrated recent birth of his daughter frances bean song you and me by attack attack was a result of band winning a competition to be included in game in addition to on disc songs guitar hero 5 is first game in series to reuse content from previous games all but 6 jimi hendrix songs of 158 world tour downloadable content songs can be imported into guitar hero 5 at no cost additionally 35 songs from world tour 21 songs from guitar hero smash hits and 61 songs from band hero can be imported into game after paying a small transferring fee more songs from these games may be made available to guitar hero 5 at a later date including world tour tracks importing process for world tour and smash hits content requires downloading of content as these tracks have been recreated with support for guitar hero 5 s new gameplay features such as band moments all such imported songs are also playable in band hero sixty nine of guitar hero 5 tracks can be imported into band hero in addition 39 of tracks from guitar hero metallica are importable into guitar hero 5 and band hero since september 2010 release of sequel guitar hero warriors of rock no additional songs have been made available for dlc and it is unlikely any additional songs will ever be offered for guitar hero 5 reception guitar hero 5 was well received upon release seth schiesel of new york times called guitar hero 5 most enjoyable guitar hero game in several years and generally well tuned often exhilarating rock n roll experience keza macdonald of eurogamer commented that there is just nothing wrong with guitar hero 5 given various stumbling blocks developers had made from previous iterations of game and way developers have continued to find new additions to game reviewers greatly appreciated new features in game to make it easier to jump in and play music from simplification of menu system to availability of every song in all game modes from start erik brudvig of ign considers menu change to be one of best things that neversoft has done although menus are a minor part of game it removes much of frustration with world tour and other previous guitar hero games menu systems arthur gies of gamespy noted that by simplification of interface neversoft stripped guitar hero down to what works and built up from there reviewers appreciated immediate launch of game s party mode once player put disk in system and ability to jump right into that song through new menus and considered this to help make game enjoyable for social gatherings chris watters of gamespot considered this mode to be accessible welcoming and delightfully low key changes in career mode in which players need not stick to same instrument or difficulty throughout was well appreciated brudvig appreciated how this allows player to complete career mode without getting stuck on a song having to go back to replay career mode on other instruments and that with addition of song challenges provides enough incentive to return to songs to improve one s performance new multiplayer modes in rockfest which replaced more arcadey competitive modes were considered a welcome replacement as it allowed players of various skill levels to compete fairly against each other making game more friendly to multiplayer experience however matt helgeson of game informer noted that despite various rockfest modes it all comes down to hitting notes correctly track list while well received for most part was found to be one of weaker features while helgeson and others noted that track list was extremely diverse and for most part well selected this diversity was found to work against game as well justin haywald of 1up com noted that with diverse track list there would be a good chance players would find songs they liked but at same time would also find songs they loathed brudvig noted that while goal was to include a bit of everything diversity of track list ensures that nobody will like everything on disc gies noted that while guitar difficulty progression in career mode was strong and better than in previous games it leaves vocals and drummer progression all over place while schiesel considered vocals parts somewhat rough in comparison to beatles rock band haywald noted that singing portions of game were still weak with poor indicators to help player s performance and with possibility of multiple vocalists performing at same time would make it hard for a player to keep track of his pitch while reviews appreciated activision s efforts to allow importing of songs from previous games small number of tracks that were available at launch felt at odds with impression that activision had made of process prior to game s release improvements made in ghtunes were seen as leaps and bounds above original offering in world tour though was still considered to be too unwieldy for average players on its week of release in united kingdom guitar hero 5 was most purchased title across all game systems beating beatles rock band which was also released during that same week in country united states sales of guitar hero 5 for xbox 360 reached 210 800 units on its first month of release making it 9th best selling title for month and 499 000 units total across all platforms were sold comparable to world tours first month sales of 534 000 units total revenue for united states sales in september 2009 was 33 million driving primarily by sales of standalone copy of game game sold just under 1 million copies worldwide by end of 2009 guitar hero 5 has been nominated for best family game interactive achievement award from academy of interactive arts sciences kurt cobain controversy inclusion of kurt cobain as a playable character in game has been considered a strange concept by some reviewers reflecting on possible influence of commercialization pressures that played into cobain s suicide shortly after game s release it was discovered that once players unlocked kurt cobain character pack as well as that for any other of included famous musicians they could use that character for any other song on disc leading to what some have considered to be awkward virtual performances of cobain singing songs from completely different genres user created videos of these performances that had attracted attention to this issue have since been removed from video sharing sites like youtube by activision previous games in series that feature known musicians also allow for use of their characters once unlocked in other songs except for case of jimi hendrix in guitar hero world tour only posthumous artist to appear in series prior to guitar hero 5 some have seen this as a scar on cobain s legacy jeff gerstmann of giant bomb commented that it s near mythic legacy he left behind and way nirvana catalog has been protected from commercial interests over years that makes this stuff so harsh on his observation of such performances tim walker of independent contrasted cobain s posthumous humiliation to appearance of virtual characters based on living artists that have appeared in rhythm music games noting that deceased artists do not have same fair consideration as live artists that can opt to license their images for such rhythm games seth schiesel of new york times countered these arguments noting that as long as no legal contracts were broken cobain and other artists in game are too big and too important to be damaged in a cultural sense by mere inclusion in a video game on her twitter account courtney love expressed her anger at cobain s representation in game and threatened legal action alongside other companies that represent cobain s intellectual property love further stated that she received no monetary arrangements for cobain s appearance in response to comments that believe love had sold out to activision and from a statement by activision ceo dan claiming that cobain estate has cashed cheque both dave grohl and krist novoselic have made statements disapproving inclusion of cobain as an unlockable character in game and have requested that he be locked to only nirvana songs and jon bon jovi who had denied activision s offer to include him in game supports their concerns about having his image be used to sing other artists songs in response to these statements activision claims it had secured all proper publication rights for cobain s image for game however according to attorneys for love contract was not meant to allow activision to denigrate his image joystiq noted that crux of legal issues revolve around right of personality which is defined at state level within united states these rights are presently held by love due to her ownership of cobain s estate but may have been overridden in contract with activision band hero suffered a similar issue as group no doubt avatars in that game filed a lawsuit against activision due to having their avatars be usable to play or sing any song in game love stated to magazine nme that she will be joining no doubt in their lawsuit against activision notes references external links category 2009 video games category activision
