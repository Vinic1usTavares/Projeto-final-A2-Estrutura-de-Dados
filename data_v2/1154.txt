charlotte north carolina and greenville south carolina on night of february 8 1965 aircraft serving flight a douglas dc 7 crashed near jones beach state park new york just after taking off from jfk airport all 79 passengers and five crew aboard perished civil aeronautics board cab investigation determined that evasive maneuvers undertaken by flight 663 to avoid an oncoming pan am boeing 707 caused pilot to suffer spatial disorientation and lose control of aircraft accident is third worst accident involving a dc 7 flight history douglas dc 7 serving flight 663 made its first flight in 1958 and had subsequently accumulated a total of 18 500 hours of flight time it was piloted by captain frederick r carson 41 who had been employed by eastern air lines for 19 years and who had

and airport control tower prepared to hand over control to new york air route traffic control center artcc on long island noting that flight 663 was executing a dutch seven departure a routine takeoff procedure that required a series of turns over atlantic ocean in order to avoid flying over new york city new york artcc responded with information that pan american airways flight 212 a boeing 707 was descending to in same airspace radio conversation between new york air route traffic control jfk control tower sender message ref new york air route traffic control center all right at three miles north of dutch is clipper 212 descending to 4 000 how does he shape up with that boy coming in guy at his 1 o clock position jfk control tower we re above him though control tower responded that flight 663 was at a higher altitude than flight 212 it was in fact lower subsequently control tower radioed pan am flight that there was traffic in his airspace at 11 o clock six miles away travelling southeast of pan am s position climbing above pan am 212 acknowledged air traffic control then radioed flight 663 a similar advisory at 2 o clock five miles away travelling below flight 663 s position plaintext in reality traffic pan am 212 was above flight 663 descending from captain carson acknowledged that he saw traffic that he was beginning to turn into dutch seven departure and signed off saying good night radio conversation between jfk control tower pan am flight 212 and eastern flight 663 highlighted sender bold recipient message ref jfk control towerto pan am 212 traffic at 11 o clock six miles just climbing out of three thousand feet pan am 212to jfk control tower we have traffic jfk control towerto eastern 663 traffic 2 o clock five miles northeast bound below you eastern jfk control tower okay we have traffic turning one seven zero six six three good night jfk control towerto eastern 663 good night sir flight 663 s radioed good night at 6 25 p m was last transmission received from flight crash night of february 8 was dark with no visible moon or stars and no visible horizon as two airliners approached similar positions their pilots had no points of reference with which to determine actual separation distance or position flight 663 s departure turn and pan am s subsequent turn left to its assigned heading had placed two aircraft on an apparent collision course boeing rolled right and initiated a descent in an attempt to avoid a collision in response eastern 663 initiated an extreme right turn in order to pass safely captain of pan am 212 later estimated that two aircraft had passed between of each other while first officer estimated that distance was only flight 663 was unable to recover from its unusually steep bank and plunged into icy water of atlantic ocean where it exploded with bright orange flames pan american 707 was first to relay news of crash as it was receiving permission to land air canada flight 627 which had departed a few minutes prior to flight 663 also radioed news of an explosion in water radio conversation between jfk control tower pan am flight 212 and air canada flight 627 sender bold recipient message ref pan am 212to jfk control tower uh ok we had a near miss here uh we re turning now to uh three six zero and uh did you have another target in this area at same spot where we were just a minute ago jfk control towerto pan am 212 uh affirmative however not on my scope at present time pan am 212to jfk control tower is he still on scope jfk control towerto pan am 212 no sir pan am 212to jfk control tower it looked like he s in bay then because we saw him he looked like he winged over to miss us and we tried to avoid him and we saw a bright flash about one minute later he was well over top of us and it looked like he went into an absolute vertical turn and kept rolling air canada jfk control tower there s a big fire going out on water here about our 2 o clock position right now i don t know what it is it looked like a big explosion after initial explosion wrecked aircraft sank to bottom in of water numerous air crews including pan am 212 air canada 627 and braniff airlines flight 5 radioed atc controllers in area with news of an explosion aircraft broke up upon impact and was destroyed all five crewmembers and 79 passengers died on impact aftermath and investigation fifteen ships accompanied by eleven helicopters and numerous rescue divers converged on scene of crash in hopes of rendering aid to survivors two hours after impact debris began floating up to surface by sunrise seven bodies had been recovered three more were discovered in course of following three days in locating wreckage united states navy provided underwater sonar to assist with operation thirteen coast guard vessels helped searching shores of long island and provided salvage efforts rescue workers and volunteers scoured of beaches collecting debris that washed ashore civil aeronautics board cab investigated accident dc 7 was not required to be equipped with a flight recorder which would have automatically recorded pilots every control input thus cab was forced to rely on witness testimony radio recordings and a best guess based on experience nevertheless cab determined that evasive maneuvers taken by pilot of flight 663 in order to avoid oncoming pan am jet caused spatial disorientation disorientation coupled with extreme maneuver made it impossible for pilot to recover from roll in few seconds remaining before dc 7 crashed into atlantic ocean cab also determined that captain carson had neither time nor adequate information to assess flight 663 s position relative to pan am 212 and given illusion of a collision course he had acted appropriately in initiating evasive maneuvers cab made no recommendations in final accident report although early news reports reported near miss of flights 663 and 212 faa denied that there was ever any danger of a collision at that time crash of flight 663 was fifth worst aviation accident to have occurred in united states it is third deadliest crash of a dc 7 after caledonian airways flight 153 and northwest airlines flight 293 and is 25th deadliest single plane accident to have occurred in united states see also aviation safety adc airlines flight 86 list of accidents and incidents involving commercial aircraft
