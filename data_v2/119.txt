19 september 2012 security researchers demonstrated during a computer hacking contest held in amsterdam netherlands that s iii can be hacked via nfc allowing attackers to download all data from phone in december 2012 two hardware issues were reported by users of s iii a vulnerability of exynos soc allowed malicious apps to gain root privileges even on unrooted devices and a spontaneous bricking of unit called sudden death vulnerability that occurs about six months after activation samsung has been replacing of affected units under warranty in january 2013 samsung released a firmware update that corrected both issues affecting both galaxy s ii and iii some units can have high memory use without apparent cause in itself causing units to be unable to store any more data and making units memory to be full when apparently not using all of units internal memory available in october 2012 samsung noted that this was caused by a mass caching archive running in background of units operational tasks this copied and saved media tasks and app information to a background archive which was not accessible to user without change and re writing of phones operational script when this has been altered access can be gained and cache can be deleted and no further caching will occur unless requested this issue was resolved for galaxy s iii and later model two s iii explosions were reported first involved a man from ireland while more recent incident occurred when a swiss teenager was left with second and third degree burns in her thigh caused by her phone s explosion in october 2013

month long tour of s iii to nine cities including sydney new delhi and cities in china japan south korea and united states s iii has helped samsung consolidate its market share in several countries including india where samsung expected to capture 60 percent of country s smartphone market improving on its previous 46 percent within a month of release samsung had a 60 percent market share in france while company controlled over 50 percent of german and italian smartphone markets over a similar period s iii helped increase samsung s market share in united kingdom to over 40 percent while eroding iphone 4s s 25 percent to 20 percent in country s iii was scheduled to be released in north america on 20 june 2012 but because of high demand some us and canadian carriers delayed release by several days while some other carriers limited market at launch s iii s us launch event took place in new york city hosted by twilight actress ashley greene and attended by dubstep artist skrillex who performed at skylight studios samsung estimated that by end of july 2012 s iii would have been released by 296 carriers in 145 countries and that more than 10 million handsets would have been sold shin jong kyun president of samsung s mobile communications sector announced on 22 july that sales had exceeded 10 million according to an assessment by swiss financial services company ubs samsung had shipped 5 6 million units of phone in second quarter of 2012 and would ship 10 12 million handsets per quarter throughout rest of year an even more aggressive prediction by paris based banking group bnp paribas said 15 million units will be shipped in third quarter of 2012 while japanese financial consultant company nomura placed figure for this quarter as high as 18 million sales of s iii were estimated to top 40 million by end of year to meet demand samsung had hired 75 000 workers and its south korean factory was running at its peak capacity of 5 million smartphone units per month a manufacturing flaw resulted in a large portion of new smartphones having irregularities with hyper glazing process mistake caused an undesirable finish on blue back covers and resulted in disposal of up to 600 000 plastic casings and a shortage of blue model issue was later resolved however reuters estimated that shortage had cost samsung two million s iii sales during its first month of release on 6 september 2012 samsung revealed that sales of s iii had reached 20 million in 100 days making it three and six times faster selling than galaxy s ii and galaxy s respectively europe accounted for more than 25 percent of this figure with 6 million units followed by asia 4 5 million and us 4 million sales in south korea s iii s home market numbered 2 5 million around same time of samsung s announcement sales of s iii surpassed that of iphone 4s in us in third quarter of 2012 more than 18 million s iii units were shipped making it most popular smartphone at time ahead of iphone 4s s 16 2 million units analysts deduced that slump in iphone sales was due to customers anticipation of iphone 5 by may 2014 s iii had sold approximately 60 million units since its 2012 release in april 2015 total sales number was reported as 70 million on 11 october 2012 samsung unveiled galaxy s iii mini a smartphone with lower specifications compared to s iii critical reception reception of s iii has been particularly positive critics noted phone s blend of features such as its s voice application display processing speed and dimensions as having an edge over its competition apple iphone 4s and htc one x vlad savov of verge declared it a technological triumph while natasha lomas of cnet uk lauded phone s impossibly slim and light casing and a quad core engine calling it ferrari of android phones a sentiment affirmed a prince among android phones by dave oliver of wired uk and king of android esat of stuff magazine gareth beavis of techradar noted that s iii is all about faster smarter and being more minimal than ever before while keeping spec list at bleeding edge of technology matt warman of daily telegraph said on spending just a short time with s3 i m confident in saying that it s a worthy successor to globally popular s2 upon release a number of critics and publications have made references to s iii samsung s 2012 flagship phone as an iphone killer responding perhaps to apple s favourable customer perception label owes itself to s iii s use of android os chief rival of apple s ios as well as its design and features that rival iphone 4s such as smart stay a large display a quad core processor android customizability and a multitude of connectivity options s iii was first android phone to have a higher launch price than iphone 4s when apple product was released in 2011 with s iii tim weber business editor of bbc observed with new galaxy s3 they samsung have clearly managed to move to front of smartphone field ahead of mighty apple itself conversely reviewers have opined on design and feel of phone calling its polycarbonate shell cheap and having a slippery feel s voice was described as not optimised and more rigid than siri with its poor voice recognition accuracy with instances when it would not respond at all another usage problem was a microphone malfunction that resulted in difficulty communicating during a call reviewers have noted somewhat abrupt auto adjustment of display brightness which tends to under illuminate screen however it has twice battery life compared to htc handset achieved partly through dim display others say numerous pre installed apps make s iii feel bloated in late september 2012 techradar ranked it as no 1 handset in its constantly updated list of 20 best mobile phones stuff magazine also ranked it at no 1 in its list of 10 best smartphones in may 2012 s iii won an award from european imaging and sound association under category of european mobile phone of 2012 2013 in 2012 s iii won t3 s phone of year award

litigation on 5 june 2012 apple filed for preliminary injunctions in united states district court for northern district of california against samsung electronics claiming s iii had violated at least two of company s patents apple requested that court include phone in its existing legal battle against samsung see apple inc v samsung electronics co ltd and ban sales of s iii prior to its scheduled 21 june 2012 us launch apple claimed alleged infringements would cause immediate and irreparable harm to its commercial interest samsung responded by declaring it would vigorously oppose request and demonstrate to court that galaxy s3 is innovative and distinctive and reassured public that 21 june release would proceed as planned on 11 june judge lucy koh said that apple s claim would overload her work schedule as she would also be overseeing trial of samsung s other devices consequently apple dropped its request to block 21 june release of s iii in mid july 2012 samsung removed universal search feature on sprint and at t s iii phones with over air ota software updates to disable local search function as a precautionary measure prior to its patent court trial with apple which began on 30 july 2012 although apple won trial s iii experienced a sales spike because of public s belief that phone would be banned on 31 august 2012 apple asked same federal court to add s iii into its
