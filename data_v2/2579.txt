birkebeiner party when he was just four years old although obviously not in control of events surrounding him guttorm s accession to throne under effective regency of haakon crazy led to renewed conflict between birkebeiner and bagler parties latter supported militarily by valdemar ii of denmark guttorm s reign ended abruptly when child king suddenly became ill and died rumours among birkebeiner held that guttorm s illness and death had been caused by haakon crazy s future wife christina nilsdatter a claim considered dubious by modern historians low intensity civil war followed

short reign but following his death relations between parties collapsed and a new phase of norwegian civil wars began helle 1974 p 94 parts of birkebeiner were disgruntled by haakon s policy of reconciliation with bagler which may have led to his death following which balance of power within birkebeiner switched immediately to faction around haakon crazy lunden 1976 pp 149 150 day after haakon s death birkebeiner designated guttorm as king at a meeting of hird in consultation with bishop martin of bergen sverre s nephew haakon crazy was simultaneously appointed regent as leader of hird and army helle 1974 pp 94 1972 p 129 according to boglunga sogur bagler sagas young king then took a sword and mounted it to haakon s side and handed him a shield he further gave haakon title of earl with consent from all chieftains and had haakon sit next to him at his throne haakon s unusually strong position was thus symbolised by his sitting at same level as king and not on a lower seat as would have been customary for an earl blom 1972 p 14 another of sverre s nephews peter together with einar husband of sverre s daughter cecilia were appointed as guttorm s guardians helle 1972 p 476 revolt and death appointment of warlike and power hungry haakon crazy called mad dog by bagler to key positions contributed to conflicts within birkebeiner and a worsening of relations with bagler haakon s elevation led bagler to believe that there was not much hope of peace with birkebeiner bagler therefore travelled to denmark and united around erling stonewall an alleged son of former king magnus erlingsson whom elements of party had attempted to proclaim as king in 1203 their revolt was actively supported by valdemar ii of denmark who sought to regain ancient danish overlordship of viken in norway helle 1974 pp 95 96 thumb left upright valdemar ii who aided bagler seen here on a coin valdemar arrived in viken in june with more than 300 ships and erling performed a trial by

guttorm was in turn proclaimed king by birkebeiner at oyrating in trondheim in spring or early summer while haakon crazy was in process of gathering an army to fight bagler likely at a second purely military assembly at oyrating guttorm suddenly became ill and died on 11 august he was buried at nidaros cathedral in trondheim in longer version of boglunga sogur it is insinuated that guttorm s illness and death were caused by swedish born christina nilsdatter who married haakon crazy shortly after guttorm s death modern historians consider this claim to be dubious derived from rumours spread by birkebeiner in connection with sudden death of haakon sverresson some months earlier same source claims that haakon was poisoned allegedly by sverre s widow margaret christina s aunt haakon crazy s bid to succeed guttorm as king foundered because he was not trusted and had made powerful opponents lunden 1976 p 154 guttorm s death was followed by low intensity civil war between his
