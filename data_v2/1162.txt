a prominent family in and around providence rhode island since its founding in 1636 by roger williams and his companion thomas angell though scant there is evidence suggesting thomas angell s ancestors were relations of henry i of england thomas angell s grandson had settled farm where james was born in 1710 same year he founded angell tavern where scituate s leaders held town meetings after its incorporation in 1730 and where men such as george washington benjamin franklin and marquis de lafayette stayed during revolutionary war angell s grandfather built an inn on site in 1810 and angell credited his boyhood interaction with travelers who passed through for some of his later success saying knowledge of men i gained by observations and experiences of my boyhood in country tavern has been of greatest service eminent political speakers were always entertained at our table and some of them were very helpful friends in my later life building burned down in 1862 and land was later submerged during creation of scituate reservoir education angell attended local school until age of eight when his parents placed him with a quaker tutor who taught him arithmetic and surveying at twelve he left home to attend a seminary in seekonk massachusetts in order to study latin but after one term went to study at smithville seminary where he stayed until age of fourteen unsure what career path to take he had worked on family farm for two summers and also unsuccessfully attempted to find clerk jobs with providence businesses when his father informed him that he had financial means to pay for college angell decided to attend brown university a year too young to enroll he went first to university grammar school in providence where one of his instructors was henry s frieze who would later serve as acting president of university of michigan while angell was abroad on diplomatic assignments in 1845 angell began studying at brown which had a total of seven instructors on faculty at time he graduated in 1849 and obtained part time jobs working as an assistant librarian at university and tutoring a boy whose eyesight prevented him from reading in 1850 angell came down with a cold and sore throat but he refused to give his throat any rest from daily exertion of reading aloud to his pupil resultant damage to his throat made extended speaking difficult for rest of his life thumb portrait of james burrill angell as a young man travels while angell was recuperating father of his friend rowland hazard ii whose own grandson rowland hazard iii would later be instrumental in formation of alcoholics anonymous suggested that angell accompany hazard on an upcoming winter tour of south he was undertaking to help alleviate a lung ailment trip which began on october 5 1850 lasted seven and a half months and took angell and hazard throughout much of south young men were introduced to realities of slavery including a whipping and a slave auction that angell called most repulsive and disgusting spectacle we had ever seen upon his return angell had planned to attend andover theological seminary and take up a career as a minister a throat specialist however advised him to avoid any work that would require extended public speaking and he instead found work in office of ellis s city engineer of boston his brief tenure there ended when his friend rowland hazard still suffering from lung ailments invited him on another trip this time to europe pair traveled first to france arriving just three weeks after louis napoleon bonaparte had staged a coup d etat then later to italy and austria while in vienna he received a letter from francis wayland president of brown university offering him a choice of jobs as chairman of either civil engineering or modern language department with a year and a half of continued study in europe he chose latter and went to paris for several months to study french then to braunschweig germany to study german finally returning home in summer of 1853 professor and editor when angell began his tenure as chair of modern languages department at brown university president wayland was in midst of reorganizing university away from its traditional roots additional study was offered in areas such as modern languages and engineering angell s own areas of interest and students were given greater freedom to choose elective courses extension classes were initiated to bring instruction to wider community and angell gave lectures on his experiences in europe and on topic of education among his own students angell singled out as especially memorable two future u s secretaries of state richard olney and john hay on november 26 1855 angell married sarah swoope caswell daughter of alexis caswell who was then a professor at brown and became its president in 1868 sarah s family was also long established in new england and she was a direct descendant of peregrine white first baby born in plymouth colony couple had a son alexis caswell angell on april 26 1857 wayland grew frustrated with a lack of funding for his reforms and resigned as president in 1855 and his successor sears reversed many of reforms study of modern languages was de emphasized leaving angell unsatisfied with teaching duties that were now limited to only one year courses he began writing articles for providence journal starting in 1854 and took over full responsibility for editorial pages in 1859 after editor and part owner henry b anthony was elected to united states senate in 1858 he proposed that angell replace him as editor angell resigned his professorship in 1860 to become full time editor of paper angell allied himself with radical wing of new republican party and lent paper s backing to 1860 gubernatorial candidacy of abolitionist republican nominee seth which failed when a coalition concerned about economic effects of angering south instead led to election of fellow republican william sprague in presidential contest angell felt that rhode island s interests would be best served by nomination of staunch abolitionist william h seward as republican candidate but when somewhat more moderate abraham lincoln was nominated he put power of journal behind lincoln s candidacy publishing favorable letters from his former pupil john hay who was by then working in lincoln s law offices in end lincoln carried rhode island 61 4 to 38 6 angell ran journal for entire civil war and briefly considered buying it to run as a non partisan newspaper an idea which senator anthony rejected but workload took its toll on his health in august 1866 when university of vermont requested that he come serve as its new president he accepted offer and moved to burlington university of vermont civil war had depleted university of vermont of students and funds that came with them when he assumed presidency in 1866 angell s primary responsibility was to improve both size of student body and university s finances he oversaw integration of a state agricultural college formed following passage of morrill act in 1862 which had introduced land grant colleges in united states this effort faced resistance both from classicists worried about influence of new college on quality of education and from farmers who doubted university curriculum had much to offer them but angell was able to build enough trust between groups that integration went forward and both finances and enrollment began to recover latter grew from 31 in 1866 to 67 in 1870 angell traveled to state and county fairs around vermont to attract publicity for university and his fundraising efforts and also secured donations from prominent alumni such as henry j raymond founder of new york times and congressman thaddeus stevens due to a lack of funds to hire professors he personally taught university s courses in history rhetoric german and international law on may 8 1869 angells had another son james rowland angell who later served as president of yale university on september 3 of that year university of michigan offered angell its presidency following resignation of erastus haven that june he visited ann arbor with his wife but he felt that he had a duty to complete his work at university of vermont and declined offer michigan repeated offer in 1871 his former teacher henry s frieze having served as acting president while regents searched for a permanent president this time angell felt that university of vermont had made enough progress that he could leave it in good conscience and he accepted offer he made a trip to ann arbor to deliver his inaugural address at commencement on june 28 1871 then returned to vermont to complete academic term before moving his family to ann arbor in september of that year university of michigan thumb james b angell in 1897 when angell took over as third president of university of michigan in 1871 it was largest university in country with 1 207 students 35 faculty members and an annual budget of 104 000 but it was still more a collection of colleges than an expression of german model of university that had been envisioned by its first two presidents henry philip tappan and recently departed haven over next 38 years angell oversaw growth and innovation that led to him being called chief architect of modern state university unlike tappan angell did not have an overriding vision of future of education but he introduced several changes early in his tenure establishing a scientific course that no longer required greek dropping classics from english course and greatly expanding number of elective courses michigan had begun admitting women year before angell arrived one of first large schools to do so and angell pushed for its continuation and became known as an advocate for coeducation for rest of his career angell felt it was important for a president to teach courses and he taught international law during his entire term controversies angell s first decade in ann arbor was marked by several controversies one involved his expressions of christian piety in course of official business which drew criticism as aligning state funded university too closely with his personal faith detroit resident stephen b mccracken lodged a complaint in 1873 that said such christian and specifically protestant favoritism violated state constitution to detriment of catholics jews spiritualists and free thinkers a state senate committee investigated and ultimately cleared angell and university concluding that teachings of university are those of a liberal and enlightened christianity in general highest and best use of term angell recognized need to make christian spirit he wished to cultivate more voluntary and less explicitly protestant first by dropping compulsory chapel attendance then by hiring university s first roman catholic faculty member eugene w hilgard question of whether homeopathic medicine should be taught at university had been debated for decades before angell s arrival and in 1873 legislature passed a law appointing two professors of homeopathy in medical school despite testimony of angell and others that doing so would be a great mistake that might ultimately kill entire department due to hostility of medical faculty towards homeopathy regents refused to appoint professors saying it was impossible to teach both types of medicine in a single department but they would establish a separate school to teach homeopathy if legislature funded it funding for a separate school was provided in 1875 and school of homeopathy was created in spite of his earlier opposition angell worked to find qualified professors and to ensure school provided best possible instruction and it coexisted with medical school until it was closed in 1922 in october 1875 an audit of student laboratory fees in chemistry department found a shortfall of 831 10 attributable to one of two professors silas h douglas or preston b rose rose at first mortgaged his house to make up difference but later douglas was also found to be responsible charges and counter charges were made among two men various regents and president angell douglas was episcopalian and rose was methodist and their fellow churchmen joined in a bitter public debate over who was to blame a two month investigation by state legislature produced a 740 page report and case ultimately went to michigan supreme court where douglas won a judgment against university in 1881 one historian wrote that no one who examines voluminous records of struggle can doubt that university would have been a far stronger institution had there been no douglas rose controversy six year fight affected angell as well with one professor saying he was never quite same afterwards growth of university thumb angell hall dedicated in 1924 on university of michigan campus during his tenure at michigan faculty size grew from 35 to about 400 student body from 1 100 to over 5 000 annual budget from 104 000 to over 1 000 000 following schools or colleges were founded during his tenure dentistry pharmacy music nursing and architecture urban planning concerned about growing role of professionalism in collegiate sports and a loss of control by faculties over athletics on campus angell called for a meeting in 1906 of presidents of members of western conference now big ten at angell conference presidents agreed to restrictions on number of games years of student eligibility and ticket prices an additional rule targeted michigan football coach fielding h yost s considerable outside income by requiring coaches be full time employees of university in spite of angell s efforts to institute more control yost convinced a majority of regents to support him and michigan left athletic conference for nearly a decade rather than abide by new rules diplomatic posts angell put his academic career on hold at several points in order to carry out a variety of diplomatic assignments including serving as minister to qing empire in china and ottoman empire in turkey as well as negotiating maritime treaties with britain and canada he remained president of university of michigan throughout but took leaves of absence with acting presidents managing in his place minister to china in february 1880 secretary of state william m evarts asked angell to go to china to negotiate changes to burlingame treaty that would reduce flow of chinese immigrants into pacific united states angell was nominated by president hayes confirmed by senate as minister to china and chairman of treaty commission on april 9 1880 angell left for peking that june with fellow commissioners john f swift and william henry and presented his credentials on august 16 succeeding george

and set tonnage dues and tariffs to be same for both nations treaties collectively were signed on november 17 1880 and other commissioners returned home leaving angell in china to fulfill his duties as minister after a year he decided to return to academia and left china on october 4 1881 taking a trip through europe and returning to ann arbor on february 24 1882 angell was succeeded in his post by john russell young most of provisions that angell treaty had secured were negated by chinese exclusion act of 1882 and scott act of 1888 which placed much stricter bans on chinese immigration 112th congress maritime commissions in fall of 1887 president cleveland appointed angell to a three man commission along with william l putnam and secretary of state thomas f bayard to negotiate with british government regarding fishing rights off coast of canada which had been a source of misunderstanding between canada and u s since they were first agreed to in treaty of 1818 results of these negotiations bayard chamberlain treaty was signed on february 15 1888 but subsequently failed ratification in u s senate whose republican majority had objected to formation of commission in first place on november 4 1895 president cleveland appointed angell to deep waterways commission along with john e russell and lyman e cooley commission created by congress was to negotiate an agreement between u s and canada regarding creation of a waterway to allow ocean going traffic between great lakes and atlantic ocean they undertook a feasibility study and forwarded proposals for further appropriations to congress but little was done and it was not until 1959 that st lawrence seaway finally opened minister to turkey president mckinley asked angell to serve as minister to turkey in april 1897 and he agreed on condition he could return home after a year if he wished angell s nomination encountered brief opposition from constantinople first because of reports that he had accused russia of fomenting unrest in region and then because sultan abdul hamid ii had confused angell s congregationalist faith with congregation of jesuits of whom he had a poor opinion these objections were resolved by angell s denial of former report and clarification to sultan on latter misunderstanding senate confirmed him and he sailed to europe on ss normandie in july then on to constantinople where he presented his credentials to sultan on september 3 succeeding alexander w terrell university of michigan regents appointed harry burns hutchins acting president in his absence through october 1898 pressing issue facing angell in turkey was protection of american missionaries during unrest following massacre of armenians that had been carried out over previous two years as well as compensation for damage to their properties they claimed were caused by both deliberate actions and inaction of turkish forces he was mostly unsuccessful on this front except for negotiating a 50 000 surcharge on a warship ottoman empire was purchasing from an american firm with understanding that this would be used to resolve claims of damages and which was eventually paid in 1901 angell blamed this failure in part on outbreak of spanish american war causing american naval ships to leave area and remove pressure on sultan angell and his wife toured middle east from january to march 1898 visiting cairo jerusalem damascus beirut and ephesus president mckinley was disturbed by a request from angell to send american warships to rattle sultan s windows he feared it would lead to an event like sinking of maine and approached oscar s straus about taking over post angell himself was becoming discouraged by his inability to win concessions from turkish government and submitted his resignation in may he had his final audience with sultan on august 5 and left his post on august 13 traveling home by way of greece italy switzerland and france later years thumb graves of james and

of 1911 when he suffered a stroke of paralysis in germany following an exhausting excursion to russia he recovered sufficiently to return to ann arbor within a month but his lingering weakness was

a few days later april 1 1916 and was buried in forest hill cemetery on april 3 with a line of university students formed on each side of streets as his funeral cortege traveled through ann arbor legacy angell s historic legacy is based on transition of michigan from a small local state college to a major national university featuring state of art research he was a transitional figure maintaining small college paternalistic interest in welfare of individual students and endorsing traditional small college mission to promote civility and character building he introduced a broader mission including admission by merit coeducation teaching large classes by lecture and an increasing emphasis on graduate studies he introduced a broad curriculum ranging from humanities to social sciences sciences and engineering as well as traditional and modern professional fields he appealed to michigan public for financial support and provided a model that was followed by other ambitious university presidents his moderation natural tact and political astuteness strengthened his leadership role and his diverse background in foreign languages literature civil engineering and newspaper work facilitated his approaches to every major interest group in state however angell was not as dynamic or innovative as younger generation such as charles w eliot daniel coit gilman and william rainey harper by 1909 he was obsolete in terms of state of art in world class universities and was even accused of provincialism inbreeding and complacency benjamin g rader angell james burrill in
