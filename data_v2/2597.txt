hypnos monopterygius also known as coffin ray or australian numbfish is a species of electric ray endemic to australia where it is common in inshore waters shallower than it is sole member of its family hypnidae this small species typically reaches in length greatly enlarged pectoral fins and an extremely short tail coupled with diminutive dorsal and caudal fins all concentrated towards rear give coffin ray a distinctive pear like shape it is a varying shade of brown in color above and has tiny eyes and a large highly distensible mouth sluggish and nocturnal coffin ray frequents sandy or muddy habitats where it can bury itself during daytime it can produce a powerful electric shock reaching 200 volts for attack and defense this species is a voracious predator that feeds mainly on benthic bony fishes often tackling fish approaching or exceeding itself in size on occasion it may also consume invertebrates and even small penguins and rats reproduction is aplacental viviparous in which developing embryos are nourished by yolk and maternally produced histotroph uterine milk female gives birth to 4 8 pups during summer coffin ray can deliver a severe albeit non fatal shock to a human not valued commercially it is very hardy and can usually survive being captured and discarded international union for conservation of nature iucn has listed this species under least concern as its population does not seem threatened by human activity taxonomy and phylogeny first scientific reference to coffin ray was written by english zoologist and botanist george shaw to accompany frederick polydore nodder s illustrations of a beached fish published in their 1795 work naturalist s miscellany shaw interpreted specimen as a goosefish calling it single finned lophius or lophius monopterygius in latin independently french zoologist auguste dumeril described a new electric ray in an 1852 volume of journal revue et de zoologie based on two specimens collected off new south wales he named it hypnos genus name is derived from greek word for sleep referring to ray s ability to induce numbness eventually gilbert percy whitley recognized that nodder had illustrated same species that dumeril had described and thus proper binomial name became hypnos monopterygius in 1902 edgar ravenswood waite proposed hypnarce as a replacement name for hypnos which he believed was preoccupied by butterfly genus however international code of zoological nomenclature iczn does not seem to require change and thus hypnarce is regarded as a junior synonym common name coffin ray comes from coffin like shape of beached specimens which become bloated after death this species may also be referred to as crampfish electric ray numbfish short tail electric ray or torpedo phylogenetic studies based on morphology have found that hypnos is most closely related to genus torpedo hence some taxonomists classify it with torpedo in family torpedinidae in its own subfamily on other hand there are also taxonomists who believe hypnos to be distinctive enough to merit its own separate family hypnidae distribution and habitat coffin ray has a wide but disjunct distribution in tropical and warm temperate australian waters western part of its range extends from gulf st vincent in south australia to broome in western australia and eastern part from eden in new south wales to heron island in queensland it does not occur off victoria or tasmania this common bottom dwelling species is typically found close to shore no deeper than though it has been recorded from as deep as it favors habitats with sandy or muddy bottoms including beaches estuaries and bays and can also be found over seagrass as well as on and around rocky and coral reefs description thumb left coffin ray can be identified by its greatly enlarged pectoral fin disc and tiny tail unusual pear like shape of coffin ray distinguishes it from all other rays its body is flabby with two large kidney shaped electric organs visible on both sides of head pectoral fins form a greatly enlarged disc about as wide as long that is thick at center and thin at margins leading margin of disc is straight to gently concave eyes are minute and can be elevated on short stalks close behind eyes and slightly larger are spiracles which are rimmed by small papillae in some individuals nostrils are located just ahead of mouth and are connected to it by a pair of broad grooves between nostrils is a short curtain of skin that overlaps mouth capacious mouth forms a very long wide arch slender jaws can be distended dramatically though are not particularly protrusible adults have over 60 rows of small teeth in either jaw each tooth has three long cusps five pairs of gill slits are small and placed beneath disc pelvic fins are relatively large and merged with pectoral fin disc at front to form a roughly circular secondary disc two dorsal fins are shaped like rounded lobes and are located very close to caudal fin which is of similar size with a nearly symmetrical rounded margin tail is extremely short bray d j 2011 coffin ray hypnos monopterygius in fishes of australia http www fishesofaustralia net au home species 1843 such as that caudal fin barely extends past pelvic fin disc skin is entirely devoid of dermal denticles and may be creased in areas dorsal coloration ranges from dark to reddish brown to grayish pinkish or yellowish and may be plain or sparsely patterned with irregular darker and lighter markings underside is pale as are spiracle papillae this species grows to a length of or possibly even though most are only around long biology and ecology thumb coffin rays are often stranded on shore coffin ray is a slow and weak swimmer that moves forward with a jerky fluttery motion it is nocturnal and spends most of day buried in sediment with only its spiracles showing when disturbed it has been observed performing a possible defense behavior wherein it erupts from bottom and swims in a loop with its mouth agape this species is sometimes stranded on land by ebbing tide but can survive out of water for hours like in other electric rays coffin ray s electric organs are derived from muscle tissue and consist of numerous vertical columns each formed from a stack of jelly filled electric plates that essentially acts as a battery it is capable of generating up to 200 volts of electricity and delivering 50 shocks over span of ten minutes with each successive shock weakening coffin ray employs electricity both to subdue prey and deter predators diet of coffin ray consists mostly of benthic bony fishes but also includes cephalopods and on occasion crustaceans and polychaete worms penguins and rats have also been recorded from stomachs of this species coffin ray ambushes prey from substrate and swallows them whole head first before re burying it often takes extremely large prey relative to its size one observed individual long had swallowed a flathead sp long and tail of prey fish was still protruding from its mouth dead specimens have been recovered that had apparently choked trying to swallow too large prey coffin ray is aplacental viviparous in which developing embryos are nourished by yolk later supplemented by histotroph uterine milk secreted by mother females give birth to litters of 4 8 pups in summer newborns measure approximately long males and females both attain sexual maturity around long this species is known to be parasitized by tapeworms acanthobothrium angelae and and nematode echinocephalus overstreeti human interactions when approached coffin ray tends to keep still in its place of concealment on sea floor as a result many divers swimmers and bathers have been shocked after accidentally contacting it while not life threatening shock can be quite severe shock can still be perceived by a person pouring a stream of seawater on ray coffin ray has no economic value in 1883 edward pierson ramsay noted that it was only ray native to port jackson that was inedible it is caught incidentally by commercial trawlers but is hardy enough to usually be returned to water alive it is also caught in lobster traps and infrequently taken by spear fishers as it remains common and widespread international union for conservation of nature iucn has assessed this species as least concern it has been kept in public aquariums but requires moving food references category torpedinidae category fish of australia category strongly electric fish category fish described in 1795 category taxonomy articles created by
