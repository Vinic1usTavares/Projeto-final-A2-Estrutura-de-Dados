battle of verrieres ridge was a series of engagements fought as part of battle of normandy in calvados during second world war main combatants were two canadian infantry divisions with additional support from canadian 2nd armoured brigade against elements of three german ss panzer divisions battle was part of british and canadian attempts to break out of caen and took place from 19 to 25 july 1944 being part of both operation atlantic 18 21 july and operation spring 25 27 july immediate allied objective was verrieres ridge a belt of high ground which dominates route from caen to falaise ridge was occupied by battle hardened german veterans who had fallen back from caen and entrenched to form a strong defensive position over course of six days substantial canadian and british forces made repeated attempts to capture ridge strict german adherence to defensive doctrine as well as strong and effective counterattacks by panzer formations resulted in heavy allied casualties for little strategic gain jarymowycz 1993 p 76 from perspective of canadian 1st army battle is remembered for its tactical and strategic miscalculations most notable being a highly controversial attack by black watch royal highland regiment of canada on 25 july in which 315 of its 325 soldiers were killed wounded or captured this attack costliest single day for a canadian battalion since 1942 dieppe raid has become one of most contentious and critically analysed events in canadian military history bercuson p 223 zuehlke p 168 copp 1999a while failing to achieve its original objective an important strategic result of battle of verrieres ridge was to aid overwhelmingly successful operation cobra by tying down powerful german panzer formations that might otherwise have been moved to counter attack cobra background verrieres ridge lies south of city of caen overlooking broad plains and dominating countryside between caen and falaise although a major d day objective for commonwealth forces allied push inland was halted short of caen and positional warfare ensued until first week of july zuehlke p 163 on 9 july operation charnwood succeeded in taking northern half of city but i ss panzer corps maintained defensive positions in remainder of caen van der vat p 155 a week later operation goodwood renewed british offensive and caen finally fell on 19 july although by this time city had been largely devastated van der vat p 157 next anglo canadian goal was town of falaise but verrieres ridge now strongly defended by i ss panzer corps stood in their path jarymowycz 1993 p 75 elements of british 2nd army secured part of adjacent bourguebus ridge and managed to gain a foothold on verrieres ridge but were unable to dislodge its german defenders copp 1992 p 45 forces involved thumb geography of verrieres ridge and surrounding area canadian ii corps commanded by lieutenant general guy simonds initially assigned two infantry divisions and one armoured brigade to assault on german positions around verrieres canadian 3rd infantry division having taken heavy casualties during first six weeks of normandy campaign was given a supporting role bercuson p 220 onus of task therefore fell on fresh though relatively inexperienced canadian 2nd infantry division along with tanks of canadian 2nd armoured brigade bercuson p 222 d este p 205 additional forces were later made available in shape of three divisions from british i corps 51st highland division guards armoured division and british 7th armoured division jarymowycz 1993 p 78 despite having significantly more combat experience than their canadian counterparts british units played a minor part in battle bercuson p 221 jarymowycz 2001 p 128 while british forces had been battling for caen elements of dietrich s i ss panzer corps part of generalfeldmarschall gunther von kluge s army group b had turned verrieres ridge into their main defensive position along anglo canadian front jarymowycz 2001 p 132 although not particularly high ridge s topography meant that advancing forces would be exposed to fire from german positions across river orne from ridge and from nearby german held industrial hamlet of st martin o keefe two powerful formations 12th ss and 1st ss panzer divisions held ridge supported by artillery dug in tiger tanks and mortar emplacements jarymowycz 1993 p 77 a third 9th ss panzer division was held in reserve further support was available from 272nd grenadier infantry division a force composed mainly of russian and polish combatants that had been raised in 1943 116th panzer division and a battalion of tiger tanks battle attack of calgary highlanders in a follow up to operation goodwood on 19 july calgary highlanders attempted to take northern spur of verrieres ridge but german mortar fire limited their progress tanks from sherbrooke fusiliers were sent to support battalion and eliminated several machine gun positions on either side of point 67 highlanders eventually managed to dig in despite accurate return fire over next few hours they strengthened their position and 5th and 6th canadian infantry brigades made repeated attempts to exploit gains against a tenacious german defence and minor infantry and tank counter attacks canadians were broadly repulsed with heavy casualties simonds rapidly prepared a new offensive for following day with goals of capturing both eastern side of orne river and main slopes of verrieres ridge operation atlantic thumb upright lieutenant general guy simonds senior canadian commander for battle during an inspection tour after ve

hours of 20 july camerons secured a position in st andre sur orne but were quickly pinned down by german infantry and tanks bercuson p 220 at same time south saskatchewan regiment moved directly up

der vat p 159 by end of day south saskatchewans had taken 282 casualties and ridge was still in enemy hands despite these setbacks simonds was adamant that verrieres ridge should be taken and sent in black watch and calgary highlanders to stabilise precarious allied position minor counter attacks by both battalions on 21 july managed to contain dietrich s armoured formations and by time operation was called off canadian forces held several footholds on ridge including a now secure position on point 67 bercuson p 224 copp 1992 p 47 four german divisions still held ridge in all actions around verrieres ridge during operation atlantic accounted for over 1 300 allied casualties operation spring thumb start lines of operation spring showing layout of divisional and battalion forces for both sides with capture of caen on 19 july an anglo canadian breakout had become strategically feasible in american sector lieutenant general omar bradley commander of u s 1st army had been planning his own breakout codenamed operation cobra and simonds too began preparing a new offensive codenamed operation spring spring was originally conceived by field marshal bernard montgomery as a holding attack designed to tie down german forces while cobra was under way on 22 july however with operation atlantic having failed to achieve its aims simonds changed objective of operation spring to a breakout offensive copp 1992 p 46 with verrieres ridge taken simonds could launch armour and artillery attacks from its southern flank to push germans further back this would clear caen falaise road and his two british armoured divisions could then advance south to falaise operation spring was scheduled in four tightly timed phases calgary highlanders would attack bourguebus ridge and may sur orne to secure flanks of main thrust which was to be a move on verrieres ridge by black watch along with armoured support from british 7th armoured division and 4th canadian armoured division plan called for offensive to start on 23 july but poor weather led to a postponement for 48 hours taking advantage of this respite i ss panzer corps reinforced ridge with an additional four battalions 480 tanks and 500 guns copp 1999b allied intelligence learned of this reinforcement through ultra signals intercepts and advised simonds s headquarters on 25 july two days later than originally planned owing to weather operation spring was launched black watch were scheduled to begin their attack at about 05 30 from an assembly area at st martin south of caen canadians ran into heavy german resistance on st martin road and did not arrive at their assembly area until close to 08 00 by that time black watch s two highest ranking officers had been killed and command fell to major phil griffin at 08 30 he met with 5th brigade commander brigadier general w j and despite non arrival of most of their promised armoured support decision was taken for attack to proceed copp 1992 p 55 at 09 30 as canadian infantry regiments advanced up ridge they were easy targets for well entrenched german machine gun nests and mortar pits supported by tanks anti tank guns and nebelwerfer rocket artillery to make matters worse black watch communications were knocked out within minutes of start of their assault very few members of black watch regiment managed to make it to crest of ridge and those who did were subjected to an even heavier bombardment as they ran into counter attacking forces of 272nd infantry division and 9th ss bercuson p 225 jarymowycz 1993 pp 83 134 of 325 men that left assembly area 315 were killed wounded or captured black watch lost all its senior commanders including major phil griffin with two companies virtually annihilated stacey 1960 p 192 aftermath thumb german counter attacks in aftermath of operation spring 25 26 july 1944 all of gains made by black watch and calgary highlanders were lost to german counterattacks which inflicted heavy losses on highlanders and previously unscathed black watch support company jarymowycz 1993 p 82 black watch had to be reformed after verrieres ridge having sustained more casualties than any canadian infantry battalion since disastrous 1942 raid on dieppe bercuson p 226 central area of ridge near verrieres village was eventually taken and held by royal hamilton light infantry jarymowycz 1993 p 79 east side was also taken but subsequently lost although two british armoured brigades were able to secure significant footholds near positions of royal hamilton light infantry jarymowycz 2001 p 135 failure to capture ridge had little effect on overall allied position as success of operation cobra was so overwhelming that germans diverted significant resources including two panzer divisions from ridge in their attempt to keep bradley s forces boxed in jarymowycz 1993 p 84 with german defences weakened subsequent commonwealth attacks on ridge were successful operation totalize finally managed to wrest position from its ss defenders on 8 august jarymowycz 1993 p 87 bercuson pp 228 229 casualties allied casualty figures for battle as a whole were not produced but can be inferred by examining two operations accepted toll for operation atlantic is 1 349 with about 300 fatalities operation spring s losses were about 500 killed with a further 1 000 captured or wounded working from these figures historians estimate around 800 canadian dead and 2 000 wounded or captured jarymowycz 1993 p 81 canadian dead are buried in bretteville sur laize canadian war cemetery between caen and falaise canadian official historian charles stacey and military historian michael reynolds wrote that german casualty figures for individual operations are difficult to determine stacey attributes this to gradual degradation of german logistics chain leaving incomplete records and reynolds wrote that units sometimes over reported their losses in hope of receiving more reinforcements stacey 1960 pp 270 271 reynolds p 198 german losses for battle were significantly fewer than those suffered by canadians according to reynolds between 16 july and 1 august 1st ss panzer division lost 1 092 men killed wounded or captured along with 11 panzer iv tanks and 10 sturmgeschutz iii self propelled guns in fighting across all its fronts including at verrieres over a similar period he estimates 12th ss panzer division in all sectors suffered only 134 casualties many of german fallen are buried at la german war cemetery historiography and controversy thumb montgomery eighth from left talking with simonds ninth from left at ii canadian corps headquarters in normandy france 20 july 1944 photo by lt donald i grant battle of verrieres ridge although given no particular prominence in german military history is one of first canadian army s most scrutinised actions matter was first brought to public attention by stacey who wrestled with question of how to present battle in official history of canadian army in second world war and was required to make minor changes to narrative of battle by simonds at time stacey was writing history as senior historian of historical section of canadian army simonds was chief of general staff of canadian army effectively his boss stacey 1980 pp 1 293 report on operation spring by simonds was released after war and blamed its failure on 11th hour reinforcement of german lines and strategically unsound execution on part of major phillip griffin and black watch simonds pp 67 68 declassified wartime documents show that simonds along with several others in allied high command had likely been notified on 23 july of a massive german build up on ridge copp 1992 p 50 some historians including david o keefe and david bercuson accused simonds of being careless with lives of his men terry copp and john a english wrote that given amount of pressure that all allied commanders were under to break out from normandy simonds probably had little choice in decision he made copp 1992 p 61 operation spring succeeded in its later defined objective of a holding attack and aided overwhelming success of operation cobra by tying down powerful german formations that might otherwise have been in american sector thus precluding any immediate inquiry into its failure simonds p 65 german commander of normandy sector gunther von kluge was at canadian front on 25 july instead of american front where eventual breakout occurred bercuson p 227 battle of verrieres ridge had little overall effect on british attempts to break out of caen as significant resources were transferred to american front in aftermath of cobra to exploit bradley s success ridge eventually fell to general allied advance notes footnotes references av media books journals
