regency square is a large early 19th century residential development on seafront in brighton part of british city of brighton and hove conceived by speculative developer joshua hanson as brighton underwent its rapid transformation into a fashionable resort three sided set piece of 69 houses and associated structures was built between 1818 and 1832 most of houses overlooking central garden were complete by 1824 site was previously known briefly and unofficially as belle vue field square was a prestigious high class development attracting social elite central garden originally private has been council owned since 1885 and publicly accessible since ww2 an underground car park was built beneath it in 1969 most of buildings in and around square have been designated listed buildings 47 houses are each listed at grade ii second highest designation while 18 other houses a war memorial a nearby inn and a set of bollards outside it have each been given lower grade ii status house at southwest corner is now numbered as part of king s road but was built as part of regency square and is also grade ii listed history belle vue field regency square was built on one of fields to west of town but within parish of brighton field was briefly and unofficially known as belle vue field after it was acquired by francis hanson owner of nearby belle vue house in late 1790s belle vue house was built near to a windmill known as west mill windmill was owned by matthew bourne in 1744 but was not marked on ogilby s 1762 map although a windmill is shown on lambert s view of brighthelmstone which is dated 1765 in 1790s windmill was owned by john streeter on 28 march 1797 when 86 oxen dragged it uphill on a sled to nearby village of preston it was re erected there and renamed preston mill after several more renamings it was demolished in 1881 its machinery was cannibalised by owners of nearby mill a watercolour painting now displayed at preston manor shows crowds of people watching mill s removal to preston by late 18th century brighthelmstone as it was originally known had begun to develop into a fashionable coastal resort when annual town fair could no longer be accommodated on its traditional site in old town belle vue field was used as one of several temporary locations belle vue field is sometimes said to have been site in 1793 of a 10 000 man military encampment however belle vue field did not yet exist in 1793 and contemporaneous sources show that encampment occupied a much wider area of land extending as far as boundary with neighbouring parish of hove jane austen refers to encampment in her novel pride and prejudice written in 1796 and published in 1813 heroine elizabeth bennet s sister is invited to brighton and elopes with and later marries army officer george wickham annual military encampments moved to other sites in and around brighthelmstone in subsequent years hanson builds square in 1818 field was acquired by francis hanson s son joshua flesher hanson a businessman by this time brighton s profile was such that speculators were commissioning architects and builders to design and lay out sea facing residential developments to attract wealthy long term visitors or permanent residents royal crescent new and bedford square were already in existence clarence square russell square and marine parade were being developed hanson s plan for regency square was on a much larger scale than these developments he divided belle vue field into 69 plots leased them individually and put strict covenants in place demanding that each house be built in a specific style in order to ensure architectural harmony in return leaseholders mostly private builders would have right to buy and would end up with houses much larger than average for town with excellent sea views and exclusive access to large central garden most leaseholders bought houses as soon as they could which was to hanson s advantage as he made money and had no ongoing responsibility for buildings restrictions in covenants included requirement to erect a facade with an iron balcony to clad area below balcony in stucco to paint facade at least every three years to repair any damage and to pay towards maintenance of central garden no stucco was to be applied above balcony line covenants included a requirement to form a residents committee whose job it was to ensure covenants were obeyed and to impose a levy on occupiers of houses to pay for upkeep of garden thumb left regency tavern stands at northeastern corner of square although there is no documentary evidence confirming architects most sources attribute regency square s buildings to father and son partnership of amon and amon henry wilds who moved to brighton from nearby lewes in 1815 and became two of brighton s most important architects they were extremely prolific and were responsible for defining and developing town s distinctive regency style although they worked extensively with fellow architect charles busby during 1820s historians agree that he was not involved in regency square at least not in its early stages buildings appear to lack his distinctive flair and are not as impressive as those at kemp town estate to east of brighton which all three men were involved with no 1 regency square now 131 kings road is confirmed as work of amon henry wilds some evidence points to william mackie being involved in design of houses on east side of square building work started in 1818 and continued until 1832 with most of houses complete by 1824 a passageway regency colonnade was built at northeast corner to connect square to neighbouring development of russell square regency tavern has occupied most of passageway since 1870s all of it since 1939 st margaret s church an anglican chapel of ease designed in greek revival neoclassical style in 1824 by busby was local place of worship thumb right 131 king s road was formerly known as 1 regency square and st albans house in 1866 west pier designed by eugenius birch was built opposite square s central garden unusually hanson had set a 71 year time limit on covenants rather than granting them in perpetuity and on 25 december 1889 they were due to expire among other things residents would then lose their rights to use gardens residents committee led by solicitor somers clarke unrelated to brighton born architect of that name attempted unsuccessfully to purchase gardens and extend covenants by an act of parliament two years later passing of brighton improvement act 1884 achieved same aims brighton corporation took ownership of gardens and householders signed new deeds confirming they wished for covenants relating to their houses to be extended indefinitely 20th century from beginning regency square was a prestigious high class development and it is still considered to be one of brighton s best sea facing squares by mid 20th century most of houses had become hotels but majority have since been converted into flats and square today is overwhelmingly residential in early 1963 a surface level car park was planned for brighton corporation owned central garden this was changed to a 520 space underground car park created in 1967 9 using cut and cover method in which garden was dug up car park with roof constructed and lawns and flowerbeds restored richard seifert s modernist 24 storey residential block sussex heights was built in 1968 on land immediately to east of square and was criticised for affecting character of square because of its contrasting style and height during early 1970s hotels sought permission from brighton corporation to erect neon signs advertising themselves after negotiation with regency society a brighton wide conservation group formed in 1945 corporation made square and surrounding area into a conservation area in 1973 conservation area status gives council firmer control over planning permission and changes to buildings or street furniture especially in respect of their effect on character and appearance of area original conservation area has since been enlarged twice to its present size of architecture almost all buildings in regency square have
