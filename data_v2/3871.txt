remixes in you can dance stephen thomas erlewine from allmusic said that song sounds dated this is quite clearly extended mixes from mid 80 s but that s part of charm dave barry from miami herald commented that although you can dance sounds like old madonna spotlight sounds surprisingly fresh to his ears joe brown from washington post commented that song should have been a flat reject don mcleese from chicago sun times called song exuberant from dallas observer hunter hauk deemed it bastard brother of into groove it s just as infectious but it didn t get support it deserved dennis hunt from los angeles times commented that you can dance is an attractive package for dance fans particularly with inclusion of a new cut spotlight he went on to add that lyrics of spotlight aren t great but they re still more interesting than others still words like those of most dance songs are just window dressing that s secondary to beat big attraction of spotlight is a long hard driving closing passage that s guaranteed to turn dancers on jan while writing for orlando sentinel noted that song was already receiving airplay from radio stations billboards joe lynch called it a lyrically simplistic affair that s elevated by a pounding opener sparkling keys and a charmingly earnest vocal that makes even silliest sentiment sound like a viable philosophy for conquering world chart
