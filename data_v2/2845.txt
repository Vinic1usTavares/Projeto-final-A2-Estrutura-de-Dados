rain weathered in women s road race following day event was one of earliest to be concluded at 2008 summer olympics taking place on first day of competition concerns were raised before olympics about threat of pollution in endurance sports but no major problems were apparent in race in april 2009 it was announced that rebellin had tested positive for continuous erythropoietin receptor activator cera a third generation form of erythropoietin during olympics after his b sample subsequently confirmed initial results he returned his medal and repaid prize money he had won from italian national olympic committee coni while still maintaining his innocence cancellara and original fourth place finisher alexandr kolobnev were later awarded new medals corresponding to their updated finishing positions qualification qualification for race was restricted to five athletes per national olympic committee noc providing that these athletes qualified through union cycliste internationale uci rankings with uci protour considered to be superior to uci continental circuits number of qualification places allocated varied among different uci tours which all maintain their own ranking system any noc unable to fill its quota of athletes from protour was permitted to enter athletes from one of continental tours and if that was not feasible from b world championship number of places allocated to each tour were thus in descending order 70 riders from protour 38 from europe tour 15 from america tour nine from asia tour five from africa tour and three from oceania tour five entrants qualified through b world championships final number of competitors was set to be 145 but only 143 athletes started race four cyclists were scratched from race shortly before it took place damiano cunego of italy had not yet recovered from injuries he sustained in 2008 tour de france so he was replaced by vincenzo nibali portugal s sergio paulinho silver medalist at 2004 event was said to be in insufficient shape to race after russian vladimir gusev was fired by his professional team for failing an internal doping check he was replaced in this event by denis menchov who later competed in time trial while training earlier in week before race switzerland s michael albasini crashed and broke his collarbone there was not sufficient time to find a replacement for him preview pollution issues prior to opening of games international olympic committee was keen to play down risk that athletes faced from pollution however organizing body considered rescheduling of endurance events such as cycling road race if pollution levels were too high athletes partaking in these events can consume 20 times amount of oxygen as a sedentary person a higher level of pollution in air could adversely affect performance damage or irritate an athlete s lungs or exacerbate respiratory conditions such as asthma independent sources showed that pollution levels were above limit deemed safe by world health organization on august 9 however cycling event went ahead as scheduled with no objections from athletes fifty three of 143 cyclists pulled out during race however this is not unusual over half withdrew mid race at 2004 summer olympics post race a number of riders highlighted punishing conditions in particular heat and humidity 90 which were much higher than in europe where majority of uci protour races are held pollution however was not widely cited as a problem though stefan schumacher of germany who had been considered an outside favorite for victory in event said elements and pollution played a role in his withdrawal pre race favorites thumb paolo bettini left and kim kirchen right rivals and pre race favorites among pre race favorites was entire spanish contingent of riders it included two winners of grand tours in alberto contador and carlos sastre along with highly regarded countrymen alejandro valverde winner of 2008 criterium du dauphine libere and reigning

schumacher and australian cadel evans twice a runner up in tour de france 2007 and 2008 it was thought that members of overall strong squads from germany and luxembourg could also contend for victory

nest and water cube men s race layout which differed most significantly from women s in that it was over double its length saw riders make seven loops back and forth between badaling and juyong passes early sections of race took place within central beijing consequently gradient of this part of race was relatively flat at approximately point in race riders reached badaling section of great wall and began their first of seven loops riders encountered an increase in gradient at this point with badaling pass gaining in elevation over a distance of from start of circuit to highest point from there cyclists rode over a false flat before descending a highway towards juyong pass final of race gave riders a moderately steep climb to contend with which was designed to ensure an exciting finale should several riders have been grouped together at end of race as there were due to security regulations put in place by olympic organizers no spectators were permitted to stand roadside along course this decision proved to be controversial several prominent figures in cycling including uci president pat mcquaid and riders stuart o grady and cadel evans both australia spoke out against it mcquaid and o grady both felt that absence of people along course deprived race of atmosphere present at other cycling events and said that it failed to take supporters wishes into consideration cycling
