hereinafter cited as puyallup ii again justice douglas wrote opinion for court but this time he struck down state restrictions as discriminatory puyallup ii 414 u s at 48 blumm at 451 douglas noted that restrictions for catching steelhead trout with nets had remained and was a method used only by indians whereas hook and line fishing was allowed but was used only by non indians mulier at 52 as

indians in favor of sports and commercial fishermen allocating almost nothing to tribes at headwaters of river sohappy 302 f supp at 911 at 90 91 blumm at 454 mulier at 54 55 oregon argued that treaties only gave indians same rights as every other citizen and belloni noted that s uch a reading would not seem unreasonable if all history anthropology biology prior case law and intention of parties to treaty were to be ignored sohappy 302 f supp at 905 mulier at 55 belloni also found that state may regulate fishing by non indians to achieve a wide variety of management or conservation objectives its selection of regulations to achieve these objectives is limited only by its own organic law and standards of reasonableness required by fourteenth amendment but when it is regulating federal right of indians to take fish at their usual and accustomed places it does not have same latitude in prescribing management objectives and regulatory means of achieving them state may not qualify federal right by subordinating it to some other state objective or policy it may use its police power only to extent necessary to prevent exercise of that right in a manner that will imperil continued existence of fish resource sohappy 302 f supp at 908 mulier at 56 57 belloni issued a final ruling that tribes were entitled to a fair and equitable portion of fish harvest mulier at 58

net onto a beach on quileute indian reservation men and women hauling a fishing net onto a beach on quileute indian reservation court held that when tribes conveyed millions of acres of land in washington state through a series of treaties signed in 1854 and 1855 they reserved right to continue fishing court looked at minutes of treaty negotiations to interpret meaning of treaty language in common with as united states described it to tribes holding that united states intended for there to be an equal sharing of fish resource between tribes and settlers at 457 at 206 at 123 as court stated phrase means sharing equally opportunity to take fish therefore fishermen shall have opportunity to take up to 50 of harvestable number of fish and treaty right fishermen shall have opportunity

washington 520 f 2d at 682 n 2 684 writing for a majority of court circuit court judge herbert choy affirmed judge boldt s opinion in all respects but clarified that judge boldt s equitable apportionment of harvestable fish did not apply to fish caught by non washington citizens outside state s jurisdiction washington 520 f 2d at 688 90 693 in his majority opinion judge choy emphasized that states may not enact regulations that are in conflict with treaties in force between united states and indian nations washington 520 f 2d at 685 noting that indians negotiated treaties as at least quasi sovereign nations consequently he concluded that treaties signed in 1850s expressly preempted washington s regulations and that non indians had only a limited right to fish at treaty places washington 520 f 2d at 685 judge choy also emphasized that tribes were entitled to an equitable apportionment of opportunity to fish in order to safeguard their federal treaty rights and that ninth circuit should grant district court a great amount of discretion as a court of equity when apportioning rights to fisheries washington 520 f 2d at 687 he held that district court s apportionment was well within its discretion but clarified that tribes were not entitled to compensation for unanticipated heavy fishing that occurred off washington s coast judge choy also clarified that district
