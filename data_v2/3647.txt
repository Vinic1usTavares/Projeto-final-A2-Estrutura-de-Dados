with opening credits for season nine a complete re design that saw annabeth gish and mitch pileggi added to opening sequence and familiar graphics totally scrapped these credits looked like they belonged to a different series and at that point it was emily vanderwerff of a v club awarded first part a c and second part a c she argued that series was unable to figure both out how to re situate itself after events of september 11 and deal with permanent departure of duchovny ultimately she wrote that episodes as a whole represent a limp piece of storytelling that has maybe enough good ideas for three quarters of an episode but is stretched across two for no particular reason m a crang in his book denying truth revisiting x files after 9 11 was highly critical of script arguing it was difficult to pinpoint any significant moments that occur during either episode but he did praise production team s execution of some impressive set pieces robert shearman and lars pearson in their book wanting to believe a critical guide to x files millennium lone gunmen rated both episodes one star out of five shearman and pearson p 261 in a review of first part two noted that this isn t quite dullest season opener to x files but this episode has all passion of a wet monday morning in a review of second half two noted there is at least semblance of drama here but this second episode isn t significantly better than first marisa guthrie from boston herald felt that gillian anderson s character dana scully had been rendered impotent footnotes bibliography external links category 2001
