other universities with later foundations team did not form as a conscious act of campus administration university s student newspaper at time ariel reported on basketball throughout 1895 as sport was introduced to campus from a rival school minnesota a m in st paul later incorporated into larger university of minnesota twin cities in 1896 a team from school began to participate in a league with

time basis to coach basketball program and became full time coach and director of physical education by fall of that year hugunin and thornley pp 6 cooke was one of first full time professional coaches in all of college basketball and would remain at program for 28 seasons cooke began to improve team significantly and was responsible for shifts in gophers scheduling that foreshadowed other changes to come team never played a ymca team after 1903 04 season and beginning in 1900 began to schedule large neighboring universities that would join minnesota in big ten competition this shift to playing similar competition helped gophers to become one of premier programs in nation from 1899 00 to 1903 04 seasons gophers had a 59 6 record 1901 02 squad has been retroactively named national champions by both helms foundation and premo porretta power poll premo porretta poll also names 1902 03 gophers as national champions when big ten established basketball in 1905 gophers won first two conference titles after 1907 cooke s dominance of national basketball scene was greatly reduced he led team to two more conference titles 1916 17 1918 19 and one consensus retroactive national championship for 1918 19 season but team was never consistent winner that it was in first decade under cooke he retired after 1923 1924 season his successor harold taylor was cooke s assistant coach in his final season and had previously a successful high school coach however he had little success with gophers and was fired after never finishing higher than sixth in conference in three forgettable seasons perlstein pp 50 dave macmillan and beyond 1927 1959 following firing of harold taylor as coach program underwent a national search for a successor many of candidates for job were high profile coaches of other conference foes hugunin and thornley pp 50 team opted however to hire dave macmillan who had been coaching university of idaho for previous seven seasons and had previously played for original celtics during 1910s perlstein pp 18 mcmillan would dominate program for next thirty years coaching team from 1927 to 1942 and again from 1945 to 1948 mcmillan s teams in 1928 began to play in university of minnesota field house a new on campus arena basketball had been off campus for several seasons when team moved downtown mcmillan s teams had middling success his 1930 31 and 1931 32 teams competed near top of big ten but his teams dropped off again until 1936 john kundla joined team for 1936 1937 season and helped team to big ten championship which was ended up being its last until 1972 mcmillan s squad also competed in a tournament in 1936 to represent united states in 1936 summer olympics in berlin team advanced several rounds before being ousted by depaul hugunin and thornley pp 52 many gophers players in this era were recruited from minneapolis public high schools and in some seasons this even constituted a majority of roster and thornley pp 56 mcmillan resigned in 1942 but returned in 1945 after three poor seasons for gophers in interim when he resigned for second time in 1948 he was replaced by o b cowles cowles was known for playing slower tempo basketball like was most common in 1920s and 1930s and was known as a defensive minded coach especially early in his career hugunin and thornley pp 79 his squads were led by two time all american jim mcintyre and three time nba champion whitey skoog for early years of his career and big ten mvp chuck mencel for middle ones another notable gophers star from era was pro football hall of fame coach bud grant cowles had a 612 winning percentage at school gophers were unable to win a big ten title however despite a solid nucleus in cowles s early seasons team finished fourth or better in conference seven times in cowles s eleven seasons as gopher head coach kundla and fitch 1959 1971 thumb right golden gophers have played home games in williams arena since 1928 in 1959 john kundla stayed behind in minneapolis as lakers prepared to leave town and succeeded o b cowles as head coach of golden gophers kundla remained head coach until 1968 in 1963 he broke color barrier in minnesota program and recruited three african american players to come to school one of these first three players was lou hudson who played in nba and was first gopher to have his number retired by school perlstein pp 55 other two players recruited by kundla archie clark and don yates also were both drafted by nba teams that trio helped gophers to a third place big ten finish in 1963 64 and a second place finish in 1964 65 but those were high points for kundla s collegiate career kundla s personal assessment of his gophers career was that his personal weaknesses in recruiting were marring team by end of his tenure perlstein pp 61 kundla was succeeded by bowling green head coach bill fitch fitch remained with gophers for two seasons before being hired by cleveland cavaliers as their first head coach in 1970 to make leap to nba where he later won an nba title as coach of boston celtics perlstein pp 64 fitch did recruit jim brewer before he left laying first seed for 1972 big ten title george

cal luther away from murray state to coach team in 1971 but he changed his mind and turned team down after accepting position instead bill musselman took over program musselman was a defensive minded coach and designed his team around brewer recruiting several junior college players university of minnesota baseball star dave winfield also joined team in 1971 hugunin and thornley pp 128 starters on 1971 72 squad after ohio state became known as iron five musselman s strategy succeeded and team took big ten title first since 1937 other big ten coaches did not approve of musselman s recruiting posture as they all had gathered and agreed not to recruit ron into big ten because he was known as a troublemaker musselman had not been named head coach of minnesota at that time and therefore was unaware of internal agreement and therefore recruited what he thought were best players available in 1973 former player greg olson accused musselman of having attempted to strike him in a practice hugunin and thornley pp 130 it was also revealed that olson had sold complimentary season tickets to a booster named harvey mackay which prompted ncaa investigations musselman s coaching style also brought about significant transfers away from minnesota program to other schools hugunin and thornley pp 131 in 1975 musselman resigned and was named head coach of san diego sails of aba after his resignation musselman admitted to giving money to players for rent and transportation these charges coupled with earlier ticket selling scandal and other transgressions regarding payments and aid revolving around harvey mackay resulted in a list from ncaa of more than 100 rule violations in musselman s four seasons at school extent of consequences would not be known until early in jim dutcher s eleven season tenure as gophers head coach jim dutcher era 1975 1986 dutcher took over gophers program in 1975 following departure of bill musselman highlight of his time at minnesota was 1982 a

allegations of massive academic fraud in men s basketball program former basketball office manager jan gangelhoff had gone to newspaper claiming she had written over 400 papers for at least 20 gopher men s basketball players over a period of several years ending in 1998 when gophers played gonzaga on march 11 university suspended players antoine kevin clark jason stanford and miles tarver since they allegedly had papers written for them by in previous seasons with their roster depleted gophers lost to gonzaga season came to an end and an internal investigation at university began by june

2000 season and docked itself 11 scholarships over four years in summer of 2000 haskins came forward and admitted that he had paid gangelhoff 3 000 for her services this revelation came to light after haskins turned his financial records over to ncaa in addition more details were emerging in which haskins was also accused of mail fraud in an incident regarding a recruit s transcript giving players cash dismissing sexual harassment concerns against his players as well as his staff trying to persuade professors to give his players inflated grades they had not earned stripped banners and record

haskins watch ncaa stripped gophers of all postseason awards titles personal records and statistics dating back to 1993 94 season citing a lack of institutional control haskins was also slapped with a seven year show cause order which effectively banned him from coaching at any level in ncaa until 2007 besides lying about 3 000 payment he had also told several of his players to lie to ncaa later big ten forced gophers to vacate their 1997 conference title as well as all regular season games dating to 1993 94 as a result minnesota s official record from 1993 94 to 1998 99 is 0 0 if not for

level as rest of big ten his gopher teams only made ncaa tournament once in 2004 05 monson almost left minnesota program for university of washington following 2001 02 season but was thought of highly
