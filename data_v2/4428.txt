1893 94 season was 13th season of competitive association football and second season in football league played by small heath f c an english football club based in birmingham in 1892 93 inaugural season of football league second division small heath had won divisional championship but failed to gain promotion via test match system this year they finished as distant runners up in league eight points behind liverpool but were successful in test match defeating darwen 3 1 to confirm their place in first division for 1894 95 football league season club struggled financially during season and there were suggestions that it might have disbanded had promotion not been secured small heath entered 1893 94 fa cup in first round proper and lost in that round for second consecutive year this time to eventual losing finalists bolton wanderers of first division in local competitions they were eliminated by midland league club loughborough in first round of birmingham senior cup and by wolverhampton wanderers in semi final of mayor of birmingham s charity cup small heath played fewer friendly matches than in previous season instead competing in a regionally organised supplementary competition united counties league in which they finished third of four teams in southern section small heath used 23 different players in nationally organised competitive matches during season and had 12 different goalscorers four players ted devey fred wheldon tommy hands and billy ollis appeared in every league match all but devey for second consecutive season top scorer was inside forward frank mobley with 25 goals his total of 24 league goals made him second division s leading scorer and all five first choice forwards reached double figures for second season running background small heath were elected to newly formed second division in 1892 and went on to win divisional championship however promotion to first division depended on test match system in which each of lowest ranked three teams from first division played off against one of highest ranked three from second division small heath lost to newton heath after a replay so were not promoted league s annual general meeting heard proposals that first division be expanded to either 20 or 18 teams both motions were unsurprisingly seconded by small heath but both were defeated thus confirming that team would play in second division for 1893 94 season second division championship shield was presented to club at a meeting of football league held at colonnade hotel in new street birmingham in august of regular first team

in form of a shield small heath opened their second season in football league with a visit to walsall who were playing at wednesbury because their new ground was not yet ready former small heath full back tom bayley was one of several newcomers for hosts but their visitors had few changes in personnel teddy jolley came in at full back and replacing billy walton was jack lee who dribbles cleverly and is a very dangerous forward round goal in presence of 4 000 spectators lee scored twice as small heath won 3 1 fred wheldon opened scoring for small heath in first 30 seconds of their next match at home to rotherham town 15 minutes later visitors were 3 2 ahead but by half time home side had regained lead unsurprisingly tempo dropped in second half but a game played in a friendly and sportsmanlike spirit was marred towards end by rotherham forward alf pickering suffering a fracture of his right leg just below knee in an accidental collision with bernard pumfrey snap of bone being heard all round ground initial reports suggested break was such that he was almost certain never to play football again this was followed by a comfortable 6 1 defeat of burton swifts in which jolley moved to inside right in jack hallam s absence through illness giving gilbert smith his debut at full back in return fixture against walsall charles izon a well built forward who is quick on ball and shoots excellently scored a hat trick on his debut as small heath again won comfortably a visit to liverpool gave caesar jenkyns honour of scoring first football league goal conceded by home side but visitors fell all to pieces in second half and were decisively beaten young and inexperienced smith made mistakes that cost two goals but forwards were undoubtedly weak spot and birmingham daily post s reporter suggested they would have to learn to shoot harder and play with far more spirit if they are to keep up reputation they gained last season after burslem port vale beat small heath on monday in more decided a fashion than did liverpool by five goals to nil poor form shown in previous two matches by forwards and by wheldon in particular was much improved at ardwick although small heath scored only once resultant win was enough to take them into october in second place in division having already completed a quarter of 28 game league programme october thumb right upright caesar

players claim that small heath s equaliser had entered goal through a hole in side netting their play became rough culminating in centre half joe mcque a strapping fellow kicking frank mobley in abdomen apparently intentionally while referee was cautioning mcque small heath captain caesar jenkyns rushed in knocked mcque to ground and was sent off with a man advantage it still took liverpool until stroke of time to score winning goal posts reporter suggested that despite provocation jenkyns should not have reacted way he did but knowledge that it cost his side game was sufficient punishment despite referee in his report agreeing that punishment of being sent off would meet case and that jenkyns had played a perfectly fair game and had expressed regret at his actions both when dismissed and after game football association imposed a four week suspension to begin on 31 october in meantime play of jenkyns and his fellow half backs was instrumental in a 4 1 defeat of woolwich arsenal first half hour was played in a spiritless fashion but then wheldon scored a fine goal with one of his characteristic shots and remainder of game was one sided small heath team prepared for their match at newcastle united by taking train as far as york on friday evening which left only another for day of match contrary to expectation small heath were successful in a hard game with half backs again influential despite jenkyns receiving a nasty blow in mouth they ended october level on points with three other clubs in third place on goal average november while most of second division clubs were involved in fa cup qualifying ties small heath who had received a bye to first round proper lost a friendly match against everton reserve team by five goals to nil everton s near neighbours liverpool complained to league that game adversely affected attendance at their home fixture with newcastle but league confirmed that everton were within their rights to arrange match better forward play had rarely been witnessed at lincoln than that shown by small heath in a 5 2 defeat of lincoln city whose defence failed to cope with industry and creativity of teddy jolley feeding light but nimble forwards mobley in particular next weekend numerous matches were postponed or abandoned because of weather although small heath and crewe alexandra players were changed and ready to play

turned down a big offer from first division club aston villa for services of fred wheldon newcastle united travelled to birmingham on friday to be fresh for saturday s match as small heath had done in reverse fixture and again tactic worked their forwards displayed excellent combination were splendidly supported by half backs and but for jenkyns untiring efforts matters would have been worse than 4 1 defeat changes were made for visit of middlesbrough ironopolis arthur littleford charles izon and bernard pumfrey coming in for smith mobley and jack hallam half backs were again backbone of team and wheldon who produced a brilliant exposition of dodging and shooting scored winning goal five minutes from time in what standard s reporter described as a rattling good game fred speller was reported to have not been seen in such form since his leg was broken last year in a boxing day friendly with top amateur club marlow club from which he signed for small heath their last league match of 1893 a comfortable 6 0 victory against lincoln city took them into new year in second place in division three points ahead of notts county but two points behind liverpool who had played two fewer matches pumfrey strengthened defence george hollis was as usual secure in goal and forwards with returning mobley and introduction of reserve team player walter jackson showed better combination and

half tommy hands crossed ball for wheldon to open scoring from which point goals followed regularly until match finished as a 4 3 home win wheldon was involved in two of his side s three goals but was too closely watched by reynolds to be as effective as usual on a day when hard and slippery surface meant those teams whose players have least regard for safety of their limbs usually gain victory small heath without hallam who was unwell and william reynolds injured against aston villa defeated a very indifferent northwich victoria 7 0 in their next match at crewe alexandra home players reportedly played with supreme indifference to safety of their opponents limbs hands who had been one of small heath s better performers was carried off after receiving a nasty kick to leg but despite having to play with ten men visitors won 5 3 of crewe s three goals first should have been disallowed for offside and third was a ted devey own goal midland league club loughborough hosted small heath in first round of birmingham senior cup in heavy rain scores were level until ten minutes from time when goalkeeper george hollis was barged into goal before he could get to a shot from distance ball followed him over line and despite obstruction on goalkeeper referee awarded loughborough a goal small heath threw men forward in search of an equaliser which left them ill protected in defence and they conceded twice more in fa cup small heath were drawn at home to bolton wanderers who were so keen to have match played on their own ground that they offered small heath total gate receipts up to ps150 and a half share of receipts above that figure with a minimum guarantee of ps60 to agree to a change of venue offer was declined bolton were predicted to lose but they did not with wind behind them small heath took a two goal half time lead but in second half hollis who had not given a worse display in goal all season made numerous mistakes gifted visitors two goals and final score was 4 3

ill played behind an experimental defensive pairing of half back ted devey and reserve team player george short despite scoreline nottinghamshire guardian described them as a very useful pair of backs although not up to home team s standard and daily post rated devey as easily best left back club have played this season two of notts goals were fortunate an attempted clearance by devey ricocheted off jenkyns head for their second goal and for their third ball appeared to be heading safely over crossbar until caught by a gust of wind eight midlands clubs formed a league to be played as a supplementary competition to fill vacant dates in season without trouble and expense of arranging friendly matches later joined by small heath and notts county small heath s first four matches in this united counties league were played in february after a creditable draw at home to wolverhampton wanderers of first division they thoroughly deserved to win return match 2 1 west bromwich albion took a 5 1 lead in first half at coventry road yet in second small heath forwards raised their level of performance scored three times without reply and were unfortunate not to secure a draw two days later first division club won return match at stoney lane rather more comfortably committee organised a public meeting at which chairman walter hart bemoaned poor attendances which he felt would not improve unless team were promoted to first division mentioned that club had rejected a big offer from a neighbouring club for release of a prominent player and called for ps200 to be raised to bring in players to strengthen team s defence a collection in hall raised cash and pledges to value of ps42 10s and supporters contributed generously to public appeal an attempt to sign full back jack oliver from middlesbrough ironopolis was unsuccessful and club offered services of goalkeeper chris charsley to aston villa march in front of a large crowd small heath suffered what was described as an unfortunate one goal defeat at grimsby town hollis should have done better with grimsby s opener frank mobley was injured around eye in collision with goalkeeper when scoring small heath s only goal and showed some bravery in remaining on field and wheldon had an apparently valid goal disallowed short in a trifle risky style and solid devey again did well in defence lost gate receipts because of aston villa s withdrawal from united counties league was decidedly unpopular with other members and small heath committee arranged a smoking concert to raise funds those clubs at bottom of first division and top of second were all recruiting new players test matches mean such a lot to clubs concerned that there is no wonder at this anxiety to secure new blood small heath acquired services of full backs percy watson and william purves from rotherham town and irish club glentoran respectively small heath club staged a double header following saturday after reserves beat brierley hill alliance 3 0 in birmingham district league watson made a promising debut at back as first team played a friendly against a below strength nottingham forest side charsley returned to first team duty in a 10 2 demolition of ardwick whose goalkeeper arrived with his team already one goal behind mobley s fourth hat trick gave him ten goals from his last six matches taking him past 20 goal mark for season a close game at rotherham produced a 3 2 win and against burslem port vale small heath forwards had rarely been seen to greater advantage as they scored six without reply semi final of birmingham charity cup provided a break from league action mobley opened scoring but wolverhampton wanderers shot against woodwork on several occasions and visitors were singularly fortunate in restricting home side to one goal and that a penalty kick with scores level a decision was made not to play extra time and replay was arranged for two weeks later at coventry road in their penultimate match of football league season small heath produced a good team performance to win 4 1 at woolwich arsenal and reach 100 league goals for season forwards played a characteristic beautifully combined game half backs particularly jenkyns were too strong for home forwards purves looked set to be full back team had needed for some time and charsley kept goal exceedingly well april against stoke in united counties league jack hallam opened scoring after a fine passing move as small heath won 3 0 in return fixture charles partridge s magnificent performance in goal kept score down to a 2 1 defeat as small heath finished third in four team division going into last match of football league season small heath were in second place in division one point ahead of opponents notts county neither could challenge liverpool for title but both were sure of their places in promotion test matches likely opponent for team finishing second would be darwen whereas third placed team could expect rather tougher prospect of preston north end notts county had won fa cup previous weekend and daily post took that as a good omen inasmuch as winners of english cup rarely do themselves justice on following

generating gate receipts of ps200 although result was rather overshadowed by aston villa beating burnley away from home to be confirmed as first division champions dart clearly appreciated how small

small heath lost replayed charity cup semi final to wolverhampton wanderers 2 0 fred wheldon was only second division player selected in football league representative team to play scottish league at goodison park liverpool expected to join aston villa should small heath not be promoted and thought by many to be best inside left in england wheldon performed like clever and finished player he is as match was drawn leicester chronicle felt that darwen would have to play up to stand much chance against small heath who had a smarter set of forwards than can be found amongst most of first division teams and pointed out that small heath were only team in either division to have scored 100 goals during season players prepared for test match at droitwich spa where saturated salt water of brine baths provided relief for tired muscles match played at stoke s victoria ground was an exciting one darwen had much best of first half but failed to take their chances small heath were restricted to rare attacks but were dangerous on break and opened scoring through jack hallam darwen equalised before interval and continued their dominance until superior fitness told with six minutes left small heath took lead goal variously attributed to wheldon or an orr own goal after which darwen lost heart and tommy hands scored again four minutes later daily post suggested that one would scarcely believe that they were same five forwards who have so often delighted spectators with their play at coventry road but to every man of defence great praise is due for so ably checking opposing forwards nottinghamshire guardian was less critical of forwards but took view that small heath were fortunate to catch darwen in a very crippled condition and that goalkeeper chris charsley had done club a considerable service in making himself available for such a vital game victorious team arrived back in birmingham by train engine s funnel draped in players blue and white kit to be greeted by 1 000 supporters at new street station interviewed 55 years later billy walton remembered how we were rushed pell mell into a coach and followed by others we paraded streets calling at what seemed to be every hotel and pub en route i almost regret to say that when celebrations ended it was necessary to engage cabs to convey our players to their homes season ended with a friendly against newly crowned football league champions aston villa visitors giving their services free for benefit of small heath club before a crowd of four or five thousand both clubs fielded strong sides and match finished as a 3 3 draw summary and aftermath daily posts pleasure at small heath s victory was heightened by their belief that defeat would in all probability have meant disbanding of club ambitions of promotion having sustained committee s efforts throughout season to raise enough funds to keep club going they pointed out that further expense was necessary both to strengthen team for it cannot be expected that eleven or twelve men will stand strain of a season s work amongst first division clubs and to improve facilities at coventry road ground club held a celebratory dinner at which chairman congratulated players exhorted them to redouble their efforts to make a decent showing in first division and appealed to their continuing loyalty he attempted to dispel suggestions that city could not support two teams in top division and expressed gratitude to aston villa club for their sincere best wishes as demonstrated by their generous donation of recent benefit match balance sheet showed expenditure of ps2 039 of which players wages accounted for ps1 303 which resulted in a net loss of ps222 when set against income of ps1 816 of which ps1 586 came from gate receipts and ps104 from season tickets nevertheless during close season club began work on a grandstand and furrows on field of play were filled up small heath went through league season without drawing a match they scored 103 goals at a rate of 3 6 goals per game and became first team to exceed 100 goals in a football league season sunderland scored exactly 100 previous season if test match goals are counted all five first choice forwards reached double figures for second consecutive season leading scorer was frank mobley with 24 league goals a total which also made him top scorer in second division closely followed by fred wheldon with 22 ted devey tommy hands billy ollis and wheldon were ever present in league all but devey for second season running and caesar jenkyns missed only two games for which he was suspended fred speller attempted a comeback appearing twice for first team early in season but injury received against darwen proved end of his professional football career matthews complete
