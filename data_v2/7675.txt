theodoxus fluviatilis common name river is a species of small freshwater and brackish water snail with a gill and an operculum an aquatic gastropod mollusk in family neritidae neubauer thomas a 2014 theodoxus theodoxus fluviatilis linnaeus 1758 accessed through world register of marine species at http www marinespecies org aphia php p taxdetails id on 2014 11 18 this widely distributed snail species occurs from europe to central asia it has a thick shell with a calcified operculum coloration pattern on shell is very variable theodoxus fluviatilis lives in freshwater and in brackish water in rivers and lakes on stones it feeds mainly by grazing on biofilms and diatoms some of populations of this species are spreading and these can reach densities up to thousands of snails per square meter females lay egg capsules each of which contains a large number of eggs but only one snail hatches from capsule snails reach sexual maturity in a year and total lifespan is 2 or 3 years taxonomy theodoxus fluviatilis was originally described under name nerita fluviatilis by carl linnaeus in 1758 linnaeus original text type description in latin was very short and reads as follows which means in english nerita fluviatilis number 632 shell is wrinkled there are no teeth in aperture it inhabits rivers in europe later this species was moved to genus theodoxus montfort 1810 theodoxus fluviatilis is in fact type species of genus theodoxus anistratenko and colleagues designated lectotype for theodoxus fluviatilis in 1999 anistratenko o yu ya i anistratenko v v 1999 molliuski roda

while in other areas it is expanding for example in danube river in rhine river during 1970s theodoxus fluviatilis came close to local extinction because of water pollution subsequently water quality improved for more than two decades leading to a recovery even so species became extinct in rhine for an unknown reason in late 1990s since 2006 theodoxus fluviatilis recolonized rhine probably via

maximum weight of freshwater shells is 343 mg exterior of shell is basically whitish or yellowish with a net like dark reddish or violet pattern this pattern is very variable depending on environmental factors sometimes partly presenting bands and even occasionally being evenly dark shell is very variable in color and color patterns showing great polymorphism shell coloration and patterns are very plastic in all species of genus theodoxus and these qualities may be influenced by factors like ionic composition of water type of substratum and nutrition of individuals in various habitats zettler and colleagues 2004 showed that in outer coastal waters of baltic sea nearly black and often corroded shell form of theodoxus fluviatilis is predominant whereas in inner sheltered parts of coastal waters yellowish green forms prevail gloer and pesic 2015 observed that specimens from a darker stony substrate were black or dark brown shells of specimens of theodoxus fluviatilis from northern europe are ornamented with a pattern of white drop like spots on a dark or red background specimens from south france and spain are ornamented with a pattern of zigzag stripes while

species display a large morphological plasticity which makes them difficult to differentiate overall outline of shell is still used for species identification in recent malacological literature though

species too females have two openings located under edge of mantle in mantle cavity opening of vagina and an opening for laying eggs vagina accepts sperm during copulation vagina is connected to bursa copulatrix and to spermatheca for storing sperm other opening is for laying eggs egg cells originate in ovary egg cells travel through oviduct to fertilization chamber where fertilization occur eggs

populations can live in salinities of up to 15 0 in baltic sea or up to 18 0 in baltic sea and in black sea populations from brackish water can tolerate higher salinity than populations from freshwater brackish water populations have much higher accumulation of positive substances in foot this species lives on hard benthic substrates typically rocks it lives on pebbles sometimes on boulders and rarely on dead wood it tolerates mild organic pollution low oxygen content down to below 2 mg liter but it does not tolerate long periods of droughts or ice it lives in waters and sometimes in oligotrophic waters theodoxus fluviatilis serves an indicator species for river monitoring in germany however spreading populations also have a high tolerance for degraded habitats
