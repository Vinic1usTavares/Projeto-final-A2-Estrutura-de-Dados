letters and believed austen s personal life was inspiration for pride and prejudice jarrold began production of film in early 2006 opting to shoot primarily in ireland as he found it had better preserved locations than hampshire england where austen was raised released firstly in united kingdom on 9 march 2007 and in other countries later in year becoming jane earned approximately 37 million worldwide film received mixed reviews from critics hathaway s performance received mixed critical reception with some reviewers negatively focusing on her nationality and accent commentators and scholars have analysed presence of austen characters and themes within film and also noted implementation of mass marketing in film s release plot jane austen is younger daughter of reverend george

benefactor lord chief judge langlois of london for rich madame la comtesse and her friends this visit is meant to be a short break in their journey to see jane s brother edward this would allow judge

impressions manuscript that will become pride and prejudice however judge langlois receives a letter informing him of genteel poverty of jane s family and he refuses to give tom his blessing declaring that he would wish tom to be he had been rather than allow him to live in poverty because of a bad marriage tom tells jane that he cannot marry her and she is crushed not knowing that tom has a

and with a penniless wife distraught tom asks her if she loves him and she replies yes but if our love destroys your family then it will destroy itself in a long slow degradation of guilt and regret and blame as she leaves jane catches a last glimpse of tom through carriage window as he briefly follows horses outpacing him twenty years later jane now a successful author and by choice unmarried sees tom during a gathering henry now married to eliza brings tom to her tom introduces his eldest daughter who admires jane s novels tom s daughter asks jane to read aloud but as jane rarely does so he with his daughter using her name which is also jane astonished that he named his eldest after her jane agrees to read last scene shows tom s daughter sitting by jane as she reads aloud from pride and prejudice while tom watches jane affectionately as she concludes their eyes meet and tom joins rest of company in honouring jane and her work with applause cast anne hathaway as jane austen james mcavoy as thomas tom lefroy julie walters as mrs austen james cromwell as reverend george austen maggie smith as lady gresham lucy cohu as eliza comtesse de feullide laurence fox as mr wisley joe anderson as henry austen ian richardson as lord chief judge langlois of london sophie as jane lefroy anna maxwell martin as cassandra austen leo bill as john warren jessica ashworth as lucy lefroy eleanor methven as mrs lefroy helen mccrory as mrs radcliffe tom vaughan lawlor as robert fowle production conception and adaptation in 2004 screenwriter sarah williams approached douglas rae and robert bernstein of ecosse films with intention of creating a film about life of jane austen a popular eighteenth century english novelist williams had recently read becoming jane austen a 2003 biography that largely pieced together several known facts such as austen s meeting tom lefroy on christmas 1795 into a coherent story about unrequited love bernstein agreed to adapt work believing that it depicted a pivotal relationship in jane austen s early life that was largely unknown to public book s author jon hunter spence was hired as a historical consultant on film with task of see ing that given that story is a work of imagination factual material was as accurate as possible within limitations of story after williams completed several drafts of screenplay company hired kevin hood to aid in further script development bernstein believed that hood s past work contained a romantic sensibility there is a poetic quality about his writing as well as there being a rigorous emotional truth which i thought was important for jane hood was attracted to film because he believed story is such an important one and very much inspiration for pride and prejudice calling austen a genius and one of top two or three prose writers of all time hood thought that her relationship with lefroy was absolutely essential in shaping her work hood acknowledged however that becoming jane is based on facts as they are known and majority of characters did exist as did many of situations and circumstances in film some have been fictionalised weaving together what we know about austen s world from her books and letters creating a rich landscape julian jarrold became attached to direct film in early 2005 it was his second feature film after kinky boots which was released later that year according to bernstein he liked jarrold s style as it was modern and visceral and i just had a feeling that he was right choice this piece needed to be handed with delicacy but also with a certain amount of brio and julian was able to bring those two things to production director began work on project in early 2006 rereading novels pride and prejudice sense and sensibility and persuasion and also reviewing austen biographies such as spence s book jarrold depended most heavily on script calling it a rich witty and clever screenplay from someone who obviously knew his subject very well it is a love story but much more besides kevin s screenplay has so many layers and interesting ideas apart from love story i was very attracted by themes of imagination and experience director intended to bring austen up to date by roughening her up a bit and adding more life and energy and fun opining that past austen adaptations had been a little bit picture postcard and safe and sweet and nice casting left thumb 200px anne hathaway focused on learning an english accent believing that if she didn t get that right rest of performance wouldn t matter because people would write me off in first five minutes jarrold sought to make becoming jane look and feel realistic so everything is not lit in a very glamorous hollywood way according to him one of key ideas in film was to get away from old stuffy costume drama kind of feel of what jane austen is and to look at somebody before she becomes a genius when she is in her early twenties and on verge of writing her great thing she had a real exuberance for life intelligent and independent and a sort of outsider in rural hampshire more intelligent than people around her and kicking against all those pressures to further set his film apart from other costume dramas american actress anne hathaway was cast as title character a fan of jane austen since she was fourteen hathaway immediately began rereading austen s books conducting historical research including perusing author s letters and also learned sign language calligraphy dance choreography and playing piano she moved to england a month before production began to improve her english accent and attempted to stay in character throughout filming first time she had done so for a movie james mcavoy stars as thomas langlois lefroy thumb 200px there were concerns in some quarters that american hathaway was playing a beloved english writer james mcavoy who plays thomas langlois lefroy believed that filming in ireland made her casting a bit safer than if they had shot in england mcavoy accepted role because he enjoyed austen s writings and was eager to work with jarrold having collaborated with him previously on 2002 television production white teeth mcavoy first assumed that becoming jane would be directly associated with pride and prejudice with his character possessing similarities with mr darcy actor soon realised however that screenplay was nothing like pride and prejudice screenwriter probably speculated on some of inspiration for pride and prejudice but it is a completely different story julie walters had once disliked austen s writings but changed her mind when she read pride and prejudice after receiving her role as mrs austen appearing as mr austen was actor james cromwell who viewed his character as a generous gentleman well educated and supportive of jane for most part he is bedevilled by his financial circumstances but deeply in love with his wife and sympathetic to her concerns about what will happen to girls if they don t marry joe anderson portrayed henry austen while lucy cohu played widowed eliza de worldly cousin and henry s romantic interest cohu believed that her character needs security she is looking to be safe she finds that security with henry as she knows austen family anna maxwell martin appeared as jane s sister cassandra actress called her character terribly sensible noting that she gets her heart broken it s very sad she s levelling force for jane austen wild one she tries to get her back in line but fails miserably becoming jane also featured laurence fox as mr wisley and dame maggie smith as lady gresham whom jarrold viewed as possessing similarities to lady catherine de burgh in pride and prejudice but in this film you get to see her hidden vulnerabilities pain of never having had children and her controlling maternal power over wisley other cast members included ian richardson as judge langlois leo bill as john warren jessica ashworth as lucy lefroy michael james ford as mr lefroy tom vaughan lawlor as robert fowle and helen mccrory as mrs radcliffe costume design thumb right 250px a costume from film worn by anne hathaway irish costume designer eimer ni mhaoldomhnaigh designed clothing seen in film she attempted to create a different style of costumes than had been seen in recent austen adaptations and drew inspiration from fashions of 1790s a time period she considered fascinating and a very transitional era in terms of fashion it was a real challenge to make it work ni mhaoldhomhnaigh attended cannes film festival in may 2006 but then had to quickly return to becoming jane set to complete last two days of filming she later collaborated with jarrold in 2008 drama film brideshead revisited for research ni mhaoldhomhnaigh visited museums and art galleries and also read austen s letters and novels she was interested in both effects of continental fashions on english clothing and differences between social classes while she recognised that 1795 marked beginning of empire waistline trend ni mhaoldhomhnaigh also understood this fashion would have barely been introduced to austen s circle in country rather film displayed many costume designs from early 1790s she explained we wanted to show that transition especially for women look in london is very different from look in countryside for country ball fashion for older women is more of old style but for younger women we show introduction of empire line costume designer created all of hathaway s outfits from scratch and looked for images of a young jane austen ni mhaoldhomhnaigh explained i wanted to get her youthfulness and innocence across through her dress but crucially there was also her strength of character so we kept away from frills and i wanted a definite look that was quite strong but also pretty at same time jane was living on a working farm so her dress had to be practical as well in terms of costume we were definitely trying to steer away from chocolate box image that we associate with jane austen ni mhaoldhomhnaigh dressed mcavoy in rich fabrics such as velvet and beaver fur to help distinguish him from other men she recalled that he wears very stylish waist coats and cut away jackets with jane around he d have an extra swagger in front of her james mcavoy was really into it we d talk about colours and fabrics to achieve his distinctive look ni mhaoldhomhnaigh and maggie smith agreed that lady gresham s dresses would be modelled after 1770s fashion which was sort of dress that character would have worn when she was much younger and suited her back then lady gresham is very much her own character and is not someone who is dictated to by fashion smith s dresses contained stiff fabrics to emphasise a woman who was very set in her ways filming produced independently by ecosse becoming jane was given a limited budget of eur12 7 million ps9 million or 16 5 million production designer eve stewart researched regency literature and austen s life and along with jarrold scouted locations in dublin and nearby counties for five weeks in january and february 2006 they ultimately opted to shoot in dublin and irish counties of meath and wicklow instead of hampshire birthplace of austen because it held a sense of countryside that felt more unchanged while hampshire had unfortunately become too groomed and manicured jarrold also found a great variety of georgian houses and older houses in ireland his production received funds from irish film board uk film council premiere fund higson pp 18 19 2 entertain scion films and miramax films film critic andrew sarris noted that in ireland happily there are still architectural traces of life more than 200 years ago to correspond with year 1795 however ireland did include a few disadvantages stewart found that rural aspects were most difficult as irish country landscape is nothing like hampshire there are no rolling hills so vegetation and landscaping was trickiest thing for me as a production designer left thumb 280px henrietta street in dublin was used to represent regency london due to its low budget becoming jane was filmed on a tight schedule of eight weeks from march to may 2006 jarrold observed however that because ecosse was not a film studio he had more creative freedom bernstein stated of filming we recreated a world that jane austen lovers can recognise and associate with but hopefully we can also take them into areas and places like boxing club cricket game and fair that do not feature in jane austen s fiction they are sort of seedy and dangerous areas that are not normally associated with austen jarrold found filming very difficult we had to make it work in locations that we had as efficiently as possible filming outdoors was often so cold that hathaway turned blue and had difficulty saying her lines automated dialogue replacement in post production helped correct this by re dubbing her lines story s central location was set at steventon rectory where austen was raised while it had been demolished in 1824 jarrold and his crew fortunately found a wonderful house that was very like original we honed script as well to make it as practical as possible stewart believed that austen house expressed their status and wealth i think that you will lose central thrust of story unless you understand status of austen s and that they are pretty poor jane spent all her formative years there and that was place that influenced her view of world you have to believe that family live in that house because that is a crucial piece of jigsaw scenes at steventon rectory were filmed in house a few miles off trim in county meath later in fall 2006 it appeared again as house of in northanger abbey charleville castle stood in for interior scenes of lady gresham s estate while house an old elizabethan revival estate provided exterior shots of property other filming sites included bridge in dublin mountains as mr austen s rectory and dublin s henrietta street and north great george s street as regency london a house on henrietta street also provided filming site for mrs radcliffe s residence gentleman jackson s club where lefroy boxes was represented by dark and otherworldly mother redcaps tavern also in dublin music and soundtrack musical score of film was written by english composer adrian johnston to prepare melodies he reviewed music books that had belonged to austen family first track first impressions has been described as a depressing song that exhibits slow pure and classical piano work one critic quipped that it belonged in becoming sylvia plath later tracks ranged in mood from upbeat and playful to somber and teary in his review of score tim clark of soundtrack net lamented absence of a truly memorable theme despite a wealth of thematic material and found similarities to dario s composition for 2005 film pride prejudice patsy morita a music critic for allmusic wrote that second half of johnston s score becomes as unremarkable as so many other dramatic film scores of early twenty first century she continued it fulfills its purpose of underscoring emotion of story by being moody and slow to change melodically and harmonically and by using many pregnant pauses and minimalist leaning repetitive figures morita added that there is nothing in it to draw attention away from film score later received a nomination for best original film score at 2008 ivor novello awards film soundtrack was released on 31 july 2007 a track listing for album is as follows henry purcell s hole in wall also known as st martin s lane which is featured in ballroom scene was first published in 1695 and is highly unlikely to have been common during regency when jane austen was a young adult downloadable editions of original soundtrack include six bonus tracks of music heard in film themes and analysis fictionalisation of plot jon spence author of biography film was based on identifies tom lefroy as love of austen s life and her relationship with him as origin of her genius but he never suggests that there was an aborted elopement much less subsequent reading sessions with any of lefroy s children and he is careful as filmmakers are not to clarify that in speculating about austen s romantic experience he is reading between lines of family records and of three rather opaque austen letters that are his principal sources an important deviation of film s plot from history is that there is scant evidence in real life austen and lefroy s relationship went beyond acquaintance rather all that is known of them together is that they danced at three christmas balls before tom returned to school and that jane was too proud to ask his aunt about him two years later in latter years of tom lefroy s life he was questioned about his relationship with jane austen by his nephew and admitted to having loved jane austen but stated that it was a boyish love as is written in a letter sent from t e p lefroy to james edward austen leigh in 1870 my late venerable uncle said in so many words that he was in love with her although he qualified his confession by saying it was a boyish love as this occurred in a friendly private conversation i feel some doubt whether i ought to make it public lori smith author of jane austen guide to life opined that no doubt this relationship and her jane s repartee with tom fueled her writing whether it was her greatest inspiration as trailers for becoming jane claim well that s debatable but i m sure it provided as spark however contrary to film s story line jane had attempted her first full length novel before she met tom and had already read history of tom jones a foundling before meeting him in a cut scene from movie it is clear that she is reading novel for second time but in theatrical release without that scene it appears he introduces her to it representation of austen characters in story various commentators have offered opinions concerning presence in film of characters and themes from austen s works particularly with pride and prejudice deborah cartmell contended that hathaway s austen is a replica of elizabeth bennet with a touch of impetuous lydia thrown in cartmell p 11 and added that associations between austen and elizabeth are more explicit than in any other austen biopic cartmell p 113 tim robey of daily telegraph declared that film took good old p ps storyline and replace d elizabeth bennet with austen herself and added a real life pseudo darcy from skimpiest of biographical evidence a companion to jane austen observed that physicality of jane and lefroy s kiss was similar to passionate kiss between elizabeth and darcy in 1995 serial pride and prejudice empire magazine further expressed that place in mass marketing implementation of mass marketing in film s production and release has attracted notice from film and literary scholars dianne f sadoff writes that becoming jane confirms two decades long of jane austen according to andrew higson film was another example of austen power and desire of filmmakers to exploit possibilities of both austen industry and market for literary cinema and television and more generally market for traditional english drama higson p 180 while reviewing austen adaptations of 1990s and 2000s in her book heritage film nation genre and representation author belen vidal viewed becoming jane as yet another transformation of austen s novels into icons of popular culture to vidal this and other productions such as jane austen book club 2007 and miss austen regrets 2008 confirmed generic status of austen phenomenon whilst dispensing with incorporation of literary text becoming jane followed a different formula than austen adaptations of 1990s and attempted to draw viewers from a variety of demographic groups hathaway s casting was intended to attract young female viewers who had enjoyed actress in princess diaries and princess diaries 2 royal engagement higson p 186 according to producers view was that this demographic group would have been in their early teens during release of princess films making them right age for austen as 15 year olds expecting becoming jane to be a popular film in february 2007 penguin books announced new editions of six of austen s best known novels their redesigned covers were intended to attract teenage readers heritage and other themes becoming jane has been referred to as a heritage costume drama film a genre which has been popular in united states among both its audiences and its film studios according to andrew higson becoming jane falls into continuing trend of american attitudes influencing english film higson p 9 belen vidal wrote that film exploit s a well defined heritage iconography and strategically combine s american stars with supporting casts of international quality players hilary radner analysed presence of marriage plot a girl succeeding only by marrying man of her choice in film and television and noted that while becoming jane critiques this film trope it points to power of traditional marriage plot as a residual paradigm influencing feminine identity jarrold s adaptation also came in wake of a number of literary biographical films such as shakespeare in love and miss potter higson pp 180 81 deborah cartmell author of screen adaptations jane austen s pride and prejudice a close study of relationship between text and film found similarities between becoming jane and shakespeare in love almost so obvious that former film risks accusation of being dangerously derivative a given example included characters of austen and william shakespeare inputting their personal experiences directly into their works cartmell pp 116 18 marina cano lopez and rosa maria garcia explained that film follows path opened by john madden s shakespeare in love numerous intertextual connections between both movies can be reduced to one just as shakespeare is imagined as hero of his own play jane austen becomes heroine of her own novel among other listed similarities they noted that romantic interests of both protagonists serve as their literary muses and that middle part of both films lie when viewed from a historical perspective release and reception premiere theatrical release distribution and box office world premiere of becoming jane took place in london on 5 march 2007 it was released to cinemas on 9 march 2007 in united kingdom and a week later in ireland by buena vista international it ultimately grossed ps3 78 million in uk and ireland placing in sixteenth among all uk films for year in those markets sixty three percent of audience was female and 40 5 percent were above age of 55 film s performance was considered disappointing and it influenced us release date it arrived in australia on 29 march miramax films distributed film in united states giving it a release date of 3 august 2007 originally studio intended to release becoming jane in june or july due to a counter programming strategy attempting to attract demographic groups who were not interested in large blockbusters higson p 182 film was expected to perform well during all seven days of week and gradually gain more viewers during its time in cinemas due to presence of recognizable stars such as hathaway becoming jane was expected to also do well among mainstream audiences however due to its weak uk release film s release was moved to august when it opened on 100 screens in its first week it increased to 601 screens following week later reaching 1 210 screens while film made under 1 million in its first week it was considered a highly respectable showing for a heritage biopic and enough of a figure to justify a ten week run sadoff pp 247 48 film eventually grossed a total of 18 670 946 in us on an international scale becoming jane received a total of 37 311 672 it earned its highest grosses in us uk and australia home media becoming jane was released on dvd and blu ray in uk on 10 september 2007 a month after it arrives in cinemas in us on 12 february 2008 disney and miramax released dvd and blu ray in us both versions contained audio commentary with jarrold hood and bernstein deleted scenes pop up facts footnotes and a featurette called discovering real jane austen us home video rights to film have since been picked up by echo bridge entertainment and film has seen several reissues on blu ray and dvd often packaged with other films such as jane eyre critical response film review aggregation website rotten tomatoes gave film a score of 58 based on reviews from 139 critics site summarized consensus although becoming jane is a well crafted period piece it lacks fresh insight into life and works of jane austen film focuses too much on wardrobe and not enough on austen s achievements new york times called film a triumph for hathaway but observed that screenplay s pseudo austen tone is so consistent that its lapses into modern romance novel fantasy and threatens to derail film more positive entertainment weekly called film a charmer articulating that supporting cast julie walters maggie smith james cromwell is top drawer and anne hathaway with her beauty and frank demeanor is a welcome jane critics lauded hathaway and mcavoy for chemistry between their characters finding that it lent authenticity to love story between austen and lefroy while hathaway was admired for her performance by some critics some reviews negatively focused on her nationality as well as inauthenticity of her accent james mcavoy defended decision of casting hathaway by stating that a director should find right actor and she is undoubtedly brilliant hathaway herself admitted persistent tendency to sound too much like myself and not at all like jane blaming cold weather in ireland which meant she had to do voice retakes for several scenes nonetheless jarrold praised hathaway for her performance in a wrap up party after filming director confessed that actress had been a different person not just her accent but also whole character way of holding yourself and speaking was so completely different time out london gave a positive review enunciating that overall approach is less contrived than you d expect and though alignment of circumstance and social status thwarting innocent passions is hardly fresh it s handled with thoughtful decorum emotional temperature s rather restrained as a result but with luxury casting all down line elegant visuals balancing verdant and velvet and a delightful faux classical score it s a classy package all right just missing extra spark some reviewers have questioned historical accuracy of film for instance critiquing depicted relationship between austen and lefroy accolades award category
