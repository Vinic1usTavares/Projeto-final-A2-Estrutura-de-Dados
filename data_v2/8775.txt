matsumino apologizes to gin for eating persimmon and gin forgives him story concludes with gin seeing hotaru following summer and wondering if he will be able to tell her about his feelings for her production manga author yuki midorikawa explained in postscript of aizoban hotarubi no mori e reprint that idea for story came to her more easily than for any other work up until that point although she had been planning to write a story as challenging as hotarubi no mori e once she had gained more experience writing manga she decided to undertake project sooner when idea for story suddenly came to her afraid that she might lose idea she promptly began to draw it and midorikawa s writing progressed smoothly despite having numerous conflicting ideas for development of story story came from midorikawa s desire to draw several scenes she was interested in drawing a scene where a boy dodges a girl who is falling towards him she also wanted to draw a shadowy summertime forest which would allow her to expand range of tones and blacks used in manga a third inspiration was desire to depict a more tranquil summer festival than those she had drawn before she was also eager to create mask worn by gin at festival which resembled face of a fox whose typical slitted eyes were replaced by oval ones to give mask a creepy hybrid fox primate appearance supernatural love story between hotaru and gin is considered a starting point for midorikawa s best known work natsume s book of friends which also depicts ill fated interactions between humans and yokai sometimes referred to as in both stories differences in lifespan and other insurmountable barriers mar their relationships and attempts to understand each other prior to anime film s theatrical release in 2011 midorikawa published an additional chapter to story hotarubi no mori e since original story was already complete and she initially felt uncomfortable about adding to it she opted instead to expand on story from gin s perspective anime cast voice actor s s tree hand child younger brother mami child older sister kumiko at festival according to animation director yumi satou anime project originated with his personal wish to animate original manga which he enjoyed project was given approval in early 2011 and according to film s producer shuko yokoyama anime was originally planned as an original video animation which would not have been released in theaters however popularity of natsume s book of friends which was also written by midorikawa and developed by same production staff gave them support they needed to create an anime film film was produced by studio brain s base and directed by takahiro omori starring japanese voice actors ayane sakura as hotaru and koki uchiyama as gin satou had frequently worked together with yokoyama on previous projects other staff included akira character design yukihiro shibuya art hiromi miyawaki color design hitoshi tamura photography and kazuhiko seki editor anime film had a very small staff because it was a very short film and was produced domestically unlike tv series natsume s book of friends which was primarily outsourced to other countries a common trend in anime production in march 2011 midway through production 2011 tohoku earthquake and tsunami struck japan despite national tragedy production crew continued its work and according to omori team hoped that their work would help soothe nation after it had time to recover omori speculated that this was part of reason for strong positive reception and awards anime later received setting in manga was based on a shrine in kumamoto prefecture of japan known as shrine which is dedicated to no mikoto and no mikoto from japanese mythology animation crew spent two hours searching location for settings on which they could base their art because story was set in forest of a mountain god omori intended art to represent a different world where background scenery was obscure and blue sky was slightly brighter than normal omori and his crew devoted extra attention to lighting and coloring making forest dim with light coming through canopy and landing on characters with appropriate intensity contrast between light and dark was also used during festival scene to emphasize its bizarre nature reminding audience that hotaru should not be there because of significance of summer season to story omori deliberately loaded film with summer scenes such as rustling leaves and of cicadas according to omori idea for opening scene was suggested by yokoyama following traditional cinematography images of scenes indirectly related to main story were played while opening credits appeared originally intended to show gin s life before meeting hotaru omori allowed viewer to decide its relationship in time with main story omori also opted to start hotaru s narration from a time after story s main events showing hotaru as an 18 year old who had just graduated high school and heading back to visit her relatives near forest by having hotaru tell story in retrospect omori thought it provided a more human feel and gave more meaning to final scene where hotaru expresses her hopes for future by saying come on let s go one of difficulties in adapting manga to anime according to omori was that developing relationship between hotaru and gin had to be shown visually rather than through monologue one way in which this was done used hotaru s yearly change in height by subtly showing convergence of length of their strides when walking audience is led to perceive a change in their relationship omori also wanted to portray more depth to hotaru s character by expanding on her school life although manga depicted a brief flash of her life in middle school anime depicted scenes from both aspects of her life omori shared a draft of film with composer makoto yoshimori so that he could write music to match tempo however there was some disagreement over ending theme which omori and yoshimori discussed at length over email although neither would compromise on key points issue was eventually settled and ending theme was finalized hotaru s voice actor in anime film ayane sakura was a fan of midorikawa and owned original manga in an interview she mentioned that she was thrilled to get an audition and ultimately role and also admitted that she shed tears while recording koki uchiyama who played gin read manga for audition and confessed that he was concerned at first about how to portray his character though his work made him feel good film was initially pre scored where voice acting was recorded prior to creation of animation but later re recorded for final version according to omori this allowed animation to emphasize natural pauses in dialogue and let cast set rhythm and tempo media manga manga was first published in issue of hakusensha s lala dx in japan it was first reprinted on in tankobon entitled hotarubi no mori e which included four previously

who attended a screening at scotland loves animation festival said it is beautiful in its simplicity though noting that climax seemed a bit rushed and sudden leaving audience to struggle with their emotions nicoletta browne of t h e m anime reviews described it as a vignette of bittersweet nostalgia praising anime for being a gorgeously detailed piece with beautiful animation browne also wrote favorably of story s progression noting that its dark undertones grew heavier as main character matured and that consistent characterization of hotaru from childhood to her early teens was impressive especially given film s length browne s criticisms were limited to noting film s short length a clash between cartoonish depictions of forest spirits and rest of movie and an issue with one element of plot development near end of film she did note that sensitive viewers may interpret some aspects of story as inappropriate such as initial age difference between main characters and way gin punishes hotaru as a child when she tries to touch him in case of former browne noted that their romance developed only when hotaru began to approach gin s physical age and with latter she noted that no harm was intended in both cases she also mentioned that cultural differences must be considered both yokoyama and satou noted japanese ness of anime during panel discussion following main showing at scotland loves animation festival yokoyama had originally been concerned that foreign audiences would not fully understand and appreciate work but reaction of audience at glasgow showing alleviated his concerns according to yokoyama and satou elements of story that exhibited strong elements of japanese culture included watermelon eating scene part where gin hits young hotaru over head with a stick and scene where young hotaru gets scared at night when she sees face of a yokai in patterns of wood panels on ceiling midorikawa attributed success of hotarubi no mori e to quality of story noting even those readers of original manga who were critical of her artwork were drawn to read story from start to finish she speculated that hiding gin s face behind a mask had helped mitigate some of artistic issues for which her earlier work had been criticized intense pressure experienced by midorikawa early in her manga writing career was relieved as a result of positive feedback she received upon her success with hotarubi no mori e in 2011 she expressed excitement for new anime film and having manga reprinted in a new short story collection remarking that her attempts to write about her feelings and recent experiences in relation to hotarubi no mori e brought tears to her eyes she described story as a precious work that helped her build social connections references
