barrett is second and final studio album of new material released by former pink floyd frontman syd barrett recording began at abbey road studios on 26 february 1970 and lasted for 15 sessions until 21 july album was produced by pink floyd s guitarist david gilmour and keyboardist richard wright who also contributed on bass guitar and keyboards respectively along with previous madcap contributor jerry shirley on drums barrett was released in november 1970 on harvest in united kingdom but failed to chart it was re released in 1974 as part of syd barrett which was first us issues of these lp s no singles were issued from album it was remastered and reissued in 1993 along with barrett s other albums madcap laughs 1970 and opel 1988 independently and as part of crazy diamond box set a newly remastered version was released in 2010 background initial sales and reaction of barrett s first solo album madcap laughs were deemed sufficient by emi to sanction a second solo album on 24 february 1970 a month after releasing madcap barrett appeared on john peel s top gear radio show where he performed only one song from newly released album terrapin three that would later be recorded for barrett gigolo aunt baby lemonade and effervescing elephant and a one off two of a kind possibly written by richard wright session producers had no verbal contact with barrett having only communication to him via gilmour for radio session gilmour and humble pie drummer jerry shirley accompanied barrett on bass and bongos respectively version of gigolo aunt recorded for radio session and later released on 1988 s peel session was unfinished as barrett had sung opening verse three times barrett played slide guitar on radio version of baby lemonade with gilmour on organ two days later he began working on his second album in abbey road studios with gilmour as producer and a trio of musicians richard wright shirley and gilmour himself main aim for barrett sessions was to give barrett structure and focus many felt was missing during long and unwieldy sessions for madcap laughs thus sessions were more efficiently run and album was finished in considerably less time than madcap laughs six months compared to madcap s one year on 6 june 1970 barrett gave his one and only official solo performance at olympia in kensington backed once more by gilmour and shirley at end of octopus fourth number of set barrett baffled audience and his backing musicians by abruptly taking off his guitar and walking off stage recording thumbnail left recording took place at abbey road studios first session was on 26 february three of first songs fully recorded attempted during session were baby lemonade maisie and gigolo aunt however gilmour thought they were losing barrett ness after baby lemonade was attempted 2 takes of maisie were recorded before barrett went into 15 takes of gigolo aunt next day two track demos of wolfpack waving my arms in air living alone and bob dylan blues were recorded former two made it to album latter two didn t on recording sheet it lists gilmour as having taken home a copy of latter two gilmour later returned and took master tapes too gilmour has since said those sessions were done so quickly we were rushing to gigs every day and had to fit recording sessions in between i probably took it away to have a listen and simply forgot to take it back it wasn t intended to be a final mix syd knocked it off i took a tape home despite some minor work made to gigolo aunt barrett wouldn t return to abbey road studios until 1 april due to pink floyd working on their 1970 album atom heart mother on various occasions barrett would spy on band as they recorded album again barrett recorded some work to a song wolfpack on 3rd before sessions were postponed until 5 june this time due to gilmour and wright going on tour in us with pink floyd on session of 5 june barrett managed to record an unknown number of two track demos for three songs rats wined and dined and birdie hop rats demo recorded here became basis for album master and would later be overdubbed by musicians despite changing tempos two days later on 7th barrett recorded milky way millionaire before being rounded off with overdubs for rats millionaire was originally titled she was a millionaire and was originally recorded by pink floyd barrett recorded two attempts at a backing track before abandoning it and adding vocals yet another break in recording occurred until 14 july where barrett recorded several takes of effervescing elephant while numerous overdubs were added to barrett s wined and dined demo by gilmour three takes of dominoes ensued with an unknown number of takes of love song dolly rocker and let s split were recorded love song and dolly rocker were both overdubbed former being overdubbed from 17 to 21 july but overdubs for latter were wiped on 21 july barrett worked on another untitled track later to be titled as word song recording only one take before recording 5 takes of last new song to be recorded for barrett it is obvious barrett worked on remakes of two tracks maisie and waving my arms in air latter now seguing into a new track i never lied to you shirley said of barrett s playing he would never play same tune twice sometimes syd couldn t play anything that made sense other times what he d play was absolute magic barrett s direction to other musicians were limited to pronouncements like perhaps we could make middle darker and maybe end a bit middle afternoonish at moment it s too windy and icy songs animals are a recurring item in not only album but barrett s entire solo output side one baby lemonade is a blues folk tune reminiscent of byrds intro was actually barrett simply warming up on guitar that gilmour had managed to record and placed it at start of album making it seem like an intro to song lyrics that describe way for a person to kill time such as line in clock they sent through a washing machine solo was performed by barrett not gilmour as is often noted a recurring theme in album starting with baby lemonade is weather barrett performed song twice both times for bbc previously recorded on 24 february 1970 for john peel s top gear and later for bob harris show on 16 february 1971 love song tells story of an ex girlfriend fondly remembered i knew a girl and i like her still it is first of two songs which feature dreamlike senses in lyrics i ll lay my head down and see what i see barrett performed song for bob harris show in 1971 dominoes features imagery of regret and recollection in lyrics song features a backwards guitar solo by barrett and organ and rhodes by wright song s you and i lyric hints to turtles happy together which refers to tail end relationship barrett had with lindsay first of three songs on album which lyrics point to anguish in my tears my dreams barrett performed song for bob harris show in 1971 it is obvious is second of two songs which feature dreamlike senses in lyrics creep into bed when your head s on ground it is also second of three songs on album which lyrics point to anguish remember those times i could call through clear day time and you would be there theme of weather is referenced again softness warmth and weather in suspense song also references cambridge quarry pits and landscape rats started off as a jam but eventually evolved into a structured song it contains taunting and maniacal lyrics rats rats lay down flat we don t need you we act like that maisie is a blues jam with barrett muttering lyrics song was influenced by howlin wolf s spoonful side two gigolo aunt is based on jeff beck s hi ho silver lining barrett performed song for top gear in 1970 for barrett s only solo performance at kensington olympia in 1970 he played four songs one of them being gigolo aunt waving my arms in air hints to then recently released rolling stones song midnight rambler song contains an echo of octopus waving my arms in air pressing my feet to ground lyrics refer to a hard learned experience song features a childlike section no care no no song segues into i never lied to you with aid of wright s organ i never lied to you is final of three songs on album which lyrics point to anguish it s been so hard to bear with you not there wined and dined dated from barrett s cambridge days and is about relationship between barrett and his then girlfriend gayla pinion a model from cambridge song reflects on about mediterranean evenings musk winds blow and hauntings of barrett s childhood chalk underfoot light ash of blue evoked during a summer party he didn t want to leave dave gilmour added a sinuous sliding lead over barrett s vocals wolfpack had been mentioned by barrett in an interview he said song was one of favourites out of all his material effervescing elephant was pastiche of verse form of hilaire belloc s cautionary tales for children in contrast to dominoes it is obvious rats waving my arms in air and wolfpack previously mentioning one or two animals effervescing elephant contains references to a whole jungle full of animals barrett performed song for top gear in 1970 for barrett s only solo performance at kensington olympia in 1970 he played four songs one of them being effervescing elephant release and aftermath cover of album was designed by barrett it was originally one of many drawings barrett had done in cambridge years earlier barrett was released in november 1970 to less interest than had greeted madcap laughs earlier in year and as a result failed to reach chart talks of more singles and a third album were rumoured over following months barrett dismissed album and madcap saying they ve got to reach a certain standard and that s probably reached in madcap once or twice and on other one only a little just an echo of that neither of them are much more than that allmusic reviewer ritchie unterberger called album a bit fuller and smoother than first album referring to baby lemonade gigolo aunt and effervescing elephant as among his and best loved tunes however tone is darker and more meandering in rest of album in an overview of barrett s career rolling stone referred to both barrett s solo albums as entrancing on 16 february 1971 barrett recorded a short set for bbc radio 1 s sound of seventies radio show in contrast to 1970s radio appearance where barrett performed new material this time he played songs from barrett baby lemonade dominoes and love song bored and directionless barrett headed back to his hometown of cambridge and but for a brief dalliance with a band called stars in 1972 and some abortive recording sessions in 1974 left his music career behind for good album was reissued in late 1974 with his first solo album
