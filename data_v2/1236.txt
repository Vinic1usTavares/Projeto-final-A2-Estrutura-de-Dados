kawasaki heavy industries c151 sometimes abbreviated to c151 or khi c151 is first generation electric multiple unit rolling stock in operation on north south and east west lines of singapore s mass rapid transit mrt system these are oldest trains built for system they were introduced in 1987 and are still in operation sixty six trainsets consisting of six cars each and a single money trainset consisting of four cars were purchased these trains are operated by smrt trains majority of trains are on east west line these trains were manufactured from 1986 to 1989 in batches by a japanese consortium consisting of kawasaki heavy industries nippon sharyo tokyu car corp and kinki sharyo following a round of intense competitive bidding by rolling stock manufacturers from around world no visible differences can be found in any of these batches which were built to agreed specifications trains underwent a two year mid life interior refurbishment programme by hyundai rotem after 2011 major train disruptions on 15 and 17 december 2011 further plans to upgrade its mechanical components to increase its reliability were made first trainset to receive this upgrade set 131 132 which included a replacement traction system to pmsm entered service in july 2015 only 6 trainsets have received replacement traction system to pmsm lta called a tender cr151 for replacement of all c151 trains starting from january 2016 on 25 july 2018 lta announced that bombardier will manufacture 66 cr151 trains which are set to arrive in batches from 2021 operational history tendering process with construction of mass rapid transit system underway in 1983 contract 151 called for procurement of rolling stock 150 cars in phase one and an option for 246 cars in phase two in what financial times described as a time when manufacturers were begging for orders for global rolling stock market competition for contract was intense at least eight companies from around world submitted bids for what they had nicknamed big one bidders included metro cammell with singapore automotive engineering kawasaki heavy industries with three japanese manufacturers man ag with aeg siemens and brown boveri cie with alsthom and singapore shipbuilding and engineering asea with sembawang shipyard and a bombardier transportation led consortium with hawker siddeley canada and brown boveri canada competition for contract was so fierce that it involved last minute discounts offers of free parts and allegations of sabotage metro cammell kawasaki and asea were shortlisted for final round metro cammell based its design on hong kong mtr m train emu and proposed to use gec propulsion system had they won contract metro cammell also delivered a concept mock up and was originally favourite to win contract however analysts became concerned that a measuring error involving london underground 1983 stock during evaluation period could jeopardise their bid in 1984 japanese consortium of kawasaki heavy industries with nippon sharyo tokyu car corp and kinki sharyo was awarded contract 151 at a cost of s 581 5 million for construction of 396 passenger cars kawasaki won contract its bid aided by favourable financing from mitsui and positive economic conditions in japan was 12 lower than those of other bidders award was largest single contract awarded in initial construction of system kawasaki also promised to supply 20 9m worth of complimentary spare parts after delivery loss of contract 151 was a massive financial blow to metro cammell who were forced to reduce their workforce by half later that year initial construction a mock up was manufactured in japan after kawasaki won contract it was shipped to singapore and put on public display during 1984 national exhibition held in november 1984 at world trade centre mock up featured three choices of seating arrangements and colour schemes members of public were invited to give feedback on these options finalised interior design of c151 trains consisted of a fully longitudinal seating arrangement bucket seats were made of plastic glass partitions separated seating areas from passenger doors strap lines for standing passengers were installed in middle of every car colour scheme of each adjacent car s interior is distinct to make car identification in cases of fault reporting easier for passengers originally colour scheme of driving trailer cars was orange that of second and fifth motor cars was blue and that of two centre motor cars was green there were nine seats between two doors this was reduced to seven after first round of refurbishment while rolling stock and mitsubishi electric propulsion equipment were constructed in japan many parts were sourced from europe trains were fitted with stone platt air conditioning duwag bogies sig gangways scharfenberg couplers and westinghouse brakes mitsubishi electric s propulsion equipment which was also used on tokyo metro 03 series and tokyo metro 05 series was estimated to consume 50 less electricity than hong kong s existing mtr m train emu its automatic train control atc signalling system was supplied by westinghouse capable of running at pre programmed speeds and activated by train driver while theoretically possible to design for a fully driverless operation using this signalling technology mrt corporation mrtc now smrt corporation decided against this option trainsets were assembled in kobe japan and then shipped to singapore by neptune orient lines first trainset was delivered to mrtc on 8 july 1986 at bishan depot officiated by yeo ning hong c151 was also basis for taipei metro built from 1992 to 1993 by kawasaki led union rail car partnership for taipei metro xinyi line between 1994 and 1996 original rail wheels of all 66 c151 trains were progressively replaced with german made rail wheels equipped with absorbers that vibrations on wheels in motion replacement were made at a cost of 5 4 million and were part of enhancement works in conjunction with commencement of woodlands extension first refurbishment thumb labels in a c151 train showing train car manufacturer kawasaki heavy industries refurbishment contractor hyundai rotem and car number on 3 september 2004 hyundai rotem mitsui rm transit technology and du received an order to refurbish all 396 carriages costing s 142 7 million in total works included refurbishment of interior fixtures addition of wheelchair spaces upgrading of onboard communications equipment enhancement of public announcement system and general improvement of cars appearance smrt corporation said reasons for refurbishment were wear and damage of important components over past two decades and water leaks from air conditioning system on some trains company chose this option instead of buying new rolling stock which would have cost s 792 million first refurbished train began revenue service on 5 november 2006 and all remaining trainsets had been refurbished by end of 2008 exteriors of refurbished trains resemble those of c751b and c151a rolling stock interior fittings were replaced with white walls and new seats and installed further back to allow more standing space colour of seats in driving trailer was changed from orange to red seats of refurbished cars were lengthened from to four of seven seats per row were designated as priority seats and were differentiated using a darker colour mitsubishi electric propulsion system was retained having performed better than expected wheelchair space was made available on end of two mid train cars nearest to lifts in above ground stations led lights that blink to warn passengers of closing doors were introduced in upper middle section of door additional loudspeakers and advertisement panels were also introduced hand grips were moved to support bars of seats on ceiling and were located near doors and at both ends of each carriage air conditioning system was modified to match system used in c751b cars with air conditioning vents and in flow fans installed in november 2008 smrt corporation and land transport authority lta announced that last ten refurbished trainsets would have one third of their seats replaced with metal rails to create extra standing space move was justified on grounds of allowing more standing space onboard during peak hour services reduction of seats per row from nine to seven after refurbishment was already unpopular among commuters decision to further reduce seating capacity drew sharp criticism against operator and lta as of december 2015 all 66 from one third of their seats have been replaced by metal bars to create extra standing space second proposed refurbishment and replacement following major train disruptions on 15 and 17 december 2011 committee of inquiry coi found that despite first refurbishment of c151 rolling stock there does not appear to be any upgrade in terms of engineering components report of committee of inquiry into disruption of mrt train services on 15 and 17 december 2011 ministry of transport pp 313 319 coi was particularly critical of inadequate and ageing emergency battery installed on c151 and recommended installation of a train integrated management system tims found on c751b and c151a trains in response smrt announced it was replacing important engineering components on all c151 trains by 2019 this included changing existing mitsubishi electric propulsion system for newer insulated gate bipolar transistor igbt and permanent magnet synchronous motor pmsm propulsion system by toshiba technology currently used in tokyo metro s 1000 series and 16000 series trains as well as jr kyushu 305 series and hankyu 1000 series trains in july 2015 train sets 055 056 and 131 132 are trialed with new propulsion system on changi airport extension trial was successful and by 2017 trainsets 025 026 055 056 065 066 095 096 109 110 and 131 132 had new propulsion system in tandem with replacement of signalling system on east west line and north south line with newer thales seltrac signalling system new equipment are installed in passenger compartment of trailer cars in october 2016 lta had announced to replace all trains with new cr151 trains a decision was made since beginning of 2016 to replace all of them on 13 april 2017 lta released a tender for contract cr151 which will be replacement train for current first generation c151 trainsets for time being lta will work with smrt to improve reliability of 66 first generation trains with four more trains changed pmsm motors on 25 july 2018 contract cr151 was awarded to bombardier transportation at a sum of 1 2 billion inclusive of a long term service support package for up to 30 years 66 cr151 trains will subsequently replace all 66 c151 trains from 2021 onwards 66 c151 trains will then be scrapped thereafter operational details money train kawasaki built a four car unit to serve as a money train since 2003 this train was decommissioned with change to stored value cards and in 2006 this train was being taken out from revenue service both set 301 and 302 are used by singapore armed forces saf for training purposes located near reservoir passenger announcement and information systems these trains originally had no visual passenger information systems station announcements had to be made by train operator an automatic audio announcement system using voice synthesizers was installed on each train by september 1994 first iteration of door closing buzzer announcements which replaced initial door chimes was fully introduced by april 1997 smrt first attempted to install a passenger information system on trains using lcd displays in 1999 these have since been removed in november 2006 doors of three cars carriage number 3006 1006 and 2006 were installed with a dynamic in train system displaying station information for testing these are similar to ones used by hong kong s mtr an initial prototype of staris based upon existing automatic transit info system was developed in house this was removed before end of year without entering service two years later four units of vacuum fluorescent displays vfd were mounted on ceiling and eight units of dynamic route maps were mounted above every door in each car of trainset 053 054 for a two month trial this new smrt active route map information system staris was then progressively introduced to all c151 trainsets and subsequently to and c751b trains for a cost of s 12 million s 20 000 per car it became standard equipment on all new rolling stocks subsequently introduced on east west line and north south line livery and numbering thumb right captain smrt demonstrating use of a refurbished c151 s emergency ramp cars had an aluminium alloy double skinned construction and were delivered unpainted to save time a red adhesive strip ran through length of cars in middle to match operator s visual branding unpainted cars had a shiny appearance upon delivery but as dirt and grime accumulated it became a recurring problem for operator and attracted several public complaints in response mrt corporation built a wash machine at bishan depot in an attempt to clean up cars exterior proper after refurbishment problem was solved by covering cars exterior entirely with giant stickers creating a livery that is similar to newer c751b and c151a rolling stocks train formation a complete six car trainset consists of an identical twin set of one driving trailer dt and two motor cars m1 and m2 permanently coupled together report

been involved in four high profile incidents clementi rail accident on 5 august 1993 two c151 trains collided at clementi station because of a oil spillage on track by a maintenance locomotive resulting in 132 injuries on 17 may 2010 oliver fricker trespassed and vandalised car 1048 trainset 047 048 with graffiti at changi depot graffiti was initially mistaken for an advertisement and was not spotted until car was filmed and video was uploaded to youtube by a railway enthusiast fricker was convicted and sentenced to seven months imprisonment and caning public perceived this incident to have serious security implications as depot was considered a sensitive installation in a major mrt disruption on 15 december 2011 one c151 train trainset 067 068 t139 in coi was stalled in tunnel and its backup battery failed report of committee of inquiry into disruption of mrt train services on 15 and 17 december 2011 ministry of transport pp 61 62 passenger compartments in t139 experienced a blackout and loss of ventilation leading to one passenger smashing a train door window to avoid suffocation battery failure led to criticism by coi on condition of aging emergency batteries installed on all c151 trains smrt has since proposed an upgrading plan to address this issue pasir ris rail accident on 22 march 2016 2 smrt maintenance trainees were run over and killed by an oncoming c151 train trainset 073 074 reportedly travelling at 60 km h 150 metres from pasir ris station at approximately 11 10 am maintenance staff were a group of 15 personnel tasked to investigate a possible signalling system fault on tracks near pasir ris mrt station this incident had led to a 2 5 hour train service disruption and at least 10 000 commuters were affected other incidents on 25 may 2012 a c151 train s glass window panel was reported to had shattered on its own at admiralty station causing no injuries or death this is unrelated to similar issue as well as other defects found on c151a
