messers run is a tributary of catawissa creek in schuylkill county pennsylvania in united states it is approximately long and flows through kline township and east union township only named tributary of stream is negro hollow but it has two unnamed tributaries creek has some alkalinity but is slightly acidic main rock formations in watershed of it are mauch chunk formation and pottsville formation main soils in watershed are leck kill soil and hazleton soil watershed of messers run has an area of there are two reservoirs on stream it is difficult to access stream as most of it is several hundred meters from any road creek is a high quality coldwater fishery and class a wild trout waters in some places there are many species of fish inhabiting creek including brook brown trout and others creek has been surveyed by pennsylvania fish and boat commission course messers run is approximately long it begins near interstate 81 on a mountain known as spring mountain in kline township it flows southwest for several tenths of a mile before entering a valley and turning west southwest after approximately a mile stream passes through lofty reservoir it exits lofty reservoir via reservoir s southwestern edge and continues west and slightly south after more than a mile it turns west and slightly north receiving an unnamed tributary several tenths of a mile downstream stream then continues west receiving another unnamed tributary after several tenths of a mile a few tenths of a mile later it exits kline township and enters east union township in east union township stream turns northwest and receives tributary negro hollow it then turns northeast for a few hundred feet and passes near blue head reservoir stream then turns northwest and flows for slightly less than a mile until it reaches its confluence with catawissa creek messers run joins catawissa creek upstream of its mouth tributaries messers run has three tributaries only one of which is named named tributary is known as negro hollow and it flows through delano township kline township and east union township unnamed tributaries are known as trib to messers run and trib 27609 to messers run former is entirely in kline township while latter flows through delano township and kline township hydrology messers run is infertile and acidic upstream of lofty reservoir stream has potential to be affected by acid precipitation in this part of it stream also has these attributes from lofty reservoir downstream to blue head reservoir and from blue head reservoir downstream to mouth ph of messers run upstream of lofty reservoir is 6 3 total concentration of alkalinity in this part of stream is 3 milligrams per liter these values are similar to those measured in a similar area during a 1990 survey of stream concentration of water hardness in this part of stream is 47 milligrams per liter a 1997 report noted that this value was very high considering concentration of alkalinity ph of messers run between lofty reservoir and blue head reservoir is 6 6 concentration of alkalinity in this portion of stream is 4 milligrams per liter and total water hardness is 18 milligrams per liter ph of stream below blue head reservoir is 6 6 concentration of alkalinity in this part of stream is 5 milligrams per liter and water hardness is 13 milligrams per liter air temperature in vicinity of messers run upstream of its mouth was measured to be at 3 40 p m on july 23 1997 water temperature at that time and location was air temperature near stream upstream of its mouth was measured to be at 2 55 p m on july 22 1997 and water temperature was measured to be air temperature in vicinity of stream was measured to be at 4 20 p m on july 23 1997 at a point upstream of its mouth water temperature at this time and location was measured to be specific conductivity of waters of messers run upstream of its mouth is 223 micromhos specific conductivity of stream s waters upstream of its mouth is 71 micromhos and specific conductivity upstream of its mouth is 45 micromhos geography and geology thumb left messers run s watershed includes pottsville formation rocks example from worlds end state park in sullivan county pennsylvania pictured elevation near mouth of messers run is above sea level elevation of stream s source is just under above sea level most of watershed of messers run is on rock of mauch chunk formation this rock formation consists of siltstone sandstone grayish red shale and conglomerate however areas that are on pottsville formation are scattered throughout watershed mainly along its southern and northern edges this rock formation is especially common in sub watershed of negro hollow and near upper reaches of trib 27609 to messers run pottsville formation contains claystone limestone conglomerate shale and gray sandstone main soils in watershed of messers run are leck kill soil and hazleton soil leck kill soil occurs in northwestern part of watershed in its lower reaches hazleton soil is found throughout rest of watershed messers run is flanked by areas prone to flooding during a 100 year flood from mouth of negro hollow upstream to its headwaters negro hollow and its unnamed tributaries are also surrounded by areas prone to flooding during a 100 year flood for much of their length both of unnamed tributaries of messers run are surrounded by such areas for majority of their length messers run has a width of upstream of lofty reservoir gradient of stream at this location is its width between lofty reservoir and blue head reservoir is gradient of stream at this location is its width below blue head reservoir is gradient of stream at this location is a mountain known as spring mountain is at headwaters of messers run a mountain known as locust mountain is also found in watershed watershed and history watershed of messers run has an area of stream passes through united states geological survey quadrangles of conyngham and delano much of watershed is in kline township however significant areas in western part of watershed are in east union township delano township and mahanoy township interstate 81 passes through watershed in its easternmost part a reservoir known as lofty reservoir is situated on messers run it is owned by pennsylvania game commission and is used as a supply of drinking water additionally blue head reservoir is in watershed there is some agricultural land in lower reaches of watershed of messers run a large part of watershed is on land that is part of a nature conservancy priority forest hub stream flows through pennsylvania state game lands number 308 for most of its length there are of forested land in pennsylvania state game lands number 308 watershed of stream is almost entirely on forested land between lofty reservoir and blue head reservoir messers run is mostly accessible by state game lands roads which are only open seasonally it is also difficult to access stream upstream of lofty reservoir or downstream of blue head reservoir no part of messers run upstream of lofty reservoir is within of a road 18 percent of stream s length between lofty reservoir and blue head reservoir is within of a road 95 percent is within of a road and 100 percent is within of one 16 percent of its length between blue head reservoir and mouth is within of a road 23 percent is within of a road and 31 percent is within of one in 1990 population density of watershed of messers run upstream of lofty reservoir was 140 people per square mile 54 people per square kilometer population density of watershed between lofty and blue head reservoirs was 80 people per square mile 31 people per square kilometer population density of watershed downstream of blue head reservoir was 52 people per square mile 20 people per square kilometer mahanoy water company sought permission to construct a dam on messers run as early as 1913 stream was used as a water supply as early as early 1900s messers run was surveyed once by environmental services branch of pennsylvania fish and boat commission this survey was carried out by young in november 1990 biology thumb messers run is inhabited by brook trout illustration from john treadwell nichols fishes of vicinity of new york city pictured messers run is considered by pennsylvania department of environmental protection to be a high quality coldwater fishery as is its tributary negro hollow both messers run from lofty reservoir downstream to blue head reservoir and negro hollow between its headwaters and its mouth are also considered by pennsylvania fish and boat commission to be class a wild trout waters a 1997 report advised against stocking messers run seven species of fish inhabit messers run these include a highly substantial population of brook trout upstream of lofty reservoir there are two species of fish inhabiting stream brook trout eastern blacknose dace 1990 survey observed these two species as well as white suckers and pumpkinseeds three species of fish inhabit stream between lofty reservoir and blue head reservoir these species are brook trout brown trout and blacknose dace six species of fish inhabit stream below blue head reservoir brook trout blacknose dace tessellated darters brown trout white suckers and sculpins however only first three species were observed during 1990 survey of
