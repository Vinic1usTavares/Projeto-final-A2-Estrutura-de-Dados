minute and as such she argued that her emotionally exhausted state informed her songwriting song was inspired by an incident that sugar had experienced with a former roommate although two often fought sugar desperately wanted them to be friends despite not particularly liking her sugar transferred this situation onto marceline writing song so that marceline while having issues with princess bubblegum wanted to become her friend my best friends in world was written by sugar as a celebration of friendship she shared with her coworkers especially her storyboarding partner muto ward later

alluded to perhaps more than platonic feelings between princess bubblegum and marceline as well as fact that what was missing was underlined by potential lesbian subtext a v club named episode one of ten additional installments of series that illustrates that emotional complexity lies beneath adventure times weirdness controversy what was missing became controversial because of an allegedly implied past relationship between marceline and princess bubblegum controversy largely began after an accompanying mathematical recap a behind scenes video series produced by frederator studios that
