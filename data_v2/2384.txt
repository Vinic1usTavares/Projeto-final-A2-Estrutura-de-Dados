potential connections between gefjon and grendel s mother and or goddesses freyja and frigg etymology etymology of theonym gefjon and its variant gefjun has been a matter of dispute in modern

spake why ye gods twain with bitter tongues raise hate among us here loki is famed for his mockery foul and dwellers in heaven he hates bellows 1923 158 last two lines of stanza above differ greatly by translation henry adams bellows comments that manuscript text for these two lines is puzzling and that as a result they have been freely amended in stanza that follows loki responds to gefjon commenting that a youthful male once gave her a necklace and that with this youth gefjon slept loki be silent gefion i will now just mention how that fair youth thy mind corrupted who thee a necklace gave and around whom thou thy limbs didst twine loki spake be silent gefjun for now shall i say who led thee to evil life boy so fair gave a necklace bright and about him thy leg was laid odin interjects stating that loki must be quite insane to incur wrath of gefjon for she knows destinies of mankind just as well as odin himself thou art raving mad loki and hast lost thy wits in calling gefion s anger on thee for all men s destinies i ween she knows as thoroughly as i do mad art thou loki and little of wit wrath of gefjun to rouse for fate that is set for all she sees even as i methinks bellows 1923 159 prose edda thumb gefjun plows zealand with her oxen 1882 by karl ehrenberg prose edda book gylfaginning begins with a prose account stating that king gylfi was once ruler of what is now called sweden and that he was said to have given a certain vagrant woman as reward for his entertainment one plough land in his kingdom as much as four oxen could plow up in a day and night this woman was of race of aesir and her name was gefjun gefjun took four oxen from jotunheimr in north these oxen were her sons from a jotunn name not provided gefjun s plough cut so hard and deep that it uprooted land and oxen drew land out into sea to west and halted in a certain sound gefjun there placed land and bestowed upon it name zealand where land had been taken from a lake stands

theories ploughing folk customs parallels and fertility thumb gefjon ploughs earth in sweden by lorenz frolich a reoccurring theme in legend and folktale consists of a man or more often a woman who is challenged to gain as much land as can be traveled within a limited amount of time this motif is attested by livy around 1 ce 5th century bce greek historian herodotus and in folktales from northern europe in six tales from jutland denmark and one from germany a plough is used similarly as in livy s account though conditions are often met by walking or riding davidson 1990 52 53 hilda ellis davidson points out a tale from iceland that features a female settler whose husband had died on voyage out establishing her claim to a piece of land by driving a young round it davidson notes that in landnamabok this is recorded as a recognized method for a woman to claim land and work further details that she might not possess more than she could encircle in this way between sunrise and sunset on a spring day davidson comments that this sounds like a ritual taking over of land rather than a legal requirement like custom of men lighting fires when taking new land and it is possible that women s custom was linked with fertility goddess davidson 1999 53 in addition davidson notes that zealand is most fertile region of denmark davidson further links folk customs recorded in 19th century involving ploughs in northern and eastern europe to practices involving gefjon from heathen period davidson points out that in eastern europe a custom is recorded in russia where women with loosened hair and clad in white would assemble and drag a plough three times around their village during serious disease outbreaks in western europe yearly ploughing rituals occurring in england and denmark in preparation for spring sowing which are in eastern england held on plough monday after christmas break gangs of young men dragged round a plough while taking various names davidson states that gefjon with her giant sons transformed into oxen seems a fitting patroness of ceremonies of this kind davidson 1999 56 davidson finds similar elements and parallels in non germanic traditions such as a folktale regarding lady of lake from wales recorded in 19th century in tale lady brings forth a herd of wondrous cattle from water after she consents to marrying a local farmer years later he unwittingly breaks conditions that she had laid down as a result lady returns to her dwelling beneath lake and calls for her cattle to accompany her calling them by name in one version of tale lady calls forth four gray oxen who were ploughing in a field six miles away responding to her call oxen dragged plough with them and gash in land that plough produced was said to have once been clearly visible a woman was recorded in 1881 as having claimed to recall that people once gathered at lake on first sunday of august waiting to see whether or not water would boil up as an indication that lady and her oxen would make an appearance davidson notes that here again a supernatural woman is linked both with water and ploughing land davidson 1999 56 57 davidson states that in germanic areas of europe traditions also exist of supernatural women who travel about countryside with a plough examples including holde and holle from western and central regions of germany and and in traditions from upper germany switzerland and austria davidson explains that they were frequently said to travel with a plough around countryside in a way reminiscent of journey of fertility goddess to bless land in pre christian times and on these occasions they might be accompanied by a host of tiny children it was suggested that these children who died unbaptized or human offspring replaced by changelings but another possibility is that they were souls of unborn davidson details that some local tales feature plough breaking down supernatural woman gaining assistance from a helper and supernatural woman giving him wooden chips only for chips to later to turn to gold davidson 1999 57 regarding plough and gefjon davidson concludes that idea behind taking of plough round countryside seems to be that it brought good fortune and prosperity gifts of a benevolent goddess gefjon and her plough thus fit into a large framework of cult of a goddess associated with fertility of both land and water possible gylfaginning manuscript alteration questions have been proposed over seemingly contradictory description of gefjon as a virgin in gylfaginning yet also as attested as having sexual relations lokasenna heimskringla and marrying heimskringla john lindow says that gefjon gylfi story in gylfaginning is absent in one branch of manuscripts of work and that fact that gylfi is reintroduced directly after it in other manuscripts suggests that that it was not part of snorri s author of prose edda and heimskringla original text but may have been added by a later scribe lindow says that if snorri did not write it possibility exists that whoever added story either was aware of an association made between gefjon and greek goddess diana as in glosses section above or took view of pagan gods as demons and therefore made a whore out of gefjon however lindow adds that reference to gefjon made by loki in lokasenna suggest that notion of gefjon partaking in sexual activity may have been widespread beowulf thumb first page of beowulf manuscript mentions of gefjon may appear in beowulf in five passages line 49 line 362 line 515 line 1394 and line 1690 scholar frank battaglia refers to these passages as gefion passages and asks does beowulf oppose earth goddess of ancient germanic religion possibility of such an interpretation follows upon discovery that name gefion by which early danes called their female chthonic deity may occur in old english poem five times battaglia 1991 415 battaglia further theorizes that five gefion passages seem to highlight championing of a new order antagonistic to goddess worship in light of what appears to be an elaborate thematic statement about in poem new order may also have entailed a change in kinship systems grendel and his mother may stand as types of earlier matrilineal tribes further hall which is object of struggle between beowulf and first two monsters may symbolize consolidation of new hierarchical social organization among northern germanic peoples battaglia says that if passages are taken to represent gefjon geafon mentioned in line 49 refers directly to gefjon s sadness at skjoldr s described as having wed gefjon in heimskringla death and that here we may with some confidence conclude that in a poem about scyld s funeral for an anglo danish audience word geafon could probably not have been used without invoking gefion battaglia 1991 418 battaglia posits translations for line 362 as gefion s realm line 515 geofon weol as gefion welled up in waves line 1394 ne on grund ga he wille as not even in ground of gefion go where he will and line 1690 gigante as gefion gushing race of giants battaglia 1991 426 428 432 and 437 scholar richard north theorizes that old english geofon and old norse gefjun and freyja s name gefn may all descend from a common origin a germanic goddess connected with sea whose name means giving north 1998 226 frigg and freyja some scholars have proposed a connection between gefjun and goddesses frigg and freyja due to perceived similarities britt mari nasstrom theorizes that gefjun is simply another aspect of freyja and that white youth that freyja is accused of sleeping with by loki in gylfaginning may be god heimdallr nasstrom 1999 71 hilda ellis davidson says that there seems ample indication that gefjon represents one aspect of a once powerful goddess of north figure representing in scandinavian myths as either frigg wife of odin or freyja sister of fertility god freyr freyja desired by gods giants and dwarves alike acted as dispenser of bounty and inspirer of sexual love between men and women like greek aphrodite davidson 1999 58 in addition davidson says that as axel 1901 pointed out long ago we know very little about gefion and it is possible that she can be identified with frigg or freyja and not only does prose edda associate her with an afterlife realm of dead in lokasenna loki claims that gefion was given a jewel by a lover traditions that would fit in very well with what we know of freyja davidson 1998 65 regarding parallels drawn between freyja and gefjon proposed from exchange found in lokasenna rudolf simek says that lokasenna is a late composition and reproach is too much of a stereotype to carry much weight simek says that regardless even if gefjon shouldn t be identified with freyja gefjon could still be considered one of fertility and protective goddesses because of meaning of her name giving one modern influence thumb gefion fountain 1908 by anders bundgaard gefjon appears prominently as allegorical
