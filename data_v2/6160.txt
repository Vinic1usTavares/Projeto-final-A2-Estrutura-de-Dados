ultimania however explains that g genesis has returned from his three year slumber to protect planet development when final fantasy vii advent children began development square enix staff agreed that one title from compilation of final fantasy vii was not enough to cover entire world and so before crisis final fantasy vii dirge of cerberus and crisis core final fantasy vii were conceived so as to embrace more aspects with no official word from square on genre of game many publications and gamers speculated that it would be an action game similar to devil may cry series in 2004 however character designer tetsuya nomura denied this and stated that genre would surprise gamers producer yoshinori kitase decided title to be a shooting game based on his love for first person shooters and challenge provided for developers that would eventually improve their skills he said that role playing elements were added as design work on pure action games was less appealing to developers vincent was chosen as game s protagonist due to scope for expanding his backstory which was left very vague in final fantasy vii fact that his main weapon was a gun also worked into team s desire to create a more action oriented game prior to solidification of compilation of final fantasy vii development team originally considered using other gunfighter characters from final fantasy series such as final fantasy viis barret wallace final fantasy viiis irvine kinneas or final fantasy x 2s yuna however after release of before crisis and advent children and with expansion of final fantasy vii mythos they settled on vincent main character designer for game tetsuya nomura had also worked on both final fantasy vii and final fantasy vii advent children tsviets were designed with idea of creating a sense of balance for warriors with which players would already be familiar primarily vincent cloud strife and sephiroth nomura initially had doubts when designing shelke s ordinary clothes for end of game but he felt it was important for her to appear out of uniform so as to indicate she was truly free from deepground character of g was based on japanese singer and actor gackt who wrote and performed two theme songs of game and voiced g in japanese language version of game hideki imaizumi producer of crisis core liked mysterious role of g so much he decided to expand his character in that game character of lucrecia crescent who features briefly in an optional quest in original game was redesigned so as to give her a similar appearance to her son sephiroth based on portraits from guidebooks and in fan art reeve tuesti was also redesigned as he only appears briefly in original game as himself rather than through cait sith dirge of cerberus was first announced in september 2004 and was scheduled for release in japan in 2005 game s official site went online in april 2005 in may nomura stated that several snippets from game would be revealed during that year s e3 however no demo was
