treaty of gallipoli concluded in january or early february 1403 was a peace treaty between suleyman celebi ruler of ottoman territories in balkans and main christian regional powers byzantine empire republic of venice republic of genoa knights hospitaller and duchy of naxos concluded in aftermath of battle of ankara while suleyman tried to strengthen his own position in succession struggle with his brothers treaty brought major concessions to christian states especially byzantines who regained lost territories and achieved a position of nominal superiority over ottoman ruler its provisions were honoured by suleyman as well as by mehmed i victor of ottoman succession struggle but collapsed after mehmed s death in 1421 background on 26 july 1402 in battle of ankara ottoman sultan bayezid i was defeated and captured by turco mongol warlord timur this momentous event overturned balance of power in region as ottoman domains in anatolia were divided by timur who restored many of independent turkish beyliks previously absorbed by bayezid timur did not interfere with balkans where ottoman conquest was also far advanced before ankara constantinople almost last remnant of byzantine empire was cut off and on verge of falling to bayezid as in anatolia sudden collapse of ottoman power left a power vacuum in which various christian powers of region byzantines hungarians republic of venice and a number of minor rulers each tried to secure their interests as best possible while being too weak to actually challenge ottoman power suleyman celebi eldest son of bayezid escaped disaster at ankara and arrived at gallipoli on 20 august while his other brothers were left in anatolia to deal with timur and try to salvage what domains they could suleyman claimed control over ottoman territories in balkans rumelia his position there was insecure however and his first priority was to contact christian powers of region and arrange a truce with them especially in view of necessity to one day return to anatolia and contend with his brothers and other rivals cf ottoman interregnum already on 22 september venetian senate was discussing matter and hoped to gain control over gallipoli venetians also contacted byzantine emperor manuel ii palaiologos who at time was in paris on a grand journey seeking help in west urging him to return home since manuel s nephew and regent john vii palaiologos was known to sympathize with venice s maritime and commercial rivals republic of genoa negotiations soon began and suleyman sent envoys both to venice and manuel offering significant concessions manuel however would not return to constantinople until 9 june 1403 and an agreement was reached during his absence after negotiations lasting three and a half months venetians who among other concerns wanted to use ottoman influence to settle their rivalry with florentine antonio i acciaioli who had captured athens sent their most experienced diplomat lord of andros pietro zeno as their negotiator along with marco grimani while genoa named jean de as its envoy to eastern potentates provisions thumb right 300px map of southern balkans and western anatolia in 1410 during latter phases of ottoman interregnum territories of ottoman empire in balkans largely correspond to provisions of treaty of gallipoli judging from fact that on 20 february scribes from pera were being paid for their work in drafting treaty agreement was concluded in january or early february 1403 a single copy of it survives a poor venetian translation of turkish original pietro zeno also left an account of negotiations with ottomans where he states that treaty was signed at gallipoli provisions of treaty were as follows sultan suleyman concluded true peace with great emperor of greeks john vii palaiologos my father as well as with great communes of rhodes knights hospitaller venice genoa with isle of chios and duke of naxos and with all lands and islands that are theirs and their possessions in aegean sea and black sea to byzantine emperor sultan suleyman ceded thessalonica and with all their related territory coast from up to river as well as all land from panidos on marmara sea up to mesembria on black sea and region of with all its fortresses byzantines were no longer required to pay tribute and were free to erect fortresses as they pleased contemporary byzantine historian doukas gives a slightly different account recording that suleyman handed over regions of strymon as far as zetounion peloponnese and lands surrounding constantinople from panidos to hieron stomion i e bosporus and all coastal fortresses situated along black sea from hieron stomion to varna these passages have been interpreted as implying that suleyman ceded control of all coastal territories from strymon river down to zetounion modern lamia i e larger part of coastal macedonia including chalcidice and coast of thessaly down to gulf it is impossible to say with certainty how far inland that control extended suleyman further ceded all castles that emperor had possessed in turkey return of some fortresses on coasts of anatolia is confirmed by byzantine historian but no details are known from byzantine sources identity of at least some of these castles is provided by ottoman historian who reports that sultan mehmed i recovered forts of old and kartal on northern shore of gulf of nicomedia which had been in byzantine hands until then however s phrasing also suggests that these fortresses remained contested with byzantines thereafter and not until reign of mehmed ii were they definitely conquered by ottomans if timur should attack constantinople suleyman undertook to help defend it with his galleys and sailors suleyman also returned islands of northern skopelos skiathos and skyros their tribute was likewise annulled all citizens of constantinople i e of byzantine emperor were allowed to return to their homes without any impositions all cases of litigation from time of suleyman s father and grandfather were dropped except for cases of debts between individuals serbian ruler stefan lazarevic was to be allowed to retain his lands on condition that he accepted same obligations owed to bayezid i e pay tribute and provide military assistance all frankish venetian genoese rhodian and greek merchants were free to trade in any territory possessed by suleyman then or in future and would be obliged to pay in duties what was usual before if a merchant commits a crime no other merchants should be punished other than perpetrator if a shipwreck should occur in suleyman s territory both goods and passengers would be returned all ports under suleyman s control would be open to christian merchants who would be allowed to export grain without restrictions tax on each bushel of grain of weight used in constantinople was set at one hyperpyron suleyman s ships would not be allowed to leave dardanelles without permission from byzantine emperor and christian league all byzantine prisoners held by suleyman or any of his subordinate lords were to be released all genoese prisoners held by suleyman or any of his subordinate lords were to be released if a genoese slave were to escape to ottoman territory he would be returned any muslim held by genoese after timur s attack would be released twenty five prisoners from chios a genoese colony held by ottomans were to be released genoese colonies in black sea were relieved of tribute to ottomans tribute of 500 ducats paid until then by chios to ottoman governor at alto luogo would cease all territories forts dwellings and anything else taken from venetians was to be restored to them and athens to return to their rule latter provision was never actually enforced and antonio i acciaioli retained control of athens venetians received a strip of land five miles wide on greek mainland opposite whole length of island of euboea a venetian possession but ottomans were to retain salt flats and ports in area venetians also undertook to punish anyone taking grain from ottoman territory without paying customs duties suleyman agreed not to increase tribute levied on marquisate of bodonitsa from what it was under bayezid although marquis had conspired against ottomans in thessaly slaves from both sides seeking to escape in territory of other would be returned tribute of 200 ducats paid until then by naxos would cease suleyman would return 500 venetian prisoners provided venetians released all ottoman prisoners they held tribute of 500 ducats paid until then by new phocaea a genoese colony would cease transfer of county of salona to knights hospitaller by despot of morea theodore i palaiologos was ratified significance and aftermath treaty or another treaty with similar provisions was ratified anew once emperor manuel ii returned from west later in year treaty was very unpopular with ottomans due to its concessions but need to keep his rear secure while engaged in civil war of ottoman interregnum with his brothers forced suleyman to adhere to it until his own overthrow in 1411 nevertheless opposition of powerful ottoman frontier warlords uch bey such as evrenos beg may have resulted in at least one major omission from treaty gallipoli itself remained in ottoman hands thereby averting extremely disadvantageous position that had resulted from its temporary loss to savoyard crusade in 1366 when ottoman domains in anatolia and europe had been effectively sundered apart historian necipoglu highlights reference to byzantine emperor as father by suleyman throughout treaty indicating remarkable reversal of positions brought about by battle of ankara from tributary ottoman vassals teetering at verge of extinction after ankara byzantines gained a certain advantage over ottomans and managed to retain it for several years through adroit use of diplomacy and switching support between rival ottoman princes in 1411 suleyman was overthrown and killed by his brother musa who proceeded to capture most of territories ceded to byzantines in macedonia thessaly and thrace however after musa was defeated by mehmed i in 1413 bringing an end to ottoman civil war new sultan confirmed anew provisions of treaty of gallipoli and his position as obedient son of emperor manuel and upheld them until his death in 1421 following rise of murad ii to throne and ascendancy of manuel s hawkish son john viii palaiologos friendly byzantine ottoman relations ended murad launched a brief siege of constantinople in 1422 and began a long blockade of thessalonica which forced byzantines to hand it over to venice in 1423 in a peace treaty concluded in february 1424 byzantines lost again most of territories gained at gallipoli and were once more reduced to status of tributary vassals on venetian side following suleyman s preoccupation with affairs in anatolia from 1406 on relations worsened as local frontier warlords were left free to act while venice too became entangled in a war of expansion against local christian ruler balsa iii an ottoman vassal in western balkans venice sent repeated embassies to suleyman in 1406 1409 to little avail during this period venetians negotiated directly with pasha bey ruler of skopje as well as with suleyman nevertheless venetian ambassador francesco managed to conclude a treaty with suleyman in 1409 and following latter s downfall a similar treaty treaty of selymbria was concluded with musa in september 1411 references sources category 1403 in europe gallipoli 1403 gallipoli 1403 gallipoli
