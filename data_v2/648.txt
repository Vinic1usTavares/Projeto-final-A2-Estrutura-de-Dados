strobilurus tenacellus commonly known as pinecone cap is a species of agaric fungus in family physalacriaceae it is found in asia and europe where it grows on fallen cones of pine and spruce trees fruit bodies mushrooms are small with convex to flat reddish to brownish caps up to in diameter set atop thin cylindrical stems up to long with a rooting base a characteristic microscopic feature of mushroom is sharp thin walled cystidia found on stipe gills and cap mushrooms sometimes described as edible are too small to be of culinary interest fungus releases compounds called strobilurins that suppress growth and development of other fungi derivatives of these compounds are used as an important class of agricultural fungicides taxonomy species was first described as agaricus tenacellus by christian hendrik persoon in his 1796 observationes in its taxonomic history it has been moved to genera collybia by paul kummer in 1803 marasmius by jules favre in 1939 and by georges metrod in 1952 rolf singer transferred it to newly circumscribed genus strobilurus in 1962 giving it name by which it is currently known specific epithet tenacellus is a diminutive form of latin word tenax meaning tough its british mycological society recommended common name is pinecone cap english botanist james edward smith called it dark fir cone agaric in his 1836 work english flora description thumb left gills are notched and interspersed with several tiers of lamellulae cap is initially convex before flattening out sometimes retaining a small central papilla and sometimes developing a central depression cap diameter reaches smooth cap is hygrophanous i e it changes colour as it loses or absorbs moisture and has shallow radial grooves extending about halfway up cap its colour is reddish to brownish and is often paler in center than margin when dry colour fades to greyish greyish white gills have a free to deeply emarginate notched attachment to cap they are somewhat crowded together numbering 20 25 gills with 1 to 7 tiers of interspersed lamellulae short gills that do not extend fully from cap margin to stipe cylindrical stipe measures long by 0 5 2 mm thick and has at its base a root like pseudorrhiza that extends into substrate upper stipe is yellowish brown while lower it is dark orange brown to reddish brown flesh has no odour and usually has a bitter taste while fruit bodies are sometimes described as are edible they are too small to be of culinary interest spore print is white spores are roughly elliptical to tear shaped with dimensions of 5 0 7 5 by 2 4 4 0 mm basidia spore bearing cells are four spored and measure 20 40 by 7 11 mm cheilocystidia cystidia on gill edge are thin walled plentiful spindle shaped to somewhat flask shaped with a sharp tip and measure 30 70 by 3 10 mm pleurocystidia on gill face are similar in shape and size to cheilocystidia although usually not quite as numerous cap cuticle is made of a hymeniderm of club shaped to somewhat spherical cells measuring 8 25 by 7 20 mm mixed with flask shaped pileocystidia cystidia on cap that are 20 45 by 5 11 mm hyphae lack clamp connections similar species strobilurus esculentus and s stephanocystis are similar in appearance to s tenacellus s esculentus mushrooms have thin sharp cap margins and only fruit on fallen spruce cones s stephanocystis has a yellow brown to reddish yellow cap that is not hygrophanous baeospora myosura is another small agaric that grows on pine and spruce cones but it fruits in autumn habitat and distribution strobilurus tenacellus is a saprobic wood rotting fungus it fruits singly or in small groups on fallen and often partially buried cones of scots pine pinus sylvestris european black pine pinus nigra and sometimes spruce picea in coniferous and mixed forests it is found in europe and asia where it has been recorded in japan and jordan in europe fungus usually fruits from march to june its occurrence is occasional bioactive compounds thumb azoxystrobin is a commercial fungicide developed from this mushroom two cyathane like diterpenoids 12s 11a 14a epoxy 13a 14b 15 trihydroxycyath 3 ene and 12r 11a 14a epoxy 13a 14b 15 trihydroxycyath 3 ene have been isolated and identified from liquid culture of fungus these compounds inhibit growth of certain tumor cells when grown in vitro using a standard laboratory method to determine antimicrobial susceptibility methanol based extracts of strobilurus tenacellus fruit bodies were shown in a 2000 study to have low antibacterial activity against bacterium bacillus and low to moderate activity against fungi candida albicans and aspergillus fumigatus fungus produces natural antibiotic strobilurin a which was reported as a novel compound from this species in 1977 other strobilurins have since been found in other basidiomycete wood rotting fungi like porcelain mushroom for example strobilurin a is thought to be derived biosynthetically from amino acid l phenylalanine in nature fungus secretes chemical to prevent invasion by other fungi that challenge its nutrient source it works by blocking electron transfer in mitochondria stopping respiration by binding to ubihydroquinone oxidation center of bc1 complex this prevents competing fungus from creating its own energy and inhibiting its growth at earliest stages of life cycle spore germination stage fungus is resistant to its own chemical because its ubihydroquinone has three amino acid residues that prevent strobilurins from binding because of their sensitivity to light and high vapor pressures that causes them to rapidly disappear when applied to surface of a leaf chemically unmodified strobilurins are not generally useful as fungicides for agricultural use strobilurin derived compound azoxystrobin first made commercially available in 1996 was designed to overcome these limitations it is world s biggest selling fungicide other commercial fungicides developed from strobilurins
