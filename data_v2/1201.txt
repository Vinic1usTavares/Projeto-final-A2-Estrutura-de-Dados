taking on jobs to ferry goods and hunting for bounties player character can engage in trade player character s primary goal in game is to accumulate money so as to buy more advanced weaponry and equipment to upgrade his ship left thumbnail alt a spacecraft is near bottom of screen heading towards center background is filled with stars and asteroids gauges and icons line top and bottom of screen in freelancer spacecraft is controlled by pointing and clicking with mouse game is played primarily through pointing and clicking with mouse and a few keyboard commands this system is also used to control spacecraft a breakaway from traditional use of joysticks for space flight simulators observing their spacecraft from rear players fly their ships by moving mouse in direction they want vessels to go freelancers spacecraft follow simplistic flight dynamics however a dash of realism is implemented by allowing vessels to cut power to their engines and turn to face any direction while drifting along their original path conservation of momentum clicking mouse button shoots ship s weapons at location of cursor interface has no radar display location of objects not shown on screen are indicated by pointers at screen s edges targeting communications and navigation data are displayed in information boxes that can be minimized after pilot docks with a space station or lands on a planet screen and its interface change to a rendition of area he is visiting player moves pilot to different locations and interacts with certain objects such as reading a bulletin board and talking to other characters by clicking on their graphical representations freelancers economy consists of buying and selling spacecraft their armaments and components and commodities certain goods are considered contraband in some systems and they have to be smuggled past police patrols to their buyers computer controlled characters non player characters or npcs in certain locations on planets or stations offer quests and jobs freelancer features a multiplayer mode allowing up to 128 players to play together in a game multiplayer games are hosted on game servers personal computers that meet requirements for game can act as a server gameplay is similar to single player mode but is absent of story driven quests server keeps individual records of players progress and they can resume their game on their next log on to this server a persistent virtual galaxy is thus maintained for them plot and setting events in freelancer take place 800 years after those in video game starlancer 2000 solar system was engulfed in a civil war fought between western alliance and eastern coalition facing defeat alliance placed its people in stasis and sent them to sirius system where they settled and transformed surrounding space sirius sector into a region of political intrigue and opportunity rule of sector is mostly split among four houses each named after sleeper ship that brought them to system each house exhibits culture of its terrestrial ancestor liberty of 1920s united states of victorian era united kingdom of shogunate era japan and rheinland of second industrial revolution germany fifth sleeper ship hispania suffered a malfunction en route and was abandoned in deep space in omicron alpha system descendants of its crew became pirates freelancers planetary bodies and space stations lie close to a single plane in each system although some are above or below this plane and ships can travel out of plane there are 48 known star systems and spacecraft can travel from one system to another by passing through jump gates within a system spacecraft can travel in trade lanes a series of gates that connect to form a space highway to quickly reach places of interest such as planets space stations and mining operations asteroid and debris fields populate some of systems and secret hideouts and with valuable items exist in deep space merchant ships ply trade lanes carrying cargo from system to system and occasionally coming under attack by pirates patrolling systems are police and large naval warships characters player takes on role of edison trent a mercenary in single player mode regardless of trent s background player can play him in different roles such as being a trader pirate or bounty hunter throughout story trent meets several npcs such as liberty security force lsf commander jun ko zane professor roland quintaine and head of a secret organization casper trent s relationships with these npcs are pre determined and illustrated by cutscenes player has no choice of import in trent s interactions with these npcs most npcs are aligned with a certain faction such as police pirates a company or government each faction has its own agenda and relationships among them are interlinked in a web of alliances and hostilities player characters anger a faction and its allies by destroying its ships likewise they gain favor of a faction and to a smaller extent its allies by attacking its enemies player characters who have a bad relationship with a faction are attacked on sight by its forces and denied from docking with its stations paying bribes to a faction improves its attitude to player character several npcs with major roles are voiced by professional voice actors such as ian ziering beverly hills 90210 jennifer hale metroid games george takei star trek and john rhys davies indiana jones films and sliders these npcs are excluded from multiplayer mode because of its lack of a campaign story scripted missions story plot of freelancers single player campaign is illustrated with two hours worth of in game cutscenes story is linear in structure player is unable to effect a different storyline and broken down into stages cutscenes inform players of background events and goals in a stage most stages have no time limits for their completion and players can put main story on hold while taking on missions jobs not crucial to it however players can only proceed to other regions of sirius sector where more advanced ships weaponry and equipment are obtained after completing missions that advance story some stages are not introduced until character has achieved a certain level based on total worth accumulated and it is not possible to gain sufficient levels just through story itself so players must spend at least some time on side missions to gain money to advance to level required for next stage of story this is also necessary as some stages would be too tough with only money and items collected in story on starting single player mode a cutscene shows destruction of space station freeport 7 by unknown forces leaving trent without money or ship on planet manhattan while waiting for his debtor lonnigan to regain consciousness trent takes up employment with lsf under jun ko zane who provides him with a small ship lonnigan refuses to pay trent when he awakes and is mysteriously taken away by lsf his death is later announced and trent is contacted by a thief who reveals that a mystery party destroyed freeport 7 to get an artifact in thief s possession an lsf officer kills thief and he is shot by zane in self defense as she arrives at scene zane and trent flee liberty space traveling across approximately half of freelancer world in their flight trent locates expert dr quintaine to learn more about artifact while finding additional materials for their research they discover existence of nomad alien race who are caretakers of an empire that belonged to previous inhabitants of sirius sector dom kavosh nomads can possess humans and have slowly infiltrated four houses in this manner planning to ignite a civil war to weaken humans for elimination trent joins order a secret organization formed to combat nomads and helps to rescue liberty president from aliens quintaine s research reveals artifact to be a map and key to dom kavosh s hyper gate super jump gate network which currently acts as nomads source of power order launches an attack on what they believe to be nomads homeworld aiming to activate hyper gates and cut off nomads from their power supply activated gates suck nomads to an unknown location and order watches over gates for their return with nomads defeat events return to normal in freelancer world trent and zane are granted full pardons by governments and trent is asked by order to be their eyes and ears in liberty space allowing player to continue game without any story elements development right thumb alt a city of towering buildings is sketched out in black and white arches are prominent in structures buildings are labeled at bottom as a bar a spaceport a buy and sell showroom a palace and an equipment and weapons structure concept drawing of a bretonian city architecture in freelancer is based on four societies in earth s history bretonian structures are influenced by victorian era architecture in 1997 chris roberts began work on a vision he had since he first conceived wing commander he wanted to realize a virtual galaxy whose systems execute their own programs regardless of players presence cities would be bustling with transports and each world s weather changes on its own time commodity prices in each star system would fluctuate according to activities of computer controlled traders who import and export goods roberts envisioned thousands of players simultaneously interacting with and influencing this world through a unique and intuitive user interface never seen before in other games each player could pursue a quest set up for their character and join other players to attempt other missions together without needing to exit game and start a new mode of play artificial intelligence would fly players spacecraft letting them concentrate on combat or other tasks roberts intended cutscenes and gameplay visuals to be of equal quality so players would be unable to distinguish between two by end of 1997 it was officially announced that freelancer was in early stages of a two and a half year development schedule two years later project was displayed at an annual showcase to mass media of microsoft s games media covered event focusing on features promised for this game there were concerns about state of graphics and uncertainties over promise of a dynamic economy but gaming site gamespot gave roberts and his company digital anvil benefit of their doubts initially in 1999 roberts announced game would be available on market by fall 2000 however project suffered delays and by electronic entertainment expo e3 2000 roberts said earliest release for game was at end of 2001 in june 2000 microsoft started talks to buy digital anvil roberts admitted that his team required large sums of money which only a huge company could provide to continue developing freelancer with its wildly ambitious features and unpredictable schedule project had overshot its original development projection of three years by 18 months roberts trusted that microsoft would not compromise his vision for freelancer and was convinced software giant would not attempt takeover if it did not believe freelancer could sell at least 500 000 copies when released roberts left company on completion of deal but assumed a creative consultant role on freelancer until its release microsoft instructed digital anvil to scale down ambitions of project and focus on finishing game based on what was possible and team s strengths features such as automated flight control conversations that had different choices of responses and sub quests were abandoned despite reductions several reviewers believed resultant product was still true to roberts vision freelancer team kept a low profile throughout 2001 before displaying a demo of their latest work at international games festival 2002 drawing large crowds microsoft announced project was on schedule and digital anvil added all planned content for game by october 2002 a beta test with approximately 500 testers was conducted and only main activities left were to refine game s features and to fix errors uncovered in testing game shipped to retailers on march 4 2003 and was later available online through yahoo s game on demand service digital anvil s role on freelancer ended on june 6 2003 with their delivery of a software patch to resolve issues on server and cheating staff were redeployed to other departments in microsoft in accordance with their five year support policy for software microsoft stopped supporting game on april 8 2008 and shut down their global server which managed list of multiplayer servers and connection of players to them freelancers soundtrack was released by sumthing else music works on november 18 2003 composed by award winning composer james hannigan music group visual music incorporated and digital anvil s musician and programmer andrew sega freelancer behind scenes on youtube com video it includes a bonus dvd that contains game s alternative introduction movies concept art scripts and deleted content communities of freelancer players banded together to produce modified versions of game their software modifications included new ships including big capital ships for players to fly and new factions for them to join certain modifications allowed players to fly ships of one franchise against another for example star wars versus wing commander communities also worked around loss of global server allowing players to host modified games on their servers and continuing freelancer multiple player online gaming world reception sales in united kingdom freelancer sold roughly 20 000 units during first half of 2003 kristan reed of gamesindustry biz wrote that these were not figures that spell h i t reviews and awards chris roberts is highly regarded in field of spaceflight combat simulators due to his successful wing commander franchise when industry learned that he was creating a new spaceflight combat simulator they paid close attention to it in its first public showing at e3 1999 roberts s freelancer won four game critics awards including best game of show journalists at one of game s later showings queued up to 90 minutes to catch a glimpse of a half hour demonstration computer gaming world trusting roberts s vision named freelancer as a game that would revolutionize gaming industry shortly after game was released ign called it game of month early in game s development industry was enthusiastic about prospect of playing in a world that changes without player interaction a dynamic world although there was caution over possibility of such implementation with contemporary technology delays in schedule and microsoft s take over of digital anvil gave rise to speculation that roberts s most promised feature dynamic world would be cut concerns were partially realized features although not cut were reduced leaving freelancer with a virtual world that did not live up to industry s expectations it presented a static galaxy where territories of various factions never change despite groups frequent raids and attacks on each other and commodity prices remain fixed nonetheless reviewers from video game sites such as eurogamer and gamespy accepted limitations and focused on other areas of game they found lack of variety a greater detraction from game than compromised dynamic world excluding single player campaign players never meet any memorable npc because almost everyone sounds american according to game nation tv after playing for a while every character and place looked similar to extent that game makes star trek look like a zoo furthermore instead of serving as entertainment missions which entail pilot to fly to a particular location and destroy enemies there are so repetitive that they become chores to reviewers instead left thumb alt a brown murky cloud is set against a black void in front of cloud at top left is a grey sphere pockmarked with craters a metal structure consisting of cylinders interconnected in shape of a ring floats in foreground scenes set against planetary systems such as this have earned praise from reviewers for their beauty freelancers graphics software was of older technology but it did not detract from firingsquad s praise of game s artistic quality beautiful and realistic depictions of universe impressed other reviewers such as gamecritics com and stratos group ign in particular was enamored with game s graphics describing them as simply gorgeous with best explosions and enormous ships mouse and keyboard flight control was praised by industry several reviewers found it easy to shoot down enemy ships with intuitive controls but others pointed out that aerobatic maneuvers such as or barrel rolls cannot be performed reducing dogfights to overly simplistic and repetitive chase or be chased sequences that pale in comparison to action in other spaceflight simulators on story side reviewers agreed professional actors such as ian ziering did a good job in bringing their respective characters to life however criticism was placed on lone voice who voiced all generic male encounters for his monotonous delivery and making all his characters sound alike long cutscenes which cannot be skipped frustrated game journalist tom chick he wanted to skip scenes and continue playing instead of being forced to watch a cliched story other reviewers expressed their own frustrations with story such as being forced to move to another star system at undesired times or leaving them without an objective after campaign abruptly ended firingsquad said freelancers multiplayer mode encapsulated best and worst of game in a nutshell although players can move their characters anywhere group with others for missions and trade ships and equipment they have very little else to do in unchanging virtual galaxy despite these limitations stratos group said joy of playing with real life counterparts is a positive factor npc pilots are so inept that human controlled pilots outperform them most of time however as missions are practically same ign and gamecritics com questioned point of playing them repeatedly with friends furthermore ign thought it was meaningless to amass wealth and higher grade equipment when they cannot be transferred to other servers lack of substance and repetitiveness led gaming site to wonder how long freelancer can be viable as a commercial multiplayer product whereas massively multiplayer online games such as everquest have thousands of players in a vast playing area freelancer can accommodate only up to 128 loneliness of playing in such a sparsely populated virtual world gave ugo concern as well over longevity of freelancers multiplayer mode overall reviewers acknowledged freelancer fell short of promises initially made by roberts however it demonstrated a high quality of work in its implemented features various concepts were well meshed together to form an entertaining product it never broke or raised bar of its genre but boasted a high production value and has been said to be well worth money game however was an anti climax for those who were hooked by touted and promised initial concepts many of which were never realized freelancer was a hugely ambitious game as admitted by chris roberts for a company to develop without necessary capital and resources editors of computer gaming world nominated freelancer for their 2003 shooter of year award which ultimately went to call of duty they wrote freelancer dazzled us with its immersive interstellar world wild combat and ambitiously open ended design but it can t compete with cinematic spectacle of europe at war sequels freelancer 2 project lonestar
