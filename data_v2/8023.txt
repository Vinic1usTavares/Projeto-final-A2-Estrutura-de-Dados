tropical storm nicole was a short lived and unusually asymmetrical tropical cyclone that caused extensive damage rainfall and flooding in jamaica during 2010 atlantic hurricane season it was sixteenth tropical cyclone and fourteenth named storm of season as well as last of a record eight tropical storms to form in september originating from a broad monsoonal low nicole became a tropical depression over northwestern caribbean sea on september 28 it maintained an unusual structure as it tracked northeastward with a poorly defined wind circulation and few thunderstorms near its center nicole approached coast of cuba as a weak tropical storm losing its status as a tropical cyclone over territory on september 29 remnants emerged over bahamas and eventually became absorbed by a separate extratropical system due to nicole s atypical structure strongest thundershowers were well removed from center most of weather activity occurred over north central caribbean in jamaica storm triggered widespread power outages across more than 288 000 residences extreme precipitation of up to caused disastrous flooding in several parishes severely damaging or destroying 528 houses devastation extended to island s farmland and environment which suffered from expansive water pollution in all nicole wrought an estimated 245 4 million 2010 usd in damage throughout jamaica and there were sixteen fatalities elsewhere minor flooding occurred in cuba florida and cayman islands remnants of storm contributed to a large disturbance along east coast of united states causing additional damage and deaths meteorological history in late september 2010 a wide band of disturbed weather and low pressure associated with monsoon trough and remnant tropical moisture from tropical storm matthew meandered over northwestern caribbean sea with a broad upper ridge anchored along yucatan coast diffluence aloft in vicinity of disturbance provided focus for development of scattered convection national hurricane center nhc noted an environment supportive of tropical development and by september 27 a broad surface low formed amid convection next day surface pressures steadily dropped as sustained winds around low tropical storm force throughout development process moderate westerly wind shear over region caused disturbance to exhibit a rather asymmetric structure it developed an elongated low pressure center by september 28 well to northwest of its strongest wind field despite asymmetry nhc initiated advisories on a tropical depression around 15 00 utc that day after surface and satellite observations revealed a sufficiently defined circulation center west of deep convection post season reassessments however indicated that a tropical storm had in fact formed three hours earlier about 75 miles 120 km south of cuba s isle of youth which operationally was not named nicole until a day later thumb right center of nicole near cuba with greatest rain volumes to southeast over jamaica as depicted on water vapor imagery for most of its duration nicole maintained a generally northeastward motion caught in steering flow between a large mid to upper level trough and an anticyclone to west within hours of storm s formation observations from a hurricane hunters flight confirmed a composition similar to one initially discerned with strongest gusts and thunderstorms dislocated 250 mi 400 km east from ill defined center in comparison core consisted of light winds and sporadic convection a structure rather characteristic of a north indian ocean monsoon depression system s ambiguous nature led to disagreement among weather specialists over its classification while nhc maintained its tropical cyclone status cuban meteorologist jose rubiera stated that no tropical storm exists over cuba or near it noting a lack of significant winds in country s vicinity over course of september 29 radar data showed convection increasing over northern half of storm bands of intense thunderstorms in southeastern periphery also formed closer to center and weather buoys and ships in that region observed sustained tropical storm force winds around 12 00 utc nicole attained an estimated peak intensity of winds and a minimum pressure of just south of cuba despite increase in strength nicole s circulation soon became exceedingly elongated and over central cuba prompting nhc to declassify it as a tropical cyclone by 15 00 utc remnant low began interacting with neighboring trough that had steered nicole in its tropical stages resulting in significant precipitation along southeastern coastlines of united states accelerating toward northeast system acquired frontal characteristics and became extratropical over bahamas by 0600 utc september 30 twelve hours before merging with a developing system over eastern north carolina lingering low pressure and broad cyclonic flow over north central caribbean in nicole s wake contributed to development of hurricane paula in first weeks of october preparations caribbean in anticipation of a tropical storm warnings were issued for cayman islands northwestern and central bahamas and cuban provinces of matanzas cienfuegos villa clara sancti spiritus and ciego de avila on september 28 however warnings were discontinued following day after reports of storm s prompt dissipation after forecasters warned

than during same period with a return period of 30 years these quantities tripled monthly rainfall average for september at several locations though broad scale wind regime over island remained gentle storm s intense convective bands produced three microbursts small downdrafts of intense winds with dozens of river banks and waterways blocked worst effects were due to landslides and particularly severe flooding across numerous communities primarily in southern parishes thumb left a shed collapsed in saint andrew parish killing three construction workers inside disaster affected 507 831 people

large stretches of land leading to soil contamination coastal erosion and deteriorated ecosystems in addition there were traces of light damage to vegetation such as uprooted trees elsewhere while nicole was intensifying offshore its outer bands produced heavy downpours over drought stricken cuba rain quantities were particularly high along southeastern coast a 48 hour total of fell at cape cruz in mountainous granma province region also briefly observed gale force winds with gusts to at guantanamo bay throughout eastern cuba nearly 300 people sought refuge from storm as rivers in granma overflowed eight houses collapsed and more than 300 others were inundated in coastal town of pilon flooding obstructed several roads with sections of highway between granma and santiago de cuba

skirted state with only showers of rain were recorded at north key largo though mainland received much smaller quantities storm flooded streets in miami beach and northern florida keys as well as one home similarly inclement weather spread over northwestern bahamas without significant consequences post tropical system extratropical remnants of nicole retained plenty of moisture and ultimately combined with a large low pressure system slowly tracking up u s east coast resultant disturbance produced torrential thunderstorms over entire coastlines and inland as far north as canada causing widespread power outages and shattering numerous precipitation records throughout region most extreme weather was concentrated over eastern north carolina during week of september 24 october 1 most communities there recorded rainfall totals of at least wilmington measured of rain most it had received over a five day period since 1871 while kinston recorded during that time widespread flooding
