substance dragan for movie reviews in croatian in comparing film with its remake heat praised mann s choice to hire unknown actors for l a takedown which contrasted with big stars in heat although he derided berkeley s performance as waingro he concluded that it was a fine companion piece to heat a reviewer from lexikon des internationalen films of germany was less enthusiastic citing routine action sequences and a confusing plot due to overly large cast lol frost of empire gave l a takedown two out of five stars acknowledging worthiness of plot but citing lack of mann s typical filming style frost concluded that film was a bit of a dud but a noble effort remake after directing last of mohicans mann decided to remake l a takedown into a wide release cinema feature he viewed film as a dry run for original story which was a complex multi layered crime drama edited out of script for television film he consulted a longer 1986 draft to work on remake having made l a takedown mann felt he had a much better idea of how he wanted to structure remake saying i charted film out like a 2 hr 45 min piece of music so i d know where to be smooth where not to be smooth where to be staccato where to use a pulse like a heartbeat on april 5 1994 mann was reported to have abandoned an earlier plan to produce a james dean biographical film in favor of l a takedown remake entitled heat heat

double cross crew in this film waingro plots against crew by himself and hanna s troubled stepdaughter plot elements not present in original film because of this heat runs nearly twice length of l a
