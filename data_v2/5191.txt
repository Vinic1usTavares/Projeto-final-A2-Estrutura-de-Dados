finished and set for release in october 2006 with call me when you re sober announced as its first single when song was first released it was speculated among public that it was dedicated to lead singer amy lee s recent ex boyfriend at that time shaun morgan lead singer of rock band seether although initially reluctant to reveal where she drew inspiration from to write song lee decided to disclose during an interview in august 2006 and confirm speculations her decision to publicly talk about inspiration came shortly after morgan had been admitted to a rehabilitation center to undergo treatment for combination of substances singer stated that when conceiving song she was aware that people would read between lines hence she tried to be completely clear with it she felt need to say exactly what i was feeling for so long and continued to describe her process of creating music as a form of a therapy which gave her a medium to express negative things that had happened in her life and allow her to turn something bad into something beautiful call me when you re sober helped her in process of healing from a painful ending to a relationship lee further elaborated i think it s impossible to hide how obvious it is day that our single hit airwaves my ex boyfriend said he was going into rehab and canceled their tour i haven t ever said right out who it was about but it s about big relationship i was in and whole breakup which was really long breaking up and hard stuff in our relationship happened sort of after i was out of spotlight for a while and writing it wasn t in any way public i was trying to be kind of discreet about it and then he totally came out and said he was going to rehab it was shocking to me it kind of made for a more interesting story in addition to that lee noted that song was also inspired by other events in her life including people who she was collaborating with holding me down and manipulating me and betraying me eventually leading her to make decision of put ting my foot down and walk ing out door during a 2011 interview with spin magazine lee described call me when you re sober as mostly a chick anthem you only want me when you re drunk you only want me because i m not there and deemed it empowering for her female audience of listeners due to response she had received from them in retrospect lee mentioned in 2016 i love this song because it has this fun spirit that was new for us as a band you can still be heavy with a smile on your face call me when you re sober had a limited radio release as first single off open door on july 31 2006 this was followed by a wider release in following week since track leaked onto internet two days before its scheduled release to radio airplay band s record label wind up records allowed radio stations to play single ahead of schedule subsequently recording was made available for digital download on september 4 2006 and a physical release as a single followed on september 25 rumors began to surface that wind up was responsible for track s selection as album s first single which lee denied in a post on band s then active fansite com wind up didn t choose this single i did and i had to fight for it i love this song also they didn t change anything about it this is way we made it we fought over guitar part but eventually just got mix right morgan s reaction thumb right shaun morgan lee s ex boyfriend and lead singer of band seether was song s inspiration during an interview in 2007 after finishing with his rehabilitation morgan explained how song had haunted him around and badly affected his reputation he stated that it was not pleasant to hear a song describing him as a bad guy which millions of people have heard he elaborated i was bummed out i was really upset that she would say and do those things in any relationship i don t think it s right to say and do those things when people break up and she obviously felt need to go out there and make me sound like a complete a hole i just refuse to lower myself to that level but it was a painful thing and it got me down at time of interview seether s album finding beauty in negative spaces was to be released soon and speculations started arising to whether it would contain an answer song to call me when you re sober breakdown was initially pinpointed as a possible answer in response to that morgan elaborated that particular song was not an angry backlash and it was more universal as he was trying to be more vague and respectful talking about lee s song he mentioned how there are always two sides to every story yet he opted not to tell his side as t hat s what bloodthirsty want and i don t care what bloodthirsty want emphasizing that he didn t feel need to write back and be mean he added that finding beauty in negative spaces did not contain other answer songs aimed at lee either as i know what expectations are for this album and that people will be looking for that amy lee reference and i am trying desperately not to have any further noting how any possible references would be about another relationship he had recently terminated or inspired by other people in his life in an october 2006 interview with spin lee initially expressed no intention of hurting morgan when writing song but noted that once song came out without any metaphors she wanted to keep it recording

york times identified numerous different genres present in call me when you re sober such as nu metal symphonic rock and electropop song starts off as a piano ballad progresses into a hard rock song with an orchestral pop infused chorus and contains a bridge before last chorus singer s vocals are doubled for second verse of song lyrically call me when you re sober is a literal song which depicts difficult situation of a female protagonist dealing with a lover who suffers from an addiction she eventually decides to move away from this dysfunctional relationship and leave him according to lee writing a song with literal meaning was an unusual practice for her a writer for daily princetonian concluded that call me when you re sober and lithium also from open door were both dedicated to lee s ex boyfriend with latter song exploring his perspective of story started by lee in former one andree farias from christianity today felt that song was self explanatory a stornoway gazette writer called it a tough love song which finds protagonist hoping that her lover will crash and burn and finally learn a lesson in song lee accuses her lover numerous times as illustrated in chorus lines don t cry to me if you loved me you would be here with me and bridge lines you never call me when you re sober you only want it cause it s over lines make up your mind repeated during song s chorus are
