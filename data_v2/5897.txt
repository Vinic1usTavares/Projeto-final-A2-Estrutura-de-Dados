record label fred records in 2002 background fred frith was a classically trained violinist who turned to playing blues guitar while still at school in 1967 he went to cambridge university where he and fellow student tim hodgkinson formed henry cow while at university frith read john cage s silence lectures and writings which changed his attitude to music completely he realised that sound in and of itself can be as important as melody and harmony and rhythm this changed his approach to guitar just to see what i could get out of it and initiated a long period of experimentation that continued throughout frith s musical career while music of henry cow was highly orchestrated and structured frith also began to experiment with unstructured music using prepared instruments and chance composition in june 1974 after release of henry cow s second album unrest virgin records henry cow s record label commissioned a solo record from frith they were impressed with his musical ability and gave him free rein to record whatever he wanted frith accepted virgin s challenge realising that he had an interesting opportunity to see if i could actually redefine what instrument was he decided that album would consist of a number of minimally planned improvisation s a set of etudes frith spent four days in july 1974 recording at kaleidophon studios in london and in october that year virgin released album as guitar solos on their budget label caroline records frith believes that virgin wanted to transform him into a guitar hero they were trying to turn me into a star which is what record companies try to do but rather than produce a guitar hero record what frith made was almost antithesis of what virgin were expecting american music academic benjamin piekut noted similarity between guitar solos and derek bailey s 1971 album solo guitar but added that while frith knew bailey at time he had not heard bailey s solo album recording frith recorded album at david vorhaus s kaleidophon studios in london on 11 13 and 15 july 1974 where he played a modified 1936 gibson k 11 he added an extra pickup over strings at nut enabling him to amplify sound from both sides of fretted note he then split fretboard in two with a capo effectively giving him two guitars each amplified separately that he could play independently with each hand to split sounds further he attached alligator clips at various positions on strings net result was a guitar with multiple sound sources that could be channelled to a mixer and distributed across stereo soundscape album was recorded in four days without any overdubbing all pieces were improvised some completely some to a roughly preconceived idea and sound as they were played except for no birds which was recorded in two parts and not forgotten from which two notes were removed only sounds not produced naturally by guitar are those of a fuzzbox used on out of their heads on heat c w moment and no birds an echo delay used on no birds and ambient noise from frith s breath and feet on heat c w moment on longest track on album no birds frith played on two prepared guitars simultaneously creating timbre and range of an orchestra he laid two guitars flat on a table neck to neck with bodies of guitars at opposite ends and necks parallel to each other he tuned strings on both guitars to one note and because they were stereo guitars with nut pickups he had six separate sound sources coming from each guitar using volume pedals on some of sound sources he filtered sounds in and out of mix without doing anything on guitars frith took title of no birds from last line of a poem one nest rolls after another by captain beefheart that was printed on back of beefheart s 1971 album mirror man reception and influence guitar solos was voted one of best albums of 1974 by new musical express critics in a review in nme in november 1974 charles shaar murray described it as a totally revolutionary album and an undeniable landmark in history of rock guitar sean westergaard of allmusic called guitar solos a landmark album because of its innovative and experimental approach to guitar playing he said it seldom sounds like traditional guitar music but pieces have a logic and beauty in some cases all their own westergaard described work as challenging avant garde music but not unapproachable in january 1983 edition of downbeat magazine bill milkowski wrote that on guitar solos frith unveiled a haunting collection of improvised music on prepared guitar which must have stunned listeners of day even today 1983 that album stands up as uniquely innovative and undeniably daring piekut described guitar solos as extraordinary not only for astonishing precision and originally of frith s technique but for his of an instrument whose entire history had been governed by a simple rule you pluck it and it goes twang album attracted attention of brian eno who was excited by timbral possibilities that frith had been discovering eno asked frith to record with him and this resulted in frith playing guitar on two of eno s albums before and after science 1977 and music for films 1978 table top guitar setup frith used on guitar solos became a standard for many of his subsequent live performances including those recorded on his 1982 live double album live in japan he later extended his technique to include found objects which he used on his guitars to extract new sounds success of guitar solos spawned two follow up albums guitar solos 2 1976 and guitar solos 3 1979 which featured frith and other improvising guitarists including derek bailey and hans reichel frith coordinated and produced these albums and employed many of same unorthodox techniques he had used on guitar solos when a remastered edition of original guitar solos was released 28 years later on frith s own fred records label it attracted further praise from critics westergaard wrote that guitar solos lasting legacy is that it radically redefined
