city government must be ready to take over property if private sector failed under chamberlain s direction birmingham soon adopted one of first town planning schemes in britain which would in time be mirrored by other large industrial cities such as liverpool and leeds however start of war in 1914 prevented implementation of his plans in birmingham with outbreak of world war i in august 1914 chamberlain became deeply involved in war effort in addition to his duties as councillor chamberlain helped recruit men for royal warwickshire regiment and set up funds for injured soldiers late in 1914 he became an alderman of birmingham and following year became lord mayor chamberlain s biographer robert self suggested that as joseph chamberlain had died previous year honour was due to neville chamberlain s hard work rather than to any family influence as a lord mayor in wartime chamberlain had a tremendous burden of work and he insisted that his councillors and officials work equally hard he set up creches for workers stockpiled coal to be distributed to poor at cost in time of shortage and reinvigorated birmingham s various committees which were ineffective and engaged in wasteful rivalries he also chaired local committee evaluating exemptions from conscription and stated that he was more lenient than were other members of tribunal he halved lord mayor s expense allowance and

whose contempt for chamberlain was reciprocated conscription for army but not for civilian industry had been brought in during first half of 1916 towards end of asquith s government in 1916 a manpower distribution board had been set up under neville s brother austen but it had no executive powers after edwin montagu had refused new position of director of national service as he thought task of building up a new ministry was beyond him chamberlain who was already nationally known was proposed for job by his brother austen in december 1916 new prime minister david lloyd george offered him job with responsibility for co ordinating conscription and ensuring that essential war industries were able to function with sufficient workforces though reluctant to leave his post in birmingham chamberlain accepted and resigned as lord mayor to a great extent chamberlain s actual responsibilities were left vague by lloyd george on his appointment lloyd george implied in house of commons that compulsion industrial equivalent of conscription was to be extended to industry and that chamberlain would soon produce a system of industrial enrolment but chamberlain found his work to be handicapped by prime minister s political manoeuvres as chamberlain sought to maximise number of workers subject both to military conscription and compulsion into industry lloyd george pledged to unions that he would oppose any sort of industrial conscription although chamberlain repeatedly made proposals for mandatory service they were turned down by lloyd george and his war cabinet army still controlled its own recruitment at this stage whilst chamberlain met with resistance from ministries of munitions and labour chamberlain s proposal that all men under 21 be drafted from industry into army was blocked by minister of munitions addison 19 january 1917 as it would have meant conscripting skilled young men who had already spent time in apprenticeships chamberlain was not made a privy councillor he also spurned advice from lloyd george about his choice of advisors apart from james stevenson from ministry of munitions who was briefly deputy for civil recruiting instead appointing cronies from birmingham who were as out of their depth as he was chamberlain nearly resigned in june 1917 when having not been told or consulted he read in newspapers that he had been given a new parliamentary secretary denied use of compulsion chamberlain had to persuade britons to volunteer for essential war work and fit young workers to leave factories and enter army he had to address mass meetings and issue posters he found that workers were reluctant to exchange comforts of home and wartime salaries for uncertainties of trenches and a wage of one shilling a day chamberlain had little confidence in voluntary schemes and they indeed proved unsuccessful with only 9 000 workers freed to be drafted into army at a time when britain was sustaining huge casualties chamberlain finally resigned on 8 august 1917 he was thanked warmly by staff at st ermin s hotel where ministry was housed lloyd george wrote to his family in welsh that neville chamberlain has resigned and thank god for that he met with considerable sympathy from members of parliament after his resignation john dillon an irish nationalist mp stated that if mr chamberlain were an archangel or if he were hindenburg and bismarck and all great men of world rolled into one his task would be wholly beyond his powers unionist party leader bonar law spoke of absolutely impossible task chamberlain had faced auckland geddes chamberlain s successor was made a privy councillor and had more power and more support from war cabinet than he had had relationship between chamberlain and lloyd george was thenceforth one of hatred with chamberlain calling lloyd george that dirty little welsh attorney and being implacably opposed to lloyd george joining national government in 1930s austen chamberlain brother of one opponent and for a time political ally of other regretted enmity more s pity for together if they were together they might do a great deal lloyd george would later paint a most unflattering portrait of chamberlain in his 1935 war memoirs claiming that mr chamberlain is a man of rigid competency such men have their uses in conventional times and are indispensable for filling subordinate posts at all times but they are lost in an emergency or in creative tasks at any time his dislike of chamberlain is sometimes said to have been based on phrenology although little contemporary evidence has been found to confirm this lloyd george would also have last laugh in may 1940 when his speech in norway debate helped bring down chamberlain s government candidate and backbencher having resigned as director chamberlain returned to birmingham embittered by his experience in london he wrote that experience reminds me of bahamas when plants didn t grow he had retained his seat on city council and busied himself with his civic duties as well as his business interests and family life in february 1918 having declined a third term as lord mayor he was appointed deputy mayor chamberlain had formed a close friendship with his cousin norman chamberlain who had also served on city council and who shared future prime minister s social ideals in december 1917 norman chamberlain was reported missing in action during battle of cambrai and in february 1918 norman s body was found a great blow to neville chamberlain who described norman as most intimate friend i had through rest of his career neville chamberlain laboured to further ideals of his cousin and wrote his biography only book he ever wrote some historians relate norman s death to a hatred of war on his cousin s part which led to appeasement according to chamberlain s biographer nick smart death did not cause chamberlain to hate world war i and any influence on his later positions is far from certain after some hesitation as to his future career chamberlain determined to enter parliament though after his experience with national service he feared that he would only have a brief unsatisfying parliamentary career wishing to stand for a birmingham constituency he initially had some difficulty in finding one representation of people act 1918 gave birmingham five additional seats and chamberlain was adopted as candidate for one of new seats birmingham ladywood with election on hold until conclusion of war he continued his work in birmingham shortly after armistice his sister beatrice died in influenza pandemic and chamberlain mourned her she had warmest heart with war ended a general election was called almost immediately chamberlain stood as a unionist as conservative party was known from 1912 to 1925 and was given coupon or letter of endorsement granted by coalition party leaders lloyd george and bonar law to approved candidates though he declined to make any use of it he was elected with almost 70 of vote and a majority of 6 833 at age 49 he remains oldest man to enter parliament for first time and later become prime minister chamberlain threw himself into parliamentary work begrudging times when he was unable to attend debates and spending much time on committee work when austen chamberlain chancellor of exchequer in continued coalition government led by liberal prime minister lloyd george tried to recruit him to serve on an additional committee neville chamberlain informed his half brother that he could only serve if it met between midnight and 7 30 am chamberlain took time to assure future of birmingham savings bank and parliament passed an act which removed onerous restrictions from bank in march 1920 he was offered a junior post at ministry of health by bonar law on behalf of prime minister but was unwilling to serve under lloyd george despite bonar law s warnings that chamberlain now past fifty might never be offered another chance to serve in government as lloyd george was likely to remain premier for a very long time chamberlain was offered no further posts during lloyd george s premiership and when bonar law resigned as party leader austen chamberlain took his place as leader of unionists in parliament unionist backbenchers had long been restive as lloyd george granted liberals in coalition more than their proportionate share of offices in october 1922 discontent among unionists against lloyd george coalition government erupted when unionist mps were summoned to carlton club for a meeting to receive their instructions for forthcoming election which as in 1918 was to be fought in coalition with lloyd george liberals they instead rebelled and voted to fight election as a single party lloyd george resigned as prime minister most unionist leaders including austen chamberlain had supported coalition and advocated its continuation they resigned from their government and party offices with austen chamberlain writing meeting today rejected our advice other men who have given other counsels must inherit our burden bonar law was recalled from retirement to lead unionists as prime minister neville

postmaster general a ministerial post below cabinet level bonar law called an election shortly after his accession which unionists won and chamberlain was re elected though his prediction that his seat was safe as houses proved dubious his majority was reduced to 2 443 in january 1923 chamberlain granted first operating licence to british broadcasting company though he opposed its request to broadcast king s speech setting forth government s programme in opening parliament chamberlain feared that allowing speech to be aired would lead to broadcast of parliamentary debates over radio a prospect which makes one shudder sir arthur griffith boscawen minister of health had lost his seat in 1922 general election and failed to win a by election in march 1923 housing fell within remit of minister of health as chamberlain had experience in developing housing programmes in birmingham bonar law offered health ministry within cabinet to him chamberlain was initially reluctant feeling that he should not leave post office before he had a chance of doing something there but decided that it would not be playing game to refuse bonar law s request there was a great shortage of housing in britain as a result of pent up demand from war years and almost all housing was rent controlled giving builders little incentive to build more any removal of rent restrictions would be wildly unpopular chamberlain introduced a housing act in april 1923 that provided subsidies for private companies and extended rent control until 1925 he expected rent control to be gradually abolished as housing supply increased but restrictions remained in force until 1933 when a new scheme was enacted in may 1923 bonar law was diagnosed with advanced terminal throat cancer he immediately resigned and king george v sent for chancellor of exchequer stanley baldwin to form a government baldwin served as his own chancellor for three months while he sought a successor and then promoted chamberlain to position chamberlain had little time for any policy changes as he served only five months in office and did not present a budget though unionists had an ample majority in house of commons and current parliament had four years to run baldwin decided that a general election was needed and that unionists should fight it on issue of tariff reform he hoped to gain both a personal mandate as prime minister and a policy mandate for his tariff proposals he miscalculated badly in general election held in december 1923 unionists remained largest party in house of commons but were outnumbered by combined liberal and labour mps baldwin government retained office until it was defeated when parliament assembled in january 1924 and ramsay macdonald became first labour prime minister chamberlain s majority in birmingham ladywood was cut yet again this time to 1 500 votes with unionists in opposition chamberlain managed to broker a reconciliation between his brother and other and new leadership and austen chamberlain resumed his place on front benches labour government fell within months necessitating another general election neville chamberlain was challenged by labour candidate oswald mosley who later led british union of fascists mosley campaigned aggressively in ladywood and accused chamberlain of being a landlords outraged chamberlain demanded that mosley retract claim as a gentleman mosley whom baldwin described as a cad and a wrong un refused to retract allegation it took several recounts before chamberlain was declared winner by 77 votes and mosley blamed poor weather for result chamberlain had not wanted to desert ladywood but now deemed seat impossible to hold and was adopted for birmingham edgbaston for next election held in 1929 at which ladywood fell to labour by eleven votes unionists won 1924 election their last under that name baldwin formed a new government in which austen was foreign secretary and neville chamberlain declined to serve again as chancellor preferring his former position as minister of health minister of health within two weeks of his appointment as minister of health chamberlain presented cabinet with an agenda containing 25 pieces of legislation he hoped to see enacted before he left office in 1929 21 of 25 had passed into law an early very popular piece of legislation was widows orphans and old age contributory pensions act 1925 passed after chancellor of exchequer winston churchill had agreed to find whatever money was needed to fund act churchill recently returned to conservative ranks after nineteen years as a liberal 1904 23 expressed envy at chamberlain s receiving credit for act and minister of health described his colleague as a man of tremendous drive vivid imagination but obsessed with glory of doing something spectacular which should erect monuments to him act lowered age for receiving government old age pension from 70 to 65 as well as providing for dependents of deceased workers though pension sum ten shillings today about ps20 per week was not enough for a pensioner to make ends meet chamberlain stated that it was not intended to replace private thrift and that sum was maximum financially feasible chamberlain sought abolition of elected poor law boards of guardians which administered relief and which in some areas were responsible for setting rates local property taxes many of boards were controlled by labour and had defied government by distributing relief funds to able bodied unemployed chamberlain s first step in direction of abolition was rating and valuation act 1925 which greatly reduced number of authorities which administered rates as well as imposing uniform standards for assessment despite policy differences chamberlain continued to work with churchill who showed him manuscript of a volume of his heavily autobiographical world crisis churchill confided that he would have wished for two more years to revise manuscript chamberlain wrote to his sisters that he could have done job in two hours with a pair of scissors though chamberlain struck a conciliatory note during 1926 general strike in general he had poor relations with labour opposition future labour prime minister clement attlee complained that chamberlain always treated us like dirt and chamberlain wrote in april 1927 more and more do i feel an utter contempt for their lamentable stupidity one labour mp referred to chamberlain as a miniature mussolini and others claimed that chamberlain s policies had allowed entire communities to starve dubbing him minister of death his poor relations with labour party eventually played a major part in his downfall as prime minister with many mining communities suffering high levels of unemployment following general strike some poor law boards granted relief to unemployed workers by misusing provisions intended for exceptional circumstances these boards used provisions to give benefits to nearly all applicants with system thrown into crisis chamberlain sought legislation to permit minister of health to dismiss recalcitrant boards and later got parliament to pass further legislation to prescribe criminal penalties to members of such boards though no board members were prosecuted chamberlain dismissed three boards replacing their members with his own appointees finally in 1929 chamberlain brought in legislation to abolish poor law boards entirely replacing them with bodies appointed by local authorities chamberlain spoke in commons for two and a half hours on second reading of bill and when he concluded he was applauded by all parties local government act 1929 passed by an ample majority and morning post commented that despite labour attacks it had been found to be impossible to make it unpopular return to opposition thumb upright 37 eaton square where chamberlain lived most of time while in london until 1935 baldwin called a general election for 30 may 1929 chamberlain expected conservatives to triumph easily and thought he would be moved either to exchequer or be asked to serve at colonial office where joseph chamberlain had made his mark chamberlain easily won in edgbaston which he represented for rest of his life but general election resulted in a hung parliament with labour holding most seats baldwin and his government resigned and labour leader ramsay macdonald took office chamberlain anticipated that labour would govern for two years then seek another general election and be returned for a second term with an overall majority in parliament he believed that were this to occur at 67 he might well be too old to hold office again when that term expired with no ministerial responsibilities he departed on a three month tour of east africa hoping it might be useful were he to serve in future as colonial secretary as minority labour government attempted to grapple with onset of depression conservative party indulged in a period of internecine warfare with baldwin under attack in parliamentary party and in press for losing election and for being too moderate chamberlain attempted to mediate between press lords and baldwin only to learn that newspaper owners had been trying to influence local constituency organisations behind his back during leadership crisis chamberlain persuaded conservative party chairman j c c davidson to resign to relieve pressure on baldwin chamberlain took vacant chair himself campaign by press lords notably lord beaverbrook and lord for empire free trade removal of tariffs within empire culminated in a crucial by election at which press lords ran their own candidate under banner of united empire party robert topping general director at conservative central office produced a memorandum showing that baldwin s support had eroded tremendously chamberlain confronted baldwin with memorandum baldwin was badly shaken and told chamberlain he would resign after a day baldwin reconsidered and even considered giving up his seat and standing in by election himself when chamberlain told baldwin that if he stood and lost his successor would be badly damaged baldwin replied i don t give a damn about my successor neville chamberlain resigned as party chairman though he continued as head of conservative research department which he had founded until his death baldwin did not stand in by election but he retained his position and attacked press barons as wanting power without responsibility prerogative of harlot through ages and conservatives won election baldwin and chamberlain healed their breach and chamberlain helped negotiate return of press lords to conservative fold baldwin led conservative party for another six years in january 1931 churchill one of chamberlain s leadership rivals left conservative front bench in a dispute over policy on india in 1931 macdonald government faced a serious crisis as may report revealed that budget was unbalanced with an expected shortfall of ps120 million as this information became public there was a run on pound depleting nation s gold reserves labour party refused to consider massive cuts in unemployment compensation which would be needed to balance budget and prime minister macdonald sought support from outside his party with baldwin on holiday in france chamberlain negotiated for conservatives chamberlain told macdonald that conservatives would only join a coalition if full recommended cuts in unemployment compensation were made finally on 24 august 1931 labour government resigned and macdonald formed a national government supported by most conservative and liberal mps and a minority of labour party chamberlain once more returned to ministry of health national government was intended as only a temporary expedient but governed britain until chamberlain s fall in 1940 in ensuing general election national government won 554 of 615 seats in house of commons with 473 of its supporters conservative mps chancellor and conservative heir apparent after election macdonald wanted to designate liberal national walter runciman an advocate of free trade as chancellor conservatives insisted that a member of their party who favoured tariffs be given office reluctantly macdonald designated chamberlain as chancellor and runciman was made president of board of trade chamberlain proposed a 10 tariff on foreign goods with lower or no tariffs on goods from colonies and dominions joseph chamberlain had advocated a similar policy imperial preference his sons found it pleasing and appropriate that chamberlain could now promote his father s policies and sir austen chamberlain wrote to his brother in november 1931 father s great work will be completed in his children tariff issue bitterly divided cabinet and threatened to end national government cabinet accepted a proposal by lord hailsham secretary of state for war that they agree publicly to disagree a rare suspension of doctrine of cabinet collective responsibility chamberlain prepared his tariff bill which exempted dominions pending ottawa conference set for later that year on 4 february 1932 he laid it before commons addressing a packed house with prince of wales duke of york and joseph chamberlain s third wife in gallery and with his brother seated behind him chamberlain concluded by referring to his father s inability to get a similar proposal adopted at end of speech sir austen chamberlain walked down and shook his brother s hand import duties act 1932 passed parliament easily ottawa conference that august produced little result with chamberlain bringing home several minor bilateral trade agreements and no general agreement in interim between import duties act and ottawa conference chamberlain presented his first budget in april 1932 gold standard had been abandoned in early days of national government bank of england sought its restoration chamberlain on advice from his officials declined to restore gold standard realising that a devalued pound would improve balance of trade otherwise chamberlain maintained severe budget cuts that had been agreed to at inception of national government chamberlain cut means tested benefits and public sector wages which proved to be an unpopular move he also cut interest rates which led to a house building boom in south of england and supported plans to clear slums interest on war debt had been a major cost in each budget chamberlain was able to reduce interest rate on most of britain s war debt from 5 to 3 5 between 1932 and 1938 chamberlain halved percentage of budget devoted to payment of interest on war debt chamberlain hoped that a cancellation of war debt owed to united states could be negotiated in june 1933 britain hosted world monetary and economic conference describing event as most crucial gathering since versailles time magazine featured chamberlain on its cover referring to him as that mighty mover behind british cabinet scenes lean taciturn iron willed it is no secret that scot macdonald remains prime minister by prime mover chamberlain s leave conference came to nothing when us president franklin roosevelt sent word that he would not consider any war debt cancellation after us congress passed johnson act forbidding loans to nations in default on their debts chamberlain felt that britain could not pay entire debt and as act made no distinction between a partial and complete default chancellor entirely suspended britain s war debt payments to us in 1934 chamberlain was able to declare a budget surplus and restore many of cuts in unemployment compensation and civil servant s salaries he had made after taking office he told commons we have now finished story of bleak house and are sitting down this afternoon to enjoy first chapter of great expectations with macdonald in physical and mental decline and conservative party leader baldwin exhibiting ever greater lethargy chamberlain increasingly became workhorse of national government defence spending had been heavily cut in chamberlain s early budgets by 1935 faced with a resurgent germany under hitler s leadership he was convinced of need for rearmament and was driving force behind defence white papers advocating rearmament in 1936 and 1937 chamberlain especially urged strengthening of royal air force realising that britain s traditional bulwark english channel was no defence against air power rearmament was an unpopular policy in britain and labour attacked chamberlain as a warmonger labour leader and leader of opposition clement attlee spoke against 1936 budget as tremendously overspending on defence everything was devoted to piling up instruments of death churchill also criticised national government s defence plans though he called for an even faster buildup despite sniping from both sides chamberlain was very concerned about expense of rearmament what a frightful bill we do owe to master hitler damn him if it only wasn t for germany we should be having such a wonderful time just now in 1935 macdonald stood down as prime minister taking baldwin s post as lord president of council and baldwin became prime minister for third time chamberlain remained at treasury almost only cabinet member not to be moved in subsequent reshuffle chamberlain was still spoken of as heir apparent but feared being eclipsed by a younger man to be seen more as second man of government he insisted on moving into number 11 downing street chancellor s traditional residence which had been occupied by baldwin during macdonald s premiership baldwin indicated his desire to remain in office until his 70th birthday in august 1937 but chamberlain doubted he would last that long in 1935 general election conservative dominated national government lost 90 seats from massive majority of 1931 but still retained an overwhelming majority of 255 in house of commons during campaign deputy labour leader arthur greenwood attacked chamberlain for spending money on re armament stating that re armament policy was merest scaremongering disgraceful in a statesman of mr chamberlain s responsible position to suggest that more millions of money needed to be spent on armaments in january 1936 edward viii became king on death of his father george v chamberlain supported baldwin s stance that king edward must abdicate if he wished to marry woman he loved wallis warfield simpson a divorcee after conclusion of abdication crisis baldwin announced that he would remain until shortly after coronation of king edward s successor george vi king george was crowned on

book on chamberlain that damage to his reputation both as prime minister and as a cabinet minister could have been contained had conservative party defended his policies but for 23 years after chamberlain s death party leaders churchill anthony eden and harold macmillan had made reputations as opponents of appeasement and who were little minded to defend chamberlain s record as a minister labour landslide in 1945 general election cemented this inclination with macmillan stating that it was not churchill who had brought conservative party so low on contrary it was recent history of party with its pre war record of unemployment and its failure to preserve peace adoption of policies using keynesian economics led to other criticisms of chamberlain s ministerial record popular wisdom then held that governments could keep unemployment at a low level through spending chamberlain s acceptance of unemployment as an inevitable part of business cycle was seen as outdated in 1958 as prime minister macmillan described a report advocating limits on public investment as a very bad paper indeed a disgraceful paper it might have been written by mr neville chamberlain s government in 1961 a controversial biography of chamberlain by conservative party chairman iain macleod defended chamberlain s ministerial record macleod pointed out that chamberlain had been a most valiant champion of rearmament as chancellor as early as 1934 but that little was done according to time magazine macleod saw chamberlain as a humanitarian industrialist a progressive lord mayor of birmingham and a dedicated minister of health who was damned as a tory socialist chamberlain had worked tirelessly in 20s and 30s for noble and fascinating ideal of fashioning a better life for britain s workingman 1960s and 1970s saw a further reassessment of chamberlain as a cabinet minister historians such as a j p taylor pointed out that while 1930s were a decade of misery for some for most britons it was a time of rising living standards with unemployment concentrated in only a few regions of country as economists and historians came to question assumption that national government could have spent its way out of unemployment chamberlain s tenure as chancellor was to an extent rehabilitated american social historian bentley gilbert stated that chamberlain was most successful social reformer in seventeen years between 1922 and 1939 after 1922 no one else is really of any significance according to taylor writing in 1965 chamberlain did more to improve local government while serving as health minister than did anyone else in 20th century in 1980s margaret thatcher instituted economic policies reminiscent of chamberlain s as chancellor control of inflation even at expense of unemployment minimisation of budget deficits and low rates of direct taxation this was a point not lost on labour party and trades union congress adopted a slogan of forwards to eighties not backwards to thirties thatcher s critics denigrated both her policies and those of 1930s in such comparisons but she did not care to defend those of 1930s thatcher stated that historical justifications for her economic positions were policies of victorian era dutton who traced progress of chamberlain s reputation through years wrote in 2001 that chamberlain s accomplishments at ministry of health were considerable achievements by any standards and stated that they should not be seen in isolation but as part of authentic chamberlain a man who was throughout his life on progressive left of conservative party a committed believer in social progress and in power of government at both national and local level to do good five years later chamberlain biographer graham
