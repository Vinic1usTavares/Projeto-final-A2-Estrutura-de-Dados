casiri is a mountainous complex in barroso mountain range in andes of peru about high and is located in tacna region casiri also known as paucarani is a volcano consisting of four individual volcanic edifices with lava domes edifice has been active during holocene producing thick lava flows that have overrun moraines of pleistocene age and youngest of which has been dated to 2 600 400 years ago although no historical eruptions are known volcano is considered to be potentially active volcano features geothermal manifestations and is linked to a larger geothermal field that has been prospected for geothermal power generation and sulfur mines are found on casiri too finally paucarani reservoir that covers bulk of tacna s water supply is associated with casiri rio uchusuma that flows through reservoir originates on volcano and reservoir is located on foot of casiri name name casiri might mean in aymara casiri is also known as paucarani or although casiri and paucarani are sometimes treated as distinct volcanoes a lake with name casiri lies about north from volcano it is a glacial lake and a reservoir geography and geomorphology thumb casiri is a high stratovolcano with lava domes close to border between peru and chile volcano rises about above surrounding terrain and has a volume of about with a diameter of there are four individual volcanic edifices at casiri three older ones that form a 5 kilometre long chain and a southeasterly younger edifice with a well preserved lava dome in its crater which is breached to south an older lava dome also exists in western part of complex and whole casiri volcano has formed on southern flanks of older volcanoes lava flows stubby and thick from viscosity originate in younger edifice and spread in several directions flows reach lengths of and are well preserved displaying flow lines levees and lobes on images taken from space they have dark colours some parts of volcano have undergone hydrothermal alteration producing gray white rocks and clay and wind blown ash covers part of lava flows casiri is part of generally terrain around casiri is dominated by various volcanic and fluvioglacial formations along with some moraines mountain chains barroso and lie southwest and south from casiri respectively and neighbouring mountains and are covered with snow geologically casiri is considered to be part of so called paucarani volcanics hydrology and paucarani reservoir rio uchusuma a tributary of rio mauri originates on casiri a natural lake called paucarani exists on southeastern foot of casiri and quebrada valley is also located south of casiri accompanied by wetlands on other side southeastward flowing quebrada lies to north and northeast of volcano and to northwest lie streams which flow through lake casiri and lake into rio mauri volcanic activity has influenced drainages through formation of lava dams altering watersheds an earth dam on rio uchusuma was built in 1982 1986 and forms a reservoir also called paucarani on southeastern foot of volcano just southwest from natural lake paucarani this reservoir has a capacity of of water and is a key part of water supply of tacna water is transferred from paucarani reservoir through canal uchusuma to tacna covering 90 of tacna s water consumption for both irrigation and human use paucarani reservoir is also involved in regulation of rio in 2012 a broken floodgate caused a damaging flood alterations in reservoir that increased its storage volume may be responsible for water leaks in dam additional problems reported at paucarani are contamination with heavy metals especially arsenic human geography casiri is located in tarata province of tacna region of peru it lies about northeast from city of tacna and close to border with chile and bolivia volcano is situated north of town of paucarani other human structures in area south of casiri are and there are also numerous roads in area including one which runs south of volcano and reaches camp to its west town of paucarani can be reached from highway that connects tacna with in bolivia and villa industrial in chile through a secondary road a rain gauge of was active there at elevation from 1946 to 2003 volcano is considered a potential tourist attraction owing to its scenery it is also part of geopark and has been proposed to become a protected area paucarani reservoir also could be exploited for tourism purposes as well geology subduction of nazca plate beneath south america plate occurs at a rate of and causes volcanism along western margin of south america this volcanism is distributed over three volcanic belts northern volcanic zone central volcanic zone and southern volcanic zone among these central volcanic zone includes volcanoes of southern peru a country with over 300 volcanoes of these el misti huaynaputina sabancaya ticsani tutupaca ubinas and yucamane have been active during historical time geothermal manifestations such as fumaroles geysers and hot springs also occur in country despite activity volcanism in peru is poorly known composition based on rock types that casiri volcano has erupted it can be determined that it is composed of andesite basaltic andesite and trachyandesite with a porphyric texture rocks contain biotite hornblende plagioclase and sanidine crystals deposition of sulfur from gases has formed sulfur deposits eruption history quaternary age casiri is one of youngest volcanic systems in southern peru with postglacial activity and peru s southernmost holocene volcano holocene lavas sourced from fissure vents overlie pleistocene age moraines and are uneroded radiometric dating on volcano has yielded ages of 50 000 years and surface exposure dating carried out more recently has found ages of 6 000 900 and 2 600 400 years for two dark lava flows southwest and south of casiri s main summit respectively there are no reported eruptions but activity may or may not have occurred in historical time casiri does feature hot springs and solfataras and has been classified as a latent or potentially active volcano with a moderate threat level in 2012 geophysical institute in peru announced that it would begin monitoring casiri along with two other volcanoes in southern peru with seismometers human use mining gloria sulfur mine lies on casiri specifically on foot of paucarani and southeast from lava flows sulfur is contained in heavily altered rocks covering an area of about and is genetically related to activity of casiri it has been excavated through trenches and wells some installations could still be exploitable another mine known as san luis may also be associated with paucarani it is located on northwestern flank precious metals might occur in hydrothermally altered areas at casiri geothermal power area of casiri also features chungara kallapuma geothermal field where about 50 separate vents occur along path of quebrada chungara and kallapuma river they reach temperatures of these phenomena appear to relate to activity of neighbouring volcanoes which supply heat to geothermal field while rainfall supplies water and faults paths for ascending water hot springs are currently used as spas by local population geothermal power potential of tacna region has been researched partly because tacna region covers its electricity demand with either oil or with hydropower which is subject to climate variations mining is both an important economic resource in tacna and a major consumer of electricity in case of chungara kallapuma geothermal field capacity of a 75 megawatt power plant exists however despite ongoing research since 1974 and a high geothermal potential no geothermal power production has taken place in peru references sources category
