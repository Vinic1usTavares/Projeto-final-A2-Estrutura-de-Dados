in physics a force is any interaction that when unopposed will change motion of an object a force can cause an object with mass to change its velocity which includes to begin moving from a state of rest i e to accelerate force can also be described intuitively as a push or a pull a force has both magnitude and direction making it a vector quantity it is measured in si unit of newtons and represented by symbol f original form of newton s second law states that net force acting upon an object is equal to rate at which its momentum changes with time if mass of object is constant this law implies that acceleration of an object is directly proportional to net force acting on object is in direction of net force and is inversely proportional to mass of object concepts related to force include thrust which increases velocity of an object drag which decreases velocity of an object and torque which produces changes in rotational speed of an object in an extended body each part usually applies forces on adjacent parts distribution of such forces through body is internal mechanical stress such internal mechanical stresses cause no acceleration of that body as forces balance one another pressure distribution of many small forces applied over an area of a body is a simple type of stress that if unbalanced can cause body to accelerate stress usually causes deformation of solid materials or flow in fluids development of concept philosophers in antiquity used concept of force in study of stationary and moving objects and simple machines but thinkers such as aristotle and archimedes retained fundamental errors in understanding force in part this was due to an incomplete understanding of sometimes non obvious force of friction and a consequently inadequate view of nature of natural motion a fundamental error was belief that a force is required to maintain motion even at a constant velocity most of previous misunderstandings about motion and force were eventually corrected by galileo galilei and sir isaac newton with his mathematical insight sir isaac newton formulated laws of motion that were not improved for nearly three hundred years by early 20th century einstein developed a theory of relativity that correctly predicted action of forces on objects with increasing momenta near speed of light and also provided insight into forces produced by gravitation and inertia with modern insights into quantum mechanics and technology that can accelerate particles close to speed of light particle physics has devised a standard model to describe forces between particles smaller than atoms standard model predicts that exchanged particles called gauge bosons are fundamental means by which forces are emitted and absorbed only four main interactions are known in order of decreasing strength they are strong electromagnetic weak and gravitational high energy particle physics observations made during 1970s and 1980s confirmed that weak and electromagnetic forces are expressions of a more fundamental electroweak interaction pre newtonian concepts thumb right aristotle famously described a force as anything that causes an object to undergo unnatural motion since antiquity concept of force has been recognized as integral to functioning of each of simple machines mechanical advantage given by a simple machine allowed for less force to be used in exchange for that force acting over a greater distance for same amount of work analysis of characteristics of forces ultimately culminated in work of archimedes who was especially famous for formulating a treatment of buoyant forces inherent in fluids aristotle provided a philosophical discussion of concept of a force as an integral part of aristotelian cosmology in aristotle s view terrestrial sphere contained four elements that come to rest at different natural places therein aristotle believed that motionless objects on earth those composed mostly of elements earth and water to be in their natural place on ground and that they will stay that way if left alone he distinguished between innate tendency of objects to find their natural place e g for heavy bodies to fall which led to natural motion and unnatural or forced motion which required continued application of a force this theory based on everyday experience of how objects move such as constant application of a force needed to keep a cart moving had conceptual trouble accounting for behavior of projectiles such as flight of arrows place where archer moves projectile was at start of flight and while projectile sailed through air no discernible efficient cause acts on it aristotle was aware of this problem and proposed that air displaced through projectile s path carries projectile to its target this explanation demands a continuum like air for change of place in general aristotelian physics began facing criticism in medieval science first by john philoponus in 6th century shortcomings of aristotelian physics would not be fully corrected until 17th century work of galileo galilei who was influenced by late medieval idea that objects in forced motion carried an innate force of impetus galileo constructed an experiment in which stones and cannonballs were both rolled down an incline to disprove aristotelian theory of motion he showed that bodies were accelerated by gravity to an extent that was independent of their mass and argued that objects retain their velocity unless acted on by a force for example friction drake stillman 1978 galileo at work chicago university of chicago press newtonian mechanics sir isaac newton described motion of all objects using concepts of inertia and force and in doing so he found they obey certain conservation laws in 1687 newton published his thesis philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica this is a recent translation into english by i bernard cohen and anne whitman with help from julia in this work newton set out three laws of motion that to this day are way forces are described in physics first law newton s first law of motion states that objects continue to move in a state of constant velocity unless acted upon by an external net force resultant force this law is an extension of galileo s insight that constant velocity was associated with a lack of net force see a more detailed description of this below newton proposed that every object with mass has an innate inertia that functions as fundamental equilibrium natural state in place of aristotelian idea of natural state of rest that is newton s empirical first law contradicts intuitive aristotelian belief that a net force is required to keep an object moving with constant velocity by making rest physically indistinguishable from non zero constant velocity newton s first law directly connects inertia with concept of relative velocities specifically in systems where objects are moving with different velocities it is impossible to determine which object is in motion and which object is at rest laws of physics are same in every inertial frame of reference that is in all frames related by a galilean transformation for instance while traveling in a moving vehicle at a constant velocity laws of physics do not change as a result of its motion if a person riding within vehicle throws a ball straight up that person will observe it rise vertically and fall vertically and not have to apply a force in direction vehicle is moving another person observing moving vehicle pass by would observe ball follow a curving parabolic path in same direction as motion of vehicle it is inertia of ball associated with its constant velocity in direction of vehicle s motion that ensures ball continues to move forward even as it is thrown up and falls back down from perspective of person in car vehicle and everything inside of it is at rest it is outside world that is moving with a constant speed in opposite direction of vehicle since there is no experiment that can distinguish whether it is vehicle that is at rest or outside world that is at rest two situations are considered to be physically indistinguishable inertia therefore applies equally well to constant velocity motion as it does to rest right thumb though sir isaac newton s most famous equation is he actually wrote down a different form for his second law of motion that did not use differential calculus second law a modern statement of newton s second law is a vector equation newton s principia mathematica actually used a finite difference version of this equation based upon impulse see impulse where is momentum of system and is net vector sum force if a body is in equilibrium there is zero net force by definition balanced forces may be present nevertheless in contrast second law states that if there is an unbalanced force acting on an object it will result in object s momentum changing over time by definition of momentum where m is mass and is velocity if newton s second law is applied to a system of constant mass it is important to note that we cannot derive a general expression for newton s second law for variable mass systems by treating mass in f dp dt d mv as a variable we can use f dp dt to analyze variable mass systems only if we apply it to an entire system of constant mass having parts among which there is an interchange of mass emphasis as in original m may be moved outside derivative operator equation then becomes by substituting definition of acceleration algebraic version of newton s second law is derived newton never explicitly stated formula in reduced form above newton s second law asserts direct proportionality of acceleration to force and inverse proportionality of acceleration to mass accelerations can be defined through kinematic measurements however while kinematics are well described through reference frame analysis in advanced physics there are still deep questions that remain as to what is proper definition of mass general relativity offers an equivalence between space time and mass but lacking a coherent theory of quantum gravity it is unclear as to how or whether this connection is relevant on with some justification newton s second law can be taken as a quantitative definition of mass by writing law as an equality relative units of force and mass then are fixed use of newton s second law as a definition of force has been disparaged in some of more rigorous textbooks one exception to this rule is translated by j b sykes a d petford and c l petford in section 7 pp 12 14 this book defines force as dp dt because it is essentially a mathematical truism notable physicists philosophers and mathematicians who have sought a more explicit definition of concept of force include ernst mach and walter noll newton s second law can be used to measure strength of forces for instance knowledge of masses of planets along with accelerations of their orbits allows scientists to calculate gravitational forces on planets third law whenever one body exerts a force on another latter simultaneously exerts an equal and opposite force on first in vector form if is force of body 1 on body 2 and that of body 2 on body 1 then this law is sometimes referred to as action reaction law with called action and reaction newton s third law is a result of applying symmetry to situations where forces can be attributed to presence of different objects third law means that all forces are interactions between different bodies any single force is only one aspect of a mutual interaction between two bodies and thus that there is no such thing as a unidirectional force or a force that acts on only one body in a system composed of object 1 and object 2 net force on system due to their mutual interactions is zero more generally in a closed system of particles all internal forces are balanced particles may accelerate with respect to each other but center of mass of system will not accelerate if an external force acts on system it will make center of mass accelerate in proportion to magnitude of external force divided by mass of system combining newton s second and third laws it is possible to show that linear momentum of a system is conserved in a system of two particles if is momentum of object 1 and momentum of object 2 then using similar arguments this can be generalized to a system with an arbitrary number of particles in general as long as all forces are due to interaction of objects with mass it is possible to define a system such that net momentum is never lost nor gained special theory of relativity in special theory of relativity mass and energy are equivalent as can be seen by calculating work required to accelerate an object when an object s velocity increases so does its energy and hence its mass equivalent inertia it thus requires more force to accelerate it same amount than it did at a lower velocity newton s second law remains valid because it is a mathematical definition but for relativistic momentum to be conserved it must be redefined as where is rest mass and speed of light relativistic expression relating force and acceleration for a particle with constant non zero rest mass moving in direction is where is called lorentz factor in early history of relativity expressions and were called longitudinal and transverse mass relativistic force does not produce a constant acceleration but an ever decreasing acceleration as object approaches speed of light note that approaches asymptotically an infinite value and is undefined for an object with a non zero rest mass as it approaches speed of light and theory yields no prediction at that speed if is very small compared to then is very close to 1 and is a close approximation even for use in relativity however one can restore form of through use of four vectors this relation is correct in relativity when is four force is invariant mass and is four acceleration descriptions thumb right free body diagrams of a block on a flat surface and an inclined plane forces are resolved and added together to determine their magnitudes and net force since forces are perceived as pushes or pulls this can provide an intuitive understanding for describing forces as with other physical concepts e g temperature intuitive understanding of forces is quantified using precise operational definitions that are consistent with direct observations and compared to a standard measurement scale through experimentation it is determined that laboratory measurements of forces are fully consistent with conceptual definition of force offered by newtonian mechanics forces act in a particular direction and have sizes dependent upon how strong push or pull is because of these characteristics forces are classified as vector quantities this means that forces follow a different set of mathematical rules than physical quantities that do not have direction denoted scalar quantities for example when determining what happens when two forces act on same object it is necessary to know both magnitude and direction of both forces to calculate result if both of these pieces of information are not known for each force situation is ambiguous for example if you know that two people are pulling on same rope with known magnitudes of force but you do not know which direction either person is pulling it is impossible to determine what acceleration of rope will be two people could be pulling against each other as in tug of war or two people could be pulling in same direction in this simple one dimensional example without knowing direction of forces it is impossible to decide whether net force is result of adding two force magnitudes or subtracting one from other associating forces with vectors avoids such problems historically forces were first quantitatively investigated in conditions of static equilibrium where several forces canceled each other out such experiments demonstrate crucial properties that forces are additive vector quantities they have magnitude and direction when two forces act on a point particle resulting force resultant also called net force can be determined by following parallelogram rule of vector addition addition of two vectors represented by sides of a parallelogram gives an equivalent resultant vector that is equal in magnitude and direction to transversal of parallelogram magnitude of resultant varies from difference of magnitudes of two forces to their sum depending on angle between their lines of action however if forces are acting on an extended body their respective lines of application must also be specified in order to account for their effects on motion of body free body diagrams can be used as a convenient way to keep track of forces acting on a system ideally these diagrams are drawn with angles and relative magnitudes of force vectors preserved so that graphical vector addition can be done to determine net force as well as being added forces can also be resolved into independent components at right angles to each other a horizontal force pointing northeast can therefore be split into two forces one pointing north and one pointing east summing these component forces using vector addition yields original force resolving force vectors into components of a set of basis vectors is often a more mathematically clean way to describe forces than using magnitudes and directions this is because for orthogonal components components of vector sum are uniquely determined by scalar addition of components of individual vectors orthogonal components are independent of each other because forces acting at ninety degrees to each other have no effect on magnitude or direction of other choosing a set of orthogonal basis vectors is often done by considering what set of basis vectors will make mathematics most convenient choosing a basis vector that is in same direction as one of forces is desirable since that force would then have only one non zero component orthogonal force vectors can be three dimensional with third component being at right angles to other two equilibrium equilibrium occurs when resultant force acting on a point particle is zero that is vector sum of all forces is zero when dealing with an extended body it is also necessary that net torque be zero there are two kinds of equilibrium static equilibrium and dynamic equilibrium static static equilibrium was understood well before invention of classical mechanics objects that are at rest have zero net force acting on them simplest case of static equilibrium occurs when two forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction for example an object on a level surface is pulled attracted downward toward center of earth by force of gravity at same time a force is applied by surface that resists downward force with equal upward force called a normal force situation produces zero net force and hence no acceleration pushing against an object that rests on a frictional surface can result in a situation where object does not move because applied force is opposed by static friction generated between object and table surface for a situation with no movement static friction force exactly balances applied force resulting in no acceleration static friction increases or decreases in response to applied force up to an upper limit determined by characteristics of contact between surface and object a static equilibrium between two forces is most usual way of measuring forces using simple devices such as weighing scales and spring balances for example an object suspended on a vertical spring scale experiences force of gravity acting on object balanced by a force applied by spring reaction force which equals object s weight using such tools some quantitative force laws were discovered that force of gravity is proportional to volume for objects of constant density widely exploited for millennia to define standard weights archimedes principle for buoyancy archimedes analysis of lever boyle s law for gas pressure and hooke s law for springs these were all formulated and experimentally verified before isaac newton expounded his three laws of motion dynamic thumb galileo galilei was first to point out inherent contradictions contained in aristotle s description of forces dynamic equilibrium was first described by galileo who noticed that certain assumptions of aristotelian physics were contradicted by observations and logic galileo realized that simple velocity addition demands that concept of an absolute rest frame did not exist galileo concluded that motion in a constant velocity was completely equivalent to rest this was contrary to aristotle s notion of a natural state of rest that objects with mass naturally approached simple experiments showed that galileo s understanding of equivalence of constant velocity and rest were correct for example if a mariner dropped a cannonball from crow s nest of a ship moving at a constant velocity aristotelian physics would have cannonball fall straight down while ship moved beneath it thus in an aristotelian universe falling cannonball would land behind foot of mast of a moving ship however when this experiment is actually conducted cannonball always falls at foot of mast as if cannonball knows to travel with ship despite being separated from it since there is no forward horizontal force being applied on cannonball as it falls only conclusion left is that cannonball continues to move with same velocity as boat as it falls thus no force is required to keep cannonball moving at constant forward velocity moreover any object traveling at a constant velocity must be subject to zero net force resultant force this is definition of dynamic equilibrium when all forces on an object balance but it still moves at a constant velocity a simple case of dynamic equilibrium occurs in constant velocity motion across a surface with kinetic friction in such a situation a force is applied in direction of motion while kinetic friction force exactly opposes applied force this results in zero net force but since object started with a non zero velocity it continues to move with a non zero velocity aristotle misinterpreted this motion as being caused by applied force however when kinetic friction is taken into consideration it is clear that there is no net force causing constant velocity motion forces in quantum mechanics notion force keeps its meaning in quantum mechanics though one is now dealing with operators instead of classical variables and though physics is now described by schrodinger equation instead of newtonian equations this has consequence that results of a measurement are now sometimes quantized i e they appear in discrete portions this is of course difficult to imagine in context of forces however potentials v x y z or fields from which forces generally can be derived are treated similarly to classical position variables i e this becomes different only in framework of quantum field theory where these fields are also quantized however already in quantum mechanics there is one caveat namely particles acting onto each other do not only possess spatial variable but also a discrete intrinsic angular momentum like variable called spin and there is pauli exclusion principle relating space and spin variables depending on value of spin identical particles split into two different classes fermions and bosons if two identical fermions e g electrons have a symmetric spin function e g parallel spins spatial variables must be antisymmetric i e they exclude each other from their places much as if there was a repulsive force and vice versa i e for antiparallel spins position variables must be symmetric i e apparent force must be attractive thus in case of two fermions there is a strictly negative correlation between spatial and spin variables whereas for two bosons e g quanta of electromagnetic waves photons correlation is strictly positive thus notion force loses already part of its meaning feynman diagrams thumb right feynman diagram for decay of a neutron into a proton w boson is between two vertices indicating a repulsion in modern particle physics forces and acceleration of particles are explained as a mathematical by product of exchange of momentum carrying gauge bosons with development of quantum field theory and general relativity it was realized that force is a redundant concept arising from conservation of momentum 4 momentum in relativity and momentum of virtual particles in quantum electrodynamics conservation of momentum can be directly derived from homogeneity or symmetry of space and so is usually considered more fundamental than concept of a force thus currently known fundamental forces are considered more accurately to be fundamental interactions when particle a emits creates or absorbs annihilates virtual particle b a momentum conservation results in recoil of particle a making impression of repulsion or attraction between particles a a exchanging by b this description applies to all forces arising from fundamental interactions while sophisticated mathematical descriptions are needed to predict in full detail accurate result of such interactions there is a conceptually simple way to describe such interactions through use of feynman diagrams in a feynman diagram each matter particle is represented as a straight line see world line traveling through time which normally increases up or to right in diagram matter and anti matter particles are identical except for their direction of propagation through feynman diagram world lines of particles intersect at interaction vertices and feynman diagram represents any force arising from an interaction as occurring at vertex with an associated instantaneous change in direction of particle world lines gauge bosons are emitted away from vertex as wavy lines and in case of virtual particle exchange are absorbed at an adjacent vertex utility of feynman diagrams is that other types of physical phenomena that are part of general picture of fundamental interactions but are conceptually separate from forces can also be described using same rules for example a feynman diagram can describe in succinct detail how a neutron decays into an electron proton and neutrino an interaction mediated by same gauge boson that is responsible for weak nuclear force fundamental forces all of known forces of universe are classified into four fundamental interactions strong and weak forces are nuclear forces that act only at very short distances and are responsible for interactions between subatomic particles including nucleons and compound nuclei electromagnetic force acts between electric charges and gravitational force acts between masses all other forces in nature derive from these four fundamental interactions for example friction is a manifestation of electromagnetic force acting between atoms of two surfaces and pauli exclusion principle which does not permit atoms to pass through each other similarly forces in springs modeled by hooke s law are result of electromagnetic forces and pauli exclusion principle acting together to return an object to its equilibrium position centrifugal forces are acceleration forces that arise simply from acceleration of rotating frames of reference fundamental theories for forces developed from unification of different ideas for example sir isaac newton unified with his universal theory of gravitation force responsible for objects falling near surface of earth with force responsible for falling of celestial bodies about earth moon and around sun planets michael faraday and james clerk maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic forces were unified through a theory of electromagnetism in 20th century development of quantum mechanics led to a modern understanding that first three fundamental forces all except gravity are manifestations of matter fermions interacting by exchanging virtual particles called gauge bosons this standard model of particle physics assumes a similarity between forces and led scientists to predict unification of weak and electromagnetic forces in electroweak theory which was subsequently confirmed by observation complete formulation of standard model predicts an as yet unobserved higgs mechanism but observations such as neutrino oscillations suggest that standard model is incomplete a grand unified theory that allows for combination of electroweak interaction with strong force is held out as a possibility with candidate theories such as supersymmetry proposed to accommodate some of outstanding unsolved problems in physics physicists are still attempting to develop self consistent unification models that would combine all four fundamental interactions into a theory of everything einstein tried and failed at this endeavor but currently most popular approach to answering this question is string theory four fundamental forces of nature property electroweak on mass experiencing mediating graviton not yet observed w w in scale of quarks applicable to in scale of protons neutrons 1not applicable to gravitational upright thumb images of a freely falling basketball taken with a at 20 flashes per second distance units on right are multiples of about 12 millimeters basketball starts at rest at time of first flash distance zero it is released after which number of units fallen is equal to square of number of flashes what we now call gravity was not identified as a universal force until work of isaac newton before newton tendency for objects to fall towards earth was not understood to be related to motions of celestial objects galileo was instrumental in describing characteristics of falling objects by determining that acceleration of every object in free fall was constant and independent of mass of object today this acceleration due to gravity towards surface of earth is usually designated as and has a magnitude of about 9 81 meters per second squared this measurement is taken from sea level and may vary depending on location and points toward center of earth this observation means that force of gravity on an object at earth s surface is directly proportional to object s mass thus an object that has a mass of will experience a force for an object in free fall this force is unopposed and net force on object is its weight for objects not in free fall force of gravity is opposed by reaction forces applied by their supports for example a person standing on ground experiences zero net force since a normal force a reaction force is exerted by ground upward on person that counterbalances his weight that is directed downward newton s contribution to gravitational theory was to unify motions of heavenly bodies which aristotle had assumed were in a natural state of constant motion with falling motion observed on earth he proposed a law of gravity that could account for celestial motions that had been described earlier using kepler s laws of planetary motion newton came to realize that effects of gravity might be observed in different ways at larger distances in particular newton determined that acceleration of moon around earth could be ascribed to same force of gravity if acceleration due to gravity decreased as an inverse square law further newton realized that acceleration of a body due to gravity is proportional to mass of other attracting body combining these ideas gives a formula that relates mass and radius of earth to gravitational acceleration where vector direction is given by is unit vector directed outward from center of earth in this equation a dimensional constant is used to describe relative strength of gravity this constant has come to be known as newton s universal gravitation constant though its value was unknown in newton s lifetime not until 1798 was henry cavendish able to make first measurement of using a torsion balance this was widely reported in press as a measurement of mass of earth since knowing could allow one to solve for earth s mass given above equation newton however realized that since all celestial bodies followed same laws of motion his law of gravity had to be universal succinctly stated newton s law of gravitation states that force on a spherical object of mass due to gravitational pull of mass is where is distance between two objects centers of mass and is unit vector pointed in direction away from center of first object toward center of second object this formula was powerful enough to stand as basis for all subsequent descriptions of motion within solar system until 20th century during that time sophisticated methods of perturbation analysis were invented to calculate deviations of orbits due to influence of multiple bodies on a planet moon comet or asteroid formalism was exact enough to allow mathematicians to predict existence of planet neptune before it was observed thumb instruments like gravity provide a powerful probe for gravity force detection mercury s orbit however did not match that predicted by newton s law of gravitation some astrophysicists predicted existence of another planet vulcan that would explain discrepancies however no such planet could be found when albert einstein formulated his theory of general relativity gr he turned his attention to problem of mercury s orbit and found that his theory added a correction which could account for discrepancy this was first time that newton s theory of gravity had been shown to be inexact since then general relativity has been acknowledged as theory that best explains gravity in gr gravitation is not viewed as a force but rather objects moving freely in gravitational fields travel under their own inertia in straight lines through curved space time defined as shortest space time path between two space time events from perspective of object all motion occurs as if there were no gravitation whatsoever it is only when observing motion in a global sense that curvature of space time can be observed and force is inferred from object s curved path thus straight line path in space time is seen as a curved line in space and it is called ballistic trajectory of object for example a basketball thrown from ground moves in a parabola as it is in a uniform gravitational field its space time trajectory is almost a straight line slightly curved with radius of curvature of order of few light years time derivative of changing momentum of object is what we label as gravitational force electromagnetic electrostatic force was first described in 1784 by coulomb as a force that existed intrinsically between two charges properties of electrostatic force were that it varied as an inverse square law directed in radial direction was both attractive and repulsive there was intrinsic polarity was independent of mass of charged objects and followed superposition principle coulomb s law unifies all these observations into one succinct statement subsequent mathematicians and physicists found construct of electric field to be useful for determining electrostatic force on an electric charge at any point in space electric field was based on using a hypothetical test charge anywhere in space and then using coulomb s law to determine electrostatic force thus electric field anywhere in space is defined as where is magnitude of hypothetical test charge meanwhile lorentz force of magnetism was discovered to exist between two electric currents it has same mathematical character as coulomb s law with proviso that like currents attract and unlike currents repel similar to electric field magnetic field can be used to determine magnetic force on an electric current at any point in space in this case magnitude of magnetic field was determined to be where is magnitude of hypothetical test current and is length of hypothetical wire through which test current flows magnetic field exerts a force on all magnets including for example those used in compasses fact that earth s magnetic field is aligned closely with orientation of earth s axis causes compass magnets to become oriented because of magnetic force pulling on needle through combining definition of electric current as time rate of change of electric charge a rule of vector multiplication called lorentz s law describes force on a charge moving in a magnetic field connection between electricity and magnetism allows for description of a unified electromagnetic force that acts on a charge this force can be written as a sum of electrostatic force due to electric field and magnetic force due to magnetic field fully stated this is law where is electromagnetic force is magnitude of charge of particle is electric field is velocity of particle that is crossed with magnetic field origin of electric and magnetic fields would not be fully explained until 1864 when james clerk maxwell unified a number of earlier theories into a set of 20 scalar equations which were later reformulated into 4 vector equations by oliver heaviside and josiah willard gibbs chapter 2 p 19 these maxwell equations fully described sources of fields as being stationary and moving charges and interactions of fields themselves this led maxwell to discover that electric and magnetic fields could be self generating through a wave that traveled at a speed that he calculated to be speed of light this insight united nascent fields of electromagnetic theory with optics and led directly to a complete description of electromagnetic spectrum however attempting to reconcile electromagnetic theory with two observations photoelectric effect and nonexistence of ultraviolet catastrophe proved troublesome through work of leading theoretical physicists a new theory of electromagnetism was developed using quantum mechanics this final modification to electromagnetic theory ultimately led to quantum electrodynamics or qed which fully describes all electromagnetic phenomena as being mediated by wave particles known as photons in qed photons are fundamental exchange particle which described all interactions relating to electromagnetism including electromagnetic force for a complete library on quantum mechanics see quantum mechanics references strong nuclear there are two nuclear forces which today are usually described as interactions that take place in quantum theories of particle physics strong nuclear force is force responsible for structural integrity of atomic nuclei while weak nuclear force is responsible for decay of certain nucleons into leptons and other types of hadrons strong force is today understood to represent interactions between quarks and gluons as detailed by theory of quantum chromodynamics strong force is fundamental force mediated by gluons acting upon quarks and gluons themselves aptly named strong interaction is strongest of four fundamental forces strong force only acts directly upon elementary particles however a residual of force is observed between hadrons best known example being force that acts between nucleons in atomic nuclei as nuclear force here strong force acts indirectly transmitted as gluons which form part of virtual pi and rho mesons which classically transmit nuclear force see this topic for more failure of many searches for free quarks has shown that elementary particles affected are not directly observable this phenomenon is called color confinement weak nuclear weak force is due to exchange of heavy w and z bosons its most familiar effect is beta decay of neutrons in atomic nuclei and associated radioactivity word weak derives from fact that field strength is some 1013 times less than that of strong force still it is stronger than gravity over short distances a consistent electroweak theory has also been developed which shows that electromagnetic forces and weak force are indistinguishable at a temperatures in excess of approximately 1015 kelvins such temperatures have been probed in modern particle accelerators and show conditions of universe in early moments of big bang non fundamental forces some forces are consequences of fundamental ones in such situations idealized models can be utilized to gain physical insight normal force right thumb fn represents normal force exerted on object normal force is due to repulsive forces of interaction between atoms at close contact when their electron clouds overlap pauli repulsion due to nature of electrons follows resulting in force that acts in a direction normal to surface interface between two objects normal force for example is responsible for structural integrity of tables and floors as well as being force that responds whenever an external force pushes on a solid object an example of normal force in action is impact force on an object crashing into an immobile surface friction friction is a surface force that opposes relative motion frictional force is directly related to normal force that acts to keep two solid objects separated at point of contact there are two broad classifications of frictional forces static friction and kinetic friction static friction force will exactly oppose forces applied to an object parallel to a surface contact up to limit specified by coefficient of static friction multiplied by normal force in other words magnitude of static friction force satisfies inequality kinetic friction force is independent of both forces applied and movement of object thus magnitude of force equals where is coefficient of kinetic friction for most surface interfaces coefficient of kinetic friction is less than coefficient of static friction tension tension forces can be modeled using ideal strings that are massless frictionless unbreakable and they can be combined with ideal pulleys which allow ideal strings to switch physical direction ideal strings transmit tension forces instantaneously in action reaction pairs so that if two objects are connected by an ideal string any force directed along string by first object is accompanied by a force directed along string in opposite direction by second object by connecting same string multiple times to same object through use of a set up that uses movable pulleys tension force on a load can be multiplied for every string that acts on a load another factor of tension force in string acts on load however even though such machines allow for an increase in force there is a corresponding increase in length of string that must be displaced in order to move load these tandem effects result ultimately in conservation of mechanical energy since work done on load is same no matter how complicated machine elastic force upright thumb fk is force that responds to load on spring an elastic force acts to return a spring to its natural length an ideal spring is taken to be massless frictionless unbreakable and infinitely such springs exert forces that push when contracted or pull when extended in proportion to displacement of spring from its equilibrium position this linear relationship was described by robert hooke in 1676 for whom hooke s law is named if is displacement force exerted by an ideal spring equals where is spring constant or force constant which is particular to spring minus sign accounts for tendency of force to act in opposition to applied load continuum mechanics thumb upright when drag force associated with air resistance becomes equal in magnitude to force of gravity on a falling object object reaches a state of dynamic equilibrium at terminal velocity newton s laws and newtonian mechanics in general were first developed to describe how forces affect idealized point particles rather than three dimensional objects however in real life matter has extended structure and forces that act on one part of an object might affect other parts of an object for situations where lattice holding together atoms in an object is able to flow contract expand or otherwise change shape theories of continuum mechanics describe way forces affect material for example in extended fluids differences in pressure result in forces being directed along pressure gradients as follows where is volume of object in fluid and is scalar function that describes pressure at all locations in space pressure gradients and result in buoyant force for fluids suspended in gravitational fields winds in atmospheric science and lift associated with aerodynamics and flight a specific instance of such a force that is associated with dynamic pressure is fluid resistance a body force that resists motion of an object through a fluid due to viscosity for so called stokes drag force is approximately proportional to velocity but opposite in direction where is a constant that depends on properties of fluid and dimensions of object usually cross sectional area and is velocity of object more formally forces in continuum mechanics are fully described by a stress tensor with terms that are roughly defined as where is relevant cross sectional area for volume for which stress tensor is being calculated this formalism includes pressure terms associated with forces that act normal to cross sectional area matrix diagonals of tensor as well as shear terms associated with forces that act parallel to cross sectional area off diagonal elements stress tensor accounts for forces that cause all strains deformations including also tensile stresses and compressions university physics sears young pp 18 38 fictitious forces there are forces that are frame dependent meaning that they appear due to adoption of non newtonian that is non inertial reference frames such forces include centrifugal force and coriolis force these forces are considered fictitious because they do not exist in frames of reference that are not accelerating because these forces are not genuine they are also referred to as pseudo forces in general relativity gravity becomes a fictitious force that arises in situations where spacetime deviates from a flat geometry as an extension kaluza klein theory and string theory ascribe electromagnetism and other fundamental forces respectively to curvature of differently scaled dimensions which would ultimately imply that all forces are fictitious rotations and torque frame right relationship between force f torque t and momentum vectors p and l in a rotating system forces that cause extended objects to rotate are associated with torques mathematically torque of a force is defined relative to an arbitrary reference point as cross product where is position vector of force application point relative to reference point torque is rotation equivalent of force in same way that angle is rotational equivalent for position angular velocity for velocity and angular momentum for momentum as a consequence of newton s first law of motion there exists rotational inertia that ensures that all bodies maintain their angular momentum unless acted upon by an unbalanced torque likewise newton s second law of motion can be used to derive an analogous equation for instantaneous angular acceleration of rigid body where is moment of inertia of body is angular acceleration of body this provides a definition for moment of inertia which is rotational equivalent for mass in more advanced treatments of mechanics where rotation over a time interval is described moment of inertia must be substituted by tensor that when properly analyzed fully determines characteristics of rotations including precession and equivalently differential form of newton s second law provides an alternative definition of torque where is angular momentum of particle newton s third law of motion requires that all objects exerting torques themselves experience equal and opposite torques and therefore also directly implies conservation of angular momentum for closed systems that experience rotations and revolutions through action of internal torques centripetal force for an object accelerating in circular motion unbalanced force acting on object equals where is mass of object is velocity of object and is distance to center of circular path and is unit vector pointing in radial direction outwards from center this means that unbalanced centripetal force felt by any object is always directed toward center of curving path such forces act perpendicular to velocity vector associated with motion of an object and therefore do not change speed of object magnitude of velocity but only direction of velocity vector unbalanced force that accelerates an object can be resolved into a component that is perpendicular to path and one that is tangential to path this yields both tangential force which accelerates object by either slowing it down or speeding it up and radial centripetal force which changes its direction kinematic integrals forces can be used to define a number of physical concepts by integrating with respect to kinematic variables for example integrating with respect to time gives definition of impulse which by newton s second law must be equivalent to change in momentum yielding impulse momentum theorem similarly integrating with respect to position gives a definition for work done by a force which is equivalent to changes in kinetic energy yielding work energy theorem power p is rate of change dw dt of work w as trajectory is extended by a position change in a time interval dt with velocity potential energy instead of a force often mathematically related concept of a potential energy field can be used for convenience for instance gravitational force acting upon an object can be seen as action of gravitational field that is present at object s location restating mathematically definition of energy via definition of work a potential scalar field is defined as that field whose gradient is equal and opposite to force produced at every point forces can be classified as conservative or nonconservative conservative forces are equivalent to gradient of a potential while nonconservative forces are not conservative forces a conservative force that acts on a closed system has an associated mechanical work that allows energy to convert only between kinetic or potential forms this means that for a closed system net mechanical energy is conserved whenever a conservative force acts on system force therefore is related directly to difference in potential energy between two different locations in space and can be considered to be an artifact of potential field in same way that direction and amount of a flow of water can be considered to be an artifact of contour map of elevation of an area conservative forces include gravity electromagnetic force and spring force each of these forces has models that are dependent on a position often given as a radial vector emanating from spherically symmetric potentials examples of this follow for gravity where is gravitational constant and is mass of object n for electrostatic forces where is electric permittivity of free space and is electric charge of object n for spring forces where is spring constant nonconservative forces for certain physical scenarios it is impossible to model forces as being due to gradient of potentials this is often due to considerations that yield forces as arising from a macroscopic statistical average of microstates for example friction is caused by gradients of numerous electrostatic potentials between atoms but manifests as a force model that is independent of any position vector nonconservative forces other than friction include other contact forces tension compression and drag however for any sufficiently detailed description all these forces are results of conservative ones since each of these macroscopic forces are net results of gradients of microscopic potentials connection between macroscopic nonconservative forces and microscopic conservative forces is described by detailed treatment with statistical mechanics in macroscopic closed systems nonconservative forces act to change internal energies of system and are often associated with transfer of heat according to second law of thermodynamics nonconservative forces necessarily result in energy transformations within closed systems from ordered to more random conditions as entropy increases units of measurement si unit of force is newton symbol n which is force required to accelerate a one kilogram mass at a rate of one meter per second squared or corresponding cgs unit is dyne force required to accelerate a one gram mass by one centimeter per second squared or a newton is thus equal to 100 000 dynes gravitational foot pound second english unit of force is pound force lbf defined as force exerted by gravity on a pound mass in standard gravitational field of pound force provides an alternative unit of mass one slug is mass that will accelerate by one foot per second squared when acted on by one pound force an alternative unit of force in a different foot pound second system absolute fps system is poundal defined as force required to accelerate a one pound mass at a rate of one foot per second squared units of slug and poundal are designed to avoid a constant of proportionality in newton s second law pound force has a metric counterpart less commonly used than newton kilogram force kgf sometimes kilopond is force exerted by standard gravity on one kilogram of mass kilogram force leads to an alternate but rarely used unit of mass metric slug sometimes mug or hyl is that mass that accelerates at when subjected to a force of 1 kgf kilogram force is not a part of modern si system and is generally deprecated however it still sees use for some purposes as expressing aircraft weight jet thrust bicycle spoke tension torque wrench settings and engine output torque other arcane units of force include sthene which is equivalent to 1000 n and kip which is
