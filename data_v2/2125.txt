who s that girl world tour was second concert tour by american singer and songwriter madonna tour supported her 1986 third studio album true blue as well as 1987 soundtrack who s that girl it was madonna s first world tour reaching asia north america and europe musically and technically superior to her previous initiative who s that girl tour incorporated multimedia components to make show more appealing madonna trained physically doing aerobics jogging and weight lifting to cope with choreography and dance routines for costumes she collaborated with designer marlene stewart expanding on idea of bringing her popular video characters to life onstage reworking scenes from her music videos stage had four video screens multimedia projectors and a flight of stairs in middle patrick leonard who was music director encouraged madonna to go with idea of remixing and presenting her older songs for show title who s that girl came to madonna s mind when during rehearsals one day when she looked at a gigantic image of herself projected on a screen on stage show consisted of seven costume changes with song and dance routines theatrics and addressing social causes tour was critically appreciated with reviewers commending extravagant nature of concert and madonna as a performer it was a commercial success grossing in total of us 25 million million in dollars by playing in front of 1 5 million audience according to pollstar it was second highest grossing female concert tour of 1987 behind tina turner s break every rule tour who s that girl was broadcast in a number of international television channels and was released in vhs titled ciao italia live from italy biographer j randy taraborrelli commented that many female artists behave like a diva for a period when they reach superstar status and who s that girl tour marked beginning of madonna s it is also noted for giving rise to term new madonna a stronger and more intelligent sexual image of her former self which had given rise to term madonna wannabe a statue of madonna wearing a conical bra was erected in her name at center of town of pacentro in italy where her ancestors used to live background madonna s 1987 film who s that girl was a box office failure however soundtrack of film proved to be a big success album consisted of four madonna songs along with tracks by obscure warner bros records acts including club nouveau scritti politti and michael davidson three of madonna s songs were released as singles namely who s that girl causing a commotion and look of love all of them were successful album sold a million copies in united states and five million worldwide taraborrelli felt that at that moment riding on madonna s coattails proved profitable for everyone involved including warner bros records which notched up big sales with a compilation soundtrack album that was basically a showcase for its marginal artists but still they wanted to milk in success of madonna a view shared by peter guber and jon peters executive producers of film hence they felt a worldwide concert tour was appropriate thing to do since it would promote both soundtrack and film as well as madonna s successful third studio album true blue released year before as madonna s first world tour who s that girl ended up being a resounding success although by its end madonna declared that she did not want to hear any of her songs again and she did not know whether she would ever write another one i returned feeling so burned out and i was convinced that i wouldn t go near music for quite a while she said development thumb right british funk band level 42 joined madonna as supporting opening act for tour who s that girl world tour was musically and technically superior to madonna s virgin tour because she incorporated multimedia components to make show more compelling as tour was confirmed madonna and her team started planning for it madonna wanted a show which consisted of theatrics drama dance and choreography in full force her publicist liz rosenberg commented she wants a visual impact that would knock people out she was very determined about this and she s type that makes decisions quickly if something doesn t work she starts over you ll see a different look this year but it s still madonna still bigger than life in order to engage herself completely and handle grueling dance routines she started attending aerobics classes at hollywood health centre sports connection by time tour drew nearer she hired a personal trainer and her daily routine involved jogging weight lifting dancing gymnastics trampoline swimming and cycling she started eating vegetarian food with plenty of protein and carbohydrate and avoided sun british funk band level 42 was supporting act of tour madonna s image was that of a blond girl with soft curls making a striking contrast with firm almost hard lines of her eye make up and lipstick idea of her friend actress debi mazar for costumes madonna collaborated with designer marlene stewart she expanded on idea of bringing her popular video characters to life onstage reworking scenes from true blue open your heart papa don t preach and la isla bonita for open your heart madonna reused stewart designed black bustier worn by her in video complete with tassels golden tips and ribbing with fishnets on leg stewart s other designs included a flamenco style dress for la isla bonita and a gold lame jacket for white heat sequence on medley sequence madonna used a dress that was visually amusing and according to madonna was for anyone that takes me too seriously or imagined and i take myself too seriously inspired by dame edna everage dress consisted of a hat strewn with fake fruits flowers and feathers jeweled batwing spectacles with heavy black frames a ruffled skirt and a bodice covered with objects such as watches and dolls and fishnets knickers were inscribed with word kiss continuing her tradition of message clothes she spelt out phrase you can dance on her jacket using letter u a can of soup and word dance at back calling show a theatrical multimedia spectacular madonna wanted a huge stage with a central platform from which a flight of stairs descended central platform was flanked by two lower platforms which housed band and musicians a large video screen was suspended above stairs which descended during show two projectors were situated at front of stage which projected images of pope and president ronald reagan during show patrick leonard who had produced true blue joined as musical director for shows instead of following every note on records leonard encouraged musicians to come up with new ideas for songs hence a number of old songs were rearranged including introducing a medley of dress you up material girl and like a virgin which contained a sample from four tops song i can t help myself sugar pie honey bunch american choreographer shabba doo was signed to choreograph show 13 year old christopher finch was signed to play part of small boy from open your heart video since felix howard who played original part did not get a working license and hence could not join tour madonna wanted three backup singers a team of male dancers and a succession of costume changes she took inputs from her then husband actor sean penn saying i really respect sean s opinion he has great taste and is a very brilliant man when i was putting my tour together it was always in back of my mind i wonder what sean will think of this he s extremely opinionated and has really high standards and that sometimes pushed me into making decisions i wouldn t have otherwise made title who s that girl tour came to madonna s mind during rehearsals one day when she looked at a gigantic image of herself projected on a screen on stage she commented oh god what have i done what have i created is that me or is this me this small person standing down here on stage that s why i call tour who s that girl because i play a lot of characters and every time i do a video or a song people go oh that s what she s like and i m not like any of them i m all of them i m none of them you know what i mean concert synopsis show started with a performance by level 42 as their performance ended lights started blinking all around stadium and finch appears on stage looking for madonna he is followed by two other dancers who jump around stage and disappear then madonna s silhouette is visible behind a screen which has paintings by tamara de lempicka on it she performs dance moves behind screen which starts going up slowly she wore a black pointy corset and fishnets like costume in music video of open your heart after dancing on stairs using a chair as a prop madonna descends and starts singing song later finch joins her again and they dance together till song ends this was followed by performance of lucky star during which a disco ball spun above stage as madonna and her dancers moved around it light from ball on them like a star for true blue madonna came up on stage wearing a blue silk taffeta dress over her corset and a blue scarf hidden in her bosom stage had a similar blue setting like original music video madonna is backed up by her singers who play her girlfriends at end of song madonna is asked to dance again by dancer playing her man in performance during papa don t preach madonna wore a black leather jacket over her dress and walked around stage while singing screen in background showed portraits of pope john paul ii and then president of u s ronald reagan along with scenes of john perry iii s short film nightmare ending with words safe sex as madonna finished song she dedicated song to pope marking her first conflict with vatican as pope john paul ii urged italian fans to boycott her concerts during white heat which featured dialogues from 1949 james cagney film of same name a video screen displayed a scene from film with cagney saying dialogue a copper a copper fellas video screen moves up and madonna appears wearing a lame jacket and holding a plastic gun in her right hand a large cut out of cagney appears in middle and madonna finishes singing song while pointing revolver towards her dancers and pretending to fire at them as sounds of gunshots are heard she followed it with causing a commotion which ended with madonna pointing to her dancers and musicians across stage and uttering line he she s got moves baby numerous times for look of love spotlight was focused on her introductory music of song started and madonna roamed around stage pretending that she was lost she wanted to portray her who s that girl film character nikki when she was lost in a similar sequence in film after she finished singing song madonna pretended to walk forward by pushing through air as conveyor belt took her backwards ultimately taking her away from stage then a red phone booth appears on stage in which madonna s silhouette appears to be changing costume she emerges from booth wearing edna everage inspired costume and starts singing dress you up then she sang material girl while stretching her legs on stage and showing her underwear and followed by like a virgin during which she took off her outfit piece by piece until she was standing in same outfit from beginning of show and ended performance while flirting with a young male dancer who played her bridegroom a backdrop then started showing newspaper reports on madonna s 1985 playboy nude picture release backdrop moves up as madonna appears wearing a loose fitted black pant and top with bejeweled glasses for singing where s party for into groove finch joins her on stage to dance alongside madonna then wore a pink bolero jacket which had can of soup and words u and dance flanking it at end she is joined by her backup singers and dancers together they take a bow to audience and finish performance next madonna sang la isla bonita as a part of encore wearing same red flamenco dress she had worn in video for who s that girl madonna flanked by finch and a male dancer strutted around stage asking audience to join her on chorus lastly madonna performed an energetic version of holiday signaling celebratory and wholesome nature of song s theme song featured a new arrangement with a guitar solo in intermediate portion added by leonard she sang final chorus twice then asked audience for a comb so that she could fix her hair and finished performance after taking a bow with her dancers to audience critical reception biographer taraborrelli commented madonna had more confidence in her stage presence her music was showing a deeper maturity her voice was fuller and show was expertly choreographed with complex numbers j d considine from baltimore sun commented i ve seen springsteen stadium tour i ve seen dylan and grateful dead and i was at live aid out of all those shows madonna s is only one i want to see again you need a larger than life show if you want to come off in a stadium and madonna does she s not that large physically but she holds your attention ann ayers assistant entertainment editor of usa today felt that show was high on glitz and low on emotional quotient madonna s going for a certain kind of show a broadway show biz song and dance spectacle in that context it s hard to make a connection with audience and i d have to say that she didn t peter goddard from toronto star reviewed concert in stadium and said madonna proved that she may be a lost girl in roads of life like her film but she ain t lost when she is singing especially during songs like papa don t preach her vocal prowess was substantially notable scott a and elizabeth snead writing for chicago tribune felt that for most part premiere concert on madonna s who s that girl tour was a success an extravaganza of multiple videos flashing lights and precision dancing if high tech accoutrements and inferior sound system made it difficult to hear singer one hopes that will be refined as tour continues across united states as a dancer madonna is supreme on stage her trademark skip to a funky beat highlighted constant acrobatics one minute she was stage left another minute stage right she ran up a wide staircase center stage to party with her three back up singers then down to stage floor swinging her hips accompanied by other dancers deborah wilker from day commented that madonna s got an almost rabid energy about her which she maintains for duration of 90 minutes in fact she rarely leaves stage preferring to change costumes in a phone booth instead boy can she change one minute she s a 50 s teenager in a party dress next she s playing a speak easy chanteuse it s almost difficult to believe that a career as young as madonna s could contain so much popular material that on stage star can barely get to half of it don mcleese from chicago sun times reviewed performance at soldier field stadium said that shine seems like a dim possibility for her soldier field performance this month because madonna invariably takes stage after dusk has turned to dark and brings back sun again for two hours that she played in another review commented madonna proceeded to show soldier field a few moves that would gain walter payton some yardage while putting a whole new twist on term backfield in motion girl really knows how to cause a commotion richard harrington from washington post felt that tour would have played better to a full house at capital centre or merriweather post pavilion but to her credit madonna performed last night as if house was full and show is splendid pop theater madonna has described it as broadway in a stadium and with her nonstop dancing costume changes mini dramas and dynamic pacing it is sort of a liza with an m jon pareles from new york times reviewed concert at madison square garden in new york and felt that for all its effort and professionalism concert wasn t exactly moving madonna had to ask audience to get up and dance twice but as shallow kitschy pop entertainment no big messages no revelations familiar sounds and images plenty of catchy tunes show was easy to enjoy tunes stick to her limited vocal range and usually use short phrases better to keep her from running out of breath as she dances across stage and her band knocked songs out with solid precision recreating gleaming sound of her records commercial response thumb left stage as visible during tour after tour was announced first two shows at wembley stadium in london sold out at a then record breaking time of 18 hours and 9 minutes for 144 000 tickets however around 10 000 concert tickets were still left unsold for her leeds concert madonna s concert in paris in front of 130 000 fans remains to this date her biggest concert audience ever and largest crowd of any concert in french history a concert was also planned in basel switzerland for august 31 1987 but negotiations between madonna s management and local organizers failed due to high fee of one million million in dollars that madonna s camp demanded as a result nice france was booked in itinerary but when a local mayor threatened to cancel concert citing crowd problems jacques chirac then mayor of paris stepped in to overrule him her first ever italian concert in turin was presented by italian state broadcaster and broadcast around world just in italy show was watched by around 14 million households show at turin was watched by 65 000 fans and was a record there in japan a thousand troops had to restrain a crowd of 25 000 fans seeking to greet madonna at airport when severe storms forced cancellation of her first shows despondent fans nearly rioted and madonna was confronted with out of control teenagers soaking themselves in rain outside stadium promoters had no choice but to refund u s 7 million to ticket buyers madonna s madison square garden show in new york city was an aids benefit with all proceeds from show going to american foundation for aids research amfar she dedicated her performance of live to tell to her late friend martin burgoyne designer of her 1983 burning up single cover sleeve upon completion tour was second top female concert tour of 1987 behind tina turner s break every rule tour earning in total of us 25 million million in dollars according to pollstar and playing in front of 1 5 million audience all over world broadcasts and recordings concert at stadium tokyo was broadcast on june 22 1987 in japan only it was later released on vhs and laserdisc as who s that girl live in japan it was first television broadcast using dolby surround sound and was promoted by mitsubishi as madonna had previously starred in television commercials for their video recorders on september 4 1987 madonna s concert special madonna in concerto filmed at stadium in turin italy was broadcast live on tv in italy rai france tf1 germany austria orf and spain tve other countries including australia and netherlands broadcast this show in 1987 concert was released commercially in 1988 as ciao italia live from italy and was later available on laserdisc and dvd video contains full who s that girl show produced using footage from three different shows tokyo on june 22 1987 turin on september 4 1987 and florence on september 6 1987 heather phares from allmusic said a much simpler less choreographed performance than her later extravaganzas like girlie show world tour ciao italia is still entertaining in its own right and will definitely please fans nostalgic for some old school madonna hits mark from los angeles daily news commented that ciao italia shows glitz and glamor that made this tour so remarkable it charted at top of billboard music dvd chart on for six weeks and ranked at two on 1988 year end top ranked tapes ciao italia also charted at number three on finnish dvd chart in 2009 legacy according to taraborrelli many female artists behave like a diva for a period when they reach superstar status and who s that girl tour marked beginning of madonna s for instance she would not allow crew members to talk directly to her they had to talk to her representatives lest they distract her from business at hand she also forbade her dancers from speaking to her and her musicians were not permitted to even look at her unless they were onstage with her moreover when coming on and off stage madonna demanded that road managers hold sheets around her in order to shield her from eyes of those who couldn t help but stare demann commented she has a way of demanding that compels you to give her your undivided attention to which taraborrelli felt that such behavior actually was an indication of how successful and strong madonna was you don t behave like a bitch until you are that successful tour sure helped cement her star status he commented tour was also notable for giving rise to term new madonna a stronger and more intelligent sexual image of her former self which had given rise to term madonna wannabe considine felt that important thing madonna did on tour was to demonstrate how female sexuality can be a source of strength traditionally in pop culture there are two roles that a woman can play good girl and bad girl and bad girl is never taken seriously but madonna shows up trappings of a bad girl and demanded to be taken up seriously because she just doesn t roll over i got more sense of strength and power that was under her image all along another important fact noted in tour by scholars is extensive use of multimedia technique to its maximum potential says mark bego author of madonna blonde ambition that madonna transformed concept of a concert tour being focused on songs she turned her who s that girl tour into a ubiquitous multimedia blitz technique by including songs dancing choreography videos big screens backdrops not to mention subtle preaching and messages that made singing a secondary quality for concert goers evident from people that thronged to see tour they were there for spectacle and not see madonna standing in front of microphone and singing while in italy madonna met some of her relatives from pacentro village in which her grandfather and grandmother gaetano and ciccone had been married however it was not glorious home coming that she had expected some of her relatives made it very clear that they were scandalized by her appearance and behavior one good thing came from visit there were talks of making her an honorary citizen of town ultimately a statue of madonna wearing conical bra was elected in her name at center of town vatican was outraged by plans of erecting statue with pope s spokesperson commenting statue would be too sexy and might corrupt morals of
