who issued letters patent and nominated a proctor and fellows for establishment of a college in 1657 however there was deep concern expressed by oxford and cambridge that awarding of degree powers could hinder their position consequently it was not until 1832 when parliament at instigation of archdeacon charles thorp and with support of bishop of durham william van mildert passed an act to enable dean and chapter of durham cathedral to appropriate part of property of their church to establishment of a university in connection therewith that university came into being act received royal
