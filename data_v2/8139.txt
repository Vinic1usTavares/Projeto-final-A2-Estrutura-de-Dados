operation colossus was codename given to first airborne operation undertaken by british military which occurred on 10 february 1941 during world war ii british airborne establishment was formed in june 1940 by order of british prime minister winston churchill in response to successful airborne operations conducted by german military during battle of france training began immediately but a shortage of proper equipment and training facilities as well as bureaucratic difficulties meant that only a small number of volunteers could immediately be trained as parachute troops first airborne unit to be formed was actually a re trained commando unit no 2 commando which was subsequently renamed as no 11 special air service battalion and numbered approximately 350 officers and other ranks by september 1940 battalion finished its training in december 1940 and in february 1941 thirty eight members of battalion known as x troop were selected to conduct an airborne operation which was intended to test capability of airborne troops and their equipment as well as ability of royal air force to accurately deliver them target chosen for operation was a fresh water aqueduct near calitri in southern italy which supplied water to a large portion of italian population as well as several ports used by italian military it was also hoped that its destruction would hamper italian military efforts in north africa and albania airborne troops were delivered by converted armstrong whitworth whitley medium bombers to target on 10 february but equipment failures and navigational errors meant that a significant portion of troops explosives and a team of royal engineer sappers landed in wrong area despite this setback remaining members of troop successfully destroyed aqueduct and withdrew from area but were all captured by italian authorities within a short time an italian translator was tortured and executed and one paratrooper managed to escape captivity but rest remained as prisoners of war aqueduct was rapidly repaired before local water reserves ran out ensuring that local population and ports were not deprived of water and consequently that italian war efforts were not hampered however it served as a morale boost for fledgling airborne establishment and technical and operational lessons learnt from operation helped development of further airborne operations background german military was one of pioneers of use of airborne formations conducting several successful airborne operations during battle of france in 1940 including battle of fort eben emael flanagan p 6 impressed by success of german airborne operations allied governments decided to form their own airborne formations harclerode p 197 this decision would eventually lead to creation of two british airborne divisions as well as a number of smaller units harclerode p 107 british airborne establishment began development on 22 june 1940 when prime minister winston churchill directed war office in a memorandum to investigate possibility of creating a corps of 5 000 parachute troops despite prime minister s desire to have 5 000 airborne troops within a short period a number of problems were rapidly encountered by war office very few gliders existed in britain in 1940 and these were too light for military purposes and there was also a shortage of suitable transport aircraft to tow gliders and carry paratroopers on 10 august churchill was informed that although 3 500 volunteers had been selected to train as airborne troops only 500 could currently begin training due to limitations in equipment and aircraft otway p 21 war office stated in a memorandum to prime minister in december 1940 that 500 parachute troops could probably be trained and be ready for operations by spring of 1941 but this figure was purely arbitrary actual number that could be trained and prepared by that period would rely entirely on creation of a training establishment and provision of required equipment otway p 23 a training establishment for parachute troops was set up at raf ringway near manchester on 21 june 1940 and named central landing establishment and initial 500 volunteers began training for airborne operations royal air force provided a number of armstrong whitworth whitley medium bombers for conversion into transport aircraft for paratroopers a number of military gliders were also designed starting with general aircraft hotspur but gliders were not used by british until operation freshman in 1942 otway p 73 organizational plans were also being laid down with war office calling for two parachute brigades to be operational by 1943 otway p 28 however immediate development of any further airborne formations as well as initial 500 volunteers already training was hampered by three problems with threat of invasion in 1940 many war office officials and senior british army officers did not believe that sufficient men could be spared from effort to rebuild army after battle of france to create an effective airborne force many believed that such a force would only have a nuisance raiding value and would not affect conflict in any useful way there were also material problems all three of armed services were expanding and rebuilding particularly army and british industry had not yet been organized to a sufficient war footing to support all three services as well as fledgling airborne force otway p 25 finally airborne forces lacked a single coherent policy with no clear idea as to how they should be organized or whether they should come under command of army or raf inter organizational rivalry between war office and air ministry in charge of raf was a major factor in delaying further expansion of british airborne forces preparation on 26 april 1941 prime minister was shown a demonstration of airborne force that britain currently possessed and was informed that although some 800 parachute troops had been trained their deployment was severely limited by lack of suitable aircraft which could be used to transport them to any prospective targets otway p 30 primary airborne formation in existence by this time was no 11 special air service battalion which numbered approximately 350 officers and other ranks and had been formed from no 2 commando a commando unit which had been selected for conversion into an airborne unit otway pp 31 32 commando began intensive airborne training in june 1940 originally 500 strong but this had been reduced to 21 officers and 321 other ranks by september 1940 despite already receiving rigorous training many of commandos failed their training by refusing to conduct a parachute drop one senior raf officer at central landing establishment believed that such a large number refused due to a combination of inexperience and a fear that their parachute would not open when they jumped out of aircraft otway p 32 on 21 november 1940 commando was officially renamed as no 11 special air service battalion and reorganized to form a battalion headquarters one parachute wing and one glider wing by 17 december battalion had officially completed its parachute training including taking part in a number of demonstrations for military observers and was considered to be ready for active duty thumb left general sir john dill chief of imperial general staff cigs inspecting parachute troops at central landing establishment at raf ringway near manchester december 1940 there were few airborne resources available to british army by mid 1941 only unit trained and available for an airborne operation was no 11 special air service battalion there were very few transport aircraft available to transport an airborne force there were few raf flight crews with experience of parachute droppings and none with operational experience and there were no specialized overseas facilities to cater exclusively for airborne operations however it had been decided that some form of airborne operation would have to be carried out reasons for mounting an operation with such meagre resources were two fold firstly a successful raid would demonstrate to rest of world that britain was still a force to be reckoned with and had not been defeated and secondly a raid would test fighting ability of battalion and its equipment as well as raf s ability to deliver paratroopers at a predetermined location at a required time harclerode p p 19 target chosen for operation was an aqueduct that crossed tragino river in campania province of southern italy near town of calitri aqueduct carried main water supply for province of apulia which at time was inhabited by approximately two million italians and included strategically important port of taranto it was hoped that destroying aqueduct and depriving population of their regular water supply would damage their morale and also have some impact on italian war efforts in north africa and albania aqueduct was a significant distance from italian coast making it unlikely that a sea borne raiding party could reach it and it was believed that it was too strongly constructed to be destroyed by aerial bombing as such an airborne raid conducted by parachute troops was thought to be ideal way to eliminate aqueduct a small force of thirty eight officers and thirty one other selected from battalion and designated x troop commanded by major t a g pritchard of royal welch fusiliers three italian speaking interpreters were attached to troop for duration of operation squadron leader lucky mc rifleman nasri from rifle brigade and a civilian named fortunato picchi a waiter in savoy hotel training for operation began in january 1941 and lasted for six weeks in order to allow time for six whitley bombers to be converted to drop parachutists a full scale model of aqueduct was built in early february to allow troop to practice its assault and during training one enlisted man was killed when he parachuted into an ice covered pond and drowned before he could be rescued plan for operation called for six whitleys of no 51 squadron raf to transport x troop from malta to target area on 10 february while another two bombers would carry out a diversionary raid against railway yards at foggia approximately to north of aqueduct at 21 30 troop would be dropped around objective attack and demolish it and then withdraw to coast to mouth of sele river where submarine hms triumph would pick them up on night of 15 february harclerode p 202 battle on 7 february x troop boarded six converted whitley bombers and were transported to malta without incident despite a significant portion of journey being over occupied france there troop were briefed with aerial reconnaissance photographs of objective that were provided by photographic reconnaissance unit which showed that there were actually two aqueducts in area one larger than other after a brief discussion it was decided that larger of two would be targeted saunders p 20 at 18 30 on 10 february six whitleys took off from malta each carrying one officer and five other ranks of x troop flight to target area was uneventful with clear weather and perfect visibility lead whitley reached drop zone which was approximately from aqueduct at 21 42 all six men and their equipment containers landed within of drop zone as did men from next four aircraft however two of bombers failed to drop their containers due to icing up of release mechanisms and sixth aircraft failed to locate drop zone and eventually dropped its six men and containers two hours later in a valley two miles from aqueduct six men who had not landed in drop zone were royal engineer sappers who were supposed to rig aqueduct for demolition and their whitley had been carrying most of explosives to be used in operation saunders pp 20 21 despite these losses troop gathered up remaining containers and took up positions around aqueduct however on examining aqueduct it was found piers supporting it were made of reinforced concrete and not brick as had been expected leading pritchard to suspect that remaining explosives might be insufficient to demolish aqueduct after closer inspection pritchard ordered that majority of explosives be placed around western pier and rest against its abutment in hope that this would cause enough damage to destroy aqueduct a small amount of explosives were also placed under a nearby bridge that bridged ginestra river saunders p p 203 thumb right memorial to men of parachute regiment at tatton park at 00 30 on 11 february explosives were detonated and western pier destroyed causing aqueduct to crumble and effectively break in half and ginestra bridge was also successfully destroyed leaving one man who had broken his ankle when he had landed with a nearby farmer remainder of troop withdrew from area at 01 00 splitting into three groups and heading towards coast saunders p 22 three groups moved as fast as possible towards coast but were all captured within a few hours of aqueduct being demolished group commanded by major pritchard was spotted by a farmer who raised alarm at a nearby village leading to a local carabinieri unit surrounding group with little ammunition and heavily outnumbered pritchard decided to surrender other three groups including six sappers who had landed two miles from objective fared little better two groups from aqueduct were soon located by italian soldiers and ambushed forcing them to surrender after brief firefights third group were found by a group of civilians as they moved towards coast after attempting to bluff their way past by claiming to be german soldiers on a special field exercise which failed when local mayor demanded identity papers they were captured by carabinieri all were stripped of their weapons and equipment and transported to naples with exception of italian translator picchi he was handed over to a fascist paramilitary group who tortured and then executed him saunders p 24 even if any of groups had managed to make their way to coast and rendezvous point they would not have been picked up by hms triumph one of two whitleys conducting diversionary raid at foggia suffered engine trouble after bombing railway yards pilot radioed malta informing his airfield that he was ditching in mouth of river sele coincidentally area where rendezvous was to occur fearing that message had been monitored by italians and that submarine might sail into a trap decision was made by senior officers not to send it to rendezvous point harclerode p 204 aftermath destruction of tragino aqueduct had a negligible effect on italian war effort in north africa and albania as it did not create a serious interruption to water supplies of taranto and other ports water supplies in local reservoirs lasted for short period needed for aqueduct to be repaired otway p 65 however operation did create a certain amount of alarm in italian population and caused stringent new air raid precautions to be introduced by italian government which were still in place when italy surrendered in 1943 saunders p 25 major general julian thompson has criticized operation claiming that although there was a great deal of planning in terms of how to insert airborne troops there was insufficient planning devoted to how they would be extracted he is also critical about lack of information gathered about aqueduct despite it being hardly difficult to obtain thompson p 342 lessons taken from operation provided british military with valuable operational and technical experience that helped shape future airborne operations such as operation biting it demonstrated range and flexibility of airborne troops and proved that they could pose a threat to axis powers and also provided a morale boost for british military and fledgling airborne establishment saunders p 27 in terms of technical experience it was found that containers used to drop equipment for troop were manufactured from a soft skinned material which sagged during flight and blocked bomb bay doors from opening future containers were constructed from metal to ensure this did not occur all of surviving members of x troop would remain as prisoners of war until they were repatriated with italian surrender with exceptions of lieutenant anthony deane drummond and corporal alfred parker lieutenant drummond who managed to escape after being captured eventually returned to england in 1942 joining newly formed 1st airborne division alfred parker escaped from sulmona pow camp but was later recaptured by germans after witnessing execution by germans of a fellow escapee and a number of italians later recognized as a war atrocity alfred parker again escaped and eventually made his way back to uk after hitching a ride to north africa on a us forces dakota aircraft when airborne establishment was expanded no 11 special air service battalion was renamed 1st parachute battalion and eventually formed nucleus of 1st parachute brigade when it was created in september 1941 tugwell p 125 references bibliography silvio l pugliese prima azione inglese di in italia febbraio 1941 storia n 33 34 febbraio marzo 2004 category
