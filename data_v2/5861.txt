battle of austerlitz 2 december 1805 11 an xiv frc also known as battle of three emperors was one of most important and decisive engagements of napoleonic wars in what is widely regarded as greatest victory achieved by napoleon grande armee of france defeated a larger russian and austrian army led by emperor alexander i and holy roman emperor francis ii battle occurred near town of austerlitz in austrian empire modern day u in czech republic austerlitz brought war of third coalition to a rapid end with treaty of pressburg signed by austrians later in month battle is often cited as a tactical masterpiece in same league as other historic engagements like cannae or gaugamela farwell p 64 austerlitz is generally regarded as one of napoleon s tactical masterpieces and has been ranked as equal of arbela cannae and leuthen dupuy p 102 after eliminating an austrian army during ulm campaign french forces seized vienna in november 1805 austrians avoided further conflict until arrival of russians bolstered allied numbers napoleon sent his army north in pursuit of allies but then ordered his forces to retreat so he could feign a grave weakness desperate to lure allies into battle napoleon gave every indication in days preceding engagement that french army was in a pitiful state even abandoning dominant pratzen heights near austerlitz he deployed french army below pratzen heights and deliberately weakened his right flank enticing allies to launch a major assault there in hopes of rolling up whole french line a forced march from vienna by marshal davout and his iii corps plugged gap left by napoleon just in time meanwhile heavy allied deployment against french right weakened allied center on pratzen heights which was viciously attacked by iv corps of marshal soult with allied center demolished french swept through both enemy flanks and sent allies fleeing chaotically capturing thousands of prisoners in process allied disaster significantly shook faith of emperor francis in british led war effort france and austria agreed to an armistice immediately and treaty of pressburg followed shortly after on 26 december pressburg took austria out of both war and coalition while reinforcing earlier treaties of campo formio and of luneville between two powers treaty confirmed austrian loss of lands in italy and bavaria to france and in germany to napoleon s german allies it also imposed an indemnity of 40 million francs on defeated habsburgs and allowed fleeing russian troops free passage through hostile territories and back to their home soil critically victory at austerlitz permitted creation of confederation of rhine a collection of german states intended as a buffer zone between france and central europe confederation rendered holy roman empire virtually useless so latter collapsed in 1806 after francis abdicated imperial throne keeping francis i of austria as his only official title these achievements however did not establish a lasting peace on continent prussian worries about growing french influence in central europe sparked war of fourth coalition in 1806 prologue europe had been in turmoil since start of french revolutionary wars in 1792 in 1797 after five years of war french republic subdued first coalition an alliance of austria prussia great britain spain and various italian states a second coalition led by britain austria and russia and including ottoman empire portugal and naples was formed in 1798 but by 1801 this too had been defeated leaving britain only opponent of new french consulate in march 1802 france and britain agreed to end hostilities under treaty of amiens for first time in ten years all of europe was at peace but many problems persisted between two sides making implementation of treaty increasingly difficult british government resented having to return cape colony and most of dutch west indian islands to batavian republic napoleon was angry that british troops had not evacuated island of malta tense situation only worsened when napoleon sent an expeditionary force to crush haitian revolution in may 1803 britain declared war on france third coalition in december 1804 an anglo swedish agreement led to creation of third coalition british prime minister william pitt spent 1804 and 1805 in a flurry of diplomatic activity geared towards forming a new coalition against france and by april 1805 britain and russia had signed an alliance having been defeated twice in recent memory by france and being keen on revenge austria joined coalition a few months later forces french imperial army before formation of third coalition napoleon had assembled an invasion force called armee d angleterre army of england around six camps at boulogne in northern france he intended to use this invasion force to strike at england and was so confident of success that he had commemorative medals struck to celebrate conquest of english channel4 time traveller series although they never invaded napoleon s troops received careful and invaluable training for any possible military operation boredom among troops occasionally set in but napoleon paid many visits and conducted lavish parades in order to boost morale men at boulogne formed core for what napoleon would later call la grande armee at start this french army had about 200 000 men organized into seven corps which were large field units that contained 36 to 40 cannon each and were capable of independent action until other corps could come to rescue a single corps properly situated in a strong defensive position could survive at least a day without support giving grande armee countless strategic and tactical options on every campaign in addition to these forces napoleon created a cavalry reserve of 22 000 organized into two cuirassier divisions four mounted dragoon divisions one division of dismounted dragoons and one of light cavalry all supported by 24 artillery pieces by 1805 grande armee had grown to a force of 350 000 men who were well equipped well trained and led by competent officers russian imperial army russian army in 1805 had many characteristics of ancien regime organization there was no permanent formation above regimental level and senior officers were mostly recruited from aristocratic circles commissions were generally given to highest bidder regardless of competence russian infantry was considered one of most hardy in europe however and there was fine russian artillery manned by trained professional soldiers who regularly fought hard to prevent their pieces from falling into enemy hands todd fisher gregory fremont barnes napoleonic wars rise and fall of an empire p 33 austrian imperial army archduke charles brother of austrian emperor had started to reform austrian

from english channel to rhine to deal with new austrian and russian threats on 25 september after a feverish march in great secrecy 200 000 french troops began to cross rhine on a front of mack had gathered greater part of austrian army at fortress of ulm in swabia modern day southern germany napoleon swung his forces southward in a wheeling movement that put french at austrian rear ulm maneuver was well executed and on 20 october mack and 23 000 austrian troops surrendered at ulm bringing number of austrian prisoners of campaign to 60 000 although this spectacular victory was soured by defeat of franco spanish fleet at battle of trafalgar following day french success on land continued as vienna fell in november french gained 100 000 muskets 500 cannons and intact bridges across danube meanwhile russian delays prevented them from saving austrian armies russians then withdrew to northeast to await reinforcements and link up with surviving austrian units tsar alexander i appointed general mikhail illarionovich kutuzov commander in chief of combined russo austrian force on 9 september 1805 kutuzov arrived at battlefield quickly contacting francis i of austria and his courtiers to discuss strategy and logistics under pressure from kutuzov austrians agreed to supply munitions and weapons in a timely manner kutuzov also spotted shortcomings in austrian defense plan which he called very dogmatic he objected to austrian annexation of land recently under napoleon s control because this would make local people distrust allied force french followed after kutuzov but soon found themselves in a difficult position prussian intentions were unknown and could be hostile russian and austrian armies had converged and french lines of communication were extremely long requiring strong garrisons to keep them open napoleon realized that to capitalize on success at ulm he had to force allies to battle and defeat them on russian side kutuzov also realized napoleon needed to do battle so instead of clinging to suicidal austrian defense plan kutuzov decided to retreat he ordered pyotr bagration to contain french at vienna with 600 soldiers and instructed bagration to accept murat s ceasefire proposal so that allied army could have more time to retreat it was later discovered that proposal was false and had been used in order to launch a surprise attack on vienna nonetheless bagration was able to hold off french assault for a time by negotiating an armistice with murat thereby providing kutuzov time to position himself with russian rearguard near murat initially refrained from an attack believing entire russian army stood before him napoleon soon realized murat s mistakes and ordered him to pursue quickly but allied army had already retreated to olmutz according to kutuzov s plan allies would retreat further to carpathian region and at galicia i will bury french napoleon did not stay still french emperor decided to set a psychological trap in order to lure allies out days before any fighting napoleon had been giving impression that his army was weak and that he desired a negotiated peace about 53 000 french troops including soult lannes and murat s forces were assigned to take austerlitz and olmutz road occupying enemy s attention allied forces numbering about 89 000 seemed far superior and would be tempted to attack outnumbered french army however allies did not know that bernadotte mortier and davout were already within supported distance and could be called in by forced marches from iglau and vienna respectively raising french number to 75 000 troops napoleon s lure did not stop at that on 25 november general savary was sent to allied headquarters at olmutz to deliver napoleon s message expressing his desire to avoid a battle while secretly examining allied forces situation as expected overture was seen as a sign of weakness when francis i offered an armistice on 27th napoleon accepted enthusiastically on same day napoleon ordered soult to abandon both austerlitz and pratzen heights and while doing so to create an impression of chaos during retreat that would induce enemy to occupy heights next day 28 november french emperor requested a personal interview with alexander i and received a visit from tsar s most impetuous aide prince peter dolgorukov meeting was another part of trap as napoleon intentionally expressed anxiety and hesitation to his opponents dolgorukov reported to tsar an additional indication of french weakness plan was successful many of allied officers including tsar s aides and austrian chief of staff franz von weyrother strongly supported an immediate attack and appeared to sway tsar alexander kutuzov s plan to retreat further to carpathian region was rejected and allied forces soon fell into napoleon s trap battle thumb 300px alt colored painting showing french troops lighting torches for napoleon napoleon with his troops on

not totally confident of victory in a letter written to minister of foreign affairs talleyrand napoleon requested talleyrand not tell anyone about upcoming battle because he did not want to disturb empress josephine according to frederick c schneid french emperor s chief worry was how he could explain to josephine a french defeat frederick c schneid napoleon s conquest of europe war of third coalition p 137 battlefield battle took place about six miles ten kilometers southeast of town of brno between that town and austerlitz in what is now czech republic northern part of battlefield was dominated by 700 foot 210 meter santon hill and 880 foot 270 meter zuran zuran hill both overlooking vital olomouc brno road which was on an east west axis to west of these two hills was village of

35 to 40 feet 10 to 12 meters in height an aide noted that napoleon repeatedly told his marshals gentlemen examine this ground carefully it is going to be a battlefield you will have a part to play upon it allied plans and dispositions 300px thumb right alt map showing french troops concentrated to west of battlefield and allies to east allied red and french blue deployments at 1800 hours on 1 december 1805 an allied council met on 1 december to discuss proposals for battle most of allied strategists had two fundamental ideas in mind making contact with enemy and securing southern flank that held communication line to vienna although tsar and his immediate entourage pushed hard for a battle emperor francis of austria was more cautious and as mentioned he was seconded by kutuzov commander in chief of russians and allied troops pressure to fight from russian nobles and austrian commanders however was too strong and allies adopted plan of austrian chief of staff franz von weyrother this called for a main drive against french right flank which allies noticed was lightly guarded and diversionary attacks against french left allies deployed most of their troops into four columns that would attack french right russian imperial guard was held in reserve while russian troops under bagration guarded allied right russian tsar rudely stripped authority of commander in chief m i kutuzov and gave it to franz von weyrother in battle kutuzov could only command iv corps of allied army although he was still de facto commander because tsar was afraid to take over in case his favoured plan failed french plans and dispositions thumb 300px french cuirassiers taking position napoleon was hoping that allied forces would attack and to encourage them he deliberately weakened his right flank richard brooks editor atlas of world military history p 109 on 28 november napoleon met with his marshals at imperial headquarters who informed him of their qualms about forthcoming battle he shrugged off their suggestion of retreat todd fisher gregory fremont barnes napoleonic wars rise and fall of an empire p 48 napoleon s plan envisaged that allies would throw many troops to envelop his right flank in order to cut french communication line from vienna as a result allies centre and left flank would be exposed and become vulnerable gregory fremont barnes napoleon bonaparte leadership strategy conflict p 19 to encourage them to do so napoleon abandoned strategic position on pratzen heights faking weakness of his forces and his own caution meanwhile napoleon s main force was to be concealed in a dead ground opposite heights according to plan french troops would attack and recapture pratzen heights then from heights they would launch a decisive assault to center of allied army cripple them and encircle them from rear massive thrust through allied centre was conducted by 16 000 troops of soult s iv corps iv corps position was cloaked by dense mist during early stage of battle in fact how long mist lasted was vital to napoleon s plan soult s troops would become uncovered if mist dissipated too soon but if it lingered too long napoleon would be unable to determine when allied troops had evacuated pratzen heights preventing him from timing his attack properly meanwhile to support his weak right flank napoleon ordered davout s iii corps to force march all way from vienna and join general legrand s men who held extreme southern flank that would bear heaviest part of allied attack davout s soldiers had 48 hours to march their arrival was crucial in determining success of french plan indeed arrangement of napoleon on right flank was very risky as french had only minimal troops garrisoning there however napoleon was able to use such a risky plan because davout commander of iii corps was one of napoleon s best marshals because right flank s position was protected by a complicated system of streams and lakes and because french had already settled upon a secondary line of retreat through brunn imperial guard and bernadotte s i corps were held in reserve while v corps under lannes guarded northern sector of battlefield where new communication line was located by 1 december 1805 french troops had been shifted in accordance with allied movement southward as napoleon expected battle begins battle began at about 8 a m with first allied lines attacking village of telnitz which was defended by 3rd line regiment this sector of battlefield witnessed heavy fighting in this early action as several ferocious allied charges evicted french from town and forced them onto other side of goldbach first men of davout s corps arrived at this time and threw allies out of telnitz before they too were attacked by hussars and re abandoned town additional allied attacks out of telnitz were checked by french artillery fisher fremont barnes p 48 49 left thumb 240px capture of a french regiment s eagle by cavalry of russian guard by bogdan 1884 allied columns started pouring against french right but not at desired speed so french were mostly successful in curbing attacks actually allied deployments were mistaken and poorly timed cavalry detachments under liechtenstein on allied left flank had to be placed in right flank and in process they ran into and slowed down part of second column of infantry that was advancing towards french right at time planners thought this slowing was disastrous but later on it helped allies meanwhile leading elements of second column were attacking village of sokolnitz which was defended by 26th light regiment and tirailleurs french skirmishers initial allied assaults proved unsuccessful and general langeron ordered bombardment of village this deadly barrage forced french out and at about same time third column attacked castle of sokolnitz french however counterattacked and regained village only to be thrown out again conflict in this area ended temporarily when friant s division part of iii corps retook village sokolnitz was perhaps most fought over area in battlefield and would change hands several times as day progressed todd fisher gregory fremont barnes napoleonic wars rise and fall of an empire p 49 while allied troops attacked french right flank kutuzov s iv corp stopped at pratzen heights and stayed still just like napoleon kutuzov realized importance of pratzen and decided to protect position but young tsar did not so he expelled iv corp from heights this act quickly pushed allied army into her grave one sharp blow and war is over 300px thumb right alt map with

strategic position to win battle at about 8 45 a m satisfied at weakness in enemy centre napoleon asked soult how long it would take for his men to reach pratzen heights to which marshal replied less than twenty minutes sire about 15 minutes later napoleon ordered attack adding one sharp blow and war is over a dense fog helped to cloud advance of st hilaire s french division but as they went up slope legendary sun of austerlitz ripped mist apart and encouraged them forward russian soldiers and commanders on top of heights were stunned to see so many french troops coming towards them allied commanders moved some of delayed detachments of fourth column into this bitter struggle over an hour of fighting destroyed much of this unit other men from second column mostly inexperienced austrians also participated in struggle and swung numbers against one of best fighting forces in french army eventually forcing them to withdraw down slopes however gripped by desperation st hilaire s men struck hard once more and bayoneted allies out of heights to north general vandamme s division attacked an area called stare vinohrady old vineyards and through talented skirmishing and deadly volleys broke several allied battalions todd fisher gregory fremont barnes napoleonic wars rise and fall of an empire p 49 50 battle had firmly turned in france s favour but it was far from over napoleon ordered bernadotte s i corps to support vandamme s left and moved his own command center from zuran hill to st anthony s chapel on pratzen heights difficult position of allies was confirmed by decision to send in russian imperial guard grand duke constantine tsar alexander s brother commanded guard and counterattacked in vandamme s section of field forcing a bloody effort and only loss of a french standard in battle a battalion of 4th line regiment was defeated sensing trouble napoleon ordered his own heavy guard cavalry forward these men pulverized their russian counterparts but with both sides pouring in large masses of cavalry no victory was clear russians had a numerical advantage but soon tide swung as drouet s division 2nd of bernadotte s i corps deployed on flank of action and allowed french cavalry to seek refuge behind their lines horse artillery of guard also inflicted heavy casualties on russian cavalry and fusiliers russians broke and many died as they were pursued by reinvigorated french cavalry for about a quarter of a mile fisher fremont barnes p 51 casualties of russians in pratzen included kutuzov who was severely wounded and his son in law ferdinand von

battlefield by 1400 hours allied army had been dangerously separated napoleon now had option to strike at one of wings and he chose allied left since other enemy sectors had already been cleared or were conducting fighting retreats meanwhile northernmost part of battlefield was also witnessing heavy fighting prince liechtenstein s heavy cavalry began to assault kellerman s lighter cavalry forces after eventually arriving at correct position in field fighting initially went well for french but kellerman s forces took cover behind general caffarelli s infantry division once it became clear russian numbers were too great caffarelli s men halted russian assaults and permitted murat to send two cuirassier divisions one commanded by d hautpoul and other one by nansouty into fray to finish off russian cavalry for good ensuing melee was bitter and long but french ultimately prevailed lannes then led his v corps against bagration s men and after hard fighting managed to drive skilled russian commander off field he wanted to pursue but murat who was in control of this sector in battlefield was against idea fisher fremont barnes p 52 napoleon s focus now shifted towards southern end of battlefield where french and allies were still fighting over sokolnitz and telnitz in an effective double pronged assault st hilaire s division and part of davout s iii corps smashed through enemy at sokolnitz which persuaded commanders of first two columns generals kienmayer and langeron to flee as fast as they could commander of allied left and man responsible for leading attack was completely drunk and fled as well kienmayer covered his withdrawal with o reilly light cavalry who managed to defeat five of six french cavalry regiments before they too had to retreat general panic now seized allied army and it abandoned field in all possible directions a famous episode occurred during this retreat russian forces that had been defeated by french right withdrew south towards vienna via frozen ponds french artillery pounded towards men and ice was broken due to bombardment men drowned in cold ponds dozens of russian artillery pieces going down with them estimates of how many guns were captured differ there may have been as few as 38 or more than 100 sources also differ about casualties with figures ranging between 200 and 2 000 dead many drowning russians were saved

after battle and corpses of only two or three men with some 150 horses were found rose 1910 46 military and political results allied casualties stood at about 36 000 out of an army of 89 000 which represented about 38 of their effective forces french lost around 9 000 out of an army of 66 000 or about 13 of their forces allies also lost some 180 guns and about 50 standards great victory was met by sheer amazement and delirium in paris where just days earlier nation had been teetering on brink of financial collapse napoleon wrote to josephine i have beaten austro russian army commanded by two
