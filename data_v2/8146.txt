episode this includes commentary by production cast audience and press cast reception thumb jolene blalock who played t pol was highly critical of series finale these are voyages was negatively received by both critics and show s cast before episode aired blalock called episode appalling she followed up her remarks by saying she was upset over finale being a next generation episode rather than an end for enterprise connor trinneer who played commander trip tucker felt finale should have had a memorable farewell that he described as a m a s h moment but producers did not want such an element anthony montgomery who played ensign travis mayweather was similarly displeased with finale and said i feel there could have been a more effective way to wrap things up for our show as well as franchise as a whole it just seemed to take a little bit away from what enterprise cast and crew worked so diligently to achieve over past four years while frakes enjoyed working with sirtis again he said reality is it was a bit of a stretch to have us shut down enterprise cast s show and that in hindsight it was a disservice to them early criticism forced show s producers to hold a conference and address issue braga admitted there was cast unrest but defended episode as a way to close not just enterprise but star trek as a whole critical reception reviewers were also critical of next generation tie in sci fi weekly s patrick lee said framing story reduces enterprise cast to status of lab rats lee further noted that even without guest appearances episode did not live up to best offerings of season including in a mirror darkly national posts alex strachan called next generation cameos reminders of better star trek compared to bad make up effects bad acting bad music of latest show rob salem of toronto star said cameos served no narrative purpose and that episode robs characters and their fans of any significant long term development or satisfying sense of closure reviewers also criticized episode s ending where viewers never got to see archer s rousing speech ign said episode was berman and braga s parting shot making sure that everyone knew who was in charge and that sharp contrast between these are voyages and terra prime brought into relief reason neither should be allowed to produce star trek ever again death of tucker was another object of controversy salem described development as a major character is pointlessly killed off in service of a pointless plot device a complaint echoed by ign actor connor trinneer who played trip said during a convention appearance that character had gotten out of much worse scrapes than that and death seemed forced writers trinneer contended wanted to kill off a character to get fans talking and so trip was killed off simply to manipulate viewers several critics ended their reviews by saying that whether fans would be disappointed or pleased by episode majority of casual viewers would not care one way or another whatculture ranked this episode 19th worst episode of star trek in 2017 this episode was rated number one worst episode of star trek franchise of all series before star trek discovery by screenrant reception analysis in response to some of these criticisms coto said he personally considered two part story demons and terra prime actual finale of enterprise storyline berman said i ve read a lot of criticisms and i understand how some people feel but braga and i spent a lot of time coming up with idea and a somewhat i would say unique ending to a series especially when you re ending it prematurely you never like to disappoint people but i think it s nonsense to say that it was more a next generation episode than an enterprise episode only elements of next generation that were present were there as a sounding board to allow us to look at a mission that took place six years after terra prime in 2009 den of geek while acknowledging cast critiques of finale said these are

for ignoring star trek canon and refusing to fix their shows michael hinman news coordinator for syfy portal said that in addition to oversaturation of star trek there also is an oversaturation of braga and berman they couldn t sit back and say you know we just can t keep this fresh no it was more about their stupid egos and their nonsensical even if it s broke don t fix it attitude braga defended series noting that next generation faced little competition from other science fiction shows while enterprise had to contend with a plethora of shows such as battlestar galactica newspapers

writers and production designers deserve credit for offering worlds that were perhaps slightly more believable they lost fantastic wondrous approach to space travel that next generation borrowed from original star trek and then perfected usa todays michael peck said that without dreams of earlier series star trek becomes just another television drama melanie mcfarland of seattle post intelligencer
