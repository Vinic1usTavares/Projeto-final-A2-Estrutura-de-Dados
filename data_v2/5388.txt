16 cygni or 16 cyg is flamsteed designation of a triple star system approximately 69 light years away from earth in constellation of cygnus it consists of two sun like yellow dwarf stars 16 cygni a and 16 cygni b together with a red dwarf 16 cygni c in 1996 an extrasolar planet was discovered in an eccentric orbit around 16 cygni b distance parallax of two brightest stars were measured as part of hipparcos astrometry mission this yielded a parallax of 47 44 milliarcseconds for 16 cygni a and 47 14 milliarcseconds for 16 cygni b since two components are associated it is reasonable to assume they lie at same distance so different parallaxes are a result of experimental error indeed when associated parallax errors are taken into account ranges of parallaxes overlap using parallax of a component distance is 21 1 parsecs parallax of b component corresponds to a distance of 21 2 parsecs stellar components 16 cygni thumb left 16 cygni in optical light 16 cygni is a hierarchical triple system stars a and c form a close binary with a projected separation of 73 au orbital elements of a c binary are currently unknown at a distance of 860 au from a is a third component designated 16 cygni b orbit of b relative to a c pair was determined in 1999 and not updated since as of june 2007 plausible orbits range in period from 18 200 to 1 3 million years with a semimajor axis ranging from 877 to 15 180 au in addition b orbits between 100 and 160 degrees inclination that is against a c pole such that 90 degrees would be both 16 cygni a and 16 cygni b are yellow dwarf stars similar to sun their spectral types have been given as g1 5v and with a being a little hotter than sun and b somewhat cooler system was within field of view of original mission of kepler spacecraft which collected extremely precise photometric data of stars from these measurements asteroseismology models have calculated precise masses of 1 08 and 1 04 times solar mass for 16 cygni a and 16 cygni b respectively and independent ages of around 7 billion years for each star system has also been observed through interferometry which allowed determination of angular diameter of each star angular diameters together with asteroseismology models were used to calculate radii of 1 229 and 1 116 times solar radius for components a and b respectively abundances despite having same age and presumably same primordial composition observations show a small difference in metallicity of two 16 cygni stars primary star has an iron abundance of 1 26 times solar value compared to 1 13 for secondary star a similar trend has been found for all other metals with primary component having an average of 10 more metals than b one possibility is that this difference is linked to planet 16 cygni bb since its formation may have removed metals from protoplanetary disk around 16 cygni b however another study found no difference in heavy element abundances between 16 cygni a and b another chemical peculiarity between stars is in their lithium abundance measurements of lithium abundance in system show a 4 times higher abundance in component a than in 16 cygni b compared to sun 16 cygni a has 1 66 as much lithium while 16 cygni b has only 0 35 it has been hypothesized that accretion of about 1 earth mass of metals by 16 cygni b soon after system s formation may have destroyed lithium in star s atmosphere another proposed scenario is engulfment of a jupiter mass planet by 16 cygni a which increased amount of lithium in star s outer atmosphere planetary system in 1996 an extrasolar planet in an eccentric orbit was announced around star 16 cygni b discovery by radial velocity method was made from independent observations from mcdonald observatory and lick observatory planet s orbit takes 799 5 days to complete with a semimajor axis of 1 69 au it has a very high eccentricity of 0 69 which might be result of gravitational perturbations from 16 cygni a in particular simulations show planet s eccentricity oscillates between low and high values in timescales of tens of millions of years like majority of extrasolar planets detectable from earth 16 cygni bb was deduced from radial velocity of its parent star at time that only gave a lower limit on mass in this case about 1 68 times that of jupiter in 2012 two astronomers e and n a showed that stable orbit would demand about 2 38 jupiter masses such that its orbit was inclined at either 45deg or 135deg eccentric orbit and mass of 16 cygni bb makes it extremely unlikely that a terrestrial sized planet will be found orbiting within star s habitable zone for 16 cyg b system only particles inside approximately 0 3 au remained stable within a million years of formation leaving open possibility of short period planets for them observation rules out any such planet of over a neptune mass there was a meti message sent to 16 cygni system it was transmitted from eurasia s largest radar 70 meter 230 foot eupatoria planetary radar message was named cosmic call 1 it was sent on may 24 1999 and it will reach 16 cygni in november 2069 http www ru rus ra sr vak 2004 html see also 61 cygni 30 arietis 83 leonis 54 piscium hd hd
