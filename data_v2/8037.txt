enemy in battle or dies in battle those who fail this rite of passage are punished either by execution or public shaming fathers and sons are expected to have an emotionally distant relationship with any signs of affection between them being considered shameful scholars christina niculescu and yonit nemtzeanu analysed kazon culture to explore political correctness and themes of racial prejudice in star trek voyager they determined that kazon are characterized as primitive inferior savage and criminal and argue that kazon s appearance and behavior were designed to elicit a negative response from audience they described kazon s clothing as resembling that of guerrilla warriors and their hair and faces as wild and threatening though kazon are not shown as having a standing army they are defined as a militaristic society niculescu and nemtzeanu noted that kazon dialogue is marked by its frequent use of violent language according to seska kazon medicine is rudimentary and primitive even though kazon are only classified species that borg refuse to assimilate janeway included in her reports that they are a tricky and dangerous foe in star trek voyager kazon s military focus is heavily

ships and carrier vessels raider ships are considered minor threats by voyager s crew but carrier ships are viewed as more dangerous even though kazon s weapons are inferior to those on voyager starfleet crew s inability to resupply leaves them vulnerable to attacks okuda 1996 p 252 kazon vessels are visually represented as dark strictly functional and without any of embellishments known from bright slick federation ships ships are adorned with only skulls and trophies of conquered enemies in star trek online players can use kazon heavy raider and have access to its bridge mmorpg s official website promotes craft s greatest strength as its maneuverability and versatility site also mentions that kazon have improved their technology since their encounter with voyager by scavenging more advanced materials from other species background concept and creation prior to announcement of a new star trek incarnation star trek voyager co creators rick berman michael piller and jeri taylor conceived basic concepts and characters during secret developmental meetings poe 1998 p 156 kazon were originally created as a part of show s basic premise of voyager s crew being stranded in delta quadrant berman piller and taylor reasoned that characters would be traveling through an area of space controlled by a new alien race serving as show s primary antagonists and created kazon to fill this role poe 1998 p 164 kazon were inspired by los angeles gangs and were referenced in a shorthand crips and bloods fashion poe 1998 p 187 idea for kazon as warrior sects as opposed to a unified race was introduced by taylor who drafted them as three gangs with constantly shifting relationships and allegiances just as we think we have sorted it out balance shifts again poe 1998 p 188 while discussing kazon s original inspiration taylor viewed them as a way to address tenor of our times and what was happening in our cities and recognizing a source of danger and social unrest gross altman 1996 p 151 piller further described premise for kazon as rooted in gang violence and warfare by clarifying our intention was to create a sort of disorganized anarchy them against them as much as them against us gross altman 1996 p 161 in a meeting dated august 17 1993 taylor wrote a story outline for pilot episode caretaker and established kazon then identified as crips as a gang which in conflict with two other gangs competes for territory in this region of space poe 1998 p 190 191 taylor s notes suggest that show s co creators considered having crips reach a truce with main characters which would anger another one of gangs then titled blood and lead to them being primary antagonists poe 1998 p 191 this idea was later dropped at a meeting on september 10 of same year poe 1998 p 205 in first draft of script for caretaker piller named alien species gazon and wrote following description of them during summer of 1994 gazon was changed to kazon as it was feared that name sounded too much like gaza producers suggested this change to avoid stories involving alien race being interpreted as political commentary on conflicts in palestinian territories according to star trek voyager technical manual kazon were originally planned to be split into only two factions kazon sera and kazon ogla design and casting right thumb michael westmore was principal make up supervisor behind kazon s design pictured alt an orange mannequin wearing a wig and heavy prosthetic make up on its face kazon s design was formulated around beginning of june 1994 series make up supervisor michael westmore was heavily involved in creation of look for kazon while describing species facial features westmore said he constructed a skin protrusion along nose and front of face to simulate a soft a rooster comb rather than dinosaur bone type of ridges he said that there were very small visual differences between kazon males and females with distinguishing characteristic being women having a more delicate physicality than men westmore sims look birnes 2000 p 165 166 according to westmore prosthetic make up for forehead was structured in a shape reminiscent of devil while ridges on nose were inspired by a vulture s neck nose designs were modified throughout first two seasons with addition of a nose tip and spikes protruding from nostrils kazon s design was subject of fan criticism following series premiere with one fan commenting they look like they re all having a bad hair day poe 1998 p 283 when anthony de longis first saw headdress worn as a part of culluh s costume he joked that culluh must be leader because he has biggest head of hair westmore said that he faced several challenges involving make up and masks during filming of caretaker because of large number of kazon present in first episode he hired additional make up artists and mold makers to assist with getting all actors into costume according to supervising producer david livingston process of applying kazon make up took multiple hours since a majority of scenes involving kazon were filmed at el mirage lake livingston and filming crew were assigned to help actors feel comfortable in heavy make up and prosthetics despite high temperatures piller originally envisioned only casting actors between ages of eighteen and twenty five to simulate connection between kazon and contemporary street gangs he said that he wanted casting choices to convey alien species as young angry people who never lived old enough to have kind of experience and perspective on world that say klingons and romulans might have he wanted to emphasize that kazon were much more emotional short fused and therefore had fewer expectations through actors performances roles however were filled by actors outside this age range with piller explaining that decision was reached on grounds that older actors gave more polished performances he later regretted choice of more mature actors as he felt this conflicted with writers concept of species making them appear too much like klingons kazon also received comparisons to cardassians and wood elves by uproxx s donna dickens filming and development left thumb alt a man wearing a black brown shirt speaks into a microphone while looking to right a majority of background information relating to kazon was written by kenneth biller pictured during development of show s second season in first season kazon were introduced as one of three new alien species that could be used as recurring antagonists other two were vidiians and sikarians kazon and vidiians would be featured in later episodes while appearance of sikarians was restricted to episode prime factors poe 1998 p 127 westmore found kazon to be most demanding species to design for voyager first season though overall he found make up and prosthetic work for voyager easier than that required for star trek deep space nine he explained this by comparing relatively small number of kazon who appeared in episodes outside of pilot to numerous aliens featured throughout deep space nine kazon s design was modified during filming of first season for example for second episode in which kazon appeared state of flux westmore removed ear prosthetics which had been created originally by hair designer josee normand to look like pigs ears pig ear prosthetics proved to be too cumbersome and heavy for actors and stunt doubles and its material was changed to a more light weight sponge voyager s writing team devoted a larger amount of screen time in show s second season to develop kazon culture and society piller described season as a deep investigation of kazon that will turn them i think into perhaps one of top five adversarial alien races in star trek s history gross altman 1996 p 123 piller devised kazon s story arc in second season from his experiences working on 2005 science fiction western television show legend gross altman 2016 p 595 taylor expressed uncertainty at renewed focus on kazon questioning if they were compelling antagonists she described them as entirely piller s idea gross altman 2016 p 597 executive story editor kenneth biller wrote a paper detailing kazon s history and societal behavior as well as their adversarial relationship with trabe biller compiled all of his ideas on paper to help various writers create a cohesive narrative for kazon across individual episodes developed for one of his episodes initiations notes were also used by taylor for creation of alliances gross altman 1996 p 161 162 biller pointed to character of seska as a key narrative device for further exploring alien species for biller seska allowed us to go behind scenes with kazon and helped to define kazon for us westmore sims look birnes 2000 p 165 nonetheless hackett interpreted seska as having little loyalty to kazon saying i don t think she gives a hoot about them when discussing his hopes for fan reaction to second season s emphasis on kazon piller said i ll be curious to know what audience s perception is if our investing in kazon this season worked in response to fans concerns that voyager did not incorporate as many science fiction elements as previous star trek installments he believed that growing focus on kazon would serve as solution piller believed alien species accentuated show s futuristic storylines explaining there are a lot of people who don t consider a lot of season s episodes to be science fiction he followed this up by saying but certainly you can make a case that facing kazon in battle is futurist storytelling gross altman 1996 p 150 taylor viewed second season as focused on character driven introspective stories with a majority of action adventure aspects being conducted through appearances of kazon abandonment following end of second season taylor decided to remove kazon as series primary antagonists having found effort to develop alien species to be unsuccessful she felt that they never grew into a compelling adversary despite their appearances in multiple episodes taylor argued that kazon limited potential of series saying it created curious implication that we are standing still in space when our franchise is that we are going at incredible speeds toward alpha quadrant we keep running into same people over and over again it was just an oddity and i don t think kazon have served us well while discussing their role in future episodes she explained that it was her intention to leave them behind and to find new and i hope more interesting aliens even though piller understood taylor s disappointment with kazon he felt that it was important and valuable to create this adversary berman agreed with taylor s assessment of kazon and noted that they would be removed in beginning of third season he also admitted that writers made several mistakes and introduced inconsistencies while developing kazon believing that large amount of space under kazon s control was implausible he argued that number of times voyager encountered alien species would make their territory bigger than united federation of planets and klingon empire producer brannon braga supported kazon s removal criticizing species as half baked klingons and their constant inclusion in episodes as making series have feeling that we re traveling in a big circle despite decision to eliminate kazon from future episodes writing team was uncertain if season two finale and season three premiere would focus on them piller said that it was suggested that episodes could serve as an introduction to a new alien species but he supported possibility that they act as a farewell to kazon storylines he explained his decision by saying he felt we had built up this arc with them and it was a natural conclusion gross altman 1996 p 169 kazon were replaced by storylines focusing on vidiians borg and barrett barrett 2001 p 82 prior to premiere of star trek discovery donna dickens speculated that andrew lincoln s appearance on series could be as a character from kazon while acknowledging fans negative response to alien species during star trek voyager dickens questioned if star trek discovery would be an appropriate venue for kazon to have a cameo comeback response cast response voyager s cast members had a negative response to continued inclusion of kazon in series and felt that their removal was best course of action tim russ commented that frequent incorporation of species would strain credibility of storylines as crew would have to eventually leave kazon controlled space on their journey home gross altman 1996 p 151 152 he also believed that kazon were failures as antagonists perceiving them to be insufficiently imposing for main characters and fans to take them seriously ethan phillips agreed with russ suggesting that kazon s presence should be reduced robert picardo joked that only interesting aspect of species was their hairstyle while robert beltran pointed to their lack of intelligence as main factor preventing them from becoming strong villains kate mulgrew suggested that show incorporate a new and stronger antagonist saying we need to encounter enemies of such ferocity enemies who in fact are quite lethal and frightening enemies that you would watch and say oh boy how are they going to get out of this one i don t think kazon hit bill mulgrew felt crew s mission to get home was a more compelling storyline than those related to kazon whom she criticized as great big stupid giants ruditis 2003 p 125 critical reception kazon have received a negative response from television critics in his 2005 book an analytical guide to television s battlestar literary critic john kenneth muir argued that events of star trek voyager lost their urgency with basing of second season in kazon space he negatively compared star trek voyager to science fiction television series battlestar galactica writing that star trek voyager could learn from how galactica must go on ever forward to their destination muir 2005 p 70 alien species was described as stereotypical macho space warriors by writer k stoddard hayes who was critical of lack of developed kazon characters he explained this up by saying no memorable kazon characters emerge from two seasons of episodes featuring their different factions critics have also doubted effectiveness of kazon as villains britt found kazon to be among silliest worst antagonists in trek s history juliette harrison of website den of geek wrote that writers were too focused on kazon and seska storylines harrison called them sub standard klingon substitutes and praised series decision to replace them with borg kazon along with seska were placed at number two on a list by io9 s charlie jane anders profiling 10 least threatening star trek villains anders explained that kazon were more frequently represented as irritating pests than a major obstacle to voyagers journey home charles evans of questioned kazon s desperation for water since they could use their warp technology to gather it from other planets even though evans described kazon as starting from a good premise he did not find them to live up to their label as most powerful race in their area of delta quadrant trektoday michelle erica green provided extensive and primarily negative commentary on kazon story arc in first two seasons while re watching series kazon were negatively compared to klingons by green who described vidiians as a more suitable and compelling candidate to serve as primary antagonists for first two seasons green questioned janeway s resolve to never share voyager s technology with kazon writing that species was characterized as a spacefaring culture with warp drive so crew would not be interfering with a primitive civilization she argued that kazon s attempts to steal a replicator and a transporter rather than offensive weapons lessened their impact as a threatening presence suggesting that possibility of relations with kazon did not seem much more heinous than dealing with klingons or ferengi who oppress women and minorities within their borders despite negative critical reception of kazon scene in which they commandeer voyager was praised by television commentators marc buxton of den of geek included kazon on his list of 50 best alien life forms in star trek universe for their advanced technology and a back stabbing bloodthirst and success in trapping voyager crew on a hostile planet similarly tor com s ryan britt ranked moment when kazon captured ship as one of seven most shocking instances in star trek franchise racial and political analysis representation of kazon as antagonists has been criticized by genre commentators and academics as an example of racism in star trek franchise christina niculescu and yonit nemtzeanu were critical of dark skinned kazon being treated as more aggressive than more diplomatic fair skinned alien species they determined that representation of kazon was implicitly racist writing that species was shown as embodying negative stereotypes niculescu and nemtzeanu followed this up by saying that kazon were written only to be criminals and savages and seen as primitive in his 2016 politics of star trek political scientist george a gonzalez agreed skin tone and hair style designed for kazon as carrying explicit racial connotations and felt that it was made more apparent during their conflict with lighter skinned ocampa gonazalez 2015 p 179 180 zach of bitch media placed kazon as one example of star trek s uneven treatment of race he compared kazon to klingons and ferengi writing that aliens of color are used as proxies to represent worst aspects of human behavior kazon have been interpreted as a sociopolitical commentary on developing countries george a gonzalez presented kazon as a pessimistic feature of delta quadrant which he read as a metaphor for developing world emphasizing kazon s mistreatment of ocampa plans to steal from voyager s more developed technology and inability to form lasting alliances gonzalez describes series as interpreting race relations in developing countries as inherently contentious and inevitably destabilizing he concluded by saying that kazon storylines were in line with neoconservative biases reasoning gonazalez 2015 p 183 for a 2015 retrospective review of star trek franchise moviepilot s david trudel wrote that he was disappointed in breakdown of alliance between kazon and trabe in episode alliances he felt that series should have featured formation of a new federation starting with these two alien species some critics viewed episode as moment trek died intellectually though trudel disagreed with this assessment as fairly dramatic in 1996 new york times jon pareles offered a less critical assessment of star treks development of alien species describing them as enacting exaggerated human tendencies pareles identified kazon s rebellion against their previous captors in
