don t want anyone talking to that little worm how dare he invade my privacy with bbc morton detailed his detective work researching madonna s life in new york where she clambered her way up to fame and fortune not only is she an interesting character but all her friends and those who ve known her are interesting characters too he said morton had to spend a lot of evenings in bars and clubs in new york chatting to people including artists musicians directors who had an interesting perspective on madonna and world he interviewed about 70 people who had known madonna since her youth i think i ve come up with a very fresh picture he said adding that dan gilroy of breakfast club who had introduced madonna to music world had e mailed him saying biography had really captured madonna s spirit critical response book received mixed reviews richard from toronto star said that madonna is a thorough if slightly workmanlike retelling of its namesake s well documented slog from lowly midwestern beginnings to squeaky voiced sex kitten to professional button pusher to mother and respected vaguely bowie esque chameleonic figure a cultural bloodhound always on scent of fresh cool and credible helen bushby from bbc commented that t he book is certainly detailed and will no doubt keep madonna fanatics happy although it is perhaps more of a reference book than a page turner but morton is a good businessman and is canny in his choice of subjects michael sneed from chicago sun times gave a negative review of book and felt that morton s previous works had been better george rush from new york daily news commented despite her best efforts to discourage friends from cooperating with him andrew morton has come forth with a book that portrays madge as an insecure manipulator so ravenous for affection that she scared off some boyfriends cheated on most of them and made a lot of foolish choices in another review sherryl connelly from same publication was of opinion that madonna was mostly similar to j randy taraborrelli s biography on her madonna an intimate biography she added at least it s story made familiar by madonna a woman who has always taken for granted world s interest in her life rick thames editor of charlotte observer criticized book s packaging calling cover as tacky hot pink and acid green sleeves featuring an unflattering photo of dished artist barry from sunday herald felt that morton had failed to find face of madonna he criticized morton s sketchy portrayal of madonna s relationship with deceased painter jean michel basquiat saying he commits an error by doing so because unusually for madonna this was a relationship of equals gregg barrios from daily star was critical of book saying fatal flaw of these quickie knockoffs is that they have no real ending or any way of predicting what fates have in store for madonna louise penn guy ritchie nee ciccone once next madonna tour cd marriage or film appears their shelf life is cut short barbara ellen from guardian criticized morton s writing by saying andrew morton achieves implausible he takes an interesting woman and an astonishing life and makes them both seem incredibly boring in his life of madonna once you get used to morton s pace dull plod with occasional snooze it becomes quite amusing joining him on journey a bit like watching someone dragging a dead body around trying to find some place to hide it even luminaries such as madonna exes sean penn and warren beatty are reduced to flailing around like disenfranchised phantoms in shallows of morton s blandly automatic insight commercial reception left thumb madonna seen here performing on drowned world tour 2001 was not happy about morton releasing biography madonna was released in hardback in united states in november 2001 it debuted at position 15 on new york times best seller list and reached eight next week but was present there for only two weeks madonna was still livid that morton wrote book without her permission even saying it s not a well written book we all know he wrote it for financial gain and truth had little to do with it after book was released with jo whiley from bbc radio 1 she added that morton really went through my and that part was really annoying and i ended up writing him a letter saying i m not interested in you writing this book i don t want to have anything to do with it and please leave my friends alone singer said that she had even sent morton a book of philosophy power of kabbalah to try to dissuade him from continuing it s a beginner s crash course in what it s all about that eventually in some way shape or form it would come back round to him but he either didn t read it or didn t care madonna added during drowned world tour of 2001 madonna was asked whether she had really sent book for morton s well being she replied sarcastically why yes i always send bibles and philosophy books to my biographers motioning to her then husband guy ritchie she continued just ask my husband he ll tell you that my greatest concern these days is not this fucking tour or him or even our kids why it s andrew morton s spiritual of course her publicist liz rosenberg released a statement that none of this things in biography is true i never saw a groom walk down an aisle with a bigger smile than guy ritchie adding that morton s claims were a retread of tired old gossip it s same old same old morton remained unabashed saying that he wrote book because of his interest in star not least because she has made a difference to pop culture and modern culture he added i m very proud of book and i m very disappointed at madonna s reaction i think problem is that she wants control over everything that s one of themes of book and secondly she seems to be almost disowning her past at moment she s reinventing herself as an upper class english aristocrat and former vegetarian who now goes hunting fishing and shooting my door s always open madonna s welcome to my house for a cup of tea she said she wasn t interested in doing any kind of biography or anything ever which is a bit of a stern statement from someone who has been so out there it doesn t matter whether it s me norman mailer whoever i was disappointed because i felt that we ve only ever seen caricature cartoon version of madonna and i really wanted to show that she is a considerable artist and that she is more than anything that has been written about her in past i think for her it is an opportunity missed lawsuit madonna faced a lawsuit in 2004 over an image in book titled amarak productions inc vs morton madonna s former bodyguard and ex lover jim albright brought a defamation case against morton and st martin s press based on an incorrect photo caption amarak productions inc had employed albright as madonna s bodyguard in 1992 and he had later become romantically involved with singer while writing book morton had contacted albright to gather information on their relationship one of picture s caption in book identified subject as albright but it was actually madonna s gay back up dancer jose on discovering misleading image lawsuit was filed by albright who objected to caption on 30 may 2004 us district judge nancy gertner ruled out lawsuit explaining that stating someone is homosexual does not libel or slander them particularly in light of new court decisions granting more lgbt rights gertner first rejected idea that mistake in caption meant that it promoted albright as gay she added private biases may be outside reach of law but law cannot directly or indirectly give them effect in this day and age recent rulings by supreme court and supreme judiciary court of massachusetts undermine any suggestion that a statement implying that an individual is homosexual is defamatory publication history region release date format united states 30 october 2001 october united kingdom 6 november 2001 march june 2004 references external links
