general browning 1st ulster rifles and 2nd ox and bucks remained in england to help create 6th airlanding brigade once they arrived in theatre brigade was based in oran area on north western mediterranean coast of algeria now part of british eighth army training for allied invasion of sicily code named operation husky started in earnest major general hopkinson had persuaded general sir bernard montgomery commander of eighth army to include 1st airborne division in invasion of sicily against wishes of both commander of british airborne forces major general browning and commander of glider pilot regiment lieutenant colonel chatterton both men were concerned that they had insufficient aircraft for complete division to take part while british pilots and infantry were not familiar with waco cg 4 gliders that were to be used ferguson p 10 their concerns proved correct as there were only enough aircraft for two of division s four brigades to take part in invasion 1st parachute brigade was assigned to operation fustian with orders to seize and hold primosole bridge over river simeto prior to that 1st airlanding brigade was to take part in operation ladbroke a glider assault on ponte grande bridge across river south of syracuse brigade was to hold bridge until relieved by advance of british 5th infantry division ferguson p and von stauffenberg p 73 1st airlanding brigade was allocated 136 waco and eight airspeed horsa gliders for operation six of horsas carrying two infantry companies were scheduled to land at bridge at 23 15 on 9 july in a coup de main operation

en route they encountered strong winds poor visibility and at times were subjected to anti aircraft fire to avoid gunfire and searchlights pilots of towing aircraft climbed higher or took evasive action in confusion surrounding these manoeuvres some gliders were released too early and 65 of them crashed into sea drowning around 252 men of remaining gliders only 12 landed at correct landing zones another 59 landed up to away while remainder were either shot down or failed to release and returned to tunisia mitcham and von stauffenberg pp 73 74 only one horsa with a platoon of infantry from staffords landed near bridge its commander lieutenant louis withers divided his men into two groups then swam across river with half of them to take up positions on opposite bank thereafter bridge was captured following a simultaneous assault from both sides platoon then dismantled demolition charges that had been fitted to bridge and dug in to wait for reinforcement or relief mitcham and von stauffenberg p 74 another horsa landed about from bridge but exploded on landing killing all on board three of other horsas carrying coup de main party landed within of bridge their occupants eventually finding their way to site tugwell p 160 reinforcements began to arrive at bridge but by 06 30 they numbered only 87 men mitcham and von stauffenberg p 75 elsewhere about 150 men landed at cape murro di porco and captured a radio station based on a warning of imminent glider landings transmitted by station s previous occupants local italian commander ordered a counter attack but his troops failed to get message scattered nature of landings now worked in brigade s favour as they were able to cut all telephone wires in immediate area forces at bridge came under repeated attacks from italians while expected 5th infantry division relief did not appear at 10 00 as planned by 15 30 only 15 of men at bridge remained fit to fight and they were out of ammunition as a result italians then recaptured bridge first unit from 5th division 2nd northamptonshire regiment of 17th brigade arrived at bridge at 16 15 and mounted a successful counterattack prior removal of demolition charges from bridge had prevented italians from destroying it tugwell p 161 brigade then took no further part in fighting and was withdrawn back to north africa on 13 july mitcham and von stauffenberg

operation more than 15 planned airborne missions into france and belgium had been cancelled due to speed of allied advance peters and buist pp 18 28 a shortage of transport aircraft meant that it

on day two problems in arnhem forced hicks to change divisional plan only 2nd parachute battalion had reached road bridge strong german defences had halted other battalions so hicks decided that staffords would link up with 1st parachute brigade in an attempt to reach their objective however staffords also failed to break through german defenders urquhart p 72 bad weather over england kept planned second lift on ground first troops did not arrive until 15 00 a delay that gave germans time to approach landing grounds and engage kosb in numerous probing attacks on northern perimeter at one stage kosb commanding officer lieutenant colonel payton reid led a bayonet charge to clear germans from area meanwhile borders were repeatedly attacked from south of landing zone s x and z and were eventually forced to call on 75 mm guns of 1st airlanding light regiment to break up attacks hicks had previously decided to send staffords on second lift to join their battalion fighting in arnhem while he also sent 11th parachute battalion on same lift to support 1st parachute brigade urquhart p 76 kosb until then responsible for defending landing ground were attached to 4th parachute

around st elizabeth s hospital attack failed but allowed major general urquhart to rejoin division from a position where he had been trapped by germans this allowed brigadier hicks to resume command of brigade clark p 170 whereupon urquhart dispatched colonel barlow to take over command of 1st parachute brigade and co ordinate attack in arnhem he left in a jeep and was killed in a mortar barrage

strong german defence line and were unable to progress any further all three battalions were ordered to withdraw south of railway line towards wolfheze although northern most battalion of kosb had thus far enjoyed a quiet morning in two hours it took them to advance south of railway two companies were now cut off and entire battalion transport lost urquhart p 91 still under fire from pursuing

wounded and with rest of his men dead or wounded engaged three tanks as they emerged from woods with his anti tank gun he destroyed first tank and disabled second before his own weapon was destroyed

machine gun fire positioned one of division s artillery guns and destroyed it this was first of a number of actions by major cain which led to award of a victoria cross this second medal for staffords meant it became only british battalion to receive two victoria crosses in one battle during second world war germans did not mount an all out infantry assault on divisional area which was under continuous mortar and artillery attack instead each sector was subjected to small scale assaults at times supported by tanks or self propelled guns enemy troops first attacked independent company then borders who were forced off high ground overlooking river and finally kosb clark p p 124 germans mounted a strong assault following landing of 1st polish parachute brigade south of river beside driel this attack forced kosb out of their positions which were only regained after a bayonet charge fighting was so fierce that first reports suggested kosb had been annihilated urquhart p 128 although it turned out that counter attack had in fact reduced battalion s strength to only 150 men urquhart p 127 by day six 22 september battle had settled into a routine of and small probing attacks at times supported by armoured vehicles and sniper fire poles dug in south of river relieved part of pressure on division as some german forces were diverted to confront them urquhart p 135 following day began in a similar way to previous days with a mortar and artillery bombardment followed by infantry and armour trying to find a gap in perimeter kosb glider pilots and 21st independent company who were all
