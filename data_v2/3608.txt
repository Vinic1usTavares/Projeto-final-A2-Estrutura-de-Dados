in united states compliance requirements are a series of directives united states federal government agencies established that summarize hundreds of federal laws and regulations applicable to federal assistance also known as federal aid or federal funds they are currently incorporated into omb a 133 compliance supplement which was created by us office of management and budget omb to facilitate a recipients compliance with federal laws and regulations and as well as its annual single audit omb created fourteen basic and standard compliance requirements that recipients must comply with when receiving and using such federal assistance omb also provides detailed explanations discussions and guidance about them in omb a 133 compliance supplement compliance requirements are only guidelines for compliance with hundreds of laws and regulations applicable to specific type assistance used by recipient and their objectives are generic in nature due to large number of federal programs a 133 sup part 3 2013 pg 3 1 p 1 2 each compliance requirement is identified by a letter in alphabetical order activities allowed or unallowed a this compliance requirement establishes that each program operates for a specific purpose such as care of elderly persons or education of children and that funds provided for program must only be used in activities that benefit that purpose a 133 sup part 3 2013 section a activities allowed or unallowed pg 3 a 1 therefore federal assistance provided to a recipient for a specific purpose must be expended for such purpose only allowable costs cost principles b this compliance requirements is one of most important sections because it covers cost accounting policies expenses and expenditures and actual use of federal funds to administer a federal assistance program in other words it provides basis and principles recipients must adhere to when spending federal funds a 133 sup part 3 2013 section b allowable costs cost principles pg 3 b 1 federal government categorizes recipient types into three groups state local and indian tribal governments institutions of higher education non profit organizations prior to december 26 2014 each group has a separate set of cost principles to follow cost principles applicable to a recipient type apply to all federal assistance received by that entity regardless of whether awards are received directly from federal government or indirectly through a pass through entity omb issues a cost principle circular for each category this is a guide for spending federal assistance in accordance with

either allowable or unallowable allowable costs are those federal government determines permissible for federal assistance unallowable costs are those government prohibits incurring for federal assistance certain cost items are considered universally unallowable such as cost related to illegal activities and lobbying costs but others may be considered unallowable for a type of recipient while being allowable for another type of recipient as a general rule any assistance used inappropriately such as incurring unallowable costs requires reimbursement to federal government uniform

federally financed program in either current or a prior period g be adequately documented cash management c this section covers actual management or handling of funds pertaining to a federal program specifically on how federal assistance is distributed to recipients and how recipients manage funds until disbursement actual transfer of funds commonly referred to as drawdowns is usually done electronically by requesting funds to federal agency via website or a network funds are automatically transferred from us department of treasury to recipient s bank account federal assistance for program operations is provided to recipients usually by one of two methods also called funding techniques by either advances of funds or by reimbursement of funds a 133 sup part 3 2013 section c cash management pg 3 c 1 advances of funds advances are federal funds provided to a recipient before program activity is performed recipients determine amount needed for a future expenditure e g through budget process and request amount to federal government or in case of subrecipients to pass through entity see subrecipient monitoring below federal funds received are then expended to perform specific activity e g purchase good or service or for payroll however laws and regulations require recipients to request funds only when it is immediately needed and recipients must try to minimize amount of time between receipts of funds to actual disbursement examples of programs under these funding techniques are section 8 program and community development block grant program reimbursement of funds this funding technique requires recipient to pay program expenditures with their own funds and then request a reimbursement for those expenses from federal government or pass through entity recipients prepare and send reimbursement requests and maintain supporting documentation showing that costs for which reimbursement was requested were paid prior to date of reimbursement request davis bacon act d as part of us department of labor s dol implementation of davis bacon act federal regulations require that all laborers and mechanics who work for a contractor or subcontractor on federally financed construction contracts over 2 000 must be paid wages not less than those dol established for project location i e prevailing wage a 133 sup part 3 2013 section d davis bacon act pg 3 d 1 40 usc 276a to 276a 7 this compliance requirement was created to assure that recipients oblige contractors to comply with davis bacon act by including in their construction contracts with a contractor or subcontractor a clause or requirement to comply with davis bacon act and dol regulations 29 cfr part 5 clause should also include a requirement for contractor or subcontractor to submit to recipient weekly e g for each week in which any contract work is performed a copy of construction payroll accompanied by statement of compliance this report is commonly referred to as certified payrolls and is often done using optional form wh 347 omb no 1215 a standard form pre designed by omb 29 cfr 5 5 and 5 6 eligibility e main objective of this compliance requirement is that only eligible individuals or organizations participate in federal assistance programs while criterion for determining eligibility may vary from program to program objective that only eligible individuals or organizations participate is consistent across all federal programs which forms basis of this compliance requirement a 133 sup part 3 2013 section e eligibility pg 3 e 1 to comply with this objective recipients must first assure that proper eligibility determinations are made which means that recipient must determine parameters and limitations to define eligibility for a specific program in accordance with program s purpose many federal programs already contain eligibility requirements based on laws agency regulations grant agreements etc and recipients must assure that their eligibility determination complies with such requirements an example includes federal programs that offer hiv aids treatment and require that participants be victims of such diseases it is usually recipient s responsibility to determine how to determine such eligibility such as establishing policy that requires an in house doctor or laboratory to diagnose each prospective participant accepting diagnoses from third party doctors or laboratories etc 42 usc 300ff 14 b and 15 a 7 a omb a 133 comp suppl part iv pg 4 93 914 4 par 4 however certain agencies have included specific parameters for which recipient should follow as in case of department of housing and urban development hud which states in code of federal regulations cfr that recipients of certain hud housing subsidy programs must obtain specific income verification documents to prove participant eligibility such as w 2 payroll forms a federal income tax return etc omb a 133 comp suppl part iv pg 4 14 850 3 par 5 through 724 cfr part 5 f 24 cfr 5 601 et seq and 24 cfr 960 253 960 255 and 960 259 after determining which eligibility requirements participation in a program requires recipient must also assure that individual program participant or group eligibility was correctly determined by keeping evidence of such compliance such as maintaining documentation in participant files e g copies of hiv aids diagnosis copies of federal income tax returns etc furthermore recipient must assure that only eligible individuals or groups participated in program by establishing strict controls of program funds to avoid non eligible persons from receiving specific assistance equipment and real property management f this section established directives on how a recipient should manage equipment and real property of a federal program equipment management equipment means tangible non expendable property acquired with federal assistance funds that has a useful life of more than one year and an acquisition cost of 5 000 or more per unit though consistent with a recipient s own equipment policy lower cost limits may be established basically this section requires that as per a 102 common rule and omb circular a 110 regulations equipment must be used in federal program it was bought for or when appropriate other federal programs additionally recipient must keep equipment records perform a physical equipment inventory at least once every two years and implement an appropriate internal control system to safeguard and maintain equipment when equipment with a current fair market value of 5 000 or more is no longer needed it may be retained or sold as a proportionate share is provided to federal government amount of current fair market value based on percent of federal funds to own recipients fund used to buy item omb a 133 comp suppl part iii pg 3 f 1 equipment and real property circular a 102 common rule ss 32 omb circular a 110 ss 34 real property management title to real property acquired by recipients with federal awards vests with recipient it must be used for originally authorized purpose as long as needed for that purpose real property may be used in other federally sponsored projects or programs that have purposes similar to one property was bought for as long as federal government authorizes it however it may not dispose of or encumber title to real property without prior federal government consent when it is no longer needed for federally supported programs or projects recipient must request disposition instructions from federal government as with equipment if property is sold a proportionate share is provided to federal government amount of current fair market value based on percent of federal funds to own recipient s fund used to acquire item a 102 common rule ss 31 omb circular a 110 ss 32 matching level of effort earmarking g this section covers 3 compliance requirements concerning recipient performance they may require that recipients provide a level of contributions to a federal program maintain specific levels of performance or achievement or restrict amount of federal funds used for a specific purpose failure to meet these requirements may result in either limitation of future funds or termination of assistance specific requirements for matching level of effort and earmarking are unique to each federal program and are described in laws regulations and contract or grant provisions that pertain to program omb a 133 comp suppl part iii pg 3 g 1 matching level of effort and earmarking matching matching also referred to as cost sharing is a requirement for recipient to provide contributions or donations usually non federal of a specified amount or percentage to supplement federal assistance received omb a 133 comp suppl part iii pg 3 g 1 par 4 in other words when recipient participates in a federal program e g it receives federal assistance and an operating budget is prepared federal government may require recipient to provide contributions to cover a portion of that program s operations omb a 133 comp suppl part iii pg 3 g 1 par 3 matching requirement is based on assertion that total program expenses are 100 and that although federal government provides assistance for most of those expenses recipient must still cover a portion of them such proportion is solely decided by federal government but usually recipient decides how that contribution is provided and to which expenses so long as contribution is verifiable generally does not originate from another federal program and is considered in operating budget expenses must be necessary and reasonable allowed under cost principles see b section above and not used for another federal program matching may be in form of contributing recipient s own funds or money to suffrage program allowable costs e g paying program utility bills paying part of program personnel payroll etc or in some cases in form of in kind contributions which are donations of non monetary objects such as services materials property etc examples of matching include head start program which requires that recipients provide 20 of total annual expenses in either monetary or in kind contributions recipients of these funds may contribute money to cover teacher payroll or may contribute a building to house program classrooms omb a 133 comp suppl part iv pg 4 93 600 1 head start program however federal government requires that in kind contributions be properly valued and evidenced such as estimating value of a building to make sure that it meets 20 of program budget and certain programs specifically require that matching be made by contributing money only omb a 133 comp suppl part iv pg 4 16 579 5 par 1 level of effort level of effort defines particular goals or objectives recipient must achieve with assistance received and includes recipient requirements for a specified level of service specified level of expenditures for designated activities and federal funds to supplement and not supplant non federal services omb a 133 comp suppl part iii pg 3 g 1 par 5 some examples are programs that establish that a recipient must provide medical services to 1 000 patients daily and programs that require that a recipients spend over 50 of its annual budget on capital projects among other earmarking earmarking is a requirement that specifies a limit amount or percentage of program s assistance that must minimum or may maximum be used for specified activities omb a 133 comp suppl part iii pg 3 g 2 par 1 examples of this include limits imposed on federal government on amount of federal funds to cover administrative expenses or a percentage requirement for total program funds provided to subrecipients omb a 133 comp suppl part iv pg 4 16 579 5 par 2 3 earmarking may also be specified in relation to types of participants covered e g a limit on how many participants a recipient can provide assistance to period of availability of federal funds h this section establishes fact that although recipients may receive various federal awards during their lifespan individual federal grants are awarded for a specified time period usually one year federal regulations prohibit use of funds from a grant award outside its specified time frame unless authorized by a federal agency and auditors should verify that recipient expends its grant during that time only for example a surplus from a federal award that starts on january 1 2006 and ends on december 31 2006 cannot be used after december 31 because its lifespan has terminated this surplus must be returned to federal agency unless otherwise authorized omb a 133 comp suppl part iii pg 3 h 1 period of availability of federal funds procurement and suspension and debarment i this section covers compliance of laws and regulations when obtaining a good or services from a vendor supplier or provider procurement requirement is established to ensure that such goods and services are obtained in an effective manner and in compliance laws and regulations including prohibition of conflicts of interest fair selection of vendors provide open and free competition among vendors etc omb circular a 110 ss 40 through ss 48 suspension and debarment requirement establishes that certain non federal entities have been prohibited from participating in or receiving federal assistance for various reasons including prior mismanagement of funds or previous non compliance of laws and regulations this prohibition may be temporary suspension or indefinite debarment until specifically allowed by government when performing this purchase recipient must verify that vendor supplier provider or their respective principals e g owners top management etc are not suspended debarred or otherwise excluded by federal government this is done by checking excluded parties list system maintained by general services administration or by contacting federal agency omb a 133 comp suppl part iii pg 3 i 1 procurement and suspension and debarment program income j program income is sometimes directly generated by federally funded program omb a 133 comp suppl part iii pg 3 j 1 par 1 2 this type of income includes but is not limited to income from fees for services performed use or rental of property acquired with program funds sale of items fabricated under program and payments of principal and interest on loans made by recipient to others with program funds however it generally does not include interest on program funds which is covered under cash management see above nor does it cover rebates credits discounts and refunds covered under allowable costs cost principles nor proceeds from sale of equipment or real property covered under equipment and real property management uses or treatment of program income are either deducted by federal agency from current program budget e g program income substitutes part of original budget added to current program budget or used to meet matching requirements real property acquisition and relocation assistance k this section covers compliance with uniform relocation assistance and real property acquisition policies act of 1970 ura this act provides for uniform and equitable treatment of persons displaced by a federal programs from their homes businesses or farms including assuring just compensation and assisting in relocation omb a 133 comp suppl part iii pg 3 k 1 par 1 2 for example if construction of a highway under a federal program requires expropriation of homes expropriation must be made by either providing fair compensation for that property or providing assistance for or reimbursement of relocation expenses incurred by affected person compliance supplement suggests verifying that property acquired is appraised by qualified independent appraisers appraisals are examined by a review appraiser to assure acceptability and that after acceptance review appraiser certifies recommended or approved value of property for just compensation to owner reporting l this section establishes that all recipients must submit reports whether financial performance related or of special nature to federal government

all recipients and general public time deadlines for submitting them vary depending on report furthermore reporting requirements e g which reports must be submitted timing of submission information in reports etc may vary from recipient to recipient although federal government has established several reports that apply to all recipients some of most common of these universal reports include sf 269 omb approval no 0348 or sf omb no 0348 commonly known as financial status report used to report status of funds e g amount received amount expended or used amount reserved amount unused etc sf 270 omb no 0348 0004 also known as request for advance or reimbursement used to request u s treasury advance payments and under non construction programs sf 272 omb no 0348 0003 or sf 272 a omb no 0348 0003
