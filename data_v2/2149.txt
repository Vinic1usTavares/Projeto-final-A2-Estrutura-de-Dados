television and abc studios would provide netflix with live action series centered around daredevil jessica jones iron fist and luke cage leading up to a miniseries based on defenders melissa rosenberg was brought on to jessica jones series to be reconfigured as a page one do over from an original project she had developed in december 2010 for abc in december 2014 official title was revealed to be marvel s a k a jessica jones but that was shortened to marvel s jessica jones in june 2015 season consists of 13 hour long episodes writing writers for season worked in los angeles with one member of writing team on set in new york for filming actress carrie anne moss talked about how scripts developed through production of season explaining that dialogue usually did not change much while filming but scenes were altered to accommodate filming locations when necessary rosenberg stated that since jones is a private investigator there would be some procedural elements to show but that s not our focus there are cases in particular there is a large case that carries over season elaborating on this marvel television head jeph loeb said that fun about being a private detective is that line between what s legal and what s not legal gets very blurred her drive is not always necessarily to solve case as much as it is to go okay can i pay rent how am i going to get through this day he also added that inspiration for season came from noir films from 40s and film s like chinatown describing tone of season loeb said when we first started talking about daredevil we promised that we were telling a story that was first a crime drama and then a superhero show this is more of a psychological thriller this speaks to when you think about what happened to jessica and what sort of destroyed her life and how she tried to put it together and then to have to confront person who deconstructed her world that s a very powerful emotional place to start from on approaching rape and trauma in season rosenberg wanted to avoid actually showing rape which she called lazy storytelling and often a way to spice up male characters and preferred to just make trauma a part of characters everyday lives rather than an issue for season to tackle when asked about adult nature of season including use of sex rosenberg explained that marvel would only not allow showing nudity and use of word fuck in season regarding all of social issues season covered such as issues of choice interracial relationships domestic violence and issues of consent while also exploring feminism and being a woman in this world rosenberg said it was never our intention going in to hit a social issue and i think minute you intend to do that you re stepping up on a soap box if you re digging into dark side of human psyche and all different experiences we go through and as women we go through you re going to find those things if you treat them honestly and with respect you re also going to hit social issues casting main cast for season includes krysten ritter as jessica jones mike colter as luke cage rachael taylor as patricia trish walker wil traval as will simpson erin moriarty as hope shlottman eka darville as malcolm ducasse carrie anne moss as jeri hogarth and david tennant as kilgrave appearing in recurring roles for season are susie abromeit as pam colby minifie and kieran mulcare as robyn and ruben nichole yannetty as nicole clarke peters as oscar clemons michael siberry and lisa emery as albert and louise thompson and robin weigert as wendy ross hogarth danielle ferland gillian glasco ryan farrell and paul pryce also recur as victims of kilgrave who join a support group established by jones while rosario dawson and royce johnson reprise their roles of claire temple and brett mahoney respectively from daredevil design stephanie maslansky returned as costume designer for jessica jones from daredevil and was assisted on first episode by jenn who crafted jessica jones leather jacket faded jeans and boots costume on jones s costume maslansky said she considers her clothing to be an armor and a shield and something that helps her maintain a distance from other people and privacy it keeps her from having to deal with rest of humanity in a certain sort of way at least 10 versions of jones s jacket were made which started as an acne studios leather motorcycle jacket that had any bells and whistles and any additional superfluous design details removed 20 pairs of jeans were used with both sets of clothing being aged and distressed because jones s costume does not evolve much throughout season maslansky used flashbacks to show how her costume had evolved to present day for pre kilgrave jessica jones maslansky gave character more pulled together clothes albeit still kind of edgy clothes that did not change who she was as a character but were just different for instance in a flashback to jones working in a corporate environment she does not wear a suit instead wear s her jeans and find s a really cool jacket maybe a vintage thing maybe something that she borrowed from trish for a flashback where jones wears a large sandwich costume a variety of costumes were ordered online with chosen suit then distressed to look dirty and old a mere shadow of its former sandwich self becoming more of a hoagie than a sandwich in another flashback jones imagines escaping kilgrave s control bright yellow dress character wears in dream sequence was chosen for its juxtaposition to character s real situation with maslansky calling it so beautiful and so free and so light for kilgrave maslansky used many suits created by designer paul smith rather than custom making them as she originally planned as smith was about purple in previous fashion season on suits maslansky added that designers wanted to find a place where we could utilize clothing in shades of purple but not go so over top that it would look silly and that he would stop feeling ominous or menacing expanding on this maslansky called purple a traditionally fairly friendly color and he s anything but friendly so i had to find ways to make him be ominous and frightening and terrifying i found that i needed right proportion of shades of purple to other shades that were similar navy black maroon maslansky felt luke cage was also someone who wears his clothing like an armor with his wardrobe consisting of t shirts jeans leather jackets or an army jacket for a character like trish walker who does not have same kind of statement costume as jones maslansky tried to create a certain character style maslansky said that walker s uniform is fashion so even when she was hanging around house she was wearing a pair of rag bone jeans with a chloe top and this was her version of a t shirt and jeans maslansky added that robin was a blast to dress because of her quirky personality yet she was still able to put herself together aesthetically for malcolm as his story progressively became brighter throughout season so did his wardrobe becoming a little brighter and a little more hopeful filming in february 2014 marvel announced that jessica jones would be filmed in new york city in april marvel comics editor in chief joe quesada stated that show would be filming in areas of brooklyn and long island city that still look like old hell s kitchen in addition to sound stage work season went into production in february 2015 in bronx at lehman college with working title violet and aimed to film each episode over nine days on average filming concluded in mid late august other filming locations in new york city used included east village s horseshoe bar for luke s bar 33rd street path station and a path train 101st street area for exterior of jessica s apartment with interior apartment settings created on a sound stage queens for jessica s childhood home angel center for jessica and luke s fight in aka take a bloody number savings bank tower and pier 88 for locations in aka smile meatpacking district nolita near 39th street entrance to lincoln tunnel tribeca bryant park union square gramercy greenpoint brooklyn near newtown creek wastewater treatment plant long island city including allied extruder factory for weed growing facility with exteriors shots taken from near calvary cemetery queensboro bridge on queens side manhattan bridge brooklyn navy yard bethesda terrace and fountain in central park and industry city concerning inspirations on season loeb revealed that chinatown is one of things that influenced brian michael bendis and michael gaydos when they created character so those kind of beautiful long wide expansive shots where people sort of come into frame and go back out of frame and someone s in foreground and then someone is way in background and they re having a conversation that s stuff that makes it interesting director of photography manuel billeter and episodic director s j clarkson took inspiration from comics in terms of their color palette while looking to works of wong kar wai as reference to create unconventional compositions with billeter explaining there were a lot of foreground elements and headroom as well and we never wanted to show an open frame we wanted to create a sense of claustrophobia billeter shot season with a red epic dragon camera in 4k resolution with 5k used for some visual effects shots and with panavision pvintage lenses he focused mostly on static frames and good composition but did occasionally employ a camera dolly or steadicam for lighting billeter noted that many new york street lamps had been changed from sodium vapor lamps to leds so he tried to recreate warm dirty color of sodium vapor for night exterior scenes production designer loren weeks described marvel s hell s kitchen as having a little more east village quality to achieve explosion at luke s bar weeks said we could not take out windows at horseshoe bar which are made up of multiple small colored glass and metal frames we didn t know frankly when we picked that location that we would have that explosion what we did was build a fireproof box in entrance and we had a cannon in there which blew out debris and smoke and some fire and then we did a lighting effect on inside and then rest of explosion was handled by visual effects for scenes on path train and station location manager jason farrar noted that production had exclusive use of tracks and platform during day when ridership was low to get their shots visual effects shade vfx created over 600 effects shots for season with invisible effects showpiece helping to push forward darker elements series therefore effects supervisor karl and producer julie long worked closely with crew on set to execute stunts set extensions explosions wetwork and fire sequences while filming rather than have shade create those effects digitally an effect that shade was required to create was tinting kilgrave s skin purple in a few key scenes where he is using his powers a nod to comic iteration s purple skinned appearance music at 2015 san diego comic con international sean callery revealed he was composing music for jessica jones eventually stating that music required for each episode ranged from 9 to 20 minutes totaling approximately 415 minutes of music for season a soundtrack album for season was released by marvel music digitally on june 3 2016 all music composed by sean callery unless otherwise noted marvel cinematic universe tie ins on existing in mcu specifically in same world as other netflix series rosenberg said jessica jones is a very very different show than daredevil we exist in a cinematic universe and mythology of universe is connected but they look very different tonally they re very different that was my one concern coming in am i going to have to fit into daredevil or what s come before and answer is no on references or easter eggs in season rosenberg explained that a little is always there and in writer s room we have some fanboys that know all this stuff and they re all out with different stuff a lot of references are to alias comic she also said that nods to larger mcu are in season with each episode having a little something in it hogarth is closely associated with iron fist in comics and also worked with luke cage as part of those characters heroes for hire team like daredevil season makes references to events of avengers and avengers specifically hulk and captain america though not by name jessica also mentions angela del toro as another private investigator who in comics is hero white tiger and has connections with k un lun and iron fist paul tassi writing for forbes was disappointed with how season fit into larger mcu feeling season seemed removed from world of avengers and did not acknowledge daredevil enough given that it s supposed to be sharing at least this little of marvel cinematic universe with it eric francisco of inverse countered that jessica lack of overt connections to mcu was show s chief advantage besides demonstrating how physically wide open mcu s scope really is jessica jones also proves mcu s thematic durability release first season of jessica jones was released on november 20 2015 on streaming service netflix in all territories where it is available in ultra hd 4k in january 2015 a month after marvel announced a 2015 release for season sarandos had said that it was too hard to say now if season would actually release in 2015 with netflix s plan to release a marvel series approximately a year apart from each other after daredevils april 2015 release however netflix soon confirmed that season would indeed release in 2015 announcing november 20 release date in september season was enhanced to be available in high dynamic range after its initial release by post production vendor deluxe marketing in may 2015 marvel announced plans to reprint alias comic that series is based on with new covers from david mack original cover artist on comic who is also providing artwork for series opening credits reprints which were all released digitally in june 2015 and up to issue 15 in two trade paperbacks in september were intended to both celebrate history of jessica jones and introduce new audiences to character ahead of release of season in late september through early october marvel and netflix released short teasers for season which chronicled a day of jones life also in early october marvel digitally released a 12 page one shot comic by original alias creative team bendis gaydos and mack set in universe of television series one shot was created as an exclusive for new york comic con where a print version was distributed comic sees jessica jones coming into contact with daredevil character turk barrett and includes a short sequence featuring daredevil to celebrate connective tissue that will build between series also during new york comic con marvel set up a street marketing campaign and screened aka ladies night on october 10 while at marvel booth fans could take their picture with alias investigations desk with kilgrave s eyes appearing in background of final animation marvel additionally partnered with uber during event to provide select riders with complimentary trips to or from convention in custom designed suvs a full trailer was released at end of october with meagan of comic book resources feeling that it helped establish same tone as daredevil and introduced marvel s creepiest villain yet with kilgrave she also compared jessica to some of other female characters of mcu black widow melinda may and peggy carter feeling that jessica stood out from others because she does not have a sense of togetherness and was most relatable because of her struggle with trauma and that season would have amount of creative space required to explore character that other female characters were lacking a second trailer was released on november 10 2015 leeds of wall street journal felt that this trailer highlighted empowerment compared to first that was about illustrating fear behind jones s past season held its premiere in new york city on november 17 home media season was released on dvd in region 1 and blu ray in region a on august 22 2017 in region 2 and region b on december 5 2016 and in region 4 on december 7 2016 reception audience viewership as netflix does not reveal subscriber viewership numbers for any of their original series symphony technology group compiled data for season based on a sample size of 15 000 people using software on their phones that measures television viewing by detecting a program s sound according to symphony from september to december 2015 episodes of jessica jones averaged 4 8 million viewers during a 35 day viewing cycle data was presented by alan wurtzel nbcuniversal president of research and media development in a presentation aimed to provide perspective when stating digital platforms are hurting traditional tv business netflix cco ted sarandos responded to data by saying that whole methodology and measurement and data itself doesn t reflect any sense of reality of anything that we keep track of a further study from symphony for same time period found jessica jones to be one of four most watched series in 18 to 24 demographic ahead of any broadcast network series marketing analytics firm jumpshot determined season was fifth most viewed netflix season in first 30 days after it premiered garnering 26 of viewers that second season of daredevil received which was most viewed season according to jumpshot

netflix viewers who watched at least one episode of season critical response review aggregator website rotten tomatoes reported a 94 approval rating with an average rating of 8 24 10 based on 79 reviews website s critical consensus reads jessica jones builds a multifaceted drama around its engaging antihero delivering what might be marvel s strongest tv franchise to date metacritic which uses a weighted average assigned a score of 81 out of 100 based on 32 critics indicating what website considers to be universal acclaim early screening of first episode at new york comic con was met by a very positive reaction from crowd george marston of newsarama gave first episode a 10 out of 10 saying season strikes a balance between self aware noir and marvel s first flirtations with psychological horror not just another hit for marvel and netflix but a landmark moment for female superheroes on tv eric goldman of ign felt that jessica jones starts out with a strong premiere episode that easily goes further than anything in mcu in terms of sexuality he called ritter a commendably tough sardonic jessica jones and praised supporting cast for strong impressions they made later scoring episode an 8 5 out of 10 evan valentine of collider gave episode 5 stars out of 5 feeling that tennant would ascend to same level as tom hiddleston s loki and vincent d onofrio s wilson fisk as one of cornerstones of villainy in mcu katharine of io9 also had positive thoughts on aka ladies night highlighting episode s use of light and color especially with purple and way it portrays new york as how it actually looks not overly bright and shiny and clean but not suffering a never ending power outage either abraham riesman noted episode s presentation of sexuality which was shockingly and refreshingly honest compared to marvel s other films and television series he concluded by applauding season s bringing up of topics of rape and ptsd reviewing first seven episodes of season maureen ryan of variety gave positive thoughts on jessica jones stating show which features an exceptional performance from krysten ritter and sure handed guidance from executive producer melissa rosenberg is not just a contender for title best marvel related tv property in a supremely crowded tv scene it is one of year s most distinctive new dramas jack shepard of independent also on first seven episodes felt season not only matches daredevil but exceeds expectations shepard gave exceptional praise to tennant s kilgrave feeling he was one of best villains produced by marvel and possibly best on screen comic book villain since heath ledger s joker forbes merrill barr stated that after seeing first seven episodes answer is a resounding yes if lightning could strike twice for marvel television claiming in no uncertain terms jessica jones is best thing marvel television has ever produced it contains all hopeful anticipation of agents of s h i e l d all feminist overtones of agent carter and all grittiness of daredevil deadline hollywood dominic patten also had praise for season particularly rosenberg s influence on it coverage of topics such as ptsd abuse assault shame and death and cast highlighting tennant s kilgrave as actor s best role as well as mcu s best villain mary mcnamara from los angeles times felt jessica jones rewrote definition of superhuman and was a marvel lauding season s breathtaking examination of recovery from a sexually emotionally and physically abusive relationship daniel fienberg for hollywood reporter was also positive saying season looks and feels a bit like a cable anti hero series but it s really more of a post hero story making it fascinating and unique in a marketplace that doesn t lack for costumed do gooders of all types his one criticism was that show shares jessica s monomaniacal fixation on kilgrave and result is a sort of narrative claustrophobia everything in these opening episodes ties back to kilgrave and kilgrave is such a twisted figure that it s hard for any light to get in melissa maerz of entertainment weekly was slightly more critical of season awarding it a b though maerz felt ritter was a good choice for jessica and enjoyed cinematography she felt season could ve made for a gritty character drama if it weren t for noir cliches saxophone music shadows through glass and a procedural structure that s very csi marvel show s biggest weakness is same as jessica s it starts out with extraordinary potential but somewhere along way it loses what make it special goldman later reviewing whole season gave it a 9 3 out of 10 he commended all actors relationship between jessica and trish and episode sin bin though was critical of character robyn additionally goldman also felt season spent too many scenes devoted to jeri s marital strife and that it hit its peak a bit before actual end of season similar to daredevil with most of thrilling moments earlier in season analysis libby hill of los angeles times commented on how jessica jones exposed modern day sexism and misogyny through kilgrave s use of phrase smile calling season most innocuous and incisive cultural critique from marvel to date hill likened an early scene that shows kilgrave asking jones to smile and her obliging to similar well meaning scenarios that play out in real world time and again each day many in form of gendered street harassment that resonates with many women hill also added that kilgrave serves as an exaggerated representation of perceived consent due to response he gives later in season to jessica about never knowing if someone is doing what they want or what he tells them to do she concludes that jessica jones is revolutionary because in acknowledging casual misogyny and exaggerating its most destructive tendencies it exposes pervasive toxicity therein it does all of this without making a show of its politics instead resting easy on knowledge that all too many women will relate to subtleties of its premise amy c chambers writing for science and entertainment laboratory noted how season moved away from sexism even more so than comics by changing kilgrave s abilities from based with a particular effect on women to viral with equal effect no matter gender indicating that powerlessness is not gendered kwame opam at verge chose to examine rape and nature of consent in season comparing jessica jones to other television series that have depicted rape game of thrones orange is new black and outlander opam felt that since rape is one of show s core themes we never need to see it rape is a foundational part of text and its presence is constant even if it s invisible it s always there he also felt season took time to examine how rape happens and what it means especially in terms of power and consent concluding jessica jones moves conversation about rape forward by treating it as a complex subject worth investigating rather than as spice for a story maybe we don t need to see it anymore to grasp how violent it is maybe our energies are better spent thinking deeply about why it happens at all guardians lili loofbourow also discussed season s depiction of rape and consent noting complications that come with kilgrave telling his victims how to feel rather than just how to act and saying however exceptional kilgrave s power seems moral quagmire it produces is all too common it s condition of rape victim who had an orgasm during her assault it s condition of soldier trained to kill when he suspects his targets are innocent it s condition of battered woman who goes back to her abuser and stays of her own free will it s condition of any person really who agrees whatever context to consent to forgo consent in future loofbourow also discussed character of simpson comparing his power inducing red pill to anti feminist red and noting that his taking of pills renders him not just dangerously delusional but so utterly at odds with nature and reality of any kind that he will forget to breathe unless he counteracts pill s effects accolades jessica jones was included on multiple best top tv shows of 2015 lists ranking on peoples 1st along with daredevil
