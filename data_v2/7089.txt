episode of show so far an hour that simultaneously feels more propulsive and more relaxed than last three he admitted that better part of it was given to exposition with many monologues by characters to expose their motivations and background in his opinion though it was done skillfully and efficiently ign s matt fowler wrote that it was another great exposition heavy episode and that best and most natural scene happened between viserys and doreah in bath out of different storylines many critics singled out scenes on wall as best myles mcnutt from cultural learnings wrote that jon snow s time at wall is maybe my favorite central location of those introduced early in series and it is in large part due to work done in this episode and maureen ryan stated that they re exceptionally well acted and written john bradley is a great addition as samwell tarly and i continue to be very impressed with kit harington s quietly charismatic performance as jon besides acting and writing both agreed that one of reasons night s watch scenes worked for them is that it was easy to connect with story of a group of raw recruits bonding under a hard nosed trainer who tries to prepare them to face great danger closing scene was praised by hitfix s alan sepinwall highlighting michelle fairley s acting as catelyn gathers allies to arrest tyrion references external links cripples bastards and
