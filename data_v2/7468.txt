oregon caves national monument and preserve is a protected area in northern siskiyou mountains of southwestern oregon in united states 4 554 acre 1 843 ha park including marble cave is 20 miles 32 km east of cave junction on oregon route 46 protected area managed by national park service nps is in southwestern josephine county near oregon california border elijah davidson a resident of nearby williams discovered cave in 1874 over next two decades private investors failed in efforts to run successful tourist ventures at publicly owned site after passage of antiquities act by united states congress in 1909 president william howard taft established oregon caves national monument to be managed by united states forest service usfs growing popularity of automobile construction of paved highways and promotion of tourism by boosters from grants pass led to large increases in cave visitation during late 1920s and thereafter among attractions at remote monument is oregon caves chateau a six story hotel built in a rustic style in 1934 it is a national historic landmark and is part of oregon caves historic district within monument nps which assumed control of monument in 1933 offers tours of cave from mid april through early november in 2014 protected area was expanded by about and re designated a national monument and preserve at same time segment of creek that flows through cave was renamed for mythological styx and added to national wild and scenic rivers system oregon caves is a solutional cave with passages totaling about formed in marble parent rock was originally limestone that metamorphosed to marble during geologic processes that created klamath mountains including although limestone formed about 190 million years ago cave itself is no older than a few million years valued as a tourist cave cavern also has scientific value sections of cave that are not on tour routes contain fossils of national importance activities at park include cave touring hiking photography and wildlife viewing one of park trails leads through forest to big tree which at is widest douglas fir known in oregon lodging and food are available at chateau and in cave

known passages totaling about in length eight separate smaller caves have also been discovered in monument runoff from heavily wooded monument forms small headwater streams of illinois river a major tributary of rogue river one of five small springs in monument becomes upper cave creek which flows on surface before disappearing into its bed and entering cave supplemented by water entering cave from above stream emerges from main entrance as cave creek within cave cave creek is known as river styx named for river styx of greek mythology connecting earth to underworld in late 2014 congress added river styx to national wild and scenic rivers system which added a level of protection aimed at keeping stream free flowing in perpetuity it is only subterranean river in wild rivers system history archeologists believe first humans to inhabit rogue river region were nomadic hunters and gatherers radiocarbon dating suggests that they arrived in southwestern oregon at least 8 500 years ago at least 1 500 years before first contact with whites natives established permanent villages along streams even so no evidence has been found to suggest that any of native peoples such as takelma who lived along rogue and applegate rivers in 19th century used cave largely bypassed by early non native explorers fur traders and settlers because of its remote location region attracted newcomers in quantity when prospectors found gold near jacksonville in rogue river valley in 1851 this led to creation of jackson county in 1852 and after gold discoveries near waldo in illinois river valley creation of josephine county named for daughter of a gold miner even with an influx of miners and of settlers who farmed donation land claims josephine county s population was only 1 204 in 1870 upright thumb alt formal half length photo of a bearded man of about 70 thomas condon a university of oregon geology professor who visited cave with his students in 1884 elijah jones davidson who discovered cave in 1874 had emigrated from illinois to oregon with his parents who eventually settled along williams creek in josephine county williams as community came to be called is about northeast of cave only a few people visited cave during next decade among them was thomas condon professor of geology at university of oregon guided by davidson s brother in 1884 he and a group of students hiked from williams to cavern which they inspected by candlelight shortly thereafter walter burch an acquaintance of davidson family tried to develop cave as a business burch and his partners opened what they called limestone caves and charged visitors 1 each for a guided cave trip a camping spot pasture for horses and cave water they described as medicinal although burch and others hacked crude trails to cave from cave junction and williams trip was too difficult for most tourists and limestone caves ceased operations in 1888 in early 1890s oregon caves improvement company headed by alfonso b smith of san diego and two men from oregon tried to raise capital for a larger tourist business at oregon caves smith made outlandish claims about cave and its business potential saying that it was long that an ordinary horse and buggy could be driven through of it that it had 600 separate chambers and that company planned to build something like a streetcar line from williams to cave smith succeeded in wooing san francisco examiner which twice sent reporters to site on second visit there was an orgy of destruction in which passages were widened formations broken or deliberately removed and directional arrows added to cave walls after smith had spent all of company s money and borrowed more in its name he disappeared in 1894 and business collapsed neither burch nor smith had owned cave or land around it which belonged to public beginning in 1890s federal government began regulating use of public lands like these in 1903 president theodore roosevelt designated millions of acres of forest lands for protection including what became siskiyou national forest which surrounds cave usfs was created in 1905 to manage these reserves three years later congress passed antiquities act which allowed president to designate protected areas called national monuments on public lands in 1909 president william howard taft established oregon caves national monument to be managed by usfs documents oregon historical quarterly vol 20 1919 a year later usfs employed men to guard cave and to serve as tour guides isolated and difficult to reach monument initially attracted few visitors by 1920 only 1 800 for year situation changed markedly when large numbers of americans began to travel by automobile on roads paid for largely with government funds one highway connected grants pass with california coast at crescent city another new road oregon caves highway led from grants pass crescent city highway to cave campaigns to attract car driving tourists included those of cavemen a booster group from grants pass that dressed in animal skins posed along tour routes and staged annual events to promote monument by 1928 number of visitors to cave had risen to about 24 000 a year thumb left upright chateau in 2009 alt a rustic multi story hotel sheathed in tree bark rests in a forest behind a reflecting pool visitors need for overnight lodging led to creation of public and private campsites and rustic cabins along highways near cave junction and monument in 1923 usfs signed a contract with oregon caves company based in grants pass to run cave tours and improve park accommodations public private partnerships between usfs or nps and concessionaires continued in various forms at oregon caves into 21st century chalet a building with a kitchen dining room gift shop ticket sales area and a dormitory for women on oregon caves company staff was completed later that year three years later company added seven two bedroom cabins for tourists and a dormitory for male employees in 1928 an oregon caves bill written by usfs and introduced by senator charles mcnary of oregon won congressional approval it provided funds for electric lights a power plant a system of pipes and hoses to wash mud from cave and an artificial exit tunnel to eliminate crowding that occurred when two groups on round trip tours had to pass one another tunnel was completed in 1931 management of monument was transferred from forest service to nps in 1933 and a six story hotel oregon caves chateau was completed at site in 1934 gust a builder from grants pass oversaw construction of chateau and some of park s other buildings which he designed in a rustic style mason manufacturing of los angeles produced chateau s furniture in a style called monterey valued in 21st century at up to 5 000 for a single chair during 1930s and early 1940s civilian conservation corps ccc installed water and telephone lines improved trails and worked on landscaping at park chalet was rebuilt in 1942 to include a third story and a larger dormitory for women although chateau suffered 100 000 in damage from a 1964 flood it was repaired by 1968 a total of one million people had visited cave in 1987 chateau was declared a national historic landmark and in 1992 of monument including chateau and other rustic structures were listed as oregon caves historic district on national register of historic places in 2001 nps began running cave tours formerly offered by private contractors and two years later all structures at monument became public property managed by nps illinois valley community development organization ivcdo a non profit organization based in cave junction runs monument s gift shop in 2014 protected area was expanded by that was transferred from rogue river siskiyou national forest to create national monument and preserve preserve consists of forest subalpine meadows mountains and creeks formerly managed by usfs and now by nps named features within

large cave chamber called miller s chapel most caves created from dissolved rocks are formed in limestone or dolomite but oregon caves was formed in marble of more than 3 900 cave systems managed by nps only those in oregon caves national monument and preserve kings canyon national park and great basin national park have marble caves parent rock in which cave developed was formed about 190 million years ago as limestone that was part of a tectonic plate beneath pacific ocean granitic plutons intruded this part of ocean crust applegate terrane about 160 million years ago as oceanic crust carrying terrane subducted under north american plate terrane accreted onto north american plate and limestone was subjected to heat and pressure that metamorphosed it to marble further tectonic movements eventually lifted marble to about above sea level marble block containing cave is at least long wide and about high cave s creation took place long after marble formed as groundwater seeped into cracks in marble it eventually dissolved enough rock to expand some of cracks to size of tunnels generally age of a cave cannot be determined directly because cave itself is an empty space but scientists can sometimes determine age of speleothems or sediments in a cave an early 21st century study of development in oregon caves focused on past 380 000 years based on available evidence cave is thought to be at least a million years old and probably not much older than a few million years calcite crystals in oregon caves thumb left alt a cluster of needle shaped rock crystals on a cave wall marble has a more coarse grained texture than limestone but both are made of calcite caco3 caves often develop when slightly acidic groundwater dissolves calcite along natural fractures in rock a reversal of dissolving process can create and dripstone such as stalactites which hang from cave ceilings like icicles and stalagmites cone shaped masses that form on cave floors usually directly below stalactites these structures form when acidic groundwater with a high concentration of dissolved calcite drips slowly from ceiling of an air filled cave becomes less acidic and leaves some of its calcite behind as a solid precipitate oregon caves includes a variety of cave formations created through precipitation of calcite although many of speleothems in public sections of cave have been broken discolored by human skin oils or otherwise damaged narrow twisting passages of show cave have been largely preserved cave is not pure marble streams have deposited silts and gravels from surface dikes of diorite an igneous rock that was part of a pluton and shales and sandstones sedimentary rocks interbedded with marble are part of cave monument has more than 50 paleontological sites ranging in age from late pleistocene to holocene a fossil of a grizzly bear more than 50 000 years old and a jaguar fossil between 40 000 and 20 000 years old have been found in cave other fossils include amphibians and rare finds of mountain beaver and blue grouse monument s mammalian fossils found in non public sections of cave are of national significance climate monument is in mountains at elevations varying from above sea level park s nearness to ocean contributes to its relatively mild climate temperatures generally range between in winter and in summer inside cave temperature is
