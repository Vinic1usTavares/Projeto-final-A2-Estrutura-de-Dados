lgbt themes in speculative fiction include lesbian gay bisexual or transgender lgbt themes in science fiction fantasy horror fiction and related genres such elements may include an lgbt character as protagonist or a major character or explorations of sexuality or gender that deviate from hetero normative science fiction and fantasy have traditionally been puritanical genres aimed at a male readership and can be more restricted than non genre literature by their conventions of characterisation and effect that these conventions have on depictions of sexuality and gender however speculative fiction also gives authors and readers freedom to imagine societies that are different from real life cultures this freedom makes speculative fiction a useful means of examining sexual bias by forcing reader to reconsider his or her heteronormative cultural assumptions it has also been claimed by critics such as nicola griffith that lgbt readers identify strongly with mutants aliens and other outsider characters found in speculative fiction before 1960s explicit sexuality of any kind was rare in speculative fiction as editors who controlled what was published attempted to protect their perceived key market of adolescent male readers as readership broadened it became possible to include characters who were undisguised homosexuals though these tended to be villains and lesbians remained almost entirely unrepresented in 1960s science fiction and fantasy began to reflect changes prompted by civil rights movement and emergence of a counterculture new wave and feminist science fiction authors realised cultures in which homosexuality bisexuality and a variety of gender models were norm and in which sympathetic depictions of alternative sexuality were commonplace from 1980s onwards homosexuality gained much wider mainstream acceptance and was often incorporated into otherwise conventional speculative fiction stories works emerged that went beyond simple representation of homosexuality to explorations of specific issues relevant to lgbt community this development was helped by growing number of openly gay or lesbian authors and their early acceptance by speculative fiction fandom specialist gay publishing presses and a number of awards recognising lgbt achievements in genre emerged and by twenty first century blatant homophobia was no longer considered acceptable by most readers of speculative fiction there was a concurrent increase in representation of homosexuality within non literary forms of speculative fiction inclusion of lgbt themes in comic books television and film continues to attract media attention and controversy while perceived lack of sufficient representation along with unrealistic depictions provokes criticism from lgbt sources critical analysis thumb zephyr and greek mythology which often features homosexuality is a source for much modern speculative fiction and mythic figures continue to appear in fantasy stories as genres

science fiction yale university press 1979 when extrapolation involves sexuality or gender it can force reader to reconsider his or her heteronormative cultural assumptions freedom to imagine societies different from real life cultures makes sf an effective tool for examining sexual bias in science fiction such estranging features include technologies that significantly alter sex or reproduction in fantasy such features include figures such as mythological deities and heroic archetypes who are not limited by preconceptions of human sexuality and gender allowing them to be reinterpreted marchesani pp 1 6 sf has also depicted a plethora of alien methods of reproduction and sex some of which can be viewed as homo or bisexual through a human binary gender lens in spite of

fans consider them separate genres film and television in general speculative fiction on television and film has lagged behind literature in its portrayals of homosexuality sexual relationships in major speculative fiction franchises have generally been depicted as heterosexual in nature inter species and inter ethnic relationships have been commonly depicted while homosexual relationships and transgender characters are more rare film lgbt characters in films began to appear more regularly only in 1980s films in late 1920s and early 1930s reflected liberal attitudes of day and could include sexual innuendos and references to homosexuality but from 1930s until 1968 film industry in us followed production code code spelled out what was morally acceptable for a public audience references to sexual perversions such as homosexuality were forbidden virtually all motion pictures produced in united states adhered to code doherty thomas code before da vinci washington post may 20 2006 and similar censorship was common in other countries for example an early version of first lesbian vampire film dracula s daughter a film described in celluloid closet as presenting homosexuality as a predatory weakness was rejected by british board of film censors in 1935 who said in part dracula s daughter would require half a dozen languages to adequately express its beastliness horror author anne rice has named dracula s daughter as a direct inspiration for her own homoerotic vampire fiction naming a bar in her novel queen of damned dracula s daughter in honor of film films produced under such censorship could only introduce homosexuality as a disguised undercurrent and still flirted with controversy in doing so such as in cult horror film white zombie less stringent rules of post hayes film industry allowed sexuality to be more open and cinema as a whole became more sexually explicit from 1980s in particular but aimed to purely to entertain rather than exploring underlying sexual dynamics much of sex in speculative fiction film is merely intended to titillate a review of fantasy films identified 10 15 as softcore pornography clute grant p xxx pornography but it remained rare to see gay characters in speculative fiction films horror films that had sex as one of their major preoccupations continued to be more leniently censored due to perception of being unserious and lightweight vampires in particular have been described as obvious erotic metaphors and as a result numerous vampire films since 1970s strongly imply or explicitly show lesbianism following inspiration

roland emmerich is openly gay still there are some curious cases like cthulhu 2007 a horror thriller film based on works of h p lovecraft in which main character is gay but it isn t main thing

characters who were on a covert mission to a mars colony in season 4 xena warrior princess fantasy television series introduced its main characters xena and gabrielle as close companions fan speculation about lesbian overtones led to them becoming lesbian icons although lesbian content remained at subtext level series has been cited as trail blazing and breaking down barriers allowing production of subsequent programming such as buffy vampire slayer which introduced a number of lgbt characters most famous is major character willow and her partners tara and kennedy although praised for their healthy relationship and being first lesbian relationship between major characters on prime time television others criticised use of witchcraft as a metaphor for lesbian sex tara s death

that he hopes to defy audience expectations of characters without making it political or dull this is going to be a very bisexual programme i want to knock down barriers so we can t define which of

anything with a hole jack doesn t categorise people if he fancies you he ll do it with you inclusion of significant lgbt characters in modern speculative fiction television series has not been universal for example star trek franchise s lack of same sex relationships has long been a sore spot with lgbt fandom some of whom have organised boycotts against franchise to protest its failure to include lgbt characters they also point out that gene roddenberry had made statements in later life favourable to acceptance of homosexuality and portrayal of same sex relationships in star trek but that franchise s coverage has remained meagre within star trek canon there had been little lgbt representation until star trek discovery in 2017 international review of science fiction ran a feature entitled prisoners of dogma and prejudice why there are no g l b t characters in star trek deep space 9 however gender identity has occasionally been treated as an issue within new star trek series to be dealt with as a theme in individual episodes such as 1995 star trek deep space nine episode rejoined which was first episode of show to feature a same sex relationship and romantic same sex kiss
