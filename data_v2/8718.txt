wetzler report also see when war refugee board published it with considerable delay in november 1944 new york herald tribune described it as most shocking document ever issued by a united states government agency while it confirmed material in earlier reports from polish and other escapees historian miroslav karny wrote that it was unique in its unflinching detail there was a delay of several weeks before report was distributed widely enough to gain attention of governments mass transports of hungary s jews to auschwitz began on 15 may 1944 at a rate of 12 000 people a day most went straight to gas chambers vrba argued until end of his life that deportees might have refused to board trains or at least that their panic would have disrupted transports had report been distributed widely and sooner from late june and into july 1944 material from vrba wetzler report appeared in newspapers and radio broadcasts in united states and europe particularly in switzerland prompting world leaders to appeal to hungarian regent miklos horthy to halt deportations on 2 july american and british forces bombed budapest and on 7 july horthy ordered an end to mass deportations possibly fearing he would be held responsible after war by then 437 000 jews had been deported almost entire jewish population of hungarian countryside but another 200 000 in budapest were saved for 437 000

clearing out any blood and excrement then sorting through new arrivals property many would bring kitchen utensils and clothes for different seasons suggesting to vrba that they believed stories about resettlement it took 2 3 hours to clear out freight cars by which time most of new arrivals were already dead a few were selected to work as slave labour but those deemed unfit for work were taken by truck in groups of 100 to gas chamber including children women with children elderly and sick he estimated that 90 percent were selected to die vrba told claude lanzmann in 1978 that process relied on

wear his own clothes he was also able to speak to new arrivals who had been selected as slave labour and he had to write reports about registration process which allowed him to ask questions and take notes estimates of numbers killed from his room in biia vrba could see lorries drive towards gas chambers in his estimate 10 percent of each transport was selected to work and rest killed during his time on judenrampe from 18 august 1942 to 7 june 1943 he saw at least 200 trains arrive each containing 1 000 5 000 people according to an interview in 1978 for documentary film shoah 1985 in a 1998 paper he wrote that he had witnessed 100 300 trains arrive each locomotive pulling 20 40 freight cars and sometimes 50 60 he calculated that between spring of 1942 and 15 january 1944 1 5 million had been killed according to vrba wetzler report 1 765 000 were killed in auschwitz between april 1942 and april 1944 in 1961 vrba swore in an affidavit for trial of adolf eichmann that he believed 2 5 million had died overall in camp plus or minus 10 percent vrba s estimates are higher than those of holocaust historians but in line with estimates from ss officers and auschwitz survivors including members of sonderkommando early estimates ranged from 1 to 6 5 million rudolf hoss longest serving auschwitz commandant said in 1946 that three million had died in camp although he revised his view later in 1946 main commission for investigation of german crimes in poland estimated four million later scholarly estimates were lower according to polish historian franciszek piper writing in 1995 most historians place figure at 1 to 1 5 million his own estimate was that 1 082 000 died in auschwitz between 1940 and 1945 rounded up to 1 1 million which he regards as minimum he calculated that nearly 88 percent of those deported to auschwitz were killed against vrba s 90 percent piper s estimate of death toll for period april 1942 to april 1944 was 450 000 against vrba s 1 765 000 yad

according to vrba a kapo by name of yup a former trade unionist from berlin told him on 15 january 1944 that he was part of a group of prisoners building a new railway line to lead straight into crematoria yup said he had overheard from an ss officer that a million hungarian jews would soon arrive and that old ramp could not handle numbers a railway line leading directly to crematoria would cut thousands of truck journeys from old ramp in addition vrba heard directly courtesy of drunk ss guards he wrote that they would soon have hungarian salami when dutch jews arrived they brought cheese likewise there were sardines from french jews and halva and olives from greeks now it was hungarian salami also see vrba wrote i believed that if i could escape and spread news of fate awaiting potential candidates for resettlement i could make some significant difference i felt that i might undermine one of principle foundations secrecy of operation upon which success of mass murder process rested vrba had been thinking of escape for two years but was now determined a russian captain dmitri advised him he would need russian tobacco soaked in petrol then dried to fool dogs a watch which he could use as a compass matches to make food and salt because salt and potatoes would be nutrition enough vrba began studying layout of camps both auschwitz i and ii consisted of inner camps where prisoners slept surrounded by a six yard wide trench full of water and high voltage barbed wire fences area was lit at night and guarded by ss in watch towers when a prisoner was reported missing guards searched for three days and nights he reasoned that key to a successful escape would be to remain hidden just outside inner perimeter until search was called off his first escape was planned for 26 january 1944 with charles unglick a french army captain but rendezvous did not work out unglick tried to escape alone and was killed ss left his body on display for two days seated on a stool

concentration camp in terezin czechoslovakia czech republic since 1993 that they had been allowed to live in auschwitz for six months was unusual not least because most women with children were killed immediately correspondence found after war between adolf eichmann s office and international red cross suggested that germans had set up family camp as a model for a planned red cross visit to auschwitz group was housed in relatively good conditions in block near main gate although in six months they were held there 1 000 died despite better conditions they did not have their heads shaved and children were given lessons and access to better food including milk and white bread after warning fredy hirsch supervisor of group s children s barracks that they were about to be killed vrba urged him to organize an uprising but hirsch died shortly thereafter of a barbiturate overdose on 7 march according to vrba wetzler report group of 3 791 was gassed except for 11 twins kept alive for medical experiments according to martin gilbert 15 others also survived a week before gassing group had been told to write postdated postcards to relatives explaining how they were doing and asking

jews mention term extermination camp but it had seemed like a myth i immediately believed report because it made sense he wrote in 2011 nothing else made sense dry factual nearly scientific language

i and others in building in sip street must have lost our minds under pressure it was same with other relatives and friends middle aged men with property and family did not believe it while younger

result of that meeting on 25 june pope pius xii sent a telegram directly to miklos horthy asking him to ensure that sufferings endured by a large number of unfortunate people because of their

into birkenau should be bombed weissmandl had already suggested this on 16 may 1944 in a message to american orthodox jewish rescue committee vrba wrote about incongruity of visiting weissmandl at his yeshiva which he assumed could exist only because it was under protection of slovak government and germans visibility of yeshiva life in center of bratislava less than 150 miles south of auschwitz was in my eyes a typical piece of goebbels inspired activity as well as both a tragic and comic deception there before eyes of world pupils of rabbi could study rules of jewish ethics while their own

chamber christie asked about height and angle when vrba told christie he was not willing to discuss his book unless jury had read it judge swiftly corrected him dr vrba you are not to give orders as to what this jury will do and what you will do or not do christie also argued that vrba s knowledge of gas chambers was secondhand according to vrba s deposition for adolf eichmann s trial in 1961 he obtained information about gas chambers and crematoria from sonderkommando filip muller and others who worked there something that muller confirmed in 1979 christie asked whether he had seen anyone gassed vrba replied that he had watched people being taken into buildings and had seen ss officers throw in gas canisters after them therefore i concluded it was not a kitchen or a bakery but it was a gas chamber it is possible they are still there or that there is a tunnel and they are now in china otherwise they were gassed thumb upright george klein in spring of 1987 swedish hungarian biochemist

and viewed him as a hero he told vrba how he had tried himself in spring of 1944 to convince others in budapest of report s veracity but no one had believed him which inclined him to view that vrba was wrong to argue that jews would have acted had they known about death camps vrba said that klein s experience illustrated his point distributing report via informal channels had lent it no authority klein asked vrba how he could function in pleasant somewhat provincial atmosphere of university of british columbia where no one had any concept of what he had been through vrba told him

hungarian jews vrba is clear in his memoir that warning hungarian community was one of motives for his escape in january 1944 he wrote a kapo told him germans were building a new railway line to bring jews of hungary to auschwitz birkenau historians have disputed this because there is no mention of hungarian jews in vrba wetzler report miroslav karny argued in 1998 that long after war was over vrba wanted to testify about deportations out of a sense of longing to force world to face magnitude of nazis crimes and that this desire led to a degree of embellishment randolph l braham also questioned vrba s later recollections although neither karny nor braham doubt veracity of vrba wetzler report according to vrba wetzler report a large compound was being built at auschwitz work is now proceeding on a still larger compound which is to be added later on to already existing camp purpose of this extensive planning is not known to us it also stated when we left on april 7 1944 we heard that large convoys of greek jews were expected vrba s statement that he had escaped to warn hungarian jews was first published on 27 february 1961 in first installment of a five article series for daily herald in england written up by a journalist alan bestic in second installment following day vrba described having overheard ss say they were looking forward to hungarian salami a reference to provisions hungarian jews could be expected to bring dr oskar neumann head of jewish council in slovakia whose interviews with vrba and wetzler in april 1944 helped to form vrba wetzler report wrote in his memoir in 1946 im schatten des todes published in 1956 that men had indeed mentioned hungarian salami these chaps did also report that recently an enormous construction activity had been initiated in camp and very recently ss often spoke about looking forward to arrival of hungarian salami and citing neumann oskar 1956 im schatten des todes tel aviv 178 181 and notes 21 and 27 vrba wrote that original slovak version of vrba wetzler report some of which he wrote by hand may have referred to imminent hungarian deportations that version of report did not survive it was german translation that was copied around world vrba wrote that he had argued strongly for inclusion of hungarian deportations but he recalled oskar krasniansky who translated report into german saying that only actual deaths should be recorded not speculation to lend report maximum credibility he could not recall which argument prevailed reprinted in vrba also wrote that rabbi michael dov weissmandl and gisi fleischmann of slovak jewish council referred to report and hungarian jews in a five page letter sent by courier in may 1944 to a swiss branch of jewish youth movement in december and january a special railway line has already been built leading into halls of annihilation in order to prepare new work of annihilation of hungarian jews that was said by knowledgeable people there in that hell

escape in april this was a source of great distress to vrba for rest of his life between 15 may and 7 july 1944 437 000 hungarian jews were deported to auschwitz most killed on arrival in epilogue of his book i cannot forgive 1963 he asks why did hundreds of thousands walk without resistance to gas chambers in his view deportees boarded trains hoping to land in some sort of jewish reservation or ghetto where they would have a respite from incredibly brutal terror inflicted upon them by horthy regime s hungarian gendarmerie arguing that they would have run or fought had they known they were being sent to their deaths or at least that panic would have slowed transports vrba alleged that rudolf kastner of budapest aid and rescue committee who had a copy of vrba wetzler report by 3 may 1944 at latest had held back report to avoid jeopardizing complex and mostly futile negotiations with adolf eichmann dieter wisliceny and other ss officers including blood for goods deal to exchange jews for money and goods vrba argued that in taking part in these negotiations ss was simply placating jewish leadership to avoid rebellion within community also see thumb left malchiel gruenwald front waving supreme court of israel 22 june 1955 in i cannot forgive vrba drew attention to 1954 trial in jerusalem of malchiel gruenwald a hungarian jew who had emigrated to palestine in 1938 in early 1950s gruenwald who strongly opposed party in power in israel began self publishing a provocative political pamphlet target of which in august 1952 was rudolf kastner who had become a civil servant in israel kastner had bribed ss to allow over 1 600 jews to leave hungary for switzerland on kastner train on 30 june 1944 at height of holocaust in hungary he had also testified on behalf of one of ss officers kurt becher at nuremberg trials gruenwald called for kastner to be liquidated accusing him of having collaborated with ss so that he could escape from hungary with a select few including his family in attorney general of government of israel v malchiel gruenwald israeli government sued gruenwald for libel on kastner s behalf on 22 june 1955 in a 275 page opinion judge benjamin halevi one of judges at trial of adolf eichmann decided mostly in gruenwald s favour ruling that kastner had sold his soul to devil for halevi at eichmann trial see masses of ghetto jews boarded deportation trains in total obedience halevi wrote ignorant of real destination and trusting false declaration that they were being transferred to work camps in hungary kastner train had been a pay off judge said and protection of certain jews had been an inseparable part of maneuvers in psychological war to destroy jews kastner had accepted extermination of ordinary people and abandoned them to their fates judge said also see israeli historian tom segev called ruling one of most heartless in history of israel perhaps most heartless ever kastner was assassinated outside his home in tel aviv in march 1957 as a result of verdict which was partly overturned by supreme court of israel in 1958 vrba agreed with gruenwald s criticism of kastner in addition he blamed slovak jewish council for having failed to resist deportation of jews from slovakia in 1942 when he was sent to majdanek concentration camp in occupied poland in june that year council knew he alleged that jews were being killed in poland but did nothing to warn community and even assisted by drawing up lists of names bauer argues that council did know that being sent to poland meant severe danger for jews but at that stage did not know about final solution it is true bauer writes that several members of jewish council under karol hochberg head of council s department for special tasks worked with ss offering secretarial and technical help to draw up lists of jews to be deported lists supplied by slovak government other members of jewish council warned jews to flee and later formed a resistance working group which in december 1943 took over jewish council with oskar neumann lawyer who helped organize vrba wetzler report as its leader vrba did not accept these distinctions he referred to jewish leaders in slovakia and hungary as quislings who were essential to smooth running of deportations creation of quislings voluntary or otherwise was in fact an important feature of nazi policy in every occupied country in his view would anyone have got me alive to auschwitz if i had had this information he wrote would thousands and thousands of able bodied jewish men have sent their children wives mothers to auschwitz from all over europe if they knew vrba further explained his views on zionist jewish councils in a 1972 tv interview in which he said that that zionist movement of europe played a very important role in mass extermination of jews indeed i believe that without cooperation of zionists it would have been a much more difficult task vrba then went on to say nazism and zionism had something in common they both preached that jews don t belong to europe but to palestine and that responses thumb upright left alt photograph yehuda bauer vrba s position that jewish leadership in hungary and slovakia had betrayed their communities was supported by anglo canadian historian john s conway a colleague of his at university of british columbia who from 1979 wrote a series of papers in defence of vrba s views in 1996 vrba repeated allegations in an article die missachtete warnung betrachtungen uber den auschwitz bericht von 1944 in vierteljahrshefte fur zeitgeschichte a prominent german academic journal to which israeli historian yehuda bauer responded bauer also responded to conway in 2006 also see bauer wrote that many survivors share vrba s and conway s view but that is patently wrong arguing that vrba s wild attacks on kastner and on slovak underground are all a historical and simply wrong from start he wrote that by time vrba wetzler report had been prepared it was too late for anything to alter nazis deportation plans jews in hungary knew about mass murder in poland he argued even if they did not know particulars about auschwitz even if they had seen vrba wetzler report they would have been forced onto trains by guards with weapons and dogs bauer cautioned about need to distinguish between receipt of information and its internalization during holocaust countless individuals received information and rejected it suppressed it or rationalized about it were thrown into despair without any possibility of acting on it or seemingly internalized it and then behaved as though it had never reached them vrba in response alleged that bauer was one of israeli historians who in defence of israeli establishment had downplayed vrba s place in holocaust historiography for a response see michael fleming argued in 2014 against view that hungarian jews had sufficient access to information after german invasion of hungary in march 1944 british government s political warfare executive pwe had directed bbc s hungarian service to run allied warnings to german government about deportation of people jews were not mentioned london based jewish chronicle ran a story on 7 april 1944 headlined zero hour in hungary and on 28 april headline 300 000 hungarian jews arrested hideous process begins but on 13 april pwe decided against broadcasting warnings directly to hungarian jews on grounds that it would cause unnecessary alarm and that they must in any case be only too well informed of measures that may be taken against them fleming writes that this was a mistake germans had tricked jewish community into thinking they were being sent to poland to work first mention of extermination camps in pwe s directives to bbc s hungarian service came on 8 june 1944 according to randolph l braham writing in 2011 by time vrba wetzler report was available jews of hungary were in a helpless state marked hermetically isolated and expropriated in northeastern hungary and carpatho ruthenia women children and elderly were living in crowded ghettos in unsanitary conditions and with little food while younger men were in military service in serbia and ukraine there was nothing they could have done to resist braham argued even if they had known about report vrba was criticized in 2001 in a collection of articles in hebrew leadership under duress working group in slovakia 1942 1944 by a group of israeli activists and historians including bauer with ties to slovak community introduction written by a survivor refers to bunch of mockers pseudo historians and historians who argue that bratislava working group collaborated with ss a baseless allegation that ignores constraints under which jews in slovakia and hungary were living vrba referred to as peter vrba is described as head of these mockers although introduction makes clear that his heroism is beyond doubt it concludes we czechoslovakian descendants who personally experienced war cannot

opinion of historians arguing that they did not know enough about auschwitz elena 5 march 1990 new list of holocaust victims reignites dispute over figures jewish telegraphic agency bauer referred to vrba s memoir as not a memoir in usual sense alleging that it contains excerpts of conversations of which there is no chance that they are accurate and it has elements of a second hand story that does not necessarily correspond with reality when writing about his personal experiences vrba s account is an important and true one bauer wrote a document of significant historical value but he argued that vrba was not justified in viewing himself as an expert citing a letter from yehuda bauer to ben ami translator of vrba s memoir vrba s place in holocaust historiography in vrba s view israeli historians tried to erase his name from holocaust historiography because of his views about kastner and hungarian and slovak jewish councils some of whom went on to hold prominent positions in israel when ruth linn first tried to visit vrba in british columbia he practically chased her out of his office according to uri dromi saying he had no interest in your state of and linn wrote in her book about vrba escaping auschwitz 2004 that vrba s and wetzler s names had been omitted from hebrew textbooks or their contribution minimized standard histories refer to escape by two young slovak jews two chaps and two young men and represent them as emissaries of polish underground in auschwitz dr oskar neumann of slovak jewish council referred to them in his memoir as these chaps oskar krasniansky who translated vrba wetzler report into german mentioned them only as two young people in his deposition for trial of adolf eichmann in 1961 there was also a tendency to refer to vrba wetzler report as auschwitz protocols which is a combination of vrba wetzler and two other reports 1990 edition of encyclopedia of holocaust published by yad vashem in israel did name vrba and wetzler but in 2001 edition they are two jewish prisoners vrba s memoir was not translated into hebrew until 1998 35 years after its publication in english as of that year there was no english or hebrew version of vrba wetzler report at yad vashem holocaust martyrs and heroes remembrance authority in jerusalem an issue museum attributed to lack of funding there was a hungarian translation but it did not note names of its authors and linn wrote could be found only in a file that dealt with rudolf kastner linn herself born and raised in israel and schooled at prestigious hebrew school first learned about vrba when she watched claude lanzmann s film shoah 1985 for which vrba was interviewed in 1998 she polled 594 students at university of haifa either third year undergraduates or first year graduate students 98 percent said that no one had ever escaped from auschwitz and remainder did not know escapees names this failure to acknowledge vrba has played into hands of holocaust deniers who have tried to undermine his testimony about gas chambers in 2005 uri dromi of israel democracy institute responded that there were at least four israeli books on holocaust that mention vrba and that wetzler s testimony is recounted at length in livia rothkirchen s slovakia destruction of slovak jewry published by yad vashem in 1961 robert rozett head librarian at yad vashem and author of entry on auschwitz report in encyclopedia of holocaust said of vrba controversy in 2005 there are people who come into subject from a certain angle and think that they ve uncovered truth a historian who deals seriously with subject understands that truth is complex and multifaceted selected works holocaust 1998 science and holocaust focus university of haifa edited version of vrba s speech when he received
