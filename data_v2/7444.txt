lithuanian seimas or seimas was a sejm parliament of polish lithuanian commonwealth that was held in warsaw between 1788 and 1792 its principal aim became to restore sovereignty to and reform commonwealth politically and economically sejm s great achievement was adoption of constitution of 3 may 1791 often described as europe s first modern written national constitution and world s second after united states constitution polish constitution was designed to redress long standing political defects of federative polish lithuanian commonwealth and its system of golden liberties constitution introduced political equality between townspeople and nobility and placed peasants under protection of government thus mitigating worst abuses of serfdom constitution abolished pernicious parliamentary institutions such as liberum veto which at one time had placed a sejm at mercy of any deputy who might choose or be bribed by an interest or foreign power to undo all legislation that had been passed by that sejm may 3rd constitution sought to supplant existing anarchy fostered by some of country s reactionary magnates with a more egalitarian and democratic constitutional monarchy

indeed largest state on continent by 18th century commonwealth s state machinery became increasingly dysfunctional government was near collapse giving rise to term polish anarchy and country was managed by provincial assemblies and magnates many historians hold that a major cause of commonwealth s downfall was peculiar parliamentary institution of liberum veto free veto which since 1652 had in principle permitted any sejm deputy to nullify all legislation that had been adopted by that sejm by early 18th century magnates of poland and lithuania controlled state or rather they managed to ensure that no reforms would be carried out that might weaken their privileged status golden freedoms matters were not helped by inefficient monarchs elected to commonwealth throne around start of 18th century nor by neighboring countries which were content with deteriorated state of commonwealth s affairs and abhorred thought of a resurgent and democratic power on their borders enlightenment european cultural movement had gained great influence in certain commonwealth circles during reign of its last king stanislaw august poniatowski 1764 95 which roughly coincided with enlightenment in poland in 1772 first partition of poland earliest of three successive 18th century partitions of commonwealth territory that eventually removed poland from map of europe shocked inhabitants of commonwealth and made it clear to progressive minds that commonwealth must either reform or perish in last three decades preceding great sejm there was a rising interest among progressive thinkers in constitutional reform even before first partition a polish noble michal wielhorski an envoy of bar confederation had been sent to ask french philosophes gabriel de mably and jean jacques rousseau to offer suggestions on a new constitution for a new poland mably had submitted his recommendations government and laws of poland in 1770 1771 rousseau had finished his considerations on government of poland in 1772 when first partition was already underway notable works advocating need to reform and presenting specific solutions were published in commonwealth itself by polish lithuanian thinkers such as stanislaw konarski founder of collegium nobilium on effective conduct of debates in ordinary sejms 1761 1763 jozef composer of polish national anthem political thoughts on civil liberties 1775 patriotic letters 1778 1778 hugo kollataj head of kollataj s forge party anonymous letters to stanislaw malachowski 1788 1789 political law of polish nation 1790 and stanislaw staszic remarks on life of jan zamoyski 1787 also seen as crucial to giving upcoming reforms their moral and political support were ignacy s satires of great sejm era proceedings 1789 90 thumb 200px right great sejm official diary a major opportunity for reform seemed to present itself during sejm of 1788 92 which opened on october 6 1788 with 181 deputies and from 1790 in words of may 3 constitution s preamble met in dual number when 171 newly elected sejm deputies joined earlier established sejm on its second day sejm transformed itself into a confederated sejm to make it immune to threat of liberum veto russian tsarina catherine great had issued approval for sejm confederation a while ago at a point she was considering that successful conclusion of this sejm may be necessary if russia would need polish aid in fight against ottoman empire stanislaw malachowski a statesman respected both by most factions was elected as marshal of sejm many supporters of reforms were gathered in patriotic party this group received support from all strata of polish lithuanian society from societal and political elites including some aristocratic magnates through piarist and enlightened catholics to radical left party s conservative or right wing led by progressive magnates such as ignacy potocki his brother stanislaw kostka potocki and prince adam kazimierz czartoryski sought alliance with prussia and advocated opposing king poniatowski patriotic party s centrists including stanislaw malachowski wished accommodation with king liberal left wing polish jacobins led by hugo kollataj hence also known as kollataj s forge looked for support to people of warsaw while king poniatowski also supported some reforms he was initially not allied with this faction represented by potocki who preferred a republican form of a government events in world appeared to play into reformers hands poland s neighbors were too occupied with wars to intervene forcibly in poland with russia and austria engaged in hostilities with ottoman empire russo turkish war and austro turkish war russians also found themselves fighting sweden russo swedish war at first king poniatowski and some reformers hoped to gain russian support for reforms they attempted to draw poland into austro russian alliance seeing a war with ottomans as an opportunity to strengthen commonwealth due to internal russian politics this plan was not implemented spurned by russia poland turned to another potential ally triple alliance represented on polish diplomatic scene primarily by kingdom of prussia this line of reasoning gained support from polish politicians such as ignacy potocki and adam kazimierz czartoryski with new polish prussian alliance seeming to provide security against russian intervention king poniatowski drew closer to leaders of reform minded patriotic party this alliance was also helped as 1790 elections were more supportive of royal faction then potocki s and conservative faction gained enough new seats to threaten reformers if they were to stay divided with mediation of scipione piattoli potocki and poniatowski begun to reach a consensus on a more constitutional monarchy approach and started to draft a constitutional document overall first two years of sejm passed with few major reforms and it was second half of sejm duration that brought major changes 1791 92 thumb 200px royal castle senate chamber where may 3 constitution was adopted elections of autumn 1790 resulted in a new group of deputies joining those already elected a second marshal of sejm was elected kazimierz nestor sapieha as malachowski was seen as associated with reformers sapieha was initially seen as a conservative although he would later switch sides and join reformers doubled number of deputies exceeded capacity of parliament chambers and not all of deputies could secure a seat public interest also grew and entire building and observation galleries were often overcrowded while sejm comprised representatives only of nobility and clergy reformers were supported by burghers townspeople who in fall of 1789 organized a black procession demonstrating their desire to be part of political process taking a cue from similar events in france and with fear that if burghers demands were not met their peaceful protests could turn violent sejm on april 18 1791 adopted a law addressing status of cities and rights of burghers free royal cities act together with legislation on voting rights act on sejmiks of march 24 1791 it became incorporated into final constitution new constitution had been drafted by king with contributions from others including ignacy potocki and hugo kollataj king is credited with authoring general provisions and kollataj with giving work its final shape poniatowski aimed for a constitutional monarchy similar to one in england with strong central government based upon a strong monarch potocki wanted to make parliament sejm most powerful of state s institutions and kollataj for a gentle social revolution enfranchising other classes in addition to till then dominant nobility but doing so without a violent overthrow of old order reforms were opposed by conservative elements including hetmans party reform s advocates threatened with violence from their opponents managed to move debate on new constitution forward by two days from original may 5 while many opposed deputies were still away on easter recess ensuing debate and adoption of constitution of 3 may took place in a quasi coup d etat recall notices were not sent to known opponents of reform while many pro reform deputies arrived early and in secret and royal guard were positioned about royal castle where sejm was gathered to prevent russian supporters from disrupting proceedings on may 3 sejm met with only 182 members present about a half of its dual number or a third if one was to count all individuals eligible to take part in proceedings including senate and king bill was read out and adopted overwhelmingly to enthusiasm of crowds gathered outside work of great sejm did not end with passing of constitution sejm continued to debate and pass legislation building on and clarifying
