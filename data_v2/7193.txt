yeomanry cavalry was mounted component of british volunteer corps a military auxiliary established in late 18th century amid fears of invasion and insurrection during french revolutionary wars a yeoman was a person of respectable standing one social rank below a gentleman and yeomanry was initially a rural county based force members were required to provide their own horses and were recruited mainly from landholders and tenant farmers though middle class also featured prominently in rank and file officers were largely recruited from among nobility and landed gentry a commission generally involved significant personal expense and although social status was an important qualification primary factor was personal wealth from beginning newly rich who found in yeomanry a means of enhancing their social standing were welcomed into officer corps for their ability to support force financially urban recruitment increased towards end of 19th century reflected in early 20th century by increasingly common use of hired mounts yeomanry was first used in support of local authorities to suppress civil unrest most notably during food riots of 1795 its only use in national defence was in 1797 when castlemartin yeomanry helped defeat a small french invasion in battle of fishguard although volunteer corps was disbanded following defeat of napoleon in 1815 yeomanry was retained as a politically reliable force which could be deployed in support of civil authorities it often served as mounted police until middle of 19th century most famously manchester and salford yeomanry was largely responsible for peterloo massacre in which some 17 people were killed and up to 650 were injured while policing a rally for parliamentary reform in manchester in 1819 yeomanry was also deployed against striking colliers in 1820s during swing riots of early 1830s and chartist disturbances of late 1830s and early 1840s exclusive membership set yeomanry apart from population it policed and as better law enforcement options became available yeomanry was increasingly held back for fear that its presence would provoke confrontation its social status made force a popular target for caricature particularly after peterloo and it was often satirised in press in literature and on stage establishment of civilian police forces and renewed invasion scares in middle of 19th century turned focus of yeomanry to national defence but its effectiveness and value in this role was increasingly questioned it declined in strength surviving largely due to its members political influence and willingness to subsidise force financially a series of government committees failed to address force s problems last in 1892 found a place for yeomanry in country s mobilisation scheme but it was not until a succession of failures by regular army during second boer war that yeomanry found a new relevance as mounted infantry it provided nucleus for separate imperial yeomanry and after war yeomanry was re branded en bloc as imperial yeomanry it ceased to exist as a separate institution in 1908 when yeomanry became mounted component of territorial force yeomanry regiments fought mounted and dismounted in both first world war and second world war yeomanry heritage is maintained in 21st century largely by four yeomanry regiments of british army reserve in which many 19th century regiments are represented as squadrons background europe experienced explosive population growth from mid 18th century which in great britain was fed by improved farming methods introduced by agricultural revolution around same time industrial revolution brought increasing urbanisation which led to ever greater demands for food more intensive cultivation required to meet these demands led to increased costs but left agricultural wages same resulting in poverty and starvation in rural communities poverty was also a problem in urban centres as increasing use of machinery put skilled labour out of work meanwhile political system had not kept up with shifting population while once prosperous towns that had become de populated were still able to elect members of parliament mps so called rotten and pocket boroughs major new towns such as birmingham and manchester were not represented poverty and disenfranchisement led to social discontent giving rise to fears that french revolution would provide a model that might be emulated in britain athawes pp 1 3 in 1793 french revolutionary government declared war on great britain adding fear of foreign invasion to that of domestic insurrection and leading to near panic in london regular british army which had already deployed six brigades alongside austrian army in netherlands was not sufficient to defend country and main military reserve militia was considered neither effective nor trustworthy it had been demobilised at conclusion of american revolutionary war in 1783 and in intervening decade it had been subject to cost cutting measures that had left it deficient it was embodied in 1792 as a precautionary measure against insurrection but a body recruited predominantly from among working class was itself suspect to extent that militia units were not trusted to be deployed in their own areas of recruitment until 1795 government had previously resorted to volunteers to augment its forces in 1779 amid fears of a franco spanish invasion though this was short lived and did not long survive end of war in colonies considering that there was not enough time to address militia s deficiencies government turned again to volunteers to bolster nation s defences in 1794 mileham 2003 pp 8 2011 pp 69 73 origins thumb alt painting of yeomanry in hyde park a review of london volunteer cavalry and flying

was traditionally a freeholder of respectable standing one social rank below a gentleman and yeomanry was recruited largely from among landholders and tenant farmers officers were appointed by royal commission in person of lord lieutenant and generally came from nobility and landed gentry mileham 2003 p 10 yeomen were expected to provide their own mounts which represented a high financial barrier to entry and ensured that yeomanry was an exclusive and prestigious organisation mileham 2003 p 2011 p 76 in addition to farmers yeomanry attracted professionals tradesmen and skilled craftsmen to its ranks though strong ties to farming community meant that yeomanry activities were scheduled with an eye on agricultural calendar and harvests in particular informed training schedule beckett 2011 pp 75 76 yeomanry was county based and could be called out embodied by lord lieutenant or sheriff members were paid while embodied and subject to military law in event of invasion initially troops were liable for service only in their home or adjacent counties though some troops voted to be liable for service nationwide while others restricted themselves to service only in their home county mileham

1794 between 28 and 32 troops of yeomanry each up to 60 men strong had been raised a government attempt to raise more cavalry by compulsion provisional cavalry act of 1796 increased interest in volunteer cavalry and by 1799 there were 206 yeomanry troops by 1800 provisional cavalry regiments had been either disbanded or absorbed into yeomanry where they were frequently ostracised because of their lower social status beckett 2011 pp 75 2003 p 12 initial deployments yeomanry was as much an instrument of law and order as it was a military organisation and its terms of service stressed defence against both insurrection and invasion it was only once called upon to repulse a foreign invasion in 1797 when french legion noire landed at fishguard in wales and castlemartin yeomanry was part of force that defeated invaders in battle of fishguard beckett 2011 p 78 yeomanry was more active as a constabulary and corps were called out during london corresponding society trials in 1794

quantity from one to more than twenty in any given county troops were also raised in ireland where they reflected protestant ascendancy peace of amiens in 1802 resulted in a reductions across military with cuts to army and navy and disembodiment of militia legislation was passed to allow volunteer corps to be retained without pay but yeomanry establishment nevertheless declined only to increase again when war resumed in 1803 mileham 2003 pp 12 2011 p 87 there were frequent invasion scares most notably in 1804 when beacons were lit in scottish lowlands and 3 000 volunteers and yeomanry assembled for what turned out to be a false alarm and victory at battle of trafalgar in 1805 did not fully eradicate fears of a french landing beckett 2011 pp 92 95 early 19th century legislation and decline threat of invasion occupied much of british political thinking until final defeat of napoleon in 1815 and in period 1802 1803 alone there were 21 separate pieces of legislation designed to raise forces either voluntarily or compulsorily for defence of nation beckett 2011 p 92 volunteer consolidation act of 1804 which effectively governed yeomanry until 1901 rationalised confusion of legislation net result was to make voluntary service more attractive a significant motivation being to avoid compulsion of service in unpopular militia beckett 2011 pp 101 102 faced with a deluge of volunteers war office attempted to limit numbers this caused an outcry and administrative responsibility was transferred to home office in 1803 as a result becket 2011 pp 102 103 by following year number of volunteers and yeomanry together exceeded 342 000 men significantly more than government could arm in immediate term and in 1805 yeomanry numbered just under 33 000 men beckett 2011 pp 103 p 18 a change of government in 1806 resulted in a change of policy based on belief that volunteer force was an expensive solution which escaped central government control and undermined recruitment into militia and regular army local militia acts of 1808 created a new militia with incentives for volunteers to transfer into it by 1813 local militia had supplanted need for a volunteer force which had already declined to just under 69 000 men previous year and only a handful of volunteer corps remained beckett 2011 pp 107 114 120 yeomanry however was retained after napoleonic wars as a politically reliable force it was nevertheless reduced in numbers nationwide figures for 1817 indicate an actual strength of around 18 000 and in gloucestershire for example of 13 troops that existed in 1813 only

response and militia while available as a local force was not trusted it fell therefore to yeomanry to deal with civil unrest and its numbers were soon increased as a result hay 2017 pp 4 138 140 post

even at its peak in 1820 less than 30 per cent of counties had called out their yeomanry civil unrest declined in 1820s and in 1827 local magistrates called upon yeomanry only six times a 90 per cent decrease compared to 1820 hay 2017 pp 144 145 155 faced with funding a force that it perceived to be increasingly unnecessary government reduced yeomanry establishment on economic grounds of 62 corps

retained though 16 of them were allowed to continue only at their own expense it was however in southern counties that swing riots erupted in 1830 a largely agrarian protest which resulted in destruction of machinery in both town and country as a result many disbanded corps were resurrected and new ones raised although it was a slow process and those corps of yeomanry that had survived

chartist riot fearing that yeomanry would provoke confrontation fledgling police force was where available used in preference to maintain order during chartist disturbances although further urban unrest in 1830s resulted in deployment of yeomanry in montgomeryshire kent and birmingham government legislated another round of cuts on cost grounds in 1838 reducing 18 300 strong force by up to 4 700 though nine corps were allowed to continue without pay hay 2017 p 2011 p 132 as in 1827 timing was unfortunate and rise of chartism between 1837 and 1842 resulted in more demands on yeomanry to extent that commanders of northern and midlands military districts were given ability to summon it directly rather than apply for permission to home office greatest pressure came in 1842 a year which saw six of nine unpaid corps returned to establishment and just under 1 000 new yeomen recruited when civil unrest in 15 english welsh and scottish counties required deployment of 84 troops from 18 corps which between them accumulated a total of 338 days duty beckett 2011 pp 133 141 despite being heavily committed force was applied sparingly and yeomanry was deployed wherever possible as a reserve in support of other law enforcement agencies rather than as a primary agent itself in 1838 a troop of yorkshire yeomanry was held back during a serious disturbance on north midland railway out of fear that their presence would inflame situation following year sir charles napier commander of northern military district responded to a magistrate request for yeomanry by saying if chartists want a fight they can be indulged without yeomen who are over zealous for cutting and slashing hay 2017 pp 156 158 there were occasions when force was used such as violent confrontations in staffordshire potteries and north wales in 1839 between protesters and yeomen of staffordshire shropshire and montgomeryshire there were injuries on both sides and at least four deaths among protesters hay 2017 p 159 declining use as a constabulary between 1818 and 1855 peak years of its employment in support of civil power units of yeomanry were on duty somewhere for approximately 26 days per year on average hay 2017 p 169 it remained available as a constabulary throughout 19th century if for no other reason than it was often only option available to magistrates even though it was recognised that its presence might escalate tensions its use in this role however declined and last known deployment in support of civil power was in 1885 hay 2017 pp 161 162 diminishing demand was fuelled by a decrease in large scale protest and better law enforcement options development of a national rail network from mid 19th century enabled rapid deployment of regular forces and establishment of police forces in all counties by 1856 gave magistrates a better alternative than yeomanry hay 2017 pp 162 163 in 1892 brownlow committee set up to investigate financial and military position of yeomanry recommended that its constitution should be specially adapted for home defence and in 1907 yeomanry was formally relieved of any role in aid of civil power a select committee report in 1908 employment of military in cases of disturbances encouraged a civil response to civil disorder it recognised however value of mounted forces and recommended that police chiefs should maintain ability to temporarily recruit men with yeomanry experience casting yeomen thus enlisted as ordinary citizens subject to common law evolution of law enforcement can be seen in government responses to tonypandy riots and liverpool general transport strike of 1910 and 1911 in which yeomanry played no part when regular army was deployed to restore order supported in former case by 500 metropolitan police hay 2017 pp 163 2008 p 29

any real role between 1860s and 1892 militarily weak and few in number its effectiveness and value as a national defence force was increasingly questioned hay 2017 pp 30 31 it was regarded not least among members themselves as light or auxiliary cavalry and yeomanry regiments adopted titles of hussars dragoons and lancers their training in which they practised complex regular cavalry drills at halt emphasised use of sword mileham 2003 pp 20 22 it was wedded to idea of a cavalry role despite increasing efforts by government to encourage proficiency in use of firearms hay 2017 pp 25 26 28 yeomanry was left untouched by volunteer act of 1863 which governed new volunteer force leaving it still subject to legislation passed in 1804 although some changes were made to way in which it was administered beckett 2011 p 2017 p 21 more substantial changes were considered in a series of committees which attempted to assess state and role of yeomanry and although first lawrenson committee of 1861 achieved nothing some changes to organisation were made in 1870 by edward cardwell secretary of state for war independent troops and corps with less than four troops were abolished and established strength set at 36 regiments and basic training and drill requirements were laid down there is also evidence that cardwell hoped to transform yeomanry from cavalry to mounted rifles and an attempt to do so was also made in 1882 though both came to nothing hay 2017 pp 22 24 25 220 stanley committee of 1875 recommended better training for yeomanry leadership and disbandment of regiments that returned an effective strength of less than 200 men for two consecutive years although former was implemented latter was ignored hay 2017 pp 26 64 65 training in latter half of 19th century focussed more on mounted reconnaissance flank protection and pickets activities regarded by traditional cavalrymen as beneath their dignity but it was rarely realistic and yeomanry proved resistant to introduction of musketry standards beckett 2011 p 2003 p 24 brownlow committee sought to define a more professional role for yeomanry by incorporating it into nation s mobilisation scheme as a result in 1893 regiments were organised by squadron rather than troop and understrength regiments were paired into brigades in another attempt to encourage use of firearms allowances were increased for those who achieved a certain level of proficiency in musketry but those who failed to do so in two consecutive years would be expelled hay 2017 pp 27 28 nevertheless yeomanry s continued existence owed more to its significant representation in parliament which gave it a political influence beyond its numbers than it did to its utility as a national defence force hay 2017 pp 6 7 changes introduced by brownlow committee were according to henry campbell bannerman leader of liberal party then in opposition yeomanry s last chance to justify its existence imperial yeomanry thumb alt photograph of an imperial yeoman in south africa imperial yeoman by 1899 yeomanry was at its lowest point it was a small force largely untouched by developments since its founding in 1794 of uncertain value and

representative in war office and a member of loyal suffolk hussars suggested yeomanry as a source of reinforcement in south africa his proposal was initially declined but disastrous events of black week in december in which british army suffered three defeats in quick succession prompted a rethink and on 2 january 1900 imperial yeomanry was created beckett 2011 pp 200 202 203 it was a separate body from domestic yeomanry free of home force s restriction to service only in uk and was organised by companies and battalions rather than squadrons and regiments betraying its role as mounted infantry rather than cavalry hay 2017 pp 173 174 2003 p 27 by end of war some 34 000 volunteers had served in imperial yeomanry although little more than 12 per cent of that number had been recruited from domestic yeomanry beckett 2011 p 203hay 2017 p 173 experience in south africa convinced authorities of value of a mounted force and influenced militia and yeomanry act of 1901 law transformed yeomanry which it renamed en bloc to imperial yeomanry from cavalry into mounted infantry replacing sword with rifle and bayonet as yeoman s primary weapon it introduced khaki uniforms mandated a standard four squadron organisation and added a machine gun section to each regiment beckett 2011 pp 207 2017 p 214 yeomanry resisted retirement of sword and loss of cavalry from its title a reflection of its own aspirations and wider debate about role of cavalry hay 2017 pp 214 216 territorial force a key issue exposed by boer war concerned ability of auxiliary forces to reinforce regular army in times of crisis in 1903 director of general mobilisation and military intelligence reported an excess of home defence forces which because they were not liable for service overseas could not be used to expand an expeditionary force in foreign campaigns hay 2017 pp 220 221 this occupied much of debate around military reform in first decade of 20th century and gave yeomanry opportunity to retain its role as cavalry by positioning itself as a semi trained reserve to numerically weak regular cavalry this was reflected in a change to training instructions issued to imperial yeomanry in 1902 and 1905 former warned yeomanry not to aspire to a cavalry role and made no distinction between yeomen and mounted infantry but latter merely proscribed traditional cavalry tactic of shock action while otherwise aligning yeomanry with cavalry hay 2017 pp 216 220 changed focus in training was prompted by plans to allocate six yeomanry regiments as divisional cavalry in regular army supported by establishment within imperial yeomanry of a separate class of yeoman free of restriction on service overseas hay 2017 pp 222 224 this however relied on men volunteering for such service and offered regular army no guarantee that enough men would do so that enough would volunteer was made more doubtful by requirement that they should abandon their civilian lives for six months of training considered necessary for them to be effective in such a reserve role as a result plans were dropped from final legislation that combined volunteer force and yeomanry now without imperial prefix into a single unified auxiliary organisation territorial force in 1908 hay 2017 pp 224 230 yeomanry ceased to be a discrete institution and was as one yeoman put it slumped in with volunteers

recruitment reversing reductions implemented after end of napoleonic wars by 1820 yeomanry establishment had been restored to its war time peak of some 36 000 men although its effective strength was actually some 6 000 short of that number same cycle was repeated in late 1820s when after 10 years of political stability government reduced yeomanry to between 8 350 and 10 700 men only to increase it again in 1830s following outbreak of swing riots yeomanry strength peaked on this cycle in 1835 at an effective strength of 19 365 hay 2017 pp 4 5 further government cuts in 1838 were once again

gentry hay 2017 pp 37 41 49 50 coincidence of wealth and position in society was reflected in leadership of yeomanry in 1850 for example 31 per cent of officer corps were magistrates and a further 14

were sometimes of questionable value officers were not always able to attend to their yeomanry duties either because they lived too far away or as in case of winston churchill had more pressing

some of rank and file were required to serve as a condition of their tenancy in one case as late as 1893 on whole however landlords did not have ability or at least will to coerce a tenantry which served or indeed refused to serve of its own free will if county elite commanded any influence in this matter it was generally in class driven society of 19th century britain on terms of deference rather than subservience hay 2017 pp 77 82 although farmers represented largest single demographic in rank and file statistics indicate that between 1817 and 1915 just under half of yeomen were recruited from outside of farming community other demographics appearing in albeit incomplete data were merchants 4 9 per cent professionals 5 6 per cent small businessmen 14 9 per cent artisans 13 5 per cent and skilled or unskilled labourers 4 9 per cent in some cases ratio of farmers within same corps varied over time an example being ayrshire yeomanry which comprised over 81 per cent farmers

pp 83 86 early appearance of manchester and salford yeomanry demonstrates an urban theme in yeomanry recruitment that became more marked as 19th century progressed influenced to some extent by an agricultural downturn in late 19th century in contrast to lanarkshire s upper ward regiment its glasgow and lower ward regiment raised in 1848 and later to become queen s own royal glasgow yeomanry was recruited from city s middle classes hay 2017 pp 92 2003 pp 92 93 in 1860s leicestershire yeomanry and south salopian yeomanry shropshire were both recruiting from towns in their territories and

system of 1893 to join a troop of lesser status hay 2017 p 94 increasing use of hired mounts particularly after turn of century also indicates a dilution of rural contingent in rank and file percentage of horses that were hired rose dramatically from up to 14 per cent in last quarter of 19th century to around 50 per cent in period 1905 1907 although this was a predictable trend in case of for example largely urban recruited middlesex yeomanry more rurally based east kent yeomanry experienced a progressive decline in ownership of horses from 76 per cent in 1880 to 66 per cent in 1884

opinions in press radical outlets framing it in terms of murder and massacre and establishment outlets tending more to a defence of yeomanry although an extreme episode events at st peter s field coloured perceptions of yeomanry among politically involved working class who equated it with abuse of civil power negative perceptions persisted long after event even in upper echelons of society and as late as 1850 peterloo was referenced when yeomanry s inclinations were criticised in parliament hay 2017 pp 111 113 in mainstream national press however as peterloo became yesterday s news so too did yeomanry and outside of public events which it attended in a ceremonial role it was seldom reported on more often yeomanry was subject of caricature in which yeomen were portrayed as old incompetent and waving blood stained weapons caricature evolved into satire and magazines such as punch regularly ridiculed force as epitome of bumbling high society with overweight yeomen unable to master their weapons or sick undersized horses they rode common themes in portrayal of yeomanry in books and on stage included amateurs with delusions of grandeur social climbing self importance and a greater concern for leisure and appearance than national defence hay 2017 pp 113 118 yeomanry s less confrontational activities resulted in a more positive interaction with general public it was often generous in its support for local charities and its gatherings whether for training or social events injected wealth into local economies to extent that towns would petition regiments to be selected as venues for such occasions hay 2017 pp 119 120 123 quin p 172 sporting events and pageantry particularly many occasions on which yeomanry escorted royalty and visiting dignitaries also drew

1852 and royal midlothian yeomanry cavalry races in 1863 attracted a considerable attendance hay 2017 pp 122 128 130 although political allegiance of yeomanry mps in house of commons was fairly evenly split between two main parties by early 20th century this was after a gradual shift in political affiliations since 1843 when ratio of politically active members of yeomanry was significantly tory hay 2017 pp 8 9 satirist cast yeomanry as ultra tories in 1838 and perception of force as an instrument of tory establishment made some local authorities cautious in its use against political reformers during chartist disturbances hay 2017 pp 8 157 in terms of yeomanry leadership at least nature of reform movement in first half of 19th century meant that yeomanry was regularly pitted against a different class but it was called upon to do so by governments of both political parties furthermore its membership was not without sympathies for causes it was called upon to police and there are a number of cases in early 1830s where loyalties of some of its corps were doubted beckett 2011 pp 137 pp 168 170 funding remuneration and terms of service thumb left alt drawing illustrating different

mileham 2003 pp 10 23 other than when called out for duty when it would be paid as regular cavalry yeomanry received no remuneration until 1803 when first allowances were granted confused legislation of early 19th century meant that different corps and even different troops within same corps operated under different terms and conditions until volunteer consolidation act of 1804 introduced some uniformity it restricted pay to a maximum of 24 days per annum set 12 days of training as qualification for exemption from conscription into other auxiliary arms offered bounties for active service

1816 and 1821 cost of maintaining yeomanry had risen by nearly 46 per cent and with only seven per cent of total cost directly attributable to aiding civil power in 1819 governments struggled to justify expense cuts to force on economic grounds were legislated twice in 1827 and 1838 saving ps92 000 and ps22 000 respectively hay 2017 p 13 government funding however consistently fell short of actual requirements of yeomanry by its members particularly officers was common practice throughout its existence and not only during those periods when corps were maintained at their own expense lord plymouth paid ps6 200 to equip a troop of worcestershire yeomanry in 1832 and earl of dudley was reputed to have spent ps4 000 approximately per year on same corps between 1854 and 1871 second duke of buckingham and chandos was said to have been bankrupted in 1848 in part by massive contribution he made to his regiment which received no government funding between 1827 and 1830 beckett 2011 pp 133 134 in 1882 it was calculated that officers paid an average of ps20 each and men up to ps5 each towards cost of their regiments giving a total subsidy of ps61 500 in a year when government voted a ps69 000 budget for yeomanry hay 2017 pp 19 20 twenty years later annual cost of being a yeomanry officer was estimated to be ps100 in excess of pay and allowances received by officer this willingness to support itself with private funding was another major factor in yeomanry s survival after its usefulness in suppressing civil disorder disappeared hay 2017 p 119 changes were made to yeomanry terms and conditions in second half of 19th century national defence act of 1888 made it liable to serve anywhere in country and four years later an annual capitation grant of ps1 was awarded however force remained largely subject to terms set by volunteer consolidation act of 1804 until passage of militia and yeomanry act in 1901 beckett 2011 pp 188 207 new legislation replaced right to resign on 14

significant changes to terms and conditions including a four year term of service and reducing annual camp to fifteen days eight of which were necessary to gain a certificate of efficiency most fundamental change of all however was transfer of administration from regiments to newly created county territorial associations these were made responsible for provision of horses and relieved
