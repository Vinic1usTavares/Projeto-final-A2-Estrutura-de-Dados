she stated there s usually a bit of nature in what i write but i don t consider myself a nature writer scheese 1996 p 120 book often quotes and alludes to walden although dillard does not explicitly state her interest in thoreau s work critic donna mendelson notes that thoreau s presence is so potent in her book that dillard can borrow from him both straightforwardly and also humorously mendelson 1995 p 51 although two works are often compared pilgrim does not comment upon social world as walden does rather it is completely rooted in observations of natural world unlike thoreau dillard does not make connections between history of social and natural aspects mcilroy 1994 p 87 nor does she believe in an ordered universe whereas thoreau refers to machine like universe in which creator is akin to a master watchmaker dillard recognizes imperfection of creation in which something is everywhere and always amiss papa 1997 p 107 in her review for new york times eudora welty noted pilgrim s

narrator notes that invisibility is all time great cover hardack 2008 p 1999 p 91 nancy c parrish author of 1998 book lee smith annie dillard and hollins group a genesis of writers notes that despite its having been written in first person pilgrim is not necessarily autobiographical narrator annie dillard therefore becomes a persona through which author can experience and describe thoughts and events that real annie dillard had only heard about or studied or imagined parrish 1998 p 126 critic suzanne clark also points to peculiar evasiveness of dillard author noting that when we read annie dillard we don t know who is writing there is a silence in place where there might be an image of social self of personality character or ego slovic 1992 p 66 while most critics assume that narrator is female mostly due to autobiographical elements of book and assumption that narrator is dillard herself clark questions whether narrator is male stating that dillard uses a variety of male voices male styles throughout book clark asks when dillard quit writing pilgrim at tinker creek in persona of a fifty year old man did she then begin to write as a woman clark 1991 p 168 themes thumb right annie dillard portrait by phyllis rose religion and is often noted for its study of theodicy or its defense of god s goodness in face of evil narrator attempts to reconcile harsh natural world with

difficult it may be to watch dockins 2003 p 638 narrator especially sees inherent cruelty in insect world fish gotta swim and birds gotta fly insects it seems gotta do one horrible thing after another i never ask why of a vulture or a shark but i ask why of almost every insect i see more than one insect is an assault on all human virtue all hope of a reasonable god dockins 2003 p 642 while she remains drawn to ultimately repugnant and amoral natural world she also questions her place in it narrator states i had thought to live by side of creek in order to shape my life to its free flow but i seem to have reached a point where i must draw line it looks as though creek is not me up but dragging me down scheese 1996 pp 128 129 title of book suggests a pilgrimage and yet narrator does not stray far from her home near creek journey is metaphysical marshall 1998 p 89 margaret loewen reimer in one of first critical studies based on book noted that dillard s treatment of metaphysical is similar to that of herman melville while melville s eyes saw mainly darkness and horror of natural world possibly stemming from his new england puritan roots dillard s sinister vision of world comes more from a horror at seeming mindlessness of nature s design than from a deeply pervasive sense of evil reimer 1983 p 183 unlike melville however dillard does not natural world or seek to find parallels in human cultural acts focusing largely on observation as well as scientific analysis dillard follows example of charles darwin and other naturalists chenetier 1990 p 167 pilgrim narrator seeks to behold sacred which she dedicates herself to finding either by stalking or seeing at one point she sees a cedar tree near her house charged and transfigured each cell buzzing with flame as light hits it this burning vision reminiscent of creation s holy fire comes and goes mostly goes but i live for it radaker 1997 p 124 critic jenny emery davidson believes that dillard s act of stalking allows her to rewrite hunting myth a popular theme in nature writing which mediates space between nature and humans although a long tradition of male nature writers including james fenimore cooper jack london and richard nelson have used this theme as a symbolic ritual of violence dillard ventures into terrain of hunt employing its rhetoric while also challenging its conventions davidson 2001 p 218 seeing and awareness while some critics describe pilgrim at tinker creek as being more devoted to speculation of divine and natural world than to self exploration others approach work in terms of dillard s attention to self aware analysis for example critic mary davidson points to dillard s thoreauvian commitment to awareness slovic 1992 p 62 in book narrator is not only self aware but also alert to every detail around her pilgrim s second chapter defines two types of seeing as verbalization active and as a letting go passive ireland 2010 p 25 narrator refers to difference between two methods as difference between walking with and without a camera whereas former requires need to analyze and pry latter only requires rapt attention dillard 1999 p 33 act of seeing is exhaustive and exhausting as one of chapters relates i look at water minnows and shiners if i am thinking minnows a carp will fill my brain till i scream i look at water s surface skaters bubbles and leaves sliding down suddenly my own face reflected startles me witless those snails have been tracking my face finally with a shuddering wrench of will i see clouds cirrus clouds i m dizzy i fall in this looking business is risky parrish 1998 p 155 sandra johnson refers to structure of book itself leading to an epiphany of self awareness or a mystical experience as narrator watches a falling maple key she feels lost sunk gazing toward tinker mountain and feeling earth reel down johnson 1992 pp 4 7 reception and awards thumb 230px right dillard is often compared to henry david thoreau
