sts 8 was eighth nasa space shuttle mission and third flight of space shuttle challenger it launched on august 30 1983 and landed on september 5 conducting first night launch and night landing of space shuttle program it also carried first african american astronaut guion bluford mission successfully achieved all of its planned research objectives but was marred by subsequent discovery that a solid fuel rocket booster had almost malfunctioned catastrophically during launch mission s primary payload was insat 1b an indian communications and weather observation satellite which was released by orbiter and boosted into a geostationary orbit secondary payload replacing a delayed nasa communications satellite was a four metric ton dummy payload intended to test use of shuttle s canadarm remote manipulator system scientific experiments carried onboard challenger included environmental testing of new hardware and materials designed for future spacecraft study of biological materials in electric fields under microgravity and research into space adaptation syndrome also known as space sickness flight furthermore served as shakedown testing for previously launched tdrs 1 satellite which would be required to support subsequent sts 9 mission crew this mission had a crew of five with three mission specialists it was second mission after sts 7 to fly with a crew of five largest carried by a single spacecraft up to that date jenkins p 271 crew was historically notable for participation of guion guy bluford who became first african american to fly in space jenkins p 271 an african american test pilot robert henry lawrence jr had been selected for us air force manned orbiting laboratory program in 1967 but was killed in a flying accident a few months later manned orbiting laboratory program was cancelled in 1969 and most of its surviving astronauts transferred to nasa outside united states arnaldo tamayo mendez was a cuban air force officer who flew on soyuz 38 mission in 1980 as part of soviet intercosmos program and became first person of african descent in space commander truly was only veteran astronaut of crew having flown as pilot on sts 2 in 1981 and for two of approach and landing tests aboard enterprise in 1977 prior to this he had worked as a capsule communicator for all three skylab missions and apollo soyuz mission press kit p 47 brandenstein gardner and bluford had all been recruited in 1978 and been training for a mission since 1979 press kit pp 48 50 mission had originally been planned for a crew of four with thornton added to crew as a third mission specialist in december 1982 eight months after crew was originally named evans p 76 as with truly he was an apollo era recruit having joined nasa in 1967 press kit p 51 his participation on mission included a series of tests aimed at gathering information on physiological changes linked with space adaptation syndrome more commonly known as space sickness this had become a focus of attention in nasa as astronauts succumbed to it during shuttle missions orbiter carried two emus for use in case of an emergency spacewalk if needed they would be used by truly and gardner sts 8 press information p 61 mission plan and payloads thumb left insat 1b being prepared an early plan for sts 8 released in april 1982 had scheduled it for july 1983 it was expected to be a three day mission with four crew members and would launch insat 1 b an indian satellite and tdrs b a nasa communications relay satellite however following problems with inertial upper stage ius used to deploy tdrs a on sts 6 mission it was announced in may 1983 that tdrs was not going to be flown it was replaced in term manifest is used by nasa to indicate both overall program schedule and individual payloads and experiments planned for a single flight by payload flight test article sts 8 press information p i after re development of ius tdrs b was eventually re manifested for sts 51 l mission and was lost along with space shuttle challenger and its crew when launch failed in january 1986 jenkins p 287 primary element of sts 8 mission payload was insat 1b it was second in a series of multi purpose weather and communications satellites to be operated by indian space research organisation first insat 1a had been launched by a delta rocket in april 1982 but had to be shut down shortly afterwards due to a failure of onboard reaction control system satellite was carried in rear of shuttle s payload bay and was boosted into a geosynchronous transfer orbit by a payload assist module pam d a small solid rocket upper stage after its release from orbiter press kit p 34 satellite with its upper stage massed a total of with cradle massing another press kit p 31 and had cost around 50 million evans p 83 thumb left technical diagram of payload flight test article pfta payload flight test article pfta had been scheduled for launch in june 1984 on sts 16 in april 1982 manifest but by may 1983 it had been brought forward to sts 11 that month when tdrs missions were delayed it was brought forward to sts 8 to fill hole in manifest it was an aluminum structure resembling two wheels with a six meter long central axle ballasted with lead to give it a total mass of which could be lifted by canadarm remote manipulator system shuttle s robot arm and moved around to help astronauts gain experience in using system it was stored in midsection of payload bay press kit p 32 orbiter carried development flight instrumentation dfi pallet in its forward payload bay this had previously flown on columbia to carry test equipment pallet was not outfitted with any flight instrumentation but was used to mount two experiments first studied interaction of ambient atomic oxygen with structural materials of orbiter and payload while second tested performance of a heat pipe designed for use in heat rejection systems of future spacecraft press kit pp 38 9 first experiment was formally designated evaluation of oxygen interaction with materials dso 0301 while second was high capacity heat pipe demonstration dso four getaway special payloads were carried one studied effects of cosmic rays on electronic equipment second studied effect of gas environment around orbiter using ultraviolet absorption measurements as a precursor to ultraviolet equipment being designed for spacelab 2 a third sponsored by japanese asahi shimbun newspaper tried to use water vapor in two tanks to create snow crystals this was a second attempt at an experiment first flown on sts 6 which had had to be redesigned after water in tanks froze solid last was similar to an experiment flown on sts 3 and studied ambient levels of atomic oxygen by measuring rates at which small carbon and osmium wafers oxidized press kit pp 40 41 in order these were designated cosmic ray upset experiment crux g ultraviolet sensitive photographic emulsion experiment g japanese snow crystal experiment g and contamination monitor package g 0348 finally in cooperation with us postal service mission also carried 260 000 postal covers with 9 35 express postage stamps which were to be sold to collectors with profits divided between usps and nasa two storage boxes were attached to dfi pallet with more stored in six of getaway special canisters press kit p 37 a number of other experiments were to be performed inside orbiter crew compartment among these was continuous flow electrophoresis system being flown for fourth time this separated solutions of biological materials by passing electric fields through them experiment aimed at supporting research into diabetes treatments press kit p 38 a small animal cage was flown containing six rats no animal experiment was carried out on flight but a student involvement project was planned for a later mission which would use cage and nasa wanted to ensure it was flight tested press kit p 39 student involvement project carried out on sts 8 involved william thornton using biofeedback techniques to try to determine if they worked in microgravity a photography experiment would attempt to study spectrum of a luminous atmospheric glow which had been reported around orbiter and determine how this interacted with firings of reaction control system sts 9 press information p 60 this was formally designated as investigation of sts atmospheric luminosities mission was also scheduled to carry out a series of tests with tdrs 1 satellite which had been deployed by sts 6 to ensure system was fully operational before it was used to support spacelab 1 program on upcoming sts 9 flight press kit p 42 orbiter furthermore carried equipment to allow for encrypted transmissions to be tested for use in future classified missions major

rollout from orbiter processing facility to vehicle assembly building vab to be stacked for launch preparation for mission began on june 3 with assembly of shuttle s solid rocket boosters srb on mobile launcher platform boosters were stacked on june 20 1983 and external tank mated to assembly on june 23 challenger arrived at kennedy space center on june 29 and was transferred to orbiter processing facility on june 30 after post flight maintenance and preparation for new mission including installation of most flight payloads shuttle was transferred to vehicle assembly building on july 27 and mated to booster tank stack stack was checked out on july 29 and 30 and moved to launch complex 39a on august 2 1983 press kit p 11 shuttle flight data p 1 270 insat 1b was loaded into orbiter when on pad overall processing time from challenger arriving at ksc to being ready for launch was only sixty two days a record for program at time evans p 75 launch had originally been scheduled for august 4 1983 and was later rescheduled for august 20 jenkins p 266 some sources give an originally planned date of august 14 requirement to conduct testing with tdrs system required a delay of ten days for system to be ready during which stack remained on launch pad shuttle flight data p 1 330 during on pad delay hurricane barry 1983 hit florida coastline making landfall just south of kennedy space center on morning of august 25 storm had only been identified two days earlier and there was no time to roll challenger back from pad decision was made to secure launch stack and ride out storm launch thumb left a lightning strike near orbiter stack some hours before launch challenger finally launched at 06 32 utc 02 32 edt on august 30 1983 jenkins p 266 after a final 17 minute delay due to thunderstorms near launch site sts 9 press information p 84 launch window extended from 06 15 to 06 49 press kit p 5 countdown to launch was called by mark hess public information officer launch which occurred in pre dawn darkness was first american night launch since apollo 17 shayler p 136 and was watched by several thousand spectators unusual launching time was due to tracking requirements for primary payload insat 1b program would not have another night launch until sts 61 b in 1985 jenkins p 275 crew had attempted to prepare for it by training in darkened simulators so as to keep their night vision but in practice it was discovered that light of solid fuel rocket boosters made immediate area around launchpad virtually as bright as a day launch evans p 80 launch was first to use a newly developed high performance motor for solid rocket boosters which gave approximately 7 greater thrust post flight analysis later showed there was nearly a burn through of rocket casing a significant problem that later doomed 51 l mission see post flight safety analysis section below for more this launch was also second to last to use original standard mass steel casings for boosters these had been replaced by a thinner case saving some on sts 6 and sts 7 but because of safety concerns next two flights used conventional cases jenkins p 425 orbital operations thumb insat 1b after deployment after a successful insertion into a circular orbit at first experiments began first two samples were run through continuous flow electrophoresis system and measurements were taken for atmospheric luminosities study a hydraulic circulation pump failed but this was worked around and it proved to have no impact on operations major event of second day august 31 1983 was successful deployment of insat 1b satellite which took place at 7 48 utc with challenger then maneuvering to avoid firing of booster motor forty minutes later evans p 85 other experimentation continued though telemetry through tdrs was lost for around three hours requiring manual intervention sts 9 press information pp 84 5 a fire alarm sounded in morning indicating signs of a fire in avionics compartment but a second alarm remained silent and it was eventually determined to be a false alarm on third and fourth days september 1 and 2 1983 work began with canadarm remote manipulator system and payload test article and communications testing through tdrs continued former was successful but latter lost contact on a number of occasions due to problems at white sands ground station sts 9 press information p 85 as a result crew had to be awakened early on september 1 in order to deal with problem a minor cabin pressure leak on september 2 was traced to waste management system and quickly controlled orbiter performed an orbital maneuvering system firing on september 2 to place itself in a lower orbit where air density was higher and oxygen interaction experiments would work more effectively on fifth day september 3 1983 testing of canadarm continued including a number of optional shopping list tests and tdrs tests were carried out with more success a live press conference was held late in day first in flight press conference since apollo 17 on sixth day september 4 1983 experiment runs were completed and crew prepared to deorbit two systems failures were recorded on this last day most serious of which involved a synchronization failure in one of onboard computers while on orbit challenger made a number of altitude and attitude adjustments in order to test behavior of a shuttle orbiter and to perform some experiments in different thermal conditions by exposing or shading areas from sun in an unusual way it was possible to induce particularly warm or cold conditions and observe any resulting problems evans p 90 landing mission plan called for a landing at edwards air force base california at 121 28 mission elapsed time press kit p 14 on original plan this would have been at 7 44 utc on september 4 1983 before accounting for last minute launch delay in event this was put back by one day to allow for further communications testing and challenger touched down at 07 40 33 utc 00 40 33 pdt september 5 1983 on runway 22 at edwards afb on morning of seventh day of mission as with launch this was first night landing of program shuttle orbiters had no on board lights due to difficulty of designing landing lights to survive re entry and so runway was lit by high intensity xenon arc lamps to guide orbiter in there was no pressing operational requirement for a night landing but there was a desire to prove it was possible footage of landing was shown in 1986 film post flight safety analysis launch was carried out with no obvious anomalies but on september 27 1983 during post flight inspection of solid rocket boosters severe corrosion was discovered in left hand booster three inch 8 cm thick resin lining protecting rocket nozzle which was designed to erode about half its thickness during firing was found to have burned down to as little as in places by some estimations this left around 14 seconds of firing time before nozzle would have ruptured a situation which would have resulted in loss of control and probable break up of spacecraft it was later determined that this fault was due to particular batch of resin used on this set of boosters burn through problem was treated as a small mishap by media and did not receive significant interest until after challenger disaster in 1986 only major contemporary public criticism came from nasa s soviet counterparts shayler p 166 as a result of this incident flight of sts 9 was delayed for a month while nozzles of its boosters were changed shuttle flight data p 1 331 post flight inspection of thermal protection system tiles found seven major debris impacts and forty nine minor impacts of which three and twenty six respectively were on orbiter s underside shuttle flight data p 1 220 major is defined as a over one in diameter this was lowest incidence of major tile damage until at least sts 74 shuttle flight data pp 1 220 to 1 222 and compares very favorably with program average of twenty three major impacts to underside columbia accident investigation board report vol i p 122 it was first shuttle flight with no significant problems reported for thermal protection system shuttle flight data p 1 227 three windows were removed from orbiter due to pitting and hazing shuttle flight data p 1 232 a total of thirty three in flight anomalies were eventually reported shuttle flight data p 2 3 as well as issues above sts 8 s more minor problems ranged from faulty flight data p 2 24 to an unusually high amount of dust in cabin evans p 91 scientific results thumb right guy bluford exercising on a mid deck treadmill while in orbit overall crew successfully completed all fifty four of planned mission test objectives sts 9 press information p 84 while insat deployment was a success satellite had problems unfolding its solar array once in geostationary orbit and was not fully operational until middle of september once functional however it provided satisfactory service for seven years returning 36 000 images of earth and broadcasting television to thousands of remote indian villages payload flight test article evaluation found that canadarm remote manipulator system was capable of moving bulky masses with some accuracy to a precision of 5 cm and one degree of alignment evans p 88 tdrs 1 program was overall less successful with satellite suffering several computer failures and an overall loss of telemetry for several hours in all orbiter was able to use satellite for 65 of planned 89 orbits and could make successful use of connection on about forty continuous flow electrophoresis system equipment functioned as planned processing several hundred times more material than would have been possible on earth evans p 86 and asahi shimbun crystal experiment flown for second time was able to produce snow crystals after canister was redesigned thornton s research into space adaptation sickness noted that sts 8 astronauts had escaped severe cases with none suffering loss of motor control evans p 78 gardner suffered a mild case but was still able to manage effectively evans p 77 while brandenstein who had suffered from induced motion sickness during training operations was entirely unaffected symptoms were found to abate within three days of launch wake up calls nasa began a tradition of playing music to astronauts during gemini program and first used music to wake up a flight crew during apollo 15 each track is specially chosen often by astronauts families and usually has a special meaning to an individual member of crew or is applicable to
