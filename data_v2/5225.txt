monolithic our vulcans are not pacifistic he sought to introduce a situation which he compared to 16th century protestant reformation and wanted to include a vulcan character who would effectively be

received by enterprise continued a downward trend in recent episodes with ratings of 1 9 3 received by previous episode michelle erica green reviewing episode for treknation was undecided about whether main point of episode where captain archer is expected to lead vulcans back to their main path of logic was a wonderfully progressive concept or just regressive trek in which humans have all answers she thought that change in soval s opinions in this episode was difficult to accept and that other members of main cast didn t get a great deal to do in episode however whilst she thought that awakening was a visual improvement over forge she was reserving judgement until she had seen third part of trilogy jamahl epsicokhan at his website jammer s reviews thought that certain elements of plot didn t follow logical paths such as how archer found kir shara in a few minutes when apparently syrrannites had been looking for it for two years even though it sits in a chamber behind a door that practically announces important relic inside however he called episode entertaining and gave it a score of three out of four in 2018 screen rant praised casting actress kara zediker as vulcan character t pau first home media release of forge was in season four dvd box set of enterprise originally released in united states on november 1 2005 blu ray edition was released on april 1 2014
