details quality of thanhouser films in general stood out amongst independent producers an editorial by spectator in new york dramatic mirror contained specific praise for thanhouser productions by stating practically all other independent american companies excepting thanhouser show haste and lack of thought in their production crude stories are crudely handled giving impression that they are rushed through in a hurry anything to get a thousand feet of negative ready for market such pictures of course do not cost much to produce but they are not of a class to make reputation thanhouser company alone of independents shows a consistent effort to do things worthwhile editorial warned that american audiences were not subject to be entertained by novelty of moving images and cautioned independents that there was distinct danger in quantity over quality editorial was written by frank e woods of american biograph company a licensed company and like publication itself had a considerable slant to licensed companies release and reception single reel drama approximately 1000 feet long was released on july 15 1910 film had a wide national release in united states theaters showing advertisements include those in kansas north carolina maryland indiana pennsylvania arizona and missouri one of last advertisements for film was in neosho missouri on may 14 1913 film received mixed reception in trade publications but some advertisements would boast power of film or go so far as to call it a great american drama moving picture news stated as a sketch of country folk admirable because it is true situations are well worked out conversion could it be a new england church meeting would be a good place to exhibit and ask questions though reviewer in new york dramatic mirror however disagreed that premise was plausible a straight laced old deacon forms complicating element in this rather conventional and rather improbable story that a girl could become a comic opera star without knowledge of her parents is a strain for imagination that a simple little dance like one in picture could effect such a conversion is another tax on belief acting is good especially in heroine s role deacon displays an unnatural tendency in such a stern character when he rapturously kisses photograph of his daughter it is unknown if character of deacon sanders is really a church deacon because synopsis states deacon sanders is a farmer who is nearly as poor as he is religious see also list of american films of 1910 cbs fox video references category 1910 films category 1910s
