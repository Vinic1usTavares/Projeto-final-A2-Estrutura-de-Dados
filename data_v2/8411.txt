snake river is a major river of greater pacific northwest region in united states at long it is largest tributary of columbia river in turn largest north american river that empties into pacific ocean snake river rises in western wyoming then flows through snake river plain of southern idaho rugged hells canyon on oregon idaho border and rolling palouse hills of washington emptying into columbia river at tri cities washington snake river drainage basin encompasses parts of six u s states and is known for its varied geologic history snake river plain was created by a volcanic hotspot which now lies underneath snake river headwaters in yellowstone national park gigantic glacial retreat flooding episodes that occurred during previous ice age carved out canyons cliffs and waterfalls along middle and lower snake river two of these catastrophic flooding events missoula floods and bonneville flood significantly affected river and its surroundings prehistoric native americans lived along snake starting more than 11 000 years ago salmon from pacific ocean spawned by millions in river and were a vital resource for people living on snake downstream of shoshone falls by time lewis and clark explored area nez perce and shoshone were dominant native american groups in region later explorers and fur trappers further changed and used resources of snake river basin at one point sign language used by shoshones representing weaving baskets was misinterpreted to represent a snake giving snake river its name by middle 19th century oregon trail had become well established bringing numerous settlers to snake river region steamboats and railroads moved agricultural products and minerals along river throughout 19th and early 20th centuries starting in 1890s fifteen major dams have been built on snake river to generate hydroelectricity enhance navigation and provide irrigation water however these dams blocked salmon migration above hells canyon and have led to water quality and environmental issues in certain parts of river removal of several dams on lower snake river has been proposed in order to restore some of river s once tremendous salmon runs course thumb right 200px a braided light colored stream winds across a flat grassy valley in lower left while jagged gray peaks laced with strips of snow rise above a distant lake under a bright sky snake river exits jackson lake and winds southwards through jackson hole formed by confluence of three tiny streams on southwest flank of two oceans plateau in yellowstone national park western wyoming snake starts out flowing west and south into jackson lake its first run through jackson hole a wide valley between teton range and gros ventre range below tourist town of jackson river turns west and flows through snake river canyon cutting through snake river range and into eastern idaho it receives hoback and greys rivers before entering palisades reservoir where salt river joins at mouth of star valley below palisades dam snake river flows through snake river plain a vast arid physiographic province extending through southern idaho southwest of rocky mountains and underlain by snake river aquifer one of most productive aquifers in united states southwest of rexburg idaho snake is joined from north by henrys fork henrys fork is sometimes called north fork of snake river with main snake above their confluence known as south fork from there it turns south flowing through downtown idaho falls then past fort hall indian reservation and into american falls reservoir where it is joined by portneuf river portneuf river valley is an overflow channel that in last glacial period carried floodwaters from pluvial lake bonneville into snake river significantly altering landscape of snake river plain through massive erosion from there snake resumes its journey west entering snake river canyon of idaho it is interrupted by several major cataracts largest being shoshone falls which historically marked upriver limit of migrating salmon a short distance downstream it passes under perrine bridge near twin falls snake approaches southernmost point in its entire course after which it starts to flow west northwest thumb left clearwater river left joins snake river center at lewiston snake continues through its canyon receiving malad river from east near bliss and then bruneau river from south in c j strike reservoir it passes through an agricultural valley about southwest of boise and flows briefly west into oregon before turning north to define idaho oregon border here snake river almost doubles in size as it receives several major tributaries owyhee from southwest then boise and payette rivers from east and further downstream malheur river from west and weiser river from east north of boise snake enters hells canyon a steep spectacular rapid strewn gorge that cuts through salmon river mountains and blue mountains of idaho and oregon hells canyon is one of most rugged and treacherous portions of course of snake river posing a major obstacle for 19th century american explorers here snake is also impounded by hells canyon oxbow and brownlee dams which together make up hells canyon hydroelectric project at halfway point in hells canyon in one of most remote and inaccessible sections of its course snake river is joined from east by its largest tributary salmon river from there snake begins to form washington idaho border receiving grande ronde river from west before receiving clearwater river from east at lewiston which marks head of navigation on snake river leaves hells canyon and turns west winding through palouse hills of eastern washington lower snake river project s four dams and navigation locks have transformed this part of snake river into a series of reservoirs confluence of snake and columbia rivers at burbank washington is part of lake wallula reservoir of mcnary dam columbia river flows about further west to pacific ocean near astoria oregon geology thumb south fork of snake river in idaho as recently as 165 million years ago most of western north america was still part of pacific ocean nearly complete subduction of farallon plate underneath westward moving north american plate created rocky mountains which were pushed up by rising magma trapped between sinking farallon plate and north american plate as north american plate moved westwards over a stationary hotspot beneath crust a series of tremendous lava flows and volcanic eruptions carved out snake river plain beginning about 12 million years ago west of continental divide even larger lava flows of columbia river basalts issued over eastern washington forming columbia plateau southeast of columbia river and palouse hills in lower snake separate volcanic activity formed northwestern portion of plain an area far from path of hotspot which now lies beneath yellowstone national park at this point snake river watershed was beginning to take shape thumb right locations of yellowstone hotspot as it passed through snake river plain snake river plain and gap between sierra nevada and cascade range together formed a moisture channel opening way for pacific storms to travel more than inland to headwaters of snake river when teton range uplifted about 9 million years ago along a detachment fault running north south through central rockies river maintained its original course and cut through southern end of mountains forming snake river canyon of wyoming about 6 million years ago salmon river mountains and blue mountains at far end of plain began to rise river cut through these mountains as well forming hells canyon lake idaho formed during miocene covered a large portion of snake river plain between twin falls and hells canyon and its lava dam was finally breached about 2 million years ago thumb right shoshone falls near twin falls idaho lava flowing from cedar butte in present southeast idaho blocked snake river at eagle rock about 42 000 years ago near present day site of american falls dam a lake known as american falls lake formed behind barrier lake was stable and survived for nearly 30 000 years about 14 500 years ago pluvial lake bonneville in great salt lake area formed in last glacial period spilled catastrophically down portneuf river into snake in an event known as bonneville flood this was one of first in a series of catastrophic flooding events in northwest known as ice age floods deluge caused american falls lake to breach its natural lava dam which was rapidly eroded with only american falls left in end flood waters of lake bonneville approximately twenty times flow of columbia river or 5 million ft3 s 140 000 m3 s swept down snake river and across entirety of southern idaho for miles on either side of river flood waters stripped away soils and scoured underlying basalt bedrock forming snake river canyon and creating shoshone falls twin falls crane falls swan falls and other waterfalls along idaho section of river bonneville flood waters continued through hells canyon and eventually reached columbia river flood widened hells canyon but did not deepen it thumb right extraordinarily flat and expansive snake river plain was result of lake bonneville floods and yellowstone hotspot as bonneville floods rushed down snake river missoula floods occurred in same period but originating farther north missoula floods which occurred more than 40 times between 15 000 and 13 000 years ago were caused by glacial lake missoula on clark fork repeatedly being impounded by ice dams then breaking through with lake s water rushing over much of eastern washington in massive surges far larger than lake bonneville flood these floods pooled behind cascade range into enormous lakes and spilled over northern drainage divide of snake river watershed carving deep canyons through palouse hills including palouse river canyon and palouse falls lake bonneville floods and missoula floods helped widen and deepen columbia river gorge a giant water gap which allows water from columbia and snake rivers to take a direct route through cascade range to pacific massive amounts of sediment deposited by lake bonneville floods in snake river plain also had a lasting effect on most of middle snake river high hydraulic conductivity of mostly basalt rocks in plain led to formation of snake river aquifer one of most productive aquifers in north america many rivers and streams flowing from north side of plain sink into aquifer instead of flowing into snake river a group of watersheds called lost streams of idaho aquifer filled to hold nearly of water underlying about in a plume thick in places water exits from rivers at rates of nearly much of water lost by snake river as it transects plain issues back into river at its western end by way of many artesian springs watershed thumb left snake river flows through an arid gorge nearing its mouth in washington snake river is thirteenth longest river in united states its watershed is 10th largest among north american rivers and covers almost in portions of six u s states wyoming idaho nevada utah oregon and washington with largest portion in idaho most of snake river watershed lies between rocky mountains on east and columbia plateau on northwest largest tributary of columbia river snake river watershed makes up about 41 of entire columbia river basin its average discharge at mouth constitutes 31 of columbia s flow at that point percentage is calculated by adding discharge at priest rapids dam on columbia to discharge at ice harbor dam on snake priest rapids is closest usgs gauge upstream of snake confluence that has a reliable discharge record above confluence snake is slightly longer than columbia compared to upstream columbia mileage calculated by subtracting 325 snake river confluence mile from 1243 length of columbia below snake confluence comes from river mileage markers on usgs topo maps and its drainage basin is slightly larger 4 bigger than upstream columbia river watershed watershed of columbia upstream of snake river confluence is just slightly smaller than that of snake mostly semi arid even desert climate of snake river watershed on average receives less than of precipitation per year however precipitation in snake river watershed varies widely at twin falls in center of snake river plain climate is nearly desert with an annual rainfall of just although average snowfall is this desert climate occupies majority of basin of snake river so although it is longer than columbia river above tri cities its discharge is on average significantly less however in high rockies of wyoming in upper jackson hole area average precipitation is over and snowfall averages most of snake river basin consists of wide arid plains and rolling hills bordered by high mountains in upper parts of watershed however river flows through an area with a distinct alpine climate there are also stretches where river and its tributaries have incised themselves into tight gorges snake river watershed includes parts of yellowstone national park grand teton national park hells canyon national recreation area and many other national and state parks thumb right map of columbia river basin with snake river highlighted in yellow and columbia river in blue much of area along river within a few miles of its banks is irrigated farmland especially in its middle and lower course irrigation dams include american falls dam minidoka dam and c j strike dam aside from water from river water is also pulled from snake river aquifer for irrigation major cities along river include jackson in wyoming twin falls idaho falls boise and lewiston in idaho and tri cities in washington kennewick pasco and richland there are fifteen dams in total along snake river which aside from irrigation also produce electricity maintain a navigation channel along part of river s route and provide flood control however fish passage is limited to stretch below hells canyon snake river watershed is bounded by several other major north american watersheds which drain both to atlantic or pacific or into endorheic basins on southwest side a divide separates snake watershed from oregon s harney basin which is endorheic on south snake watershed borders that of humboldt river in nevada and watershed of great salt lake bear jordan and weber rivers on south snake river also shares a boundary with green river to southeast green river drains parts of wyoming and utah and is largest tributary of colorado river on western extremity for a short stretch continental divide separates snake watershed from bighorn river a tributary of yellowstone river which snake begins near on north snake river watershed is bounded by red rock river a tributary of beaverhead river which flows into jefferson river and into missouri river part of gulf of mexico drainage basin rest of snake river watershed borders on several other major columbia river tributaries mostly spokane river to north but also clark fork in montana to northeast and john day river to west of these clark fork via pend oreille river and spokane join columbia above snake while john day joins downstream of snake in columbia river gorge it is of note that northeastern divide of snake river watershed forms idaho montana boundary so snake river watershed does not extend into montana mountain ranges in snake watershed include teton range bitterroot range clearwater mountains seven devils mountains and extreme northwestern end of wind river range grand teton is highest point in snake river watershed reaching in elevation elevation of snake river is when it joins columbia river pollution agricultural runoff from farms and ranches in snake river plain and many other areas has severely damaged ecology of river throughout 20th century after first irrigation dams on river began operation in first decade of 20th century much of arable land in a strip a few miles wide along snake river was cultivated or turned to pasture and agricultural return flows began to pollute snake runoff from several feedlots was dumped into river until laws made practice illegal fertilizer manure and other chemicals and pollutants washed into river greatly increase nutrient load especially of phosphorus fecal coliforms and nitrogen during low water algae blooms occur throughout calm stretches of river depleting its oxygen supply thumb left dams like milner dam divert water from snake river for irrigation which causes many of pollution problems in snake much of return flows do not issue directly back into snake river but rather feed snake river aquifer underneath snake river plain water diverted from river for irrigation after absorbing any surface pollutants re enters ground and feeds aquifer although aquifer has maintained its level it has become increasingly laced with contaminants water in aquifer eventually travels to west side of snake river plain and re enters river as springs throughout much of snake river plain and hells canyon excessive sediment is also a recurring problem in december 2007 u s environmental protection agency epa issued a permit requiring owners of fish farms along snake river to reduce their phosphorus discharge by 40 pollutant levels in hells canyon upstream of salmon river confluence including that of water temperature dissolved nutrients and sediment are required to meet certain levels discharge snake river s average flow is united states geological survey recorded river s discharge from a period of 1963 2000 at a stream gauge below ice harbor dam in that period largest average annual flow recorded was in 1997 and lowest was in 1992 lowest recorded daily mean flow was on february 4 1979 on august 27 1965 there was temporarily no flow as a result of testing at ice harbor dam highest recorded flow was on june 19 1974 highest flow ever recorded on snake river was at a different usgs stream gauge near clarkston which operated from 1915 to 1972 this gauge recorded a maximum flow of more than columbia s average discharge on may 29 1948 an even larger peak discharge estimated at occurred during flood of june 1894 river s flow is also measured at several other points in its course above jackson lake wyoming discharge is about from a drainage area of at minidoka idaho about halfway through snake river plain river s discharge rises to however at buhl idaho only about downstream river s flow decreases to because of agricultural diversions and seepage but at border of idaho and oregon near weiser at beginning of hells canyon snake s flow rises to after receiving several major tributaries such as payette owyhee and malheur discharge further increases to at hells canyon dam on border of idaho and oregon at washington downstream of confluence with salmon one of snake s largest tributaries mean discharge is history right thumb 220px snake river scene 1920 by l t walter name canadian explorer david thompson first recorded native american name of snake river as when he arrived at its mouth by boat in 1800 when lewis and clark expedition crossed westwards into snake river watershed in 1805 they first gave it name lewis river lewis fork or lewis s fork as meriwether lewis was first of their group to sight river they also made note of snake indians who lived along river who were actually shoshone tribe and learned that native americans called river or for an herb that grew prolifically along its banks later american explorers some of whom were originally part of lewis and clark expedition journeyed into snake river watershed and records show a variety of names have been associated with river explorer wilson price hunt of astor expedition named river as mad river others gave river names including shoshone river after tribe and river eventually name snake river was derived from an s shaped gesture shoshone tribe made with their hands to represent swimming salmon explorers misinterpreted it to represent a snake giving river its present day name early inhabitants thumb right 300px snake river flowing through palouse region about 10 miles 16 km above its mouth on columbia river people have been living along snake river for at least 11 000 years historian daniel s divides prehistory of western snake river basin into three main phases or adaptive systems first he calls broad spectrum foraging dating from 11 500 to 4 200 years before present during this period people drew upon a wide variety of food resources second period foraging dates from 4 200 250 years before present and is distinctive for an increased reliance upon fish especially salmon as well as food preservation and storage third phase from 250 to 100 years before present he calls equestrian foragers it is characterized by large horse mounted tribes that spent long amounts of time away from their local foraging range hunting bison summary of western snake river prehistory digital atlas of idaho in eastern snake river plain there is some evidence of clovis folsom and plano cultures dating back over 10 000 years ago early fur traders and explorers noted regional trading centers and archaeological evidence has shown some to be of considerable antiquity one such trading center in weiser area existed as early as 4 500 years ago fremont culture may have contributed to historic shoshones but it is not well understood another poorly understood early cultural component is called midvale complex introduction of horse to snake river plain around 1700 helped in establishing shoshone and northern paiute cultures on snake river in southeastern washington there are several ancient sites one of oldest and most well known is called marmes rockshelter which was used from over 11 000 years ago to relatively recent times marmes rockshelter was flooded in 1968 by lake herbert g west lower monumental dam s reservoir marmes rockshelter historylink retrieved 2013 06 24 eventually two large native american groups controlled most of snake river nez perce whose territory stretched from southeastern columbia plateau into northern oregon and western idaho and shoshone who occupied snake river plain both above and below shoshone falls lifestyles along snake river varied widely below shoshone falls economy centered on salmon who often came up river in enormous numbers salmon were mainstay of nez perce and most of other tribes below shoshone falls above falls life was significantly different snake river plain forms one of only relatively easy paths across main rocky mountains for many hundreds of miles allowing native americans both east and west of mountains to interact as a result shoshone centered on a trading economy according to legend nez perce tribe was first founded in valley of clearwater river one of snake river s lowermost major tributaries at its height there were at least 27 nez perce settlements along clearwater river and 11 more on snake between mouth of clearwater and imnaha rivers there were also villages on salmon river grande ronde river tucannon river and lower hells canyon area snake river s annual salmon run which was estimated at that time to exceed four million in good years supported nez perce who lived in permanent well defined villages unlike nomadic southeastern tribes along snake river nez perce also were involved in trade with flathead tribe to north and other middle columbia river tribes however they were enemies to shoshone and other upstream snake river tribes shoshone or were characterized by nomadic groups that took their culture from earlier bitterroot culture and great basin tribes that migrated north via owyhee river they were most powerful tribe in rocky mountains area and were known to many great plains tribes as snakes in 18th century shoshone territory extended beyond snake river plain extending over continental divide into upper missouri river watershed and even further north into canada a smallpox epidemic brought by european explorers and fur trappers was responsible for wiping out much of shoshone east of rocky mountains but shoshone continued to occupy snake river plain eventually shoshone culture merged with that of paiute and bannock tribes which came from great basin and hells canyon area respectively bannock brought with them skill of buffalo hunting and horses they had acquired from europeans changing shoshone way of life significantly exploration and settling lewis and clark expedition 1804 06 was first american group to cross rocky mountains and sail down snake and columbia rivers to pacific ocean gulick p 17 meriwether lewis supposedly became first american to sight drainage basin of snake river after he crossed mountains a few days ahead of his party on august 12 1805 and sighted salmon river valley a major snake tributary from lemhi pass a few miles from present day site of salmon idaho party later traveled north descended lemhi river to salmon and attempted to descend it to snake but found it impassable because of its violent rapids expedition named snake river lewis river lewis s river or lewis fork in his honor and they traveled northwards to river which they traveled via clearwater river into lower snake and into columbia they also referred to shoshone indians as snake indians which became present day name of river name lewis fork however did not last thumb left snake river near jackson wyoming in 1871 later american explorers traveled throughout snake river area and up its major tributaries beginning in 1806 just after lewis and clark had returned first was john ordway in 1806 who also explored lower salmon river john colter in 1808 was first to sight upper headwaters of snake river including jackson hole area in 1810 andrew henry along with a party of fur trappers discovered henrys fork of snake river which is now named after him donald mackenzie sailed lower snake river in 1811 and later explorers included wilson price hunt of astor expedition who gave river name mad river gulick snake river country p 24 ramsay crooks francisco john grey goddin and many others after 1830s many of these later explorers were original members of lewis and clark expedition who had returned to map and explore area in greater detail even later american fur trappers scouted area for beaver streams but canadian trappers from british hudson s bay company were by now a major competitor hudson s bay company first sent fur trappers into snake river watershed in 1819 party of three traveled into headwaters of owyhee river a major southern tributary of snake but disappeared meanwhile as american fur trappers kept coming to region hudson s bay company ordered canadian trappers to kill as many beavers as they could eventually nearly eradicating species from snake river watershed under rationale that if there are no beavers there will be no reason for yanks americans to come their goal was to eventually gain rights over oregon territory a region covering washington oregon idaho and parts of montana and wyoming most of present day region called pacific northwest gulick snake river country p 32 however area was eventually annexed into united states by middle 19th century oregon trail had been established generally following much of snake river one crossing trail made over snake river was near present day site of ferry several years later a ferry was established at site replacing old system where pioneers had to ford wide powerful and deep snake another place where pioneers crossed snake was further upstream at a place called three island crossing near mouth of boise river this area has a group of three islands hence name that splits snake into four channels each about wide some emigrants chose to ford snake and proceed down west side and recross river near fort boise into hells canyon continue down drier east side into gorge or float snake and columbia to willamette river destination of oregon trail reason for three island crossing was better availability of grass and water access numerous ferries have provided crossings of upper snake from brownlee ferry at head of hell s canyon to menor s ferry which operates today at moose wyoming sophistication varied from reed boats pulled by indians on horse back at snake fort fort boise as described by narcissa whitman in 1836 to an electric operated ferry swan falls ferry at swan falls dam of early 20th century one contemporary diarist crossing near salmon falls complains of exorbitant fees at crossings that were a constant drain on travelers purse she writes that this particular route was controlled by mormons who had built bridges where they were not needed most unmercifully fleecing poor emigrants diarist expresses regret at having made crossing describing landscape as desolate country another writer similarly notes several days travel through a desert so desolate and rocky that we almost regretted that we had not continued on south side of that stream steamboats thumb right an unidentified steamboat sails up snake river in either washington or idaho in 1898 unlike columbia river it was far more difficult for steamboats to navigate on snake columbia river drops from source to mouth while snake drops over in elevation over a length more than shorter still from 1860s to 1940s steamboats traveled on snake river from its mouth at columbia river to near mouth of imnaha river in lower hells canyon however most of steamboats only sailed from river s mouth to lewiston located at confluence of snake and clearwater rivers this stretch of river is easiest to navigate for watercraft since it has least elevation change although it still contained over 60 sets of rapids passenger and freight service downstream of lewiston lasted throughout late 19th century and persisted until introduction of railroads in palouse hills grain growing region and ultimately construction of dams on lower snake to facilitate barge traffic which caused demise of both steamboats and railroad lewiston from confluence of snake and columbia and from mouth of columbia on pacific ocean became connected with portland and other pacific ports via steamboat service from mouth of snake through columbia river gorge steamboats on northwest rivers p xiii a commonly traveled route was from wallula washington downstream of snake river s mouth upstream to lewiston steamboats on northwest rivers p 93 oregon steam navigation company launched shoshone at fort boise in 1866 which provided passenger and freight service on upper snake for boise and owyhee mines by 1870s osn company owned by northern pacific railroad was operating seven steamboats for transporting wheat and grain from productive palouse region along snake and columbia to lower columbia river ports these boats were harvest queen john gates spokane annie faxon mountain queen r r thompson and wide west all of which were built on columbia river steamboats on northwest rivers p 122 however there were more resources along snake river than wheat and grain in 1890s a huge copper deposit was discovered at eureka bar in hells canyon several ships were built specifically to transport ore from there to lewiston these included imnaha mountain gem and norma steamboats on northwest rivers p 162 in 1893 annie faxon suffered a boiler explosion and sank on snake below lewiston river modifications dams a total of fifteen dams have been constructed along snake river for a multitude of different purposes from its headwaters in rocky mountains to its mouth on lake wallula reservoir formed behind mcnary dam on columbia river dams on snake can be grouped into three major categories from its headwaters to beginning of hells canyon many small dams block snake to provide irrigation water between here and hells canyon first dam on snake swan falls dam was built in 1901 in hells canyon a cascade of dams produce hydroelectricity from river s steep fall over a comparatively short distance finally a third cascade of dams from hells canyon to mouth facilitates navigation many different government and private agencies have worked to build dams on snake river which now serve an important purpose for people living in drainage basin and trade of agricultural products to pacific seaports minidoka irrigation project of u s bureau of reclamation created with passage of reclamation act of 1902 involved diversion of snake river water into snake river plain upstream of shoshone falls in order to irrigate approximately in snake river plain and store of water in snake river reservoirs first studies for irrigation in snake river plain were conducted by united states geological survey in late 19th century and project was authorized on april 23 1904 first dam constructed for project was minidoka dam in 1904 its power plant began operating in 1909 producing 7 mw of electricity this capacity was revised to 20 mw in 1993 jackson lake dam far upstream in wyoming s grand teton national park was built in 1907 to raise jackson lake for providing additional water storage in dry years american falls dam upstream of minidoka was completed in 1927 and replaced in 1978 as dams were constructed above shoshone falls historical upriver limit of salmon and also a total barrier to boats and ships no provisions were made for fish passage or navigation several other irrigation dams were also built including twin falls dam and palisades dam thumb left brownlee dam uppermost dam of hells canyon project hells canyon project was built and maintained by idaho power company starting in 1940s and was second of three major water projects on river three dams of project brownlee dam oxbow dam and hells canyon dam are located in upper hells canyon all three dams are primarily for power generation and flood control and do not have fish passage or navigation locks brownlee dam most upriver dam was constructed in 1959 and generates 728 megawatts mw oxbow dam second dam in project was built in 1961 and generates 220 mw dam was named for a bend in snake river shaped like an oxbow hells canyon dam was last and most downriver of three it was constructed in 1967 and generates 450 mw downriver of hells canyon is lower snake river project authorized by rivers and harbors act of 1945 for u s army corps of engineers to create a navigable channel on snake river from its mouth to beginning of hells canyon these dams are from upstream to downstream lower granite lock and dam little goose lock and dam lower monumental lock and dam and ice harbor lock and dam dredging work was also done throughout length of navigation channel to facilitate ship passage these dams form a cascade of reservoirs with no stretches of free flowing river in between immediately below ice harbor dam is lake wallula formed by construction of mcnary dam on columbia river mcnary dam is not part of lower snake river project above lower granite dam river channel from lewiston to johnson bar just below hells canyon is also maintained for jet boats as this section is too rugged for ships these dams have been proposed for removal and if they were to be removed it would be largest dam removal project ever undertaken in united states removal has been proposed on grounds that it would restore salmon runs to lower snake river and clearwater river and other smaller tributaries idaho s snake river once teemed with sockeye salmon however there are almost no wild sockeye salmon left in river due to a number of factors there are many reasons why sockeye salmon in snake river are reduced in number one reason is that river runs through three different states and is over long salmon swimming upstream in this river are faced with predators and dams snake river has fifteen dams and is extremely difficult for salmon to access because of hydroelectric dams hell s canyon dam blocks passage to entire upper snake river grand coulee dam also blocks spawning grounds to famous june hogs legendary chinook salmon that weighed over between 1985 and 2007 only an average of 18 sockeye salmon returned to idaho each year serious conservation efforts by wildlife biologists and fish hatcheries have captured few remaining wild sockeye salmon collected their sperm and eggs and in a laboratory have them spawn instead of spawning naturally these sockeye begin their lives in an incubator in a fishery biologist s laboratory these baby salmon then are transported by ship bypassing dams dams can hurt juvenile baby sockeye salmon with their powerful tides and currents which suck baby salmon down another conservation effort that has helped salmon recover is destruction of old outdated dams such as lewiston dam on clearwater river a tributary of snake after destroying dam salmon populations noticeably recovered another interesting recovery method conservationists and biologists are using is called fish transportation since many juvenile salmon perish at each dam while swimming out to ocean massive ships filter and collect these baby salmon by size and take them out to ocean for a ride where they can be guaranteed to make it alive to saltwater this method raises controversy to effectiveness and costs since this method is extremely expensive almost costing 15 million another possible upstream passage solution is whooshh fish transport system engineers at whooshh innovations have developed a fish passage system that allows for safe and timely transportation of fish over barriers through a flexible tube system via entry into system it is found that over 60 of fisherman are in favor of dam removal on snake river overall these combined efforts have had good success in summer of 2006 snake river reportedly only had 3 sockeye salmon that returned to their spawning grounds in summer of 2013 more than 13 000 sockeye salmon returned to spawning grounds thumb left little goose lock and dam navigation in 1960s and 1970s u s army corps of engineers built four dams and locks on lower snake river to facilitate shipping lower columbia river has likewise been dammed for navigation thus a deep shipping channel through locks and slackwater reservoirs for heavy barges exists from pacific ocean to lewiston idaho most barge traffic originating on snake river goes to deep water ports on lower columbia river such as portland grain mostly wheat is main product shipped from snake and nearly all of it is exported internationally from lower columbia river ports shipping channel is authorized to be at least deep and wide where river depths were less than shipping channel has been dredged in most places dredging and work is ongoing and actual depths vary over time with a channel about deeper than mississippi river system columbia and snake rivers can float barges twice as heavy harden blaine 1996 a river lost life and death of columbia w w norton company agricultural products from idaho and eastern washington are among main goods transported by barge on snake and columbia rivers grain mainly wheat accounts for more than 85 of cargo barged on lower snake river in 1998 over of grain were barged on snake before completion of lower snake dams grain from region was transported by truck or rail to columbia river ports around tri cities other products barged on lower snake river include peas lentils forest products and petroleum biology thumb right 200px columbia river basin world wide fund for nature wwf divides snake river s watershed into two freshwater ecoregions columbia unglaciated ecoregion and upper snake ecoregion shoshone falls marks boundary between two wwf placed ecoregion boundary about downriver from shoshone falls in order to include big wood river main tributary of malad river in upper snake ecoregion because wood river is biologically distinct from rest of downriver snake shoshone falls has presented a total barrier to upstream movement of fish for 30 000 to 60 000 years as a result only 35 of fish fauna above falls and 40 of wood river s fish fauna are shared with lower snake river upper snake freshwater ecoregion includes most of southeastern idaho and extends into small portions of wyoming utah and nevada including major freshwater habitats such as jackson lake compared to lower snake river and rest of columbia river s watershed upper snake

pacific salmon and trout oncorhynchus there are also high often localized levels of mollusc endemism especially in hells canyon and basins of clearwater river salmon river and middle snake river mollusc richness extends into lower columbia river and tributaries such as deschutes river animals aside from aquatic species much of snake river watershed supports larger animals including numerous species of mammals birds amphibians and reptiles especially in headwaters and other mountainous areas strewn throughout watershed gray wolf grizzly bear wolverine mountain lion and canada lynx are common it has been determined that there are 97 species of mammals in upper part of snake river upstream from henrys fork confluence pronghorn and bighorn sheep are common in area drained by lost streams of idaho several rivers and large creeks that flow south from rocky mountains and disappear into snake river aquifer about 274 bird species some endangered or threatened use snake river watershed including bald eagle peregrine falcon whooping crane greater sage grouse and yellow billed cuckoo barrow s goldeneye are a species of bird that occurs commonly along lower section of snake river thumb left in middle reaches of snake river as it flows through snake river plain introduced species have fared better than native species ten amphibian and twenty species of reptiles inhabit upper snake river s wetland and riparian zones several species of frogs are common in lost streams basin and northeasternmost part of snake river watershed including inland tailed frog northern leopard frog western toad columbia spotted frog long toed salamander spadefoot toad however in lower and middle portions of snake river watershed several native species have been severely impacted by agriculture practices and resulting non native species supported by them introduced birds include gray partridge ring necked pheasant and chukar other non native species include bullfrog brown headed cowbird and european starling attracted by construction of cities and towns plants thumb right 200px headwaters of snake river remain heavily forested especially inside protected areas snake river watershed includes a diversity of vegetation zones both past and present a majority of watershed was once covered with shrub steppe grassland most common in snake river plain and also columbia plateau in southeastern washington riparian zones wetlands and marshes once occurred along length of snake river and its tributaries in higher elevations conifer forests of which ponderosa pine is most common dominate landscape basin ranges from semi desert to alpine climates providing habitat for hundreds of species of plants in lowermost part of watershed in southeastern washington snake river is surrounded by an area called columbia plateau which is now mostly occupied by irrigated farms rest of plateau area is characterized by low hills dry lakes and an arid nearly desert climate headwaters of snake river and high mountains elsewhere in watershed were historically heavily forested these include aspen douglas fir and spruce fir comprising about 20 of historic watershed at base of mountains and in lost river basin sagebrush was and is predominant vegetation cover because of deforestation up to one quarter of forests have been taken over by sagebrush leaving remaining forests to cover about 15 of watershed however lodgepole pine has increased in number taking over historic stands of other conifers there are also up to 118 species of rare or endemic plants that occur in snake river watershed salmon and other anadromous fish snake river was once one of most important rivers for spawning of anadromous fish which are hatched in headwaters of rivers live in ocean for most of their lives and return to river to spawn in united states river supported species including chinook salmon coho salmon and sockeye salmon as well as steelhead white sturgeon and pacific lamprey it is known that before construction of dams on river there were three major chinook salmon runs in snake river in spring summer and fall totaling about 120 000 fish and sockeye salmon run was about 150 000 historical barrier to fish migration on snake river was shoshone falls a waterfall that occurs as snake river passes through snake river plain thumb right reaches such as this one in hells canyon are no longer accessible to salmon due to construction of dams since early 20th century when swan falls dam was constructed on middle snake river upstream of hells canyon fifteen dams and reservoirs on river have posed an increasing problem for migrating salmon agricultural lands and their resulting runoff have also had a significant impact on success rate of migrating fish salmon can travel up snake river as far as hells canyon dam using fish passage facilities of four lower snake river dams leaving clearwater grande ronde and salmon river to sustain spawning salmon rising in several forks in clearwater mountains of central idaho clearwater and salmon river watersheds are nearly undeveloped with enormous exception of dam on north fork clearwater river watershed of grande ronde in northeastern oregon is also largely undeveloped four reservoirs formed by lower snake river dams lake sacagawea lake herbert g west lake bryan and lower granite lake have also formed problems as downstream current in pools is often not enough for fish to sense confusing their migration routes at confluence of snake and clearwater rivers young salmon that swim down from spawning gravels in headwaters of clearwater river often delay their migrations because of a significant temperature difference prior to removal of lewiston dam on main clearwater and grangeville dam on south fork clearwater clearwater was completely unusable by migrating salmon agricultural runoff and water held in reservoirs higher upstream on snake warm its waters as it flows through snake river plain so as snake meets clearwater its average temperature is much higher directly below confluence river flows into lower granite lake formed by lower granite dam uppermost dam of lower snake river project paradoxically combination of these factors gives young salmon further time to grow and to feed in lower granite lake so when they begin migration to pacific ocean they often have a higher chance at survival compared to those salmon who migrate to ocean earlier lower snake river dam removal a controversy has erupted since late 20th century over four lower snake river dams with primary argument being that removing dams would allow anadromous fish to reach lower snake river tributaries clearwater river tucannon river and grande ronde river and spawn in much higher numbers however removal of dams has been fiercely opposed by some groups in pacific northwest because much of electricity in northwest comes from dams removing four dams would create a hole in energy grid that would not be immediately replaceable navigation on lower snake would also suffer as submerged riffles rapids and islands would be exposed by removal of dams irrigation pumps for fields in southeastern washington would also have to reach further to access water of snake river however aside from restoring salmon runs dam removal proponents argue that power is replaceable that grain transportation system could be replaced by railroads and that only one of four reservoirs supplies irrigation water irrigators in snake river plain would likely need to allow less water into snake river during low flow in order to create a current in four lower reservoirs and recreation and tourism would likely benefit tributaries thumb right clearwater river is largest tributary of snake river salmon river is second largest tributary although salmon has a larger drainage than clearwater salmon drains much drier country and therefore has a smaller discharger than clearwater about annually compared to about annually for clearwater river thumb right henrys fork is largest tributary upstream of snake river plain thumb right grande ronde river meets snake near middle part of hells canyon thumb right salmon river is second largest tributary joining snake in hells canyon snake river has over 20 major tributaries most of which are in mountainous regions of basin largest by far is clearwater river which drains in north central idaho many of rivers that flow into snake river plain from north sink into snake river aquifer but still contribute their water to river aside from rivers snake is fed by many
