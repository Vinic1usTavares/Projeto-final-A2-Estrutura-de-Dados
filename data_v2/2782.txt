is set in fantasy world of ultima series it takes place inside great stygian abyss a large cave system that contains remnants of a failed utopian civilization player assumes role of avatar ultima series protagonist and attempts to find and rescue a baron s kidnapped daughter ultima underworld has been cited as first role playing game to feature first person action in a 3d environment and it introduced technological innovations such as allowing player to look up and down its design combines simulation elements with concepts from earlier including wizardry and dungeon master which led game s designers to call it a dungeon simulation as such game is non linear and allows for emergent gameplay ultima underworld received widespread critical acclaim and sold nearly 500 000 units game was later placed on numerous hall of fame lists it influenced game developers such as bethesda softworks and valve corporation and it was an inspiration behind games deus ex and bioshock game had a sequel ultima underworld ii labyrinth of worlds 1993 and a new game in series underworld ascendant was released in late 2018 gameplay ultima underworld is a role playing video game rpg that takes place from a first person perspective in a three dimensional environment player s goal is to adventure through a large multi level dungeon in which entire game is set player uses a freely movable mouse cursor to interact with game s world and with icon based interface on heads up display hud each icon has a specific effect for example look icon allows player to examine objects closely while fight icon causes player character to ready his or her weapon player s progression through game is non linear areas may be explored and puzzles and quests finished in any order an automatically filling map to which player may add notes records what player has seen above a minimum level of brightness player character may carry light sources to extend line of sight in varying amounts exploratory actions include looking up and down jumping and swimming left thumb a goblin walks up an inclined surface player has selected fight icon causing player character s current weapon a fist to appear at bottom of screen player begins game by creating a character for whom traits such as gender class and skills may be selected skills range from fighting with an axe to bartering to picking locks by participating in combat quests and exploration character gains experience points when certain amounts of experience points are accumulated character levels up gaining additional hit points and mana experience also allows player to recite mantras at shrines in game each mantra is a statement such as om that increases proficiency in a specific skill when typed simple mantras are provided in game s manual while more complex ones are hidden throughout game an inventory on hud lists items and weapons currently carried by player character capacity is limited by weight players equip items via a paper doll system wherein items are clicked and dragged onto a representation of player character combat occurs in real time and player character may use both melee and ranged weapons player attacks by holding cursor over game screen and clicking depressing button longer to inflict greater damage some weapons allow for different types of attacks depending on where cursor is held for example clicking near bottom of screen may result in a jab while clicking in middle produces a slash simulated dice rolls occur behind scenes to determine weapon accuracy enemies sometimes try to escape when near death and game s stealth mechanics may occasionally be used to avoid combat altogether player may cast spells by selecting an appropriate combination of runestones like mantras runestones must be found in game world before use there are over forty spells some undocumented their effects range from causing earthquakes to allowing player character to fly developers intended ultima underworld to be a realistic and interactive dungeon simulation rather than a straightforward role playing game for example many objects in game have no actual use while a lit torch may be used on corn to create popcorn weapons deteriorate with use and player character must eat and rest light sources burn out unless extinguished before sleeping a physics system allows among other things for items to bounce when thrown against surfaces game contains non player characters npcs with whom player may interact by selecting dialogue choices from a menu most npcs have possessions and are willing to trade them game was designed to give players a palette of strategies with which to approach situations and its simulation systems allow for emergent gameplay plot setting ultima underworld is set in britannia fantasy world of ultima series specifically game takes place inside a large underground dungeon called great stygian abyss dungeon s entrance lies on isle of avatar an island ruled by baron almric abyss first appeared in ultima iv quest of avatar in which it contains player s final goal codex of ultimate wisdom ultima underworld is set after events of ultima vi false prophet in time between two games a man named cabirus attempted to create a utopian colony inside abyss eight settlements of ultima series each embody one of eight virtues and cabirus wished to create a ninth that embodied all virtues to achieve this he united diverse cultures and races in peaceful co existence and planned to promote harmony by giving each group one of eight virtue imbued magical artifacts however he died before distributing artifacts and left no instructions for doing so as a result colony collapsed into anarchy and war and artifacts were lost at time of ultima underworld abyss contains remnants of cabirus s colony inhabited by fractious groups of humans goblins trolls and others story before beginning of game abyss dwelling wizard brothers garamon and tyball accidentally summon a demon slasher of veils while experimenting with inter dimensional travel garamon is used as bait to lure demon into a room imbued with virtue however demon offers tyball great power if he betrays garamon tyball agrees but betrayal fails garamon is killed but seals demon inside room because he lacks virtue tyball cannot re enter by himself and plans to sacrifice baron almric s daughter arial at doorway to gain entrance

dimension but escapes back to isle of avatar and makes it on board baron s ship as volcano erupts as game ends garamon s spirit reveals that he teleported inhabitants of abyss to another cave development ultima underworld was conceived in 1989 by origin systems employee paul neurath he had just completed work on space rogue a hybrid title that features sequences both of 2d tile based role playing and of 3d space flight simulation according to neurath space rogue took first tentative steps in exploring a blend of rpg and simulation elements and this seemed to me a promising direction he felt that way it combined elements was jarring however and believed that he could create a more immersive experience neurath had enjoyed role playing video games like wizardry but found that their simple abstract visuals were an obstacle to suspension of disbelief he believed that dungeon master s detailed first person presentation was a glimpse into future and he sought to create a fantasy role playing game that built on its example in early 1990 neurath wrote a design document for a game titled underworld which described such elements as goblins on of rowboats tossed in waves shooting arrows at player above on a rope bridge swinging in wind he contracted former origin employee doug wike to create concept art wike created a brief hand drawn animation with deluxe paint animation which depicted game s interface and a creature moving toward player animation defined game s direction and it was used as a reference point for game s tone and features throughout development that spring neurath founded company blue sky productions in salem new hampshire with intention to create underworld among company s first employees was doug church who was studying at massachusetts institute of technology mit team was thus composed of doug church as programmer doug wike as lead artist and paul neurath as lead designer development began in may 1990 an early difficulty was implementation of texture mapping neurath had experimented unsuccessfully with concept on an apple ii computer in late 1980s but he believed that more powerful ibm pcs of time might be able to process it he contacted lerner research programmer chris green an acquaintance from his past work with ned lerner who created a working algorithm using space rogue engine green s algorithm assembly code from lerner research s car and driver and original programming blue sky team completed a prototype of underworld after roughly a month of work neurath described prototype as fast smooth and featuring true texture mapped walls though ceiling and floor were flat shaded and corridors and rooms were all 10 3 0 m high it looked a lot like wolfenstein 3d in fact team demonstrated it at june 1990 consumer electronics show ces and impressed origin systems origin producer warren spector later said i remember paul showing me that demo at ces and being totally floored by it none of us had ever seen anything like it two companies reached a publishing agreement that summer and origin suggested that game be reworked to fit into ultima universe team agreed and game was renamed ultima underworld while spector had hoped to produce game he was not assigned to role and he later said that he sort of watched other producer jealously from sidelines after game was renamed doug church recruited dan schmidt a college friend who had just graduated from mit as a programmer team abandoned space rogue engine and created a new one that could display a believable 3d world one with varying heights and texture mapped floors and ceilings church estimated that first year of production was dedicated to creating game s technological base however neurath stated that team spent comparatively little time on game s technology and that most was spent working on game features mechanics and world building their ultimate goal was to create finest dungeon game a game that was tangibly better than any of long line of dungeon games that came before it each member of small team assumed multiple roles for example game s first two levels were designed by paul neurath while rest were built by artists designers and programmers according to schmidt neurath contracted a writer to create game s story and dialogue but relationship was a mismatch and so team decided to write plot themselves alongside his programming work church co wrote game s story with dan schmidt and he gradually took on project leader responsibilities writing duties for each level were given to person who created that level schmidt s role was to edit dialogue of each level to fit with that of others schmidt also created game s sound effects which were synthesized no recorded sounds were used in a graphical sound editor neurath who church said was very day to day at beginning of project became more involved with company s business and finances church explained that core of project was its dynamic creation he noted that team had no set of rules or pre written plan but rather worked organically toward general idea of creating a dungeon simulation church believed that game s ultima series heritage was extremely helpful as it gave team an anchor for their experiments according to church because team was young and inexperienced they were improvising almost whole time he said that they would just write something that seemed interesting but would then get it half done and we d say eh that s not working he believed that this iterative method was useful overall but that it entailed an abnormally large workload it resulted in creation of four movement systems before we were done several combat systems and so forth certain failed experiments meant that team created ai code for many ideas which turned out to be largely irrelevant to actual gameplay during first year of game s development church believed that origin had little faith in team s ability to complete game he later said they didn t pay any attention at all frankly while origin ceo richard garriott helped team in fitting game into ultima franchise warren spector later said that company seemed blase about ultima underworld for first several months after origin and blue sky signed deal despite his own belief that it was a change world project neurath opined that this was due to team s status as outsiders whose company was some 1 500 miles distant from their publisher team was advanced 30 000 to create game but its final cost was 400 000 game was funded partly by ned lerner and by neurath s royalties from space rogue throughout game s production studio was run on a tight budget roughly a year into development team discovered that their second producer first having quit origin near beginning of development had left project neurath later said that neither producer had much involvement in game and that following second s departure team spent time without any producer at all rumors circulated that origin planned to cancel project following a proposal by team around this time spector who had previously worked with neurath on space rogue assumed role of producer church later described this event as a big win for everyone spector began to interact regularly with team by phone and to visit studio in person neurath later said warren understood immediately what we were trying to accomplish with game and became our biggest champion within origin had not warren stepped in this role at that stage i m not sure ultima underworld would have ever seen light of day church said that spector helped team polish game and make it real and that spector s past experience in industry enabled him to keep team focused on completing game he explained that spector had that ability to help me and rest of guys reset from big picture view of someone who has done it before final four months of game s development constituted crunch time during this period neurath rented an extremely small basement office space in a somerville massachusetts social services building he sought to circumvent long commute that several team members had been making from massachusetts furniture consisted of inexpensive folding tables and uncomfortable red deck chairs development took place during winter but room was drafty and poorly heated team hired college friends such as marc leblanc to bug test game and spector stayed at studio for roughly a month and a half according to church spector later said that in that little office that team created some serious magic i mean sense of doing something incredible was palpable neurath summarized despite austere working environment game came together amazingly well in final stretch and we delivered gold master just about two years after we had started game was released in march 1992 underworld s game engine was written by a small team chris green provided game s texture mapping algorithm which was applied to walls floors and ceilings engine allowed for transparencies walls at 45 degree angles multiple tile heights and inclined surfaces and other aspects ultima underworld was first video game to implement many of these effects game was also first indoor real time 3d first person game to allow player to look up and down and to jump ultima underworld uses two dimensional sprites for characters but also features 3d objects as team believed that it had to do 3d objects in order to have reasonable visuals game uses physics to calculate motion of thrown objects during game s alpha testing phase part of programming team worked to create a smooth lighting model game s advanced technology caused engine to run slowly and its system requirements were extremely high doug church later downplayed importance of game s technology stating that technological advancement is somewhat inevitable in our field and sadly as an industry we seem to know much less about design and how to continue to extend and grow design capabilities instead he claimed that ultima underworlds most important achievement was its incorporation of simulation elements into a role playing game underworld was not an immediate commercial success which caused origin to decrease its marketing support however its popularity increased via word of mouth in years following its release and sales eventually reached nearly 500 000 copies game received critical acclaim with praise directed toward its 3d presentation and feature in 1993 game won origins award for best fantasy or science fiction computer game of 1992 and was nominated for an award at game developers conference ace called ultima underworld next true evolutionary step in rpg genre and noted that its simulation style dungeon was frighteningly realistic magazine thought that game s sprite character models detract from dense atmosphere a bit but ended review by stating if you ve got a pc then you ve got to have ultima underworld dragon magazine opined that to say this is best dungeon game we ve ever played is quite an understatement and it will leave you wondering how other game entertainments can ever stack up against new standards abyss sets computer gaming worlds allen greenberg in 1992 described it as an ambitious project but not without its share of problems he praised game s enjoyable story and well crafted puzzles but disliked its robotic controls and confusing perspectives and stated that far more impressive sounds and pictures have been produced for other dungeon games he summarized game as an enjoyable challenge with a unique game playing engine to back it up scorpia was also positive stating that despite flaws ultima underworld is an impressive first product meticulous construction of a real world dungeon environment is outstanding it may be a dungeon trek but it is certainly dungeon trek of future in 1993 she praised superb graphics of a definite must for game players magazine later awarded game role playing game of year computer shopper enjoyed its storyline and characters and believed that game makes you feel as if you ve entered a virtual reality despite describing its interface as not truly intuitive reviewer finished by calling game addictive and a fine value chicago tribune awarded it best game of year and called it an amazing triumph of imagination and creme de la creme of dungeon epics game was also well received by non english publications swedish considered game to be in a class by itself in germany power play praised its technical perfection and excellent story while play time lauded its graphical and aural presentation and awarded it game of month finland s pelit stated ultima underworld is something totally new in crpg field virtual fantasy of abyss left reviewers speechless ultima underworld was inducted into many hall of fame lists including those compiled by gamespy ign and computer gaming world pc gamer us ranked game and its sequel 20th on their 1997 50 best games ever list citing strong character interaction thoughtful puzzles unprecedented control and genuine roleplaying in ways that have yet to be duplicated in 2004 readers of retro gamer voted ultima underworld as 62nd top retro game staff called it easily one of best entries in long running ultima series retro gamer 8 page 67 in 1998 pc gamer declared it 18th best computer game ever released and editors called it light years ahead of their time and still regarded as some of best roleplaying games ever created underworld has been cited as first rpg to feature first person action in a 3d environment and even as first true first person 3d game in any genre rival 3d games appeared legends of valour advertised ultima underworld move over gamasutra posited that all 3d rpg titles from morrowind to world of warcraft share ultima underworld as a common ancestor both graphically and spiritually and for better or for worse underworld moved text based rpg out of realm of imagination and into third dimension its soundtrack composed by george fat man sanger and dave govett was first in a major first person game to use a dynamic music system player s actions alter game s music ultima underworld is considered first example of an immersive sim a genre that combines elements from other genres to create a game with strong player agency and emergent gameplay and has influence many games since its release game s influence has been found in bioshock 2007 and that game s designer ken levine has stated that all things that i wanted to do and all games that i ended up working on came out of inspiration i took from ultima underworld gears of war designer cliff bleszinski also cited it as an early influence stating that it had far more impact on me than doom other games influenced by ultima underworld include elder scrolls arena deus ex deus ex invisible war vampire masquerade bloodlines and half life 2 toby gard stated that when designing tomb raider he was a big fan of ultima underworld and i wanted to mix that type of game with sort of polygon characters that were just being showcased in virtua fighter ultima underworld was also basis for looking glass technologies later system shock id software s use of texture mapping in catacomb 3 d a precursor to wolfenstein 3d was influenced by ultima underworld conflicting accounts exist regarding extent of this influence however in book masters of doom author david kushner asserts that concept was discussed only briefly during a 1991 telephone conversation between paul neurath and john romero however doug church has said that john carmack saw game s summer 1990 software convention demo and recalled a comment from carmack that he could write a faster texture mapper paul neurath has recounted incident similarly with both carmack and romero present despite technology developed for ultima underworld origin opted to continue using traditional top down 2d graphics for future mainline ultima games engine was re used and enhanced for ultima underworlds 1993 sequel ultima underworld ii labyrinth of worlds looking glass studios planned to create a third ultima underworld but origin rejected their pitches after electronic arts ea rejected arkane studios pitch for ultima underworld iii studio instead created a spiritual successor arx in early 2000s paul neurath approached ea to discuss a port of ultima underworld to pocket pc ea rejected suggestion but allowed him to look for possible developers neurath found that interactive enthusiastically supported idea and ea eventually licensed rights to company doug church and floodgate entertainment assisted with portions of its pocket pc development and port was released in 2002 in 2015 otherside entertainment a new developer founded by paul neurath and other looking glass and irrational veterans announced a
