to set story during vietnam war as opposed to novel which is set during world war ii we were in high school in mid 1960 s behr explained so growing up then was our experience structuring film required

city and philadelphia matthew modine originally auditioned for role of al columbato but parker decided to cast him as birdy believing that actor possessed an introverted honest quality that best suited character modine said i was flabbergasted because i hadn t auditioned for birdy i had never imagined playing part of birdy so i had to really go through an extraordinary transformation in my mind of trying to bring this remarkable character to life it was an incredible experience making film nicolas cage was cast as al columbato he reflected i was terrified of role of al because it was like nothing i d ever done before and i didn t know how to get to places role was asking me to go emotionally for scenes in which al s face is disfigured and swathed in bandages cage lost 15 pounds and had two of his front teeth pulled out i wanted to look like i was hit by a bomb he said it gave me a feeling of something i had lost i felt this was a once in a lifetime part and it deserved that

camera system created by garrett brown inventor of steadicam skycam had 100 foot high posts with four hanging wires controlled by a computer and a lightweight panavision camera with 200 feet of film hung at center of wires filmmakers intended to use skycam to fully depict birdy s point of view during a fantasy sequence in which he imagines himself flying however they encountered difficulties with skycam which would often malfunction although skycam proved successful on its first take parker insisted that filmed footage be shot more rapidly however camera system malfunctioned during its second take after capturing 40 seconds of footage this resulted in camera operators shooting remainder of sequence with a steadicam mounted on top of an improvised camera dolly a women s prison wing located in philadelphia house of correction doubled for a scene set in an atlantic city jail a scene depicting birdy and al climbing an elevated railway was filmed at 46th street station above intersection of

but a test of water had shown it to be hazardous parker said we experimented with a 100 foot wire hanging from a helicopter to allow us to fly birdy into a pond we d constructed at bottom of a hill of garbage military hospital scenes were filmed at developmental center a psychiatric and medical care facility located in santa clara a corner of hospital was used to film scenes set in birdy s bedroom

songwriter peter gabriel it marked his first work on a feature film as well as his first collaboration with music producer daniel lanois during post production parker had been incorporating percussive rhythms from gabriel s solo albums into film he contacted musician s manager david geffen who advised him that producing soundtrack would be a slow process as gabriel was known for working at his own pace while working on his fifth studio album so gabriel agreed to score birdy after viewing a rough cut of film recording sessions took place at house in somerset england from october to december 1984 gabriel used tapes of previously recorded material from past four years which he and lanois remixed for individual scenes in film score close up originated from song family snapshot from gabriel s third album which was composed on a yamaha cp 70 electric grand piano scores heat birdy s flight under lock and key and powerhouse at foot of mountain borrowed musical elements from songs on his fourth album which had been composed on a fairlight cmi iix a music workstation with an embedded digital sampling synthesizer soundtrack album entitled birdy music from film was released on march 18 1985 by geffen records and charisma records allmusic s tom demalon awarded it four stars out of five writing fact that birdy is all instrumentals means that listeners whose familiarity with gabriel is limited to sledgehammer and in your eyes will be largely disappointed however its meditative nature makes it fine reflective listening for more adventurous release tri star pictures had planned to release film using a platform technique which involved opening it in select cities before releasing it nationwide studio was confident that limited theatrical run would generate strong word of mouth interest and awards consideration for film birdy opened in limited release on december 21 1984 in new york city los angeles and toronto film s failure to garner any award nominations during limited run resulted in tri star cancelling a wide release scheduled for late january 1985 in response a m films prompted studio to refocus film s marketing campaign tri star adjusted its promotional focus on

writing birdy tells a story so unlikely and yet a story so interesting it is impossible to put this movie out of my mind janet maslin of new york times wrote mr parker has for most part directed film deftly and unobtrusively every so often though he introduces kind of overstatement birdy didn t need fortunately heavy handedness is in limited supply most of birdy is enchanting film critic emanuel levy called it a powerfully dramatic chronicle of postwar trauma gene siskel of chicago tribune felt that film was far better as an antiwar film than as a poetic tribute to flight pauline kael of new yorker wrote it feels morose and unrelieved despite efforts of modine and cage variety wrote belying lightheartedness of its title birdy is a heavy adult drama about best friends and after effects of war but it takes too long to live up to its ambitious premise jack zink of sun sentinel wrote that film takes a while to hook you into its story this is one occasion we can afford wait parker keeps us awake by repeatedly slapping us across face visually accolades birdy received several awards and honors with particular recognition for film itself national board of review named it one of top ten films of 1984 following its release film premiered at 1985 cannes film festival and on may 20 1985 it won grand prix special du jury prize in 1987 film received an audience award at warsaw
