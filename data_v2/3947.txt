by hydrogen balloon from svalbard to either russia or canada which was to pass with luck straight over north pole on way scheme was received with patriotic enthusiasm in sweden a northern nation that had fallen behind in race for north pole andree ignored many early signs of dangers associated with his balloon plan being able to steer balloon to some extent was essential for a safe journey but there was much evidence that drag rope steering technique andree had invented was ineffective yet he staked fate of expedition on drag ropes worse polar balloon eagle was delivered directly to svalbard from its manufacturer in paris without being tested when measurements showed it to be leaking more than expected andree refused to acknowledge alarming implications most modern students of expedition see andree s optimism faith in power of technology and disregard for forces of nature as main factors in series of events that led to his death and those of his two companions nils strindberg and knut fraenkel this assessment is discussed in several contexts in var position ar ej synnerligen god by andree specialist sven lundstrom curator of andreexpedition polarcenter in granna

of expedition s last camp created a media sensation in sweden where dead men had been mourned and idolized andree s motives have since been re evaluated along with assessing role of polar areas as proving ground of masculinity and patriotism an early example is per olof sundman s fictionalized bestseller novel of 1967 flight of eagle which portrays andree as weak and cynical at mercy of his sponsors and media verdict on andree by modern writers for virtually sacrificing lives of his two younger companions varies in harshness depending on whether he is seen as manipulator or victim of swedish nationalist fervor around turn of 20th century see kjellstrom p 45 lundstrom p 131 martinsson background andree s scheme thumb upright 1 3 salomon august andree second half of 19th century has often been called heroic age of antarctic exploration safe return doubtful heroic age of polar exploration inhospitable and dangerous arctic and antarctic regions appealed powerfully to imagination of age not as lands with their own ecologies and cultures but as challenges to be conquered by technological ingenuity and manly daring salomon august andree shared these enthusiasms and proposed a plan for letting wind propel a hydrogen balloon from svalbard across arctic sea to bering strait to fetch up in alaska canada or russia and passing near or even right over north pole on way andree was an engineer at patent office in stockholm with a passion for ballooning he bought his own balloon svea in 1893 and made nine journeys with it starting from gothenburg or stockholm and traveling a combined distance of in prevailing westerly winds svea flights had a strong tendency to carry him uncontrollably out to baltic sea and drag his basket perilously along surface of water or slam it into one of many rocky islets in stockholm archipelago thumb upright left andree s hydrogen balloon svea on one occasion he was blown clear across baltic to finland his longest trip was due east from gothenburg across breadth of sweden and out over baltic to gotland even though he saw a lighthouse and heard breakers off oland he remained convinced that he was traveling over land and seeing lakes lundstrom pp 12 16 during a couple of svea flights andree tested and tried out drag rope steering technique which he had developed and wanted to use on his projected north pole expedition drag ropes which hang from balloon basket and drag part of their length on ground are designed to counteract tendency of lighter than air craft to travel at same speed as wind a situation that makes steering by sails impossible friction of ropes was intended to slow balloon to point where sails would have an effect beyond that of making balloon rotate on its axis andree reported and presumably believed that with drag rope sails steering he had succeeded in deviating about ten degrees either way from wind direction this notion is rejected by modern balloonists swedish ballooning association maintains that andree s belief that he had deviated from wind was mistaken andrees svenska being misled by and a surfeit of enthusiasm in an environment of variable winds and poor visibility use of drag ropes prone to snapping falling off or becoming entangled with each other or ground in addition to being ineffective is not considered by any modern expert to be a useful steering technique promotion and fundraising thumb international interest french artist s impression of projected launch arctic ambitions of sweden were still unrealized in late 19th century while neighboring and politically subordinate norway was a world power in arctic exploration through such pioneers as fridtjof nansen lundstrom pp 19 44 swedish political and scientific elite were eager to see sweden take that lead among scandinavian countries which seemed her due and andree a persuasive speaker and fundraiser found it easy to gain support for his ideas at a lecture in 1895 for royal swedish academy of sciences andree thrilled audience of geographers and meteorologists a polar exploration balloon he explained would need to fulfill four conditions it must have enough lifting power to carry three people and all their scientific equipment advanced cameras for aerial photography provisions for four months and ballast altogether about it must retain gas well enough to stay aloft for 30 days hydrogen gas must be manufactured and balloon filled at arctic launch site it must be at least somewhat steerable andree gave a glowingly optimistic account of ease with which these requirements could be met larger balloons had been constructed in france he claimed and more airtight too some french balloons had remained hydrogen filled for over a year without appreciable loss of buoyancy as for hydrogen filling balloon at launch site could easily be done with help of mobile hydrogen manufacturing units for steering he referred to his own drag rope experiments with svea stating that a deviation of 27 degrees from wind direction could be routinely achieved thumb upright 0 7 left merchandising in 1896 andree assured audience that arctic summer weather was uniquely suitable for ballooning midnight sun would enable observations round clock halving voyage time required and do away with all need for anchoring at night which might otherwise be a dangerous business neither would balloon s buoyancy be adversely affected by cold of night drag rope steering technique was particularly well adapted for a region where ground consisting of ice was low in friction and free of vegetation he said that minimal precipitation in area posed no threat of weighing down balloon if some rain or snow did fall on balloon andree argued precipitation at above zero temperatures will melt and precipitation at below zero temperatures will blow off for balloon will be traveling more slowly than wind audience was convinced by these arguments so disconnected were they from realities of arctic summer storms fogs high humidity and ever present threat of ice formation academy approved andree s expense calculation of 130 800 kronor in all corresponding in today s money to just under a million u s dollars see this price level chart from sweden of which single largest sum 36 000 kronor was for balloon with this endorsement there was a rush to support his project headed by king oscar ii who personally contributed 30 000 kronor and alfred nobel dynamite magnate and founder of nobel prize lundstrom pp 21 27 there was also considerable international interest and european and american newspaper reading public was curious about a project that seemed as modern and scientific as books of contemporary author jules verne press fanned interest with a wide range of predictions from certain death for for

scientists in these days construction and guidance of airships have been improved greatly wrote providence journal and it is supposed both by parisian experts and by swedish scientists who have been assisting m andree that question of a sustained flight in this case will be very satisfactorily answered by character of balloon by its careful guidance and providing it gets into a polar current of air by elements themselves providence journal 21 january 1896 thumb andree s balloon was made at henri lachambre s workshop in paris faith in experts and in science was common in popular press but with international attention came also for first time informed criticism andree being sweden s first balloonist no one had requisite knowledge to second guess him about buoyancy or drag ropes but both germany and france had long ballooning traditions and several of their more experienced balloonists expressed skepticism about andree s methods and inventions lundstrom pp 28 29 mentions in particular gross in germany and renard brothers in france however just as with svea mishaps all objections failed to dampen andree s optimism eagerly followed by national and international media he began negotiations with well known aeronaut and balloon builder henri lachambre in paris world capital of ballooning and ordered a varnished three layer silk balloon in diameter from his workshop balloon originally called was to be renamed eagle special technical solutions had to be designed for accommodations for three adults to be confined in a small balloon basket for up to 30 days sleeping berths for crew were fitted at floor of basket along with some of stores and provisions med ornen mot polen p 49 highly flammable hydrogen meant that cooking could not be done in basket itself solution was a modified primus stove designed by a friend of andree s that could be dangled below crew and then lit from basket at a safe distance an angled mirror attached to specially designed stove allowed crew to determine whether it was successfully lit or not med ornen mot polen p 58 first expedition thumb upright 1 1 new crew of 1896 from left to right vilhelm swedenborg nils strindberg knut fraenkel s a andree for his 1896 attempt to launch balloon andree had many eager volunteers to choose from he picked nils gustaf ekholm an experienced arctic meteorological researcher and formerly his boss during an 1882 1883 geophysical expedition to spitsbergen and nils strindberg a brilliant student who was doing original research in physics and chemistry main scientific purpose of expedition was to map area by means of aerial photography and strindberg was both a devoted amateur photographer and a skilled constructor of advanced cameras lundstrom p 36 this was a team with many useful scientific and technical skills but lacking any particular physical prowess or training for survival under extreme conditions all three men were indoor types and only one strindberg was young andree expected a sedentary voyage in a balloon basket and strength and survival skills were far down on his list lundstrom p 32 modern writers all agree that andree s north pole scheme was unrealistic he relied on winds blowing more or less in direction he wanted to go on being able to fine tune his direction with drag ropes on balloon being sealed tight enough to stay airborne for 30 days and on no ice or snow sticking to balloon to weigh it down account of andree s and computations and hypotheses in this section relies on kjellstrom passim in attempt of 1896 wind immediately refuted his optimism by blowing steadily from north straight at balloon hangar at danes island until expedition had to pack up let hydrogen out of balloon and go home it is now known that northerly winds are to be expected at danes island but in late 19th century information on arctic airflow and precipitation existed only as contested academic hypotheses even ekholm an arctic climate researcher had no objection to andree s theory of where wind was likely to take them observational data simply did not exist thumb three explorers festive send off from stockholm in spring of 1896 on other hand ekholm was skeptical of balloon s ability to retain hydrogen from his own measurements his buoyancy checks in summer of 1896 during process of producing hydrogen and pumping it into balloon convinced him that balloon leaked too much to ever reach pole let alone go on to russia or canada worst leakage came from approximately eight million tiny stitching holes along seams which no amount of glued on strips of silk or applications of special secret formula varnish seemed to seal lundstrom p 59 balloon was losing of lift force per day taking into account its heavy load ekholm estimated that it would be able to stay airborne for 17 days at most not 30 when it was time to go home he warned andree that he would not take part in next attempt scheduled for summer 1897 unless a stronger better sealed balloon was bought andree resisted ekholm s criticisms to point of deception on boat back from svalbard ekholm learned from chief engineer of hydrogen plant explanation of some anomalies he had noticed in his measurements andree had from time to time secretly ordered extra topping up of hydrogen in balloon andree s motives for such self destructive behavior are not known thumb upright 1 1 left knut fraenkel several modern writers following sundman s andree portrait in semi documentary novel flight of eagle 1967 have speculated that andree had by this time become prisoner of his own successful funding campaign sponsors and media followed every delay and reported on every setback and were clamoring for results andree strindberg and ekholm had been seen off by cheering crowds in stockholm and gothenburg and now all expectations were coming to nothing with long wait for southerly winds at danes island especially pointed was contrast between nansen s simultaneous return covered in polar glory from his daring yet well planned expedition on ship fram and andree s failure even to launch his own much hyped conveyance sundman theorizes that andree could not face letting press report that he did not know prevailing wind direction and had also miscalculated in ordering balloon and needed a new one to rectify his error kjellstrom p 45 lundstrom pp 69 73 after 1896 launch was called off enthusiasm declined for joining expedition for second attempt in 1897 from candidates andree picked 27 year old engineer knut fraenkel to replace ekholm fraenkel was a civil engineer from north of sweden an athlete who was fond of long mountain hikes he was enrolled specifically to take over ekholm s meteorological observations despite lacking ekholm s theoretical and scientific knowledge he handled this task efficiently his meteorological journal has enabled researchers to reconstruct movements of three men during their last few months with considerable precision lundstrom p 39

year old enthusiast knut fraenkel lundstrom pp 73 114 on 11 july in a steady wind from south west top of plank hangar was dismantled three explorers climbed into already heavy basket and andree dictated one last minute telegram to king oscar and another to paper aftonbladet holder of press rights to expedition large support team cut away last ropes holding balloon and it rose slowly moving out low over water it was pulled so far down by friction of several hundred meter long drag ropes against ground as to dip basket into water friction also twisted ropes around detaching them from their screw holds these holds were a new safety feature that andree had reluctantly been persuaded to add whereby ropes that got caught on ground could be more easily dropped most of them unscrewed at once and of rope were lost while three explorers could simultaneously be seen to dump of sand overboard to get basket clear of water of essential weight was thus lost in first few minutes before it was well clear of launch site eagle had turned from a supposedly steerable craft into an ordinary hydrogen balloon with a few ropes hanging from it at mercy of wind its crew had no means to direct it to any particular goal and had too little ballast for stability med ornen mot polen p 84 lundstrom pp 75 76 lightened balloon rose to an unimagined height where lower air pressure made hydrogen escape all faster through eight million little holes thumb left explorers minutes before takeoff on 11 july balloon had two means of communication with outside world buoys and homing pigeons buoys steel cylinders encased in cork were intended to be dropped from balloon into water or onto ice to be carried to civilization by currents only two buoy messages have ever been found one was dispatched by

desperate situation which andree described fully in his main diary lundstrom p 81 balloon was out of equilibrium sailing much too high and thereby losing hydrogen faster than even nils ekholm had feared then repeatedly threatening to crash on ice it was weighed down by being rain soaked dripping wet writes andree in diary and men were throwing all sand and some of payload overboard to keep it airborne free flight lasted for 10 hours and 29 minutes and was followed by another 41 hours of bumpy riding with frequent ground contact before inevitable final crash eagle traveled for two days and three and a half hours altogether during which time according to andree none of three men got any sleep definitive landing appears to have been gentle neither men nor homing pigeons in their wicker

main diary med ornen mot polen pp 391 461 last four pages of andree s diary were so damaged when recovered that only fragments could be deciphered fraenkel in his meteorological journal strindberg s own stenographic diary was more personal in content and included his general reflections on expedition as well as several messages to his fiancee anna charlier med ornen mot polen pp 465 485 all three manuscripts were eventually retrieved from ice on kvitoya in 1930 eagle had been stocked with safety equipment such as guns snowshoes sleds skis a tent a small boat in form of a bundle of bent sticks to be assembled and covered with balloon silk most of it stored not in basket but in storage space arranged above balloon ring these items had not been put together with great care or with any acknowledgment of adopting indigenous peoples techniques for dealing with extreme environment in this andree contrasted not only with later but also with many earlier explorers sven lundstrom points to agonizing extra efforts that became necessary for team due to andree s mistaken design of sleds with a rigid construction that borrowed nothing from long proven inuit sleds and were so impractical for difficult terrain andree called it dreadful terrain with channels separating ice floes high ridges and partially iced over melt ponds lundstrom pp 93 96 men s clothes included no furs but were woolen coats and trousers plus oilskins they wore oilskins but explorers reported always seeming to be damp or wet from half frozen pools of water on ice and typically foggy humid arctic summer air

down for their safety one at cape flora in franz josef land and one at sjuoyane seven islands in svalbard inferring from their faulty maps that distances to each were about equal they decided to try for bigger depot at cape flora strindberg took more pictures during this week than he would at any later point including 12 frames that make up a 360 degree panorama of crash site that series of frames is designed as a panorama was only noticed in 2004 study by tyrone martinsson who has created an animated web version of it see martinsson 2004 panorama can be seen here balloon had carried a lot of food of a kind adapted more for a balloon voyage than for travels on foot andree had reasoned that they might as well throw excess food overboard as sand if losing weight was necessary and if it was not food would serve if wintering in arctic desert did after all become necessary there was therefore less ballast and large amounts of heavy type provisions altogether including of water and some crates of champagne port beer etc donated by sponsors and manufacturers there was also lemon juice though not as much of this precaution against scurvy as other polar explorers usually thought necessary much of food was in form of cans of pemmican meat sausages cheese and condensed milk thumb upright 1 1 strindberg on snowshoes with heavily laden impractical sled by time they crashed they had thrown some of it overboard three men took most of rest with them on leaving crash site along with other necessities such as guns tent ammunition and cooking utensils making a load on each sled of more than this was not realistic as it broke sleds and wore out men after one week they sorted out and left behind a big pile of food and non essential equipment bringing loads down to per sled it became more necessary than ever to hunt for food they shot and ate seals walruses and especially polar bears throughout march lundstrom p 111 113 starting out for franz josef land to south east on 22 july three soon found that their struggle across ice which had ridges two stories high was hardly bringing goal any nearer drift of ice was in opposite direction moving them backward on 4 august they decided after a long discussion to aim for sjuoyane in southwest instead hoping to reach depot there after a six to seven week march with help of current terrain in that direction was mostly extremely

weeks they tried in vain to overcome this by turning more and more westward but it was becoming clear that sjuoyane was out of their reach lundstrom p 102 thumb upright 1 1 left crossing a channel with balloon silk boat on 12 september explorers resigned themselves to wintering on ice and camped on a large floe letting ice take them where it would which writes kjellstrom it had really been doing all along drifting rapidly due south towards kvitoya they hurriedly built a winter home on floe against increasing cold with walls made of water reinforced snow to strindberg s design observing rapidity of their drift andree recorded his hopes that they might get far enough south to feed themselves entirely from sea med ornen mot polen p 444 however floe began to break up directly under hut on 2 october from stresses of pressing against kvitoya and they were forced to bring their stores on to island itself which took a couple of days morale remains good reports andree at very end of coherent part of his diary which ends with such comrades one should be able to manage under i may say any circumstances bellows med ornen mot polen p 456 it is inferred from incoherent and badly

finds at stockholm for next 33 years fate of expedition was shrouded in mystery and its disappearance became part of cultural lore in sweden and to a certain extent elsewhere it was actively sought for a couple of years and remained subject of myth and rumor with frequent international newspaper reports of possible findings an extensive archive of american newspaper reports from first few years 1896 1899 titled mystery of andree shows a much richer media interest in expedition after it disappeared than before a great variety of fates are suggested for it inspired by finds or reported finds of remnants of what might be a balloon basket or great amounts of balloon silk or by stories of men falling from sky or visions by psychics all of which would typically locate stranded balloon far from danes island and svalbard see mystery of andree lundstrom points out that some of international and national reports took on features of urban legends they reflected a prevailing disrespect for indigenous peoples of arctic who were portrayed in newspapers as savages who had killed three men or showed a deadly indifference to their plight these speculations were refuted in 1930 upon discovery of expedition s final resting place on kvitoya by crews of two ships bratvaag and isbjorn recovery thumb upright 1 1 a recovered tea towel in tromso polar museum norwegian bratvaag expedition studying glaciers and seas of svalbard archipelago from norwegian sealing vessel bratvaag of alesund found remains of andree expedition on 5 august 1930 kvitoya was usually inaccessible to sealing or whaling ships of time as it is typically surrounded by a wide belt of thick polar ice and often hidden by thick ice fogs however summer in 1930 had been particularly warm and surrounding sea was practically free of ice as kvitoya was known to be a prime hunting ground for walrus and fogs over island on that day were comparatively thin some of crew of bratvaag took this rare opportunity to land on what they called inaccessible island two of sealers in search of water olav salen and karl discovered andree s boat near a small stream frozen under a mound of snow and full of equipment including a engraved with words andree s polar expedition 1896 presented with this hook captain peder assigned crew to search site together with expedition members among other finds they uncovered a journal and two skeletons identified as andree s and strindberg s remains by monograms found on their clothing bratvaag left island to continue its scheduled hunting and observations with intent of coming back

of three men were cremated in 1930 without further examination upon being returned to sweden question of what exactly caused their deaths has attracted both interest and controversy among scholars several medical practitioners and amateur historians have read extensive diaries with a detective s eye looking for clues in diet for telltale complaints of symptoms and for suggestive details at death site lundstrom pp 114 115 they agree on many particulars for instance explorers are known to have eaten mainly scanty amounts of canned and dry goods from balloon stores plus huge portions of half cooked meat of polar bears and occasionally seals they frequently suffered from foot pains and diarrhea and were always tired cold and wet when they moved on to kvitoya from ice they left much of their valuable equipment and stores outside tent and even down by water s edge as if they were too exhausted indifferent or ill to carry it further strindberg youngest died first and was buried wedged into a cliff aperture by others however interpretation of these observations is contested best known and most widely credited suggestion is that made by ernst tryde a medical practitioner in his book de pa viton dead on kvitoya in 1952 that men succumbed to trichinosis which they had contracted from eating undercooked polar bear meat larvae of trichinella spiralis were found in parts of a polar bear carcass at site lundstrom and sundman both favor this explanation critics note that diarrhea which tryde cites as main symptomatic evidence hardly needs an explanation beyond general poor diet and physical misery but some more specific symptoms of trichinosis are missing also fridtjof nansen and his companion hjalmar johansen had lived largely on polar bear meat in exactly same area for 15 months without any ill effects see kjellstrom pp 50 51 and personne other suggestions have included vitamin a poisoning from eating polar bear liver however diary shows andree to have been aware of this danger carbon monoxide poisoning is a theory that has found a few adherents such as explorer vilhjalmur stefansson stefansson unsolved mysteries of arctic chief objection is that their primus stove had kerosene still in tank when found stefansson argues that they were using a malfunctioning stove something he has experienced in his own expeditions lead poisoning from cans in which their food was stored is an alternative suggestion as is scurvy botulism suicide they had plenty of opium and polar bear attack a combination favored by kjellstrom is that of cold and hypothermia as arctic winter closed in with dehydration and general exhaustion apathy and disappointment kjellstrom argues that tryde never takes nature of their daily life into account and especially crowning blow of ice breaking up under their promisingly mobile home forcing them to move onto a glacier island posterity has expressed surprise that they died on kvitoya surrounded by food writes kjellstrom surprise is rather that they found strength to live so long kjellstrom p 54 mark personne a poison specialist who suggested botulism as cause in his andree man dog av botulism in 2000 provides an overview of other theories in swedish in 2010 writer and researcher bea at karolinska institutet sweden rejected theory that larvae of trichinella spiralis killed expedition members after examining men s clothes
