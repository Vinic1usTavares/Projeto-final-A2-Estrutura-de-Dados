development of final fantasy xv a japanese action role playing video game began in 2006 shortly before its announcement at that year s electronic entertainment expo square enix handled primary development on final fantasy xv and game was released worldwide in november 2016 total development time covered approximately ten years game was originally announced as final fantasy versus xiii a playstation 3 exclusive spin off title it was part of fabula nova crystallis final fantasy a subseries of games linked by a common mythos while retaining thematic links specific references were removed to aid with marketing additional media was created to portray world of xv without using sequels dubbed final fantasy xv universe it included a feature film an original net animation a virtual reality simulation game multiple mobile projects including an abridged version of game and ports to microsoft windows and stadia game was originally directed by tetsuya nomura who also created story concept and main character designs nomura wanted to create a darker final fantasy title unsuitable for main series initial development went slowly and by 2007 scale of project generated discussions about rebranding game as next main entry in series production on versus xiii ended in 2012 when it was rebranded as final fantasy xv and transferred over to playstation 4 and xbox one playstation 3 version which was originally built using company s proprietary crystal tools game engine was abandoned due to concerns about platform s shortening life cycle its engine was changed to luminous studio square enix s custom built engine for eighth generation gaming hardware after its change of platforms production team headed by hajime tabata whose previous work included crisis core final fantasy vii and final fantasy type 0 was brought on board to aid production tabata became co director and was eventually promoted to sole director after nomura was transferred to work on other projects within company after transition to eighth generation hardware multiple changes were made so that it better suited new consoles and its new status as a mainline game these included radical staff reshuffles and reevaluation of game s content latter part resulted in some scenes and characters from versus xiii being cut later in production multiple other studios were brought in to help with various aspects of game since its original announcement release of information became sporadic leading to video game journalists labeling it as vaporware and eventually to rumors of its cancellation after its public rebranding in 2013 silence continued until its appearance at 2014 tokyo game show at which point development and progress information was released on a regular basis a demo for game final fantasy xv episode duscae was released in march 2015 with first print copies of final fantasy type 0 hd promotion for title was effectively restarted at 2015 gamescom its release was delayed due to polishing work and wish for a simultaneous worldwide release something no other mainline final fantasy title had managed to accomplish cosmetic gameplay and story based downloadable content were developed between 2016 and 2019 to fix issues raised by players and expand upon base game production staff 250px thumb logo of final fantasy xv designed by yoshitaka amano and incorporating game s themes logo

title named final fantasy versus xiii created by square enix as part of wider final fantasy franchise it was directed by tetsuya nomura and produced by shinji hashimoto and yoshinori kitase nomura created original scenario designed main character and was also original director and one of original game designers cgi cutscenes were directed by takeshi nozue who had previously worked on final fantasy vii advent children music was composed by yoko shimomura and script was written by regular final fantasy scenario writer kazushige nojima tomohiro hasewaga was art director mechanical designer was and event planning director was jun akiyama after game s name and platform change in 2012 there were multiple staff reshuffles though shimomura hashimoto hasewaga and nozue retained their original positions nomura became co director alongside hajime tabata director of final fantasy type 0 then was moved to other projects and replaced as full director by tabata saori became new scriptwriter using nojima s original scenario as a base for new work kitase left as co producer while yusuke naora isamu kamikokuryo and many artists involved in development of type 0 were involved non japanese staff included character designer roberto ferrari game designer and party interaction designer wan staff as formed in 2012 not counting later additions was made up of combined final fantasy xv and type 0 development teams by 2014 between 200 and 300 people were working on game from 2006 to 2013 final fantasy xv was developed by what was then square enix 1st production department in wake of extensive business restructuring in 2013 development was transferred to newly formed business division 2 headed by tabata and incorporating core final fantasy development team in 2018 final fantasy xv team were incorporated into luminous productions a new subsidiary led by tabata who continued to work on both an untitled aaa project and post release content for final fantasy xv along with bringing in staff members from other sections of company they also recruited help from other development studios hexadrive was brought in to help with engineering game entertainment helped with design for later sections of game shanghai company helped with design of buildings licensed middleware from umbra was used to boost game s graphics while streamline studios was brought in to help with technical development it was initially supposed after an announcement in 2015 that avalanche studios was brought on board to help create game s airship mechanics in event avalanche and square enix did not directly collaborate instead avalanche showed them their level of detail development methods and square enix s internal team created airship mechanics using that information image illustration and logo design was done by yoshitaka amano who was brought on at beginning of game s production and designed logo based on game s themes several pieces of amano s original artwork were retained and used in promotion when game changed from versus xiii to xv in contrast to other major parts of game logo artwork survived almost unchanged aside from its coloring amano also designed a new version of logo that faded in during game s ending collaborating with development team on its use according to tabata new logo signified beginning of a new journey and also representing game s development since it was known as versus xiii development final fantasy versus xiii was created as part of fabula nova crystallis final fantasy a subseries within final fantasy franchise featuring games linked by a common mythos which included final fantasy xiii and type 0 apart from mythos they are completely separate and each game s staff are able to interpret mythos for each game versus xiii was one of original titles created for subseries alongside final fantasy xiii forming core of series around which future titles would evolve nomura intended versus xiii to be a heavy departure from his lighthearted kingdom hearts series he attributed this move to his love for extremes and explained direction he took as closer to his personal taste and completely different from what producers had requested him to do in past early in development nomura said that concept and thinking behind game was unfitting for a regular numbered final fantasy installment thus explaining its original status as a spin off his role as director of versus xiii in addition to other projects was a move made following departure of series creator hironobu sakaguchi from company production began in 2006 by development team responsible for kingdom hearts series as a playstation 3 exclusive although nomura had created game concept some years prior versus xiii was defined by nomura as dark side of xiii which was emphasized by game s title in 2008 it was reported that development was put on hold so team could complete final fantasy xiii this information was later clarified as a mistranslation with actual situation being that developers from versus xiii team were helping with xiii in their spare time with development on both games going according to their original schedules by june 2010 nomura reported that game s story and character and clothing designs had been completed by june 2011 game was reportedly still only in pre production phase full production on versus xiii began in september of that year with a planned release in late 2014 according to later staff versus xiii was only 20 25 complete when change of name and platform took place with tabata saying that game never really took shape it was also stated by tabata that staff s efforts to fix issues with versus xiii went on for far too long according to staff when tabata arrived production team were exhausted and fretful following project s collapse due to growing scale of project talks about changing versus xiii into next numbered entry in series were appearing as early as 2007 when type 0 originally titled final fantasy agito xiii was renamed and playstation 4 and xbox one were presented to square enix in 2011 it was decided to shift game onto those consoles for a time a playstation 3 version continued development but after a title change announcement could not be made in 2012 shortening lifespan of console caused concern for company and team after some trial and error playstation 3 was abandoned as lead platform in favor of a directx 11 based development structure allowing easy porting to next generation systems another presumed reason for shift was due to game s protracted development and escalating budget game was rebranded as final fantasy xv and began development in this form in july 2012 a proposal to turn final fantasy xv into a musical after nomura watched 2012 film adaptation of les miserables was vetoed by higher ups at square enix at beginning of development new team reviewed content of versus xiii and decided what could be sensibly carried over to new project while many design elements were retained some needed to be changed or removed tabata s new position as co director and eventually as director was related to this change separate engine gameplay graphics and design sections of team were merged into one unit to help with development nomura remained as co director alongside tabata so project could remain as true to original vision as possible after which he was reassigned to other projects within company including kingdom hearts iii while tabata took up full directorial duties to bring project to completion due to state of project during 2012 square enix s then ceo yoichi wada was considering cancelling outright so team could start from scratch under tabata s direction most of tabata s team were reluctant to merge with nomura s team due to negative reputation of versus xiii within company with tabata taking six months to bring them all round to idea tabata officially became director in december 2013 development initially followed pattern of previous high budget games but team eventually realized that such techniques had become dated during later part of development tabata s main concern was keeping game on schedule instead of letting development become delayed by experimentation with technology despite protracted development budget was kept under strict control a major issue was deciding what elements to carry over and what had to be changed or discarded as project was already known and fans had expectations when describing his attitude to development tabata described team set up as horizontal using a non hierarchical staff structure to help speed up exchange of information and feedback between departments this drastic shift was unheard of for major japanese game developers and was met with a mixed reaction from staff some were elated at their new freedom while others felt downgraded including initial work on versus xiii game s development spanned approximately ten years from conception to release despite its origins tabata considers versus xiii and xv to be two separate entities speaking later tabata said that developers were playing it by ear as little of final game s content was set prior to his taking over post release support right thumb upright 0 8 hajime tabata served as director of final fantasy xv from 2014 to its release assuming role of producer for its post release content prior to his departure from square enix in 2018 both free and paid downloadable content dlc was planned as early as april 2016 with paid dlc being a necessity due to production costs plans for dlc content were finalized by june of that year with a small team working on it while main game was completed main aim was to make players feel they had made a good purchase full production began after main game was completed in november 2016 dlc development was handled by sawatari who took over as producer when tabata saw game would not make its projected september 30 release date tabata continued to focus on polishing main game while sawatari created dlc with a group of core developers although tabata continued to oversee their production while having story based dlc focused on each character seemed to undermine main appeal of story sawatari noted that breaks gave characters a chance to grow as individuals before returning to and strengthening group square enix stressed when details were announced that dlc was not content cut from game itself but original content to add new experiences for players reception of first wave of story based dlc was so strong that team decided to create a second wave of content new content would focus on creating a new storyline while tying up any remaining loose ends that players found with storyline and lore during this period production shifted from business division 2 to luminous productions who worked simultaneously on post release content and their new ip tabata continued overseeing development as producer however tabata was growing steadily less interested in project and wanted to go ahead on his own path without inconveniencing anyone at square enix after internal discussions tabata decided to leave square enix and form his own studio company parted with tabata on good terms but decision was made to cancel all but one of subsequent dlc episodes and end post release support for game following that episode s 2019 release it was also decided by luminous productions to focus on development of their new ip contributing to dlc s cancellation design story and characters while xvs story was similar to other entries nomura wanted to create more realistic characters he wanted to make xv about men in real world including less fantasy elements describing it as darkest entry in series from 2010 onwards story was undergoing frequent revisions when versus xiii became xv multiple aspects were changed including removal of story sequences and redesigning of characters most notable change was replacement of original heroine stella nox fleuret with similarly named lunafreya when consulted over proposed changes nojima said that he would be content as long as overall concept remained faithful to original giving team needed confidence to make changes game s ending was left deliberately ambiguous so players could imagine what came next concept of reaper worship from original scenario was toned down as it would have been a violation of age rating criteria in some countries explicit references to those elements were replaced with general impression of black being a special color for main cast and their home country game s main theme is bonds as represented by relationships between noctis and his comrades and between noctis and his father regis a key narrative element was noctis personal journey from prince to king story took place over a ten year time period to properly portray noctis journey with characters aging appropriately as opposed to earlier final fantasy games which jumped between different character groups game focused almost entirely on central cast with developments concerning supporting cast happening off screen this was chosen to make main cast more compelling and create a narrative based on their point of view in contrast to many previous final fantasy titles playable cast of xv is all male although women still played key roles in story this was influenced by nomura s wish for a road movie vibe and experiences from his youth clothing for characters was designed by hiromu takahara lead designer for japanese fashion house he was brought on when nomura was occupied with other duties including designing main cast of final fantasy xiii main reason for his inclusion was wish to preserve game s realism by creating designs influenced by western fashions takahara s designs were retained during transition as they were a core part of initial project world design when first announced xv used mythos of fabula nova crystallis described by kitase as a backdrop and starting point for story for versus xiii nomura decided to focus more on world and on realistic human characters terminology of mythos including concept of l cie magically imbued warriors burdened with a pre determined task was originally present in versus xiii a key figure in mythos goddess etro was originally represented in game in a piece of artwork by amano and was a key deity worshiped in game world during transition process between versus xiii and xv game disconnected from mythos core framework existing as a thematic base for world and story without being overtly expressed while adjustments were being decided upon it was chosen to keep mythos as part of xv as much of world was built upon it and would lose a lot of its substance if removed entirely instead team chose to adjust mythos to fit game s modern setting specific terminology such as l cie was removed so game would retain an individual identity and introduce concepts in an understandable way a common theme carried over into xv was defined by tabata as humans chosen by crystal placing their lives at risk revised cosmology drew inspiration from japanese folklore and various western mythologies game s summoned monsters referred to as were designed to play integral parts in story and world as opposed to being simple monsters to be called into battle they were intelligent beings that noctis needed to forge a pact with rather than simply commanding them due to their key role in story staff chose traditional final fantasy summons such as leviathan and titan instead of creating ones unique to game left thumb upright 0 8 shinjuku tokyo was primary inspiration for insomnia capital of lucis central theme of world and story is fantasy based on reality setting is based on real world and fantasy elements grew out of familiar settings realizing this aspect of game was quite difficult before game s move onto eighth generation hardware nomura had wanted to use a present day setting for a final fantasy game ever since this idea had been considered but abandoned during development of final fantasy vii as such some of designs in final fantasy xv are based on real world locations among them are districts of tokyo piazza san marco and st mark s basilica in venice bahamas and natural locations such as a cavern in chiba prefecture insomnia crown city of lucis is specifically influenced by shinjuku tokyo area which houses headquarters of square enix and which nomura passes through every day highway and tunnel seen in game are almost exact replicas of expressway and a tunnel in ginza district respectively team created these by driving down real world locations repeatedly during their research design inspirations for niflheim ranged from roman empire to pre germanic and germanic civilizations game s theme of fantasy based on reality was emphasized on multiple levels in environments such as blending of realism and fantasy in insomnia and camping equipment which was included through a collaboration with coleman company another factor in original development of set pieces was design of vast and seamless environments they were meant to enable scenarios such as player character being shot at from a great distance or a battle which would change scenes between outside and inside of a building this corroborated nomura s intended action oriented system with more intuitive game controls he instructed his team to study third person shooters for reference not in simplistic terms like controls or mechanics but in way they create tension and mood and incorporate action within that this carried over into xv with stated aim being to distance game structurally from xiii and its sequels which featured divided zones rather than a large seamless world original inspiration behind this approach was world design of legend of zelda ocarina of time with later inspirations being modern western triple a open world titles environments are divided into three different segments with separate teams working on each world map locations in game world and dungeons dungeons were designed to be beautiful frightening and memorable specific pieces of concept art were created to represent different regions and aesthetic concepts a single building design was used to capture essence of s venice inspired atmosphere while older car designs when compared to party s vehicle regalia reflected lack of human advancement outside lucis for monster designs tabata told hasegawa that their goal was a sense of realism equivalent to photography of national geographic first monster designed with this mindset was behemoth for mystical enemies team went towards throwback designs using popular enemy designs from series history monster designs were drawn from various sources a difficult monster to design was one of larger monsters particular attention to detail was given to head and legs as they were most visible areas to players which was raised as an example of balance between fantasy and realism was designed with a horse like body along with a horn inspired by appendages on seahorses goblins and naga were not given an original design instead being taken directly from their original artwork by amano for earlier final fantasy games and inserted into game in as realistic a form as possible ronin was designed to resemble traditional dress style of its namesake with both clothing and fabric created using descriptions from books and images of antique samurai clothing and swords game s mounts recurring birds called chocobos were designed so players would feel affection for them most challenging part of design was adding fantastic flourishes while keeping it from being garish another recurring final fantasy creature moogle was originally present in versus xiii and was going to be similar in design to its final fantasy type 0 incarnation moogles were initially dropped from xv they were retained after a twitter poll in november 2015 where fans requested that moogles be included due to game being close to completion it was a token inclusion that would not impact main development music game s original score was primarily composed and arranged by yoko shimomura who was most widely known for her work on kingdom hearts series and was a first time composer for final fantasy series working on greater majority of soundtrack shimomura was involved throughout game s development cycle theme song of versus xiii somnus was sung by l hopkins its lyrics were written by nomura which were translated and adapted into latin by taro yamashita and kazuhiro when versus xiii was rebranded as xv somnus was retained as an important theme though it was replaced as official theme song game s theme song is a cover of ben e king s stand by me performed by english indie rock band florence and machine and sung by band s leader florence welch in addition to stand by me florence and machine created two original songs inspired by world and story of xv too much is never enough and i will be for game s additional media music was handled by other composers such as john r graham yasuhisa inoue and akizuki music for later content was handled by yoshitaka suzuki guest composers were brought in for major story expansions including keiichi okabe naoshi mizuta yasunori mitsuda and nobuo uematsu soundtrack for final fantasy xv was released on december 21 2016 with multiple editions being created three songs by florence and machine were released under banner title songs from final fantasy xv as digital singles on august 12 for itunes google play and spotify tracks from game were released on other albums of shimomura s music and somnus was featured as downloadable content for theatrhythm final fantasy graphics during its initial development versus xiii used crystal tools a proprietary game engine created by square enix for seventh generation gaming hardware that would be used throughout company for multiple games including xiii and final fantasy xiv later tabata described crystal tools hardware as an extension of technology of previous gaming generation during 2010 nomura revealed that team were using real world based physical calculations to determine weather and cloud behavior in game by 2011 nomura announced that game was no longer using crystal tools and instead used a specially designed proprietary gameplay engine combined by lighting technology from luminous studio an engine built for eighth generation gaming hardware focus on realism influenced decision to incorporate more advanced lighting technology while specially designed engine had a limited area of use planned scale of open world increased so much that older technology eventually became obsolete as it was restricting developers need to create new technology to cope with these problems further added to initial development difficulties original plan was to have interactive real time event scenes nomura felt that regular storytelling cutscenes in other games interrupted gameplay and caused players to skip them furthermore development frame could theoretically be shortened as there was no need to create cutscenes exclusive high polygon character models however seamless transitions of these events into gameplay were hard to achieve and instead increased time that had to be invested by team after full shift onto eighth generation platforms multiple planned elements were influenced by new luminous technology in game cutscene camera was optimized to work similarly to one used in pre rendered movies and more environmental and gameplay elements could be included such as an increased number of destructible environments and player character s warping to faraway spots on game maps it also enabled nomura to start experimenting with higher facial detail for enemies such as behemoths when game was renamed and changed platforms team chose luminous studio as main game engine game s real time graphics used 5 000 polygons per frame bringing its visual quality close to modern cgi cutscenes and to a level that would have been impossible for previous generation s hardware game s native resolution was 1920 x 1080 pixels 1080p with a frame rate of 30 frames per second this was defined as being native to game as opposed to upscaled games from previous generation for polygon models combined number of visible and occluded polygons was estimated as being 5 000 000 this number was approximately five times amount of equivalent detail from last generation games models used over 600 character bones 150 bones were created for face 300 for hair and 150 for body a bone based physical simulation technology was applied so that clothing would react to body s movements polygon count for character hair was estimated as 20 000 same number used in an entire character in last generation games all of these were achievable due to fact that eighth generation console hardware had approximately sixteen times amount of storage available in previous generation during transition from versus xiii to xv and optimization of luminous studio for game development team created a conceptual environment using a prototype engine environment called ebony after initial reveal team ran into difficulties with new hardware prompting them to contact hexadrive due to their experience with high spec gaming hardware to solve issues faced by xv team used a similar development approach to ubisoft they created an approximate game system that they could build on and edit in real time graphics and animation were developed first followed by a cinematics editor and a system to manage events during transitions between cutscenes and gameplay this latter element was what allowed developers to create what would become game s final version to help maximize realism of characters their hair was first created by a hairstylist using a mannequin s wig then rendered into game using technology of luminous studio same technique was used for agni s philosophy engine s 2012 demo character movements were created using motion capture technology animators movements were first captured while they wore special suits then their actions were adjusted in team s computer to perfect them and make minor additions like finger movements these actions were then implemented in game environment for intended characters during production tabata and new development staff used experience from a failed attempt to develop an eighth generation console sequel to type 0 when handling new hardware while using luminous studio for games other than xv was considered during production engine s technology manager julien advised against it until it has been proven and released in a finished form while cgi cutscenes created by dedicated square enix subsidiary visual works were present throughout its lifetime there were far fewer than originally planned in final game team instead relied on real time cutscenes as much as possible except for scenes with a scale too great to use real time graphics transition to next generation hardware enabled team to better realize their original vision for game as conveyed in original reveal trailer visual works also worked closely with team during development of 3d modelling systems due to their previous experiences with such technology in cutscene development gameplay versus xiii used an action based combat system based primarily on kingdom hearts battle system gameplay elements from third person shooters were also to have been incorporated character movement was designed to be fast paced during earlier gameplay trailers pace of gameplay was deliberately slowed down so viewers could have a better view of events in addition to noctis his companions were also controllable each harnessing unique weapons and all being able to enter and control mechs and airships noctis was only character with access to all weapon types within game including swords axes guns lances and others with current selection of weapons leading to different combos group attacks could not be manually triggered but party members would team up automatically for a super attack in addition attacks could be chained together by players switching between characters during battle magic was available to all characters but only when noctis was a part of party a consideration that was closely tied to story a job system was in place but it was exclusive to enemy units with those present including dragoons and summoners environments outside cities also featured a day night cycle and roaming enemies with different enemy monsters appearing at different times of day several initial concepts for game had to be abandoned a planned first person view and lack of a heads up display hud were scrapped because these ideas were deemed incompatible with style of final fantasy series an overhead camera view was also considered for open field areas but it was decided against so player would remain immersed when final versus xiii trailer was released hud was a mixture of finalized and temporary elements there were even plans for game to have a unique support setup for sixaxis controller although after game s transition there were technological and mechanical changes basic elements established in trailers such as noctis warping and weapon abilities were carried over for xv battle system was dubbed active cross battle system noctis was made only player controlled character with others being relegated to command functions governed by game s artificial intelligence ai team experimented with a multi character battle system but eventually decided that it presented too many development difficulties noctis weapons were to be arranged in a deck and contextually activated in combat later this was changed so that weapon switching could be done freely during battle with special attacks using standard weapons unless others were in place instead of a multi button combo system combat became focused on single button combat tied to timed attacks and contextually activated special abilities in addition to co op attacks triggered with other members of party one ability that was carried over from versus xiii to xv was noctis s limit break armiger where he summoned multiple weapons into battle to attack and defend this was initially seen in original trailer for xv and later in both demo and final game noctis was to have been only character in world of xv to wield magic but as this would not have worked from a gameplay perspective team created a story related pretext that allowed other characters to wield magic after demo s release cross link system was improved and other systems were put into place polishing work on game continued up until final version was released navigation was described after its 2014 re reveal as open world tabata later clarified that while character progression was driven by story various areas within world could be freely explored by players he also wished for a fusion of gameplay and story similar to last of us based on feedback from game s first commercial demo adjustable difficulty settings were added in form of players changing battle modes to alter speed and complexity of battles a major element added to game was prompto s ability to take photographs as character had garnered negative feedback from players tabata wanted to make character more useful and appealing to players and so it was incorporated into game so players could chronicle their journey inclusion of an airship function into party s vehicle came from tabata s wish to keep party in regalia while simulating experience of landing an aircraft team experimented with enabling compatibility with virtual reality headsets but this proved impractical as players would likely be wearing them for hours at a time due to game s size game s shift during second half of story from an open world to a linear structure was based on story requirements and budgetary restrictions as making entire experience open world would have doubled development time and costs many elements added to game in later updates such as controlling all main characters had to be discarded from main game due to technological and budget based restrictions artificial intelligence lead designer for game s ai was yoichiro miyake who was one of core team members for game s engine miyake whose reputation designing quality ai had landed him position had an initial concept of creating an ai that would learn and memorize new actions creating a smooth flow through various steps it needed to take to make a smoother and more advanced experience at start of its development developers used two standard classic designs for ais for reference behavior based which revolved around adaptation and decision making and state based which made decisions based on environment for xv it was decided to create an advanced hybrid of these basic behavioral ai functions due to way luminous studio s staff was structured team first needed to develop an easy to understand tool for managing and developing ai this tool was dubbed luminous ai graph which represented multi layered construction of an ai amount of effort put into ai was directly inspired by experiences of developing games for previous console generation emphasis had been put on graphics causing ai and other gameplay related elements to suffer between release of its commercial demo and full release ai underwent further refinement ai functions were divided into three different categories meta which governed environment and in game progression character which was devoted to guest and non playable characters npcs and navigation which determined best route and pattern for characters and other moving elements such as enemies to travel tasks assigned to meta ai were so numerous and large that it needed to be divided into separate interconnected elements which included implementing a hierarchical structure for task management transitioning and merger of functions to create an intelligent system and exchange of various elements with specific localities for character ai a major point was coordination between ai and character animations when responding to different situations different levels and styles of ai were created for different groups of non playable characters within xvs world from main party members to npcs around world to ensure navigation ai worked properly for enemies and monsters a system dubbed point query system pqs was created which could direct and steer them in a realistic manner while avoiding collisions with objects in environment or other moving elements a pqs was created for each enemy type and made small changes to their behaviors easier to implement decision to create high quality reactive ai for noctis companions helped influence choice of making noctis only playable character business announcement left thumb a screenshot from original trailer for final fantasy versus xiii showing noctis displaying his powers initial trailers would continue to influence development goals for game despite story and gameplay changes versus xiii was originally announced at 2006 electronic entertainment expo e3 through a cgi trailer trailer which showed noctis advancing on a group of enemy soldiers was created by visual works as a representation of what development team were aiming for trailer also featured a quote from william shakespeare s hamlet is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so this quote was intended to evoke atmosphere nomura was aiming for after its initial announcement title was absent from multiple gaming events for several successive years although a video showing an extended version of reveal trailer was released in 2007 at a fan event two trailers were released in 2008 including in game footage at 2008 tokyo game show tgs footage of navigation was shown at tgs following year in a closed theater its appearance at e3 2010 was apparently prevented due to multiple technical issues its final appearance as versus xiii was at a square enix press conference in january 2011 appearing alongside other video games then in production because of its sporadic appearances in public eye and its absence after 2011 event industry commentators labeled final fantasy xv as vaporware while it was still known as versus xiii in june 2012 it was rumored that game had been cancelled which was swiftly refuted by wada after that further rumors emerged claiming that it had either been quietly cancelled or renamed and shifted to another platform during development its name and platform change were officially announced at e3 2013 with further trailers showcasing game concept released later 2013 trailer was again a concept piece consisting mostly of cgi rather than actual gameplay footage staff later stated that xv had been announced and displayed too early game s next official appearance was made at tgs 2014 with announcement of its commercial demo and a tech demo showing off game s engine after its reappearance regular livestreamed shows called active time reports atr were broadcast giving updates to game and responses to fan questions according to tabata were created to help fans left confused by game s change of platform and title along with establishing a two way communication with fanbase during 2015 official forums were created to allow developers to receive direct feedback from fans starting from february 12 japanese forums were discontinued and replaced with a developer s blog their stated reason was to offer a more accessible medium for both feedback and developer updates after its appearance at 2014 paris games week tabata announced that xvs release window was roughly decided with company recruiting new staff to work on game s master build while it did not show at e3 2015 it did appear at that year s gamescom which tabata said was beginning of its official marketing campaign leading up to further announcements as part of marketing game was distanced from fabula nova crystallis subseries as it would have placed symbolic limits upon their target audience game s minimal showing at event caused a negative reaction from fans with tabata stating that square enix underestimated importance of event between may and november 2015 publicity was deliberately kept low key so staff could focus on completing pre beta version of game once done xv became playable in its entirety enabling developers to get a full view of product for final stages of development and testing production on beta version and progression to debugging phase began in 2016 master version version of game that would be played at release was completed in august although further technical polishing took place after this demos during its tgs 2014 presentation real time demonstration footage was dubbed final fantasy xv overture which demonstrated graphic capabilities in luminous studio and effect of environmental changes on gameplay while it was intended as a one off presentation team said they were considering creating a second demo for release in japan based on overture a demo featuring battle against astral titan was featured at e3 2016 while drawing on a part of game fight was tailored for demo so it could be completed within a ten minute window with full version having different victory requirements a

was announced on first day of event according to tabata this release date was decided upon in 2013 based on projected development time and costs in august rumors began circulating that final fantasy xv had been delayed by two months tabata later confirmed that game s worldwide release had been delayed to november 29 alongside announcement was an official apology to fans for delay reason he gave was that while game had reached fully playable form team was not satisfied with overall quality they were aiming for so extra time would be dedicated to polishing xv further in addition he wanted to give players without an online connection full experience without needing a day one patch tabata confirmed in a later interview that he was one who requested extension after master disc had been created for mass distribution patches following initial release allowed support for playstation 4 pro and xbox one x models featuring enhanced graphics resolution and framerate localization english localization of xv was led by dan inoue one of aspects of localization was using different accents to show characters coming from different regions of world a cited example was ignis who spoke with a british accent while other main characters spoke with an american accent for game s lore team made a conscious effort to move away from esoteric terminology final fantasy had gained a reputation for they used understandable names like astral and daemon to stop lore becoming uninteresting divine beings speech was made very impersonal such as gentiana not using i or you during her dialogue and using interpretive dialogue for simple concepts different issues raised later included ignis localized lines which changed aspects of character interaction and alteration of cindy s name from original in an interview with famitsu during gamescom tabata revealed that main reason for delays in xvs release were related to game s localization and debugging as team wanted to bring game out in west close to its japanese release decision for a release meant localization had to happen alongside game production with no extra time for tweaks and corrections in addition to being released with french and german dubs and text translation for those respective regions it was also localized for latin america with latin american spanish and brazilian portuguese text this was first time a final fantasy title was localized into these languages one of early issues which drew public attention with release of episode duscae was noctis english voice actor in episode duscae his voice was pitched rather low making character seem older and less energetic than his japanese counterpart this was explained as being due to tight scheduling removing opportunity for tabata to catch issue and re record before it was time for release after episode duscae voice work was redone to better convey noctis personality localization methods also ended up backfiring due to dialogue matching mechanism for characters causing line repetition or omission they also needed to deal with clash between normal dialogue and fantastic elements which threatened to undermine narrative this forced different pieces of media to take different approach and some scripted character interactions to join up different sides of narrative versions and editions in addition to standard release day one deluxe and ultimate collector s
