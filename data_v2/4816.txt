set by his grandfather qalawun and abrogate growing independence of emirs that developed under his father levanoni 1995 pp 79 80 however post qalawun mamluk norms of conduct proved too resilient for abu bakr in view of emirs and low and middle ranking mamluks abu bakr was to solely play role of a figurehead and not disturb system created by his father thus abu bakr s attempts to rule in his own right were consistently stymied by emirs of latter most prominent was qawsun who sought to become mudabbir ad dawla organizer of state in effect strongman of sultanate after neutralizing bashtak his principal rival qawsun moved against abu bakr qawsun had feared that abu bakr would attempt to imprison him on 5 august 1341 qawsun had abu bakr arrested on concocted charges of frivolity abu bakr and
