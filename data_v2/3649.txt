and provide a background for spinning wheel subsequently to avoid sectarian associations with colour scheme saffron white and green were chosen for three bands representing courage and sacrifice peace and truth and faith and chivalry respectively a few days before india became independent on 15 august 1947 specially constituted constituent assembly decided that flag of india must be acceptable to all parties and communities a modified version of swaraj flag was chosen tricolour remained same saffron white and green however charkha was replaced by ashoka chakra representing eternal wheel of law philosopher sarvepalli radhakrishnan who later became india s first vice president and second president clarified adopted flag and described its significance as follows history a number of flags with varying designs were used in period preceding indian independence movement by rulers of different princely states idea of a single indian flag was first raised by british rulers of india after rebellion of 1857 which resulted in establishment of direct imperial rule first flag whose design was based on western heraldic standards were similar to flags of other british colonies including canada and south africa its red field included union flag in upper left quadrant and a star of india capped by royal crown in middle of right half to address question of how star conveyed indianness queen victoria created knight commander of order of star of india to honour services to empire by her indian subjects subsequently all indian princely states received flags with symbols based on heraldic criteria of europe including right to fly defaced british red ensigns left thumb alt a british red ensign a red flag with union jack placed at top left corner charged with star of india five pointed star inside a circular band tied at bottom civil ensign of british india 1880 1947 in early twentieth century around coronation of edward vii a discussion started on need for a heraldic symbol that was representative of indian empire william coldstream a british member of indian civil service campaigned government to change heraldic symbol from a star which he considered to be a common choice to something more appropriate his proposal was not well received by government lord curzon rejected it for practical reasons including multiplication of flags around this time nationalist opinion within realm was leading to a representation through religious tradition symbols that were in vogue included ganesha advocated by bal gangadhar tilak and kali advocated by aurobindo ghosh and chandra chattopadhyay another symbol was cow or gau mata cow mother however all these symbols were hindu centric and did not suggest unity with india s muslim population thumb 220px based on calcutta flag design of flag of indian independence raised by bhikaji cama on 22 august 1907 at international socialist conference in stuttgart germany partition of bengal 1905 resulted in introduction of a

religious symbols represented in western heraldic fashion tricolour flag included eight white lotuses on upper green band representing eight provinces a sun and a crescent on bottom red band and vande mataram slogan in hindi on central yellow band flag was launched in calcutta bereft of any ceremony and launch was only briefly covered by newspapers flag was not covered in contemporary governmental or political reports either but was used at annual session of indian national congress a slightly modified version was subsequently used by madam bhikaji cama at second international socialist congress in stuttgart in 1907 despite multiple uses of flag it failed to generate enthusiasm amongst indian nationalists around same time another proposal for flag was initiated by sister nivedita a hindu reformist and disciple of swami vivekananda flag consisted of a thunderbolt in centre and a hundred and eight oil lamps for border with vande mataram caption split around thunderbolt it was also presented at indian national congress meeting in 1906 soon many other proposals were initiated but none of them gained attention from nationalist movement in 1909 lord ampthill former governor of madras presidency wrote to times of london in run up to empire day pointing out that there existed no flag representative of india as a whole or any indian province surely this is strange seeing that but for india there would be no empire in 1916 pingali venkayya submitted thirty new designs in form of a booklet funded by members of high court of madras these many proposals and recommendations did little more than keep flag movement alive same year annie besant and bal gangadhar tilak adopted a new flag as part of home rule movement flag included union jack in upper left corner a star and crescent in upper right and seven stars displayed diagonally from lower right on a background of five red and four green alternating bands flag resulted in first governmental initiative against any nationalistic flag as a magistrate in coimbatore banned its use ban was followed by a public debate on function and importance of a national flag in early 1920s national flag discussions gained prominence across most british dominions following peace treaty between britain and ireland in november 1920 indian delegation to league of nations wanted to use an indian flag and this prompted british indian government to place renewed emphasis on flag as a national symbol right thumb alt a tricolour flag of white green and red with a spinning wheel in centre gandhi s flag introduced at congress meeting in 1921 in april 1921 mohandas karamchand gandhi wrote in his journal young india about need for an indian flag proposing a flag with charkha or spinning wheel at centre idea of spinning wheel was put forth by lala hansraj and gandhi commissioned pingali venkayya to design a flag with spinning wheel on a red and green banner red colour signifying hindus and green standing for muslims gandhi wanted flag to be presented at congress session of 1921 but it was not delivered on time and another flag was proposed at session gandhi later wrote that delay was fortuitous since it allowed him to realise that other religions were not represented he then added white to banner colours to represent all other religions finally owing to religious political sensibilities in 1929 gandhi moved towards a more secular interpretation of flag colours stating that red stood for sacrifices of people white for purity and green for hope on 13 april 1923 during a procession by local congress volunteers in nagpur commemorating jallianwala bagh massacre swaraj flag with spinning wheel designed by pingali venkayya was hoisted this event resulted in a confrontation between congressmen and police after which five people were imprisoned over a hundred other protesters continued flag procession after a meeting subsequently on first of may jamnalal bajaj secretary of nagpur congress committee started flag satyagraha gaining national attention and marking a significant point in flag movement satyagraha promoted nationally by congress started creating cracks within organisation in which gandhians were highly enthused while other group called it inconsequential finally at all india congress committee meeting in july 1923 at insistence of jawaharlal nehru and sarojini naidu congress closed ranks and flag movement was endorsed flag movement was managed by sardar vallabhbhai patel with idea of public processions and flag displays by common people by end of movement over 1500 people had been arrested across all of british india bombay chronicle reported that movement drew from diverse groups of society including farmers students merchants labourers and national servants while muslim participation was moderate movement enthused women who had hitherto rarely participated in independence movement while flag agitation got its impetus from gandhi s writings and discourses movement received political acceptance following nagpur incident news reports editorials and letters to editors published in various journals and newspapers of time attest to subsequent development of a bond between flag and nation soon concept of preserving honour of national flag became an integral component of independence struggle while muslims were still wary of swaraj flag it gained acceptance among muslim leaders of congress and khilafat movement as national flag left thumb alt a tricolour flag of saffron white and green with a spinning wheel in centre swaraj flag officially adopted by indian national congress in text book cbse class 10 social science detractors of flag movement including motilal nehru soon hailed swaraj flag as a symbol of national unity thus flag became a significant structural component of institution of india in contrast to subdued responses of past british indian government took greater cognisance of new flag and began to define a policy of response british parliament discussed public use of flag and based on directives from england british indian government threatened to withdraw funds from municipalities and local governments that did not prevent display of swaraj flag swaraj flag became official flag of congress at 1931 meeting however by then flag had already become symbol of independence movement a few days before india gained its independence in august 1947 constituent assembly was formed to select a flag for independent india on 23 june 1947 assembly set up an ad hoc committee headed by rajendra prasad

congress flag was replaced by chakra wheel from lion capital of ashoka according to sarvepalli radhakrishnan chakra was chosen as it was representative of dharma and law however jawaharlal nehru explained that change was more practical in nature as unlike flag with spinning wheel this design would appear symmetrical gandhi was not very pleased by change but eventually came around to accepting it flag was proposed by nehru at constituent assembly on 22 july 1947 as a horizontal tricolour of deep saffron white and dark green in equal proportions with ashoka wheel in blue in centre of white band nehru also presented two flags one in khadi silk and other in khadi cotton to assembly resolution was approved unanimously it served as national flag of dominion of india between 15 august 1947
