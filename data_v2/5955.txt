neither received a penalty as stewards rated their crash as a racing incident with no driver in particular to blame it emerged that rosberg had chosen wrong engine mode for start being down on power which led to hamilton going for a passing manoeuvre however rosberg remained convinced that he had done nothing wrong saying i made it very clear i wasn t going to leave any space on inside and i was very surprised he went for gap while hamilton apologised to team after incident he refused to accept blame for it opinions about incident varied while mercedes s executive chairman niki lauda blamed hamilton for crash former f1 driver anthony davidson said on sky sports f1 that rosberg s move was very aggressive three time world champion jackie stewart said after race that mercedes should fine hamilton for crash hamilton is to blame rosberg was allowed to protect himself you don t go for it on first lap mercedes s head of motorsport toto wolff stressed after race that team would continue to let their drivers race against each other freely a decision praised by former world champion alain prost while rosberg said after race that he contemplated having a talk with hamilton about situation mercedes later decided that they did not need clear air talks however it later emerged that pair did have a conversation about incident before next race in monaco which according to hamilton was marked by pure respect it was mercedes s first double retirement since 2011 australian grand prix and first time they failed to score a point since 2012 united states grand prix ending a 62 race long streak third longest in formula one history for his last lap collision with teammate jolyon palmer kevin magnussen received a ten second time penalty dropping him one place to 15th he also received two penalty points to his licence carlos sainz received a reprimand from stewards for leaving pit lane one minute before it was allowed he escaped a more severe penalty because he stopped shortly
