order to appeal to a wider market of consumers game was one of first on playstation to utilize shifting levels of detail among rendered objects thanks to a panoramic engine developed by alex hastings

home worlds each of which acts as a dedicated hub containing portals that serve as gateways to different levels player must progress from one homeworld to next by talking to a balloonist who

an additional world that otherwise cannot be accessed spyro s moveset utilizes his unique abilities as a dragon spyro has two main offensive moves used to attack enemies as well as destroy certain objects charging in which spyro sprints forward and rams into things with his head and breathing fire these attacks must be used interchangeably for certain enemies and situations for instance some enemies carry fireproof metal armor meaning that they can only be defeated by charging while larger enemies can only be hit using fire breath as they will immediately crush spyro otherwise spyro can also use his wings to glide in midair letting him travel further distances in air and access areas otherwise unreachable via a regular jump throughout game spyro is accompanied by sparx a yellow dragonfly who protects spyro from taking damage and serves as player s system of health sparx s current health is represented by color of his body if spyro is hurt by an obstacle such as an enemy or by touching water sparx changes colors with yellow blue and green representing different subsequent amounts of withheld damage if player is damaged too many times sparx disappears leaving spyro vulnerable to lose a life if he is hurt again sparx can be rejuvenated by consuming butterflies which are found by killing passive creatures such as sheep that roam throughout most levels sparx also helps spyro collect items by retrieving any gems that spyro passes by plot in world of dragons dragon kingdom consists of five homeworlds artisans peace keepers magic crafters beast makers and dream weavers which have lived in harmony for many years one day a tv interview with a pair of dragons from artisan realm catches attention of gnasty gnorc a gnorc half gnome and half orc who was banished from kingdom due to his abrasive demeanor and sent to an abandoned junkyard which he renames to gnasty s world after hearing one of dragons in broadcast openly dismiss him as simple minded harmless and ugly gnasty loses his temper and unleashes a full fledged attack on kingdom using his magical powers he casts a spell across land that encases every dragon in a crystal shell he also steals

treasure and retrieves stolen dragon eggs a secret ending can then be unlocked by retrieving everything inside of treasure portal in this ending spyro is seen getting interviewed on tv when another spell is placed on dragons prompting spyro to set out on yet another adventure development spyro dragon was second game developed by insomniac games following release of their first game disruptor in december 1996 although disruptor was a commercial failure its positive critical reception was enough to impress universal interactive studios and encourage team to continue with their next endeavor idea of a game about a dragon was introduced by insomniac artist craig stitt who suggested concept out of his own interest in mythical creature initially game s tone was far darker and more realistic according to insomniac s coo john fiorito who joined company in 1997 during spyros development inspiration was taken in part from film dragonheart and game was initially realistic and kind of dark and gritty before it eventually took a more whimsical light hearted direction mark cerny an executive at universal interactive studios and game s producer advised that team create a game with more mass market appeal as demographics of playstation were decreasing and its selection of children s titles were greatly outnumbered by nintendo 64 s according to programmer peter hastings dragon character was originally going to be named pete but due to copyright concerns over name bearing similarities with disney film pete s dragon name was scrapped after considering name pyro which was ultimately considered too mature they finally settled on spyro in game dialogue was written by peter kleiner and spyro s character design was done by charles zembillas who had previously done design work on crash bandicoot spyro was originally going to be green but developers thought it was a bad idea because he would blend in with grass so they eventually changed him to purple during development of spyro insomniac had a very close relationship with crash bandicoot creator and fellow playstation developer naughty dog who had their office located directly across hall from theirs two developers would frequently work together playing early builds of each other s games and later going on to share game technology as a result a demo of crash bandicoot warped was hidden in spyro and vice versa spyro dragon was considerably unique at time compared to other 3d platform games spyro s ability to glide allows him to travel huge distances while in mid air meaning that player could nearly fly across an entire level if they glided off of a high enough area while this made designing levels more difficult for team it also meant that they could be made more open ended and explorative in nature in order to make spyros controls feel fluid matt whiting a nasa engineer who specialized in flight controls was brought on to help with programming camera movement as well spyro s movement controls particular difficulty was found with game s camera initially it was programmed to constantly follow spyro and remain positioned directly behind him but resulting high speed movements were found to make several playtesters feel nauseous meaning that level of movement had to be largely curbed so that playing game felt comfortable a particular example was with spyro s basic jump which would trigger camera to quickly tilt up and down to follow him compared by whiting to motion a rocking boat this was ultimately tweaked so that camera would stay steady as spyro went upwards and back down spyro dragon makes use of a 3d panoramic engine being simultaneously developed by alex hastings that could display far away objects by utilizing varying levels of detail a method of rendering which was new and unexplored at time developers believed that engine would be fitting for game as it could allow for more expansive levels that could take advantage of character s abilities such as gliding this dynamic system used to complement large and sprawling environments generates two different versions of a level one version is rendered in high detail while other one is a simpler textureless render objects close to player s vicinity are drawn using detailed render whereas distant ones are drawn from simple render this system allowed objects to be displayed from far distances while adhering to playstation s limited ram capabilities and was one of first video games to make use of such a system spyro was coded with efficiency in mind as 3d rendering technology was new at time and game had to fit limited specifications of playstation game was mostly programmed using assembly code around 80 of game s code was written using this as its programming language certain other parts were programmed in c due to its simplicity and speed game s music was composed and produced by stewart copeland formerly drummer for british band police copeland was given early builds of game s levels which he would play through in order to get a feel for them and then try to come up with a fitting composition he was also given game cheats such as invincibility so that he could have an easier time clearing levels copeland would write around three songs every day all of which he would further develop and polish next day according to copeland each song in game was written in order to correspond to a specific level but this correlation ultimately went unused copeland has looked back positively on his work on spyro calling game s music some of best compositional work that he has done across span of his career carlos alazraqui provided voice of spyro in game and additional voices were done by clancy brown michael gough jamie alcroft and michael connor alazraqui explained in an issue of electronic gaming monthly that he tried to make spyro s voice sound like a kid at camp that everybody likes release spyro dragon was first unveiled at 1998 e3 convention in atlanta georgia it was then later released in north america on september 10 1998 and in europe in october of same year according to sony computer entertainment s american marketing vice president andrew house at a press party in las vegas game along with other upcoming 4th quarter playstation releases such as crash bandicoot warped a bug s life and rugrats search for reptar was part of a general effort to appeal to a wider demographic of younger audiences and provide more games suited for younger players in order to compete with nintendo 64 which had a far larger library of children s titles at time compared to playstation s largely adult centric demographic an advertisement campaign was pushed to promote game featuring a character from game toasty sheep protesting against title character s actions against sheep campaign included tv commercials featuring an actor in an animatronic costume of toasty and a promotional website com on august 16 1999 scea announced that game would be included as a part of their greatest hits lineup of budgeted releases alongside other games such as crash bandicoot warped gran turismo cool boarders 3 and twisted metal iii and alongside announcement of a price drop for playstation console to compete with highly anticipated launch of sega dreamcast on december 12 2012 game was digitally re released to playstation store together with spyro 2 ripto s rage and spyro

aggregate of 18 reviews ign s craig harris hailed it as most fun 3d platformer he had played since crash bandicoot writing two claws up way up computer and video games called game easily best 3d platform game on playstation despite noting its largely child friendly nature as one of 4 reviewers for electronic gaming monthly shawn wrote that spyro is to playstation what banjo kazooie is to nintendo 64 and stated that it combines two most important aspects in any good game graphics and gameplay also writing for egm reviewer crispin proclaimed that spyro raises bar for 3d platformers and wrote that it had replaced gex 3d enter gecko as his favorite ps mascot game joe fielder of gamespot called game a proficient fully 3d platform game for playstation comparing it favorably to one of more recent platformers on system blasto and proclaiming that it excels over blasto in every way imaginable despite this he wrote that game only gets very very high marks instead of outrageously high marks citing its lack of high difficulty as main factor that made it inferior to games like super mario 64 and banjo kazooie edge named it best 3d platform game for playstation but criticized spyro s limited abilities and said that game was not as varied as super mario 64 critics lauded game s presentation specifically speaking praise for its graphics technical performance and copeland s music done for game gamepro reviewer slo mo wrote that game s graphics and animations gave spyro look and feel of an animated film while calling in game environments breathtaking harris wrote that game utilizes playstation s hardware to max and praised quality of in game animations he particularly praised rescued dragons talking animations which he said gave characters incredible personality fielder praised game s dynamic lighting system and character designs and noted a near complete lack of pop up during gameplay egm s sushi said that graphics were among finest on playstation fielder spoke positively of copeland s compositional work calling it wonderfully atmospheric slo mo described music as having a catchy mellow jazz rock swing to it while also praising voice work for its wide array of unique voices many critics held praise for spyro s level design and controls though some noted game s simplicity and low difficulty level fielder called level design exceptional while crispin praised levels for encouraging exploration among players sushi called play controls perfectly tuned whilst fielder wrote that they worked well both with and without dualshock s analog stick although shawn expressed that controls were unsuited for maneuvering in high risk areas camera system received varying reactions with crispin praising it as one of best in any 3d platformer and fielder declaring that it fixed common issues present in most other 3d platform games while harris criticized its lack of precision when following player stating that it tends to float around on a loose tether and highlighted camera system as one of game s only flaws fielder wrote that an overabundance of extra lives caused game to feel like it was aimed at a younger or broader audience holding final boss and bonus level as only exceptions despite praising spyro sushi noted game s lack of diversity in obstacles and objects leading to repetitive play crispin lamented that common trope of collecting items while still very fun in spyro was starting to become less interesting while also criticizing game s boss fights calling them small easy and decidedly like legacy popularity of spyro dragon helped to push character of spyro as a popular platforming mascot for playstation alongside crash bandicoot it was first game in what would go on to become an expansive video game series spawning two more platforming sequels for playstation spyro 2 ripto s rage and spyro year of dragon released in 1999 and 2000 respectively as of year 2000 series had sold more than 3 2 million copies in u s and over 4 million copies worldwide insomniac stopped developing spyro series after year of dragon as it finished off their 4 game contract with universal interactive despite this series was continued across various different developers and shifted to several other platforms besides playstation spyro being their first considerable success insomniac went on to develop several other successful video game franchises including ratchet clank series of platform games and more adult oriented third person shooter series resistance game s rendering system new and unheard of at time has gone on to be used in several other 3d video games references external links category 1998 video games category 3d platform games category insomniac games category playstation console games category playstation
