roksan xerxes transcription turntable often shortened to xerxes is a record player named after persian king xerxes i and produced by london based roksan audio designed by roksan co founder touraj moghaddam xerxes is a belt driven turntable with a solid plinth launched in 1985 sound quality of product positioned it as a strong competitor against established industry leader linn sondek lp12 many reviewers use xerxes as a reference turntable production version of xerxes is called xerxes 20plus a reference to 20th anniversary of launch in 2005 history before touraj moghaddam founded roksan he had become dissatisfied with state of audio arts when he heard his little television set reproduce thelonious monk in a more musically satisfying way than his high end linn naim tri amped audio system through experimentation he deduced that existing turntable design failed because cartridge was not being held still wherever groove went he believed that mean line traced by groove relative to body of cartridge needed to be constant his ideas led him away from using sprung sub chassis as part of speed controlling system needing a top plinth roughly an inch 25 mm thick made from wood with a density of about 700 to 800 kg m3 moghaddam found suitable material in a fire door with which he built a prototype his friend tufan hashemi then an investment analyst heard new prototype turntable and wanted one they agreed to team up to start production roksan audio was formed harris steve 4 march 2008 steady as a roksan hi fi news record review june 2008 issue xerxes introduced in 1985 secured advocacy of roger macer a successful independent hi fi retailer in london who sold then market leader linn sondek hashemi credits macer with urging him to start satisfying demand of dozens or more a week from his customers product named after persian king xerxes i was launched at a hi fi show in 1985 where roksan darius loudspeaker concept was also unveiled design principles tufan hashemi said roksan sought to create equipment that would excel in high quality musical reproduction and capable of involving listener on an emotional level product characteristics were to include precision and transparency of sound moghaddam acting as chief designer set out to find solutions to engineering problems he saw as inherent in belt driven suspended sub chassis turntable design of edgar where sub chassis and tonearm are free to rotate moghaddam believed that design generated undesirable torsional modes one such torsional mode is said to be caused by groove drag dynamic forces exerted by stylus on record as it tracked it moghaddam chose to attenuate torsion by mounting turntable drive motor casing on its own bearing motor mounted separately and tethered to a spring is allowed limited rotation about its own axis because load varied with groove modulations increases in drag would thus be dampened by spring loaded motor and platter acceleration mitigated in words of tufan hashemi roksan audio s managing director we argued that using a suspended or floating surface to support a record could not allow it to be accurately read as record itself would be floating we said that record surface should remain stationary and solid but in complete isolation from rest of deck and our design provided a very stable base for isolating a record without suspending it like lp12 xerxes has a two piece platter sub platter configuration on which sits a thin felt mat and while lp12 s platters are made of xerxes platters are of aluminium outer platter is rigid and peripherally weighted however roksan s outer platter weighs less than half of that of lp12 to reduce load on main bearing yet is able to achieve a greater inertia because of its weight distribution a second challenge was how to overcome rotation of suspended parts sub chassis platter arm and cartridge relative to motor this was done by re imagining a suspension that had less freedom of lateral movement relative to drive motor xerxes uses a relatively light medium density fibreboard top board on which bearing and tonearm assemblies are mounted firm rubber blobs mounted on bottom board along with motor assembly support yet decouple from top board aesthetically two boards are encased by a wooden surround fixed to base board with screws these design principles can be seen throughout evolution of xerxes right through to xerxes 20plus construction original xerxes design is deliberately a radical departure from traditional suspended sub chassis design instead of having a three point sprung suspension separating plinth from sub chassis xerxes is made up of two boards separated from each other by stiff rubber blobs top plinth sees mountings for main bearing and tonearm a hole is cut out from top board for motor assembly to emerge from its fixture on board below on lower board to which an outer surround is attached three compliant rubber feet give additional isolation to turntable s chosen placement one notable characteristic of deck is large c shaped groove cut into top plinth to control how vibrations would be transmitted from platter to tonearm area however cut out is prone to a commonly observed plinth sag where part of it would bend out of true with rest of board while some other designs use clamps to couple disc to platter roksan shares same philosophy as linn in believing that rigid coupling would cause rumble to be transmitted from main bearing thus colouring sound to further increase isolation xerxes possesses a spindle that allows user to centre record but which is supposed to be removed during listening so that disc rests solely on felt mat bearing mounted spring loaded motor is powered by an outboard power supply designated xps its basic power supply switchable between 33 and 45 rpm throughout years there have been many changes which have significantly improved this table earliest and most important of these was a new main bearing other changes include modifications to components such as outboard power supply now in its seventh version and suspension blobs partnering tonearms and cartridges early versions were a platform for mounting third party tonearms prior to launch of roksan s maiden tonearm artemiz it was most commonly partnered with rega rb300 at budget end and sme v at top end other 12 inch arms like or sme 309 were also chosen by buyers rega was able to function in a way that seemed more synergistic with xerxes than lp12 in both price and performance terms original xerxes fitted with rega rb300 costing ps95 became a head on and cheaper alternative to lp12 fitted with linn arm by 2010 roksan has three tonearms to partner their deck artemiz tabriz and its zi version and nima roksan artemiz launched in 1987 priced at ps350 artemiz is flagship tonearm whose design was also a break from established conventions arm and is a one piece construction large gauge aluminium tube interference fitted at one end into a massive yoke that is bearing tube is flat at other end to provide for mounting cartridge arm is finished in a matt resonant paint unusually there is no finger lift for cueing but arm is fitted with a conventional lever operated lift lower assembly bearing housings are at either side and vertical bearings are above and below arm tube are massive and machined from a single solid piece bearings have a pyramidal arrangement upper component consisting of three ball bearings arranged in a triangle rests on a single ball bearing below bearings have deliberate play in them which allows movement in response to dynamic forces when records are tracked artemiz also possesses an intelligent counterweight its fulcrum is balanced on a stub at rear of arm so that its weight is decoupled from arm and its centre of gravity low a rider with a small indentation for fulcrum can be moved incrementally along stub to adjust tracking weight pendulum is tuned to outside range of warps and vibrations from footfalls bias is adjustable by spring and a threaded counterweight arm is wired using wire made to roksan s specification one end is terminated by cartridge tags and other has gold plated rca phono jacks wire has one join in arm base where thin cartridge wires are melded with sturdier phono leads power supplies and accessories in 1989 roksan introduced artaxerxes phono stage a moving coil phono pre amplifier designed to sit inside turntable roksan also marketed a three legged table dedicated to deck in 1987 roksan launched shiraz moving coil phono cartridge in 1989 roksan launched budget radius record player tabriz arm and corus moving magnet cartridge popularity it was launched in 1985 into already established competition where linn sondek lp12 dominated other competitors included well tempered table p3 michell pink triangle dunlop and logic dm 101 at its launch xerxes was priced at around approximately ps100 cheaper than an lp12 company was highly influential in way hi fi was sold and it managed to wrest market share from linn and naim who had a stranglehold in uk hi fi critic art dudley observed that prior to roksan arriving on scene xerxes is known for its speed stability and its ability to extract information and detail from record groove it thus became acceptable to acknowledge good performance from products by companies other than linn naim and rega what hi fi considered xerxes arguably first turntable to give previously all conquering linn sondek lp12 a real run for its money throughout inspector morse tv series lead character when seen at home is often listening to music on his xerxes according to manufacturers producers of show deliberately sought to feature one in series from first episode to highlight morse s passion for music in first episode dead of jericho people associated with fictional manufacturer of turntable richards audio research were focal point of storyline versions xerxes exists in four distinct versions original two plinth xerxes 1985 was discontinued after about eight years production after touraj moghaddam signature tms was launched on 10th anniversary of company 1995 roksan reprised entry level xerxes turntable with a 3 plinth design named xerxes x its top plinth houses tonearm and main bearing and is isolated from base by five blobs which also allow plinth to be adjusted in two planes parallel and perpendicular to motor and main bearing motor is driven by xps v reference motor drive which receives power from 5 reference power supply thumb sub chassis assembly for xerxes 20 xerxes 20 which superseded xerxes x in 2005 incorporated new main bearing ball and new 5 sub plinth bearing attached to inner platter has an unusually small diameter hardened steel spindle which sits on top of a tungsten ball that measures 2 mm
