abd al rahman ibn muhammad ibn al ash ath commonly known as ibn al ash ath after his grandfather was son of nephew of first rashidun caliph abu bakr muhammad ibn al he was a distinguished arab nobleman and general under early umayyad caliphate most notable for leading a failed rebellion against umayyad viceroy of east al hajjaj ibn yusuf in 700 703 scion of a distinguished family of kindaite tribal nobility he played a minor role in second fitna 680 692 and then served as governor of rayy al hajjaj was appointed governor of iraq after he had killed abdullah ibn zubayr grandson of abu bakr and restored umayyad rule in makkah after appointment of al hajjaj as governor of iraq and eastern provinces of caliphate in 694 relations between haughty and overbearing al hajjaj and iraqi nobility quickly became strained nevertheless in 699 or 700 al hajjaj appointed ibn al ash ath as commander of a huge iraqi army so called peacock army to subdue troublesome principality of zabulistan whose ruler zunbil vigorously resisted arab expansion during campaign al hajjaj s overbearing behaviour caused ibn al ash ath and army to rebel after patching up an agreement with zunbil army started on its march back to iraq on way a mutiny against al hajjaj developed into a full fledged anti umayyad rebellion al hajjaj initially retreated before rebels superior numbers but quickly defeated and drove them out of basra nevertheless rebels seized kufa where supporters started flocking revolt gained widespread support among those who were discontented with umayyad regime especially religious scholars known as qurra quran readers caliph abd al malik tried to negotiate terms including dismissal of al hajjaj but hardliners among rebel leadership pressured ibn al ash ath into rejecting caliph s terms in subsequent battle of dayr al jamajim rebel army was decisively defeated by al hajjaj s syrian troops al hajjaj pursued survivors who under ibn al ash ath fled to east most of rebels were captured by governor of khurasan while ibn al ash ath himself fled to zabulistan his fate is unclear as some accounts hold that after long pressure from al hajjaj to surrender him zunbil executed him while most sources claim that he committed suicide to avoid being handed over to his enemies suppression of ibn al ash ath s revolt signalled end of power of tribal nobility of iraq which henceforth came under direct control of umayyad regime s staunchly loyal syrian troops later revolts under yazid ibn al muhallab and zayd ibn ali also failed and it was not until success of abbasid revolution that syrian dominance of iraq was broken life origin and early career abd al rahman ibn muhammad ibn al ash ath was a descendant of a noble family from kinda tribe in his grandfather ma better known by his nickname al ash ath he with dishevelled hair was an important chieftain who submitted to muhammad but rebelled during ridda wars defeated he was pardoned and married caliph abu bakr s sister he went on to participate in crucial battles of early muslim conquests yarmouk and as well as in battle of siffin where he was instrumental in forcing ali to abandon his military advantage and submit to arbitration and later led kindaite quarter in kufa where he died in 661 his father muhammad was far less distinguished serving an unsuccessful tenure as governor of tabaristan and becoming involved in second fitna as a supporter of ibn al zubayr being killed in 686 7 in campaign that overthrew al mukhtar like his father at siffin he is denigrated by pro alid sources for his ambiguous role in battle of karbala in 680 being held responsible for arrests of muslim ibn aqil and hani ibn urwa ibn al ash ath s mother umm amr was daughter of sa id ibn qays al hamdani he had four brothers ishaq qasim and isma il of whom first three also fought in campaigns in tabaristan according to al tabari young ibn al ash ath accompanied his father and participated in his political activities in 680 he revealed hiding place of muslim ibn aqil to authorities and he fought in campaign against al mukhtar in which his father was killed and reportedly executed or persuaded mus ab ibn al zubayr to execute al mukhtar s captured followers in revenge ibn al ash ath disappears from record during next few years but after mus ab was defeated and killed by umayyad caliph abd al malik ibn marwan at battle of maskin in october 691 he like other followers of mus ab apparently went over to umayyads in early 692 he participated in a campaign against kharijites in al ahwaz later he went on to take up governorship of rayy al hajjaj s appointment to iraq thumb 280px alt old map of western eurasia and northern africa showing expansion of caliphate from arabia to cover most of middle east with

governor of iraq a crucial post given restiveness of region towards umayyad rule in 697 his remit was expanded to cover entirety of eastern caliphate including khurasan and sistan in 695 al hajjaj entrusted ibn al ash ath with 6 000 horsemen and campaign against kharijite rebels under shabib ibn yazid al shaybani although not large this group benefited from shabib s tactical skill and inflicted a number of defeats on umayyad forces advised by general al uthman ibn sa id ibn al ash ath pursued kharijites but displayed great caution in order to avoid falling into a trap as a result governor of al mada in uthman ibn qatan wrote to al hajjaj criticizing ibn al ash ath s leadership al hajjaj responded by giving command to uthman but when latter attacked shabib umayyad army suffered a heavy defeat losing around 900 men and fleeing to kufa uthman himself was killed while ibn al ash ath who lost his horse managed to escape with help of a friend and reached kufa after an eventful journey there he remained in hiding until al hajjaj granted him pardon despite this setback relations between ibn al ash ath and al hajjaj were initially friendly and al hajjaj s son married one of ibn al ash ath s sisters gradually however two men became estranged sources attribute this to ibn al ash ath s overweening pride as one of foremost of ashraf tribal nobility and his aspirations to leadership al mas udi records that he adopted title of nasir al mu minin helper of faithful an implicit challenge to umayyads who were implied to be false believers in addition he claimed to be qahtani a messianic figure in south arab yamani tribal tradition who was expected to raise them to domination ibn al ash ath s pretensions irked al hajjaj whose hostile remarks such as look how he walks how i should like to cut off his head were conveyed to ibn al ash ath and served to deepen their hostility to outright mutual hatred according to laura veccia vaglieri however these reports are more indicative of arabic sources tendency to explain historical events by incidents relating to persons rather than actual relationship between two men especially given fact that ibn al ash ath faithfully served al hajjaj in a number of posts culminating in his appointment to lead peacock army nevertheless it is clear that al hajjaj quickly became unpopular among iraqis in general through a series of measures that according to hugh n kennedy seem almost to have goaded iraqis into rebellion such as introduction of syrian troops mainstay of umayyad dynasty into iraq use of iraqi troops in arduous and unrewarding campaigns against kharijites and reduction of iraqi troops pay to a level below that of syrian troops sistan campaign and rebellion in 698 9 umayyad governor of sistan ubayd allah ibn abi bakra suffered a severe defeat by semi independent ruler of zabulistan known as zunbil zunbil drew arabs deep into his country and cut them off so that they managed to extricate themselves only with great difficulty and after suffering many losses particularly among kufan contingent in response al hajjaj sent an iraqi army to east against zunbil whether due to splendour of its equipment or as an allusion to proud and haughty manner of kufan soldiers and ashraf who composed it g r hawting this army became known in history as peacock army two different generals were appointed by al hajjaj in succession to command it before he appointed ibn al ash ath instead in view of their bad relations sources report appointment came as a surprise to many an uncle of ibn al ash ath even approached al hajjaj and suggested that his nephew might revolt but al hajjaj did not rescind his appointment al tabari suggests that al hajjaj relied on fear he inspired to keep ibn al ash ath in check modern scholarship on other hand holds that portrayal of great personal animosity between two men is likely to be exaggerated it is unclear whether ibn al ash ath himself had joined army from outset or whether according to an alternative tradition he had originally been sent to kirman to punish a local leader who had refused to help governors of sistan and sind after taking up leadership of army ibn al ash ath led it to sistan where he united local troops with peacock army he rejected a peace offer from zunbil and in marked contrast to his predecessor s direct assault began a systematic campaign to first secure lowlands surrounding mountainous heart of kingdom slowly and methodically he captured villages and fortresses one by one installing garrisons in them and linking them with messengers after accomplishing this task he withdrew to bust to spend winter of 699 700 once al hajjaj received ibn al ash ath s messages informing him of break in operations however he replied in what veccia vaglieri described as a series of arrogant and offensive messages ordering him to penetrate into heart of zabulistan and there to fight enemy to death ibn al ash ath called an assembly of army s leadership in which he informed them of al hajjaj s orders for an immediate advance and his decision to refuse to obey he then went before assembled troops and repeated al hajjaj s instructions calling upon them to decide what should be done troops clearly resented prospect of a long and difficult campaign so far from iraq hawting denounced al hajjaj proclaiming him deposed and swore allegiance to ibn al ash ath instead ibn al ash ath s brothers however as well as governor of khurasan al muhallab ibn abi sufra refused to join rebellion ibn al ash ath hastily concluded an agreement with zunbil whereby if he was victorious in coming conflict with al hajjaj he would accord zunbil generous treatment while if he was defeated zunbil would provide refuge with his rear secure ibn al ash ath left representatives at bust and zaranj and his army set out on return journey to iraq picking up more soldiers from kufa and basra who were stationed as garrisons along way by time army reached fars it had become clear that deposing al hajjaj could not be done without deposing caliph abd al malik as well and revolt evolved from a mutiny into a full blown anti umayyad uprising with troops renewing their oath of allegiance bay a to ibn al ash ath motives and driving forces of revolt reasons for rebellion have been source of much discussion and theories among modern scholars moving away from personal relationship between al hajjaj and ibn al ash ath alfred von kremer suggested that rebellion was linked with efforts of non arab converts to islam mawali to secure equal rights with arab muslims julius wellhausen rejected this view as main source of revolt seeing it instead as a reaction of iraqis in general and ashraf in particular against syrian dominated regime of umayyads as represented by overbearing and notably low born al hajjaj other scholars have seen in it a manifestation of intense tribal factionalism between northern arab and southern arab yamani tribal groups prevalent at time thus a poem by a certain a sha hamdan in celebration of rebellion shows not only a religious but also a tribal motivation of rebel troops al hajjaj is denounced as an apostate and a friend of devil while ibn al ash ath is portrayed as champion of yamani qahtani and hamdani tribes against northern arab ma addis and on other hand as hawting points out this is insufficient evidence to ascribe purely tribal motivations to revolt if ibn al ash ath s movement was indeed led largely by this simply reflects fact that they were dominant element in kufa and while al hajjaj himself was a northerner his main commander was a southerner wellhausen s analysis furthermore ignored evident religious dimension of revolt especially participation of fanatical zealots known as qurra quran readers while religious polemic used by both sides is stereotyped unspecific and to be found in other contexts according to hawting there do appear to have been specific religious grievances notably accusation that umayyads were neglecting ritual prayer it seems that revolt began as a simple mutiny against an overbearing governor who made impossible demands of troops but at least by time army reached fars a religious element had emerged represented by qurra given close interaction of religion and politics in early muslim society hawting religious element quickly became dominant as seen by difference between bay a sworn at beginning of revolt and that exchanged between army and ibn al ash ath at istakhr in fars while in first ibn al ash ath declared as his intention to depose al hajjaj enemy of god in latter he exhorted his men to defend book of god and sunna of his prophet to depose imams of error to fight against those who regard blood of prophet s kin as although ibn al ash ath remained as head of uprising veccia vaglieri suggests that after this point one has impression that control of revolt slipped from his hands or that as wellhausen comments he was urged on in spite of himself and even if he would could not have banished spirits which he had called up it was as if an avalanche came rushing down sweeping every thing before it this interpretation is corroborated by different rhetoric and actions of ibn al ash ath and his followers as reported in sources former was ready and willing to compromise with umayyads and continued to fight only because he had no alternative while great mass of his followers motivated by discontent against umayyad regime couched in religious terms were far more uncompromising and willing to carry on struggle until death al hajjaj himself seems to have been aware of distinction in suppressing revolt he pardoned quraysh syrians and many of other arab clans but executed tens of thousands among mawali and zutt of mesopotamian marshes who had sided with rebels fight for control of iraq thumb right 280px alt geophysical map of lower iraq with main settlements and provinces denoted map of iraq lower mesopotamia in early islamic period informed of revolt al hajjaj requested reinforcements from caliph but was unable to stop advance of rebel army which is reported to have numbered 33 000 cavalry and 120 000 infantry on 24 or 25 january 701 ibn al ash ath overwhelmed al hajjaj s advance guard at tustar at news of this defeat al hajjaj withdrew to basra and then as he could not possibly hold city left it as well for nearby al zawiya ibn al ash ath entered basra on 13 february 701 over next month a series of skirmishes were fought between forces of ibn al ash ath and al hajjaj in which former generally held upper hand finally in early march two armies met for a pitched battle ibn al ash ath initially prevailed but in end al hajjaj s syrians under sufyan ibn al abrad al kalbi carried off a victory many rebels fell especially among qurra forcing ibn al ash ath to withdraw to kufa taking with him kufan troops and elite of basran cavalry at kufa ibn al ash ath found citadel occupied by matar ibn an officer from al mada in and was forced to take it by assault his lieutenant at basra hashimi abd al rahman ibn abbas tried but was unable to hold city as populace opened gates in exchange for a pardon after a few days abd al rahman too withdrew with as many basrans as would follow him to kufa where ibn al ash ath s forces swelled further with arrival of large numbers of anti umayyad volunteers after taking control of basra and executing some 11 000 of its people despite his pledge of pardon al hajjaj marched on kufa in april 701 his army was harassed by ibn al ash ath s cavalry but reached environs of city and set up camp at dayr qurra on right bank of euphrates so as to secure his lines of communication with syria in response ibn al ash ath left kufa and with an army reportedly 200 000 strong approached al hajjaj s army and set up camp at dayr al jamajim both armies fortified their camps by digging trenches and as before engaged in skirmishes whatever true numbers of ibn al ash ath s force al hajjaj was in a difficult position although reinforcements from syria were constantly arriving his army was considerably outnumbered by rebels and his position was difficult to resupply with provisions in meantime ibn al ash ath s progress had sufficiently alarmed umayyad court that they sought a negotiated settlement despite contrary advice of al hajjaj caliph abd al malik sent his brother muhammad and son abdallah as envoys proposing dismissal of al hajjaj appointment of ibn al ash ath as governor over one of iraqi towns and a raise in iraqis pay so that they received same amount as syrians ibn al ash ath was inclined to accept but more radical of his followers especially qurra refused believing that offered terms revealed government s weakness and pushed for outright victory with negotiations failing two armies continued to skirmish sources report that skirmishing lasted for 100 days with 48 engagements this lasted until september when two armies met in battle again ibn al ash ath initially held upper hand but syrians prevailed in end shortly before sun set ibn al ash ath s men broke and scattered failing to rally his troops ibn al ash ath with a handful of followers fled to kufa where he took farewell of his family as hawting comments contrast between discipline and organisation of umayyads and their largely syrian support and lack of these qualities among their opponents in spite of or perhaps rather because of more righteous and religious flavour of opposition is a recurring pattern in civil wars of period victorious al hajjaj entered kufa where he tried and executed many rebels but also pardoned those who submitted after admitting that through revolt they had become infidels in meantime however one of ibn al ash ath s supporters ubayd allah ibn samura had recaptured basra to where ibn al ash ath now headed and another muhammad ibn sa d ibn abi waqqas had captured al mada in al hajjaj remained for a month in kufa before setting out to meet ibn al ash ath two armies met at maskin on river dujayl after two weeks of skirmishing al hajjaj delivered final blow by launching a simultaneous attack on rebel camp from two sides while he with main part of his army attacked from one side a portion of his army guided by a shepherd crossed marshes and launched itself on camp from rear caught by surprise rebel army was nearly annihilated with many of its troops drowning in river in their attempt to flee flight east and death following this renewed defeat ibn al ash ath fled east towards sistan with a few survivors al hajjaj sent troops under umara ibn al tamim al lakhmi to intercept them umara caught up with them twice at sus and sabur but ibn al ash ath and his men managed to fight through to kirman and thence to sistan there he was refused entry into zaranj by his own agent amil and was then arrested by amil of bust zunbil however true to his word came to bust and forced ibn al ash ath s release taking him with him to zabulistan and treating him with much honour ibn al ash ath assumed command of some 60 000 supporters who had assembled there in meantime with their support he seized zaranj where he punished amil faced with approach of umayyad troops under umara ibn al tamim however most of ibn al ash ath s followers urged him to go to khurasan where they would be hopefully able to recruit more followers and sit out umayyad attacks until either al hajjaj or caliph abd al malik died and political situation changed ibn al ash ath bowed to their pressure but after a group of 2 000 men defected he returned to zabulistan with those who would follow him there most of rebels remained in khurasan choosing abd al rahman ibn abbas as their leader they were soon confronted and defeated by local governor yazid ibn al muhallab yazid released those who belonged to yamani tribes related to his own and sent rest to al hajjaj who executed most of them in meantime umara quickly effected surrender of sistan by offering lenient terms to garrisons if they surrendered without struggle ibn al ash ath remained safe under protection of zunbil but al hajjaj fearing that he might raise another revolt sent letters to zunbil mixing threats and promises to secure his surrender finally in 704 zunbil gave in in exchange for lifting annual tribute for 7 or 10 years accounts of ibn al ash ath s end differ one version holds that he was executed by zunbil himself or that he died of illness and that his head was cut off and sent to al hajjaj more widespread account however holds that he was confined to a remote castle at rukhkhaj in anticipation of his extradition to al hajjaj and chained to his warden but that he threw himself from top of castle along with his warden to his death aftermath failure of ibn al ash ath s revolt led to tightening of umayyad control over iraq al hajjaj founded a permanent garrison for syrian troops at wasit situated between basra and kufa and iraqis regardless of social status were deprived of any real power in governance of region this was coupled with a reform of salary ata system by al hajjaj whereas hitherto salary had been calculated based on role of one s ancestors in early muslim conquests it now became limited to those actively participating in campaigns as most of army was now composed of syrians this measure gravely injured interests of iraqis who regarded this as another impious attack on hallowed institutions in addition extensive land reclamation and irrigation works were undertaken in lower iraq sawad but this was limited mostly to around wasit and proceeds went to umayyads and their clients not iraqi nobility as a result political power of once mighty kufan elites was soon broken it was not until 720 that iraqis rebelled once again under yazid ibn al muhallab last of old style iraqi champions hugh kennedy and even then support was ambivalent and revolt was defeated two of ibn al ash ath s nephews muhammad ibn ishaq and uthman ibn ishaq supported rebellion but most remained quiescent and content with their role as local dignitaries a few held posts in kufa under early abbasids perhaps most famous of family s later members is philosopher al kindi 873 another uprising that of zayd ibn ali broke out in 740 again promising to right injustices restoration of ata distribution of revenue from sawad an end to distant campaigns and to restore rule according to quran and sunna once more however deserted it at critical moment and it was defeated by umayyads discontent with umayyad government continued to simmer and during abbasid revolution iraq rose up in support of rebellion kufa overthrew umayyad rule and welcomed abbasid army in october 749 followed immediately by proclamation of as saffah as first abbasid caliph there references sources category 7th century births category 7th century arabs category 7th century umayyad people category 8th century arabs category 704 deaths
