of characters in their efforts to stop an evil empire from recovering four powerful gems characters can fire guns and perform a series of acrobatic maneuvers to fight enemies across each stage there are four weapons in game which can be combined with one another to create different shot types development on gunstar heroes began among a team of staff working at konami in 1991 following an unwillingness of konami to embrace their original game ideas team quit in 1992 and formed treasure to see their project through team wanted to develop their game for genesis because of system s powerful motorola 68000 microprocessor sega initially rejected their proposal but later granted approval after they had been working for sega for several months on mcdonald s treasure land adventure 1993 treasure worked on both games in parallel and released gunstar heroes worldwide as their first game in 1993 gunstar heroes was a critical success being praised for its frantic action and advanced graphics it helped establish treasure s place in industry and introduced several design conventions which would become characteristic of their later work such as large bosses and a unique sense of humor it was re released several times including dedicated ports to game gear and nintendo 3ds and received a sequel on game boy advance in retrospect it is considered one of best action games of 16 bit era and one of best video games of all time by several publications gameplay thumb left player runs to right as they fire machine gun gunstar heroes is a run and gun game played from a side scrolling perspective similar to contra game can be played in single player or cooperatively with a partner players take on role of gunstar red and gunstar blue as they battle with an evil empire for control over a set of powerful gems game features seven stages of which first four can be tackled in any order stage formats vary while some feature a typical left to right format others have player riding in a mine cart along walls fighting enemies on a helicopter or playing a board game completing a level grants player an extension to their maximum health when starting a game player can choose either a free or fixed firing stance fixed stance immobilizes character when shooting while free stance has player move in direction they are firing player also has a choice of starting weapon there are four shot types in game a homing shot lightning blaster flamethrower and machine gun each weapon has its strengths and weaknesses and can be swapped with others from item drops in each stage weapons can be combined with each other to produce unique shot types for example homing shot can be combined with machine gun to add a homing effect to latter or two lightning shots can be combined to create a more powerful lightning gun in addition to firing their weapon player characters can pull off a series of acrobatic maneuvers including jumping sliding and grabbing and throwing enemies development in 1991 several konami employees led by programmer masato maegawa began holding planning sessions at coffee shops for an original game abridged translation they were establishing early concepts for an action shooting game a genre they were familiar with they pitched their idea to konami but were told it would not sell and it was rejected maegawa and his team were growing frustrated with industry s reliance on sequels to established franchises and console conversions of arcade games to generate revenue they felt konami had fallen into this pattern as a large company growing reliant on sequels in their castlevania and teenage mutant ninja turtles series maegawa and his team felt consumers wanted original games and so in 1992 they left konami and established treasure to continue development on their original game thumb left treasure believed motorola 68000 microprocessor in sega genesis was best suited for action games they wanted to make treasure wanted to develop their game for sega s genesis maegawa was interested in platform because of its motorola 68000 microprocessor which he felt was easier to program for than super nes and more powerful team decided to approach sega for a publishing contract when they first presented their design documents to sega they were not granted approval because they lacked a proven track record instead sega contracted treasure to develop mcdonald s treasure land adventure 1993 several months into development they were finally granted approval to work on their original action game they originally were using working title lunatic gunstar thinking lunatic was a good description of game s stimulating action sega of america felt word held a negative connotation so rejected it team also considered blade gunner in homage to blade runner but this was also rejected because of copyright restrictions sega of america eventually suggested word heroes so gunstar heroes became final title treasure consisted of around 18 people most being programmers from konami staff was split in half to work on both gunstar heroes and mcdonald s treasure land adventure in parallel core team behind gunstar heroes consisted of six people two programmers two graphic designers and two sound programmers staff known by their nicknames was composed of main programmer enemy and boss programmer nami graphic designers han and iuchi composer non and sound effects programmer murata role of game designer did not exist within treasure all game design and planning was undertaken by everyone involved team felt they had more freedom working under sega than konami maegawa got approval to add a treasure logo when game booted which he felt was a rare opportunity for developers to get in that era thumb right genesis s processor made multi limbed bosses like seven force possible development of gunstar heroes lasted around nine to ten months it was team s first experience programming for genesis having come off programming for super nes at konami programmers mitsuru yaida and hideyuki previously programmed contra iii alien wars 1992 for super nes at konami team felt genesis s processor was more powerful capable and friendly to experimentation than other consoles this led them to consider it more suited for action games and sophisticated graphical effects they were looking to create team implemented heavy visual effects in an exercise in design experimentation not an effort to push hardware some of that experimenting was done with system s sprite rotation and scaling capabilities which evoked a sense of depth genesis had its limitations however as it could only display 64 colors on screen at once team placed extra effort on coloring to compensate early backgrounds were drawn with a 16 color palette but they looked desolate so ultimately two palettes with 32 colors were used team also used programming tricks to make scenery appear like three to four layers were present although genesis only supports two team approached gunstar heroes with an anything goes concept that led to many ambitious ideas being implemented into final game one such concept was weapon combination mechanic which was conceived in early planning stages they experimented with weapon attributes until end of development and designed game so players would continue discovering new weapons and devise new ways to complete stages processor also made articulated multi limb enemies possible like boss seven force which was programmed by nami along with all other bosses because moving around large sprites was difficult due to limited video ram seven force was built by combining circles and squares to make one large character maegawa claims game could have never worked on super nes because boss animations required expanded computing power standard enemy characters designed by han were drawn on screen by combining a top and bottom sprite allowing for more animation patterns with lower memory usage han was inspired by game mazin saga mutant fighter 1993 to program enemies manually rather than with mathematical algorithms translation game was 16 megabits but compressed to fit under 8 release although mcdonald s treasure land adventure was completed first treasure decided to wait and release gunstar heroes first because they wanted their debut to be an original game it was nearly rejected for publishing by sega of america only being approved by mac senour last producer in reviewing queue after 12 others rejected it senour believed other producers dismissed game because its small character sprites contrasted with more popular large sprites at time senour did ask treasure to change one boss character because it looked too similar to adolf hitler gunstar heroes was released in japan on september 10 1993 and released in west same month sega underestimated demand in japan where their initial shipment was only 10 000 units meanwhile sega of america also ordered a small initial print run as they were not typically confident in games from sega of japan game was not heavily promoted and spread by word of mouth gamefan particularly enjoyed game and published first english interview with maegawa game shipped in total around 70 000 copies in japan and 200 000 overseas an arcade version was also released for sega mega play arcade board ports and re releases a game gear port was developed by m2 sega asked m2 if they wanted to make a game gear game after being impressed by their gauntlet port for genesis m2 wanted to port cliffhanger edward randy but they were ultimately handed gunstar heroes since genesis version pushed hardware limitations a game gear port was difficult translation port had some changes such as dice palace being removed and it ran at lower frame rate it was released on march 24 1995

com wrote that between gunstar heroes and their other genesis games treasure earned a reputation as a master of hardcore action gaming many of design conventions treasure used in gunstar heroes would return and became characteristic of treasure s later work these elements include a quirky sense of humor creativity and a tendency toward completely absurd levels of action a sequel was released for
