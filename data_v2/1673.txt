per minute raven and larsen alternate singing lead vocals for first two verses and then sing harmony together during choruses for most of song verses are in key of c minor and choruses are in relative major key of e major final chorus has a key change to f major song s prominent instruments are electric piano and acoustic guitar with record scratching sounds layering production in chorus in a style akin to hanson s final chorus repeats with ad libbed background vocals until song fades out lyrically song is about getting rules straight on a budding relationship slow down and don t say you love me until you give me some time and get to know me according to musicologist jon mikkel broch alvik don t say you love me is thinking person s teen pop alvik rejects a superficial interpretation that lyrics are a moralistic message of abstinence arguing instead that m2m signal a stance that sounds considered and assured rather than prudish and that song is a statement of burgeoning agency song has been described as bubblegum pop music with similar lyrical qualities to songs by girl groups of 1960s while also having more influence from rock and singer songwriter genres than was typical for other teen pop songs of late 1990s there is a slight difference in lyrics between version used in pokemon first movie version and one released on shades of purple shades of purple version includes line you start kissing me what s that about in pokemon version lyric is you said you love me what s that about when asked about lyric change in an interview m2m replied pokemon people didn t find it appropriate to have kissing in lyrics because it was for younger kids we think lyric change was stupid original version is on shades of purple and that s one we wanted to go with m2m had not heard of
