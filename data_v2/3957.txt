also came his brother charles sister susannah and charles wife all five of them aged between 21 and 26 life in new zealand at first was hard and disappointing mountfort found that there was little call for architects christchurch was little more than a large village of basic wooden huts on a windswept plain new emigre s architectural life in new zealand had a disastrous beginning his first commission in new zealand was church of most holy trinity in lyttelton built in 1852 by isaac luck building proved vulnerable to high winds and was considered unsafe it was demolished in 1857 this calamity was attributed to use of unseasoned wood and his lack of knowledge of local building materials whatever cause result was a crushing blow to his reputation a local newspaper called him a half educated architect whose buildings have given anything but satisfaction he being evidently deficient in all knowledge of principles of construction though a clever draughtsman and a man of some taste due to this blow to his reputation he began running a stationery shop working as a newspaper agent and giving drawing lessons until 1857 to supplement his architectural work it was during this period in architectural wilderness that he developed a lifelong interest in photography and supplemented his meagre income by taking photographic portraits mountfort was a freemason and an early member of

mountfort and luck ample opportunity to practice their trade in 1855 they produced a preliminary design for new canterbury provincial council buildings in timber buildings were constructed from 1857 59 but in a more limited form than original design as provincial council gained new functions with growth in population and economy of province buildings were enlarged with a north wing in stone and an iron clock tower from 1859 60 and further enlarged with a stone council chamber and refreshment rooms in 1864 65 lochhead 1999 pp 93 117 buildings today are regarded as one of mountfort s most important works from exterior building appears austere as was much of mountfort s early work a central tower dominates two flanking gabled wings in gothic revival style however interior was a riot of

church all successfully harmonised into a new zealand landscape gothic revival style of architecture began to gain in popularity from late 18th century as a romantic backlash against more classical and formal styles which had predominated previous two centuries lochhead 1999 introduction at age of 16 mountfort acquired two books written by gothic revivalist augustus pugin true principles of christian or pointed architecture and an apology for revival of christian architecture from this time onwards mountfort was a disciple of pugin s strong anglo catholic architectural values retrieved on 25 august 2008 these values were further cemented in 1846 at age of 21 mountfort became a pupil of richard cromwell carpenter carpenter was like mountfort a devout anglo catholic and subscribed to theories of and thus to oxford and cambridge movements retrieved on 26 august 2008 these conservative theological movements taught that true spirituality and concentration in prayer was influenced by physical surroundings and that medieval church had been more spiritual than that of early 19th century as a result of this theology medieval architecture was declared to be of greater spiritual value than classical palladian based styles of 18th and early 19th centuries augustus pugin even pronounced that medieval architecture was only form suitable for a church and that palladianism was almost heretical such theory was not confined to architects and continued well into 20th century this school of thought led intellectuals such as english poet ezra pound to prefer romanesque buildings to baroque on grounds that latter represented an abandonment of world of intellectual clarity and light for a set of values based on notion of hell and increasing dominance of society by bankers a breed to be despised whatever philosophy behind gothic revival in london 19th century rulers of british empire felt that gothic architecture was suitable for colonies because of its then strong anglican connotations representing hard work morality and conversion of native peoples irony of this was that many of mountfort s churches were for roman catholics as so many of new immigrants were of irish origin smith p 81 to many middle class english empire builders gothic represented a nostalgic reminder of parishes left behind in britain with their true medieval architecture these were patrons who chose architects and designs mountfort s early gothic work in new zealand was of more severe anglican variety as practised by carpenter with tall lancet windows and many gables as his career progressed and he had proved himself to employing authorities his designs developed into a more european form with towers turrets and high ornamental roof lines in french manner a style which was in no way peculiar to mountfort but was endorsed by such architects as alfred waterhouse in britain mountfort s skill as an architect lay in adapting these flamboyant styles to suit limited materials available in new zealand while wooden churches are plentiful in certain parts of us they are generally of a simple classic design whereas mountfort s wooden churches in new zealand are as much ornate gothic fantasies as those he designed in stone perhaps flamboyance of his work can be explained in a statement of principles he and his partner luck wrote when bidding to win commission to design government house auckland in 1857 provincial architect thumb right 200px construction of christchurch cathedral designed by george gilbert scott was supervised by benjamin mountfort who designed spire thumb right 200px christchurch was completed in 1904 until 2011 earthquake and collapse of spire building remained almost unaltered as provincial architect a newly created position to which mountfort was appointed in p 1306 mountfort designed a wooden church for roman catholic community of city of christchurch this wooden erection was subsequently enlarged several times until it was renamed a cathedral it was eventually replaced in 1901 by cathedral of blessed sacrament a more permanent stone building by architect frank petre though cenotaph by mountfort was preserved retrieved on 4 september 2008 mountfort often worked in wood a material he in no way regarded as an impediment to gothic style though he was unique in this respect as gothic buildings were often created from stone and mortar between 1869 and 1882 he designed canterbury museum and subsequently canterbury college and its clock tower in 1877 construction on buildings for canterbury college which later became university of canterbury began with construction of clock tower block this edifice which opened in 1877 was first purpose built university in new zealand college was completed in two subsequent stages

supervising architect of new cathedral project this proposal was originally vetoed by cathedral commission nevertheless following delays in building work attributed to financial problems position of supervising architect was finally given to mountfort in 1873 mountfort was responsible for several alterations to absentee main architect s design most obviously tower and west porch he also designed font harper memorial and north porch cathedral was however not finally completed until 1904 six years after mountfort s death cathedral is very much in european decorated gothic style with an attached campanile tower beside body of cathedral rather than towering directly above it in more english tradition in 1872 mountfort became a founding member of canterbury association of architects a body which was responsible for all subsequent development of new city mountfort was now at pinnacle of his career mountfort notably altered use of a segmented arch rather than one in romanesque style latter of which was considered by augustus pugin to be fundamentally important to gothic style college posed a challenge in its main hall on hall s completion in 1882 it was largest public space in christchurch lochhead 1999 pp 274 277 additionally a level of detail not possible in previous works was present in hall s design due to superior funding for college completion of first stage was met with praise and optimism though extensions such as a biological lab were added in early 1890s lochhead 1999 p 283 by 1880s mountfort was hailed as new zealand s premier ecclesiastical architect with over forty churches to his credit thumb left 300px canterbury museum designed by benjamin mountfort completed in 1882 in style of a french chateau in 1888 he designed st john s cathedral in napier

church of auckland covering st mary s is largest and last timber church built by mountfort lochhead 1999 p 174 and largest wooden gothic church in world at its completion it was said that in point of design completeness and beauty it reaches a high level mark not yet approached in diocese emphasis placed on sweeping roof by great aisle windows struck a balance to great area church enclosed in 1982 entire church complete with its stained glass windows was transported to a new site across road from its former position where a new cathedral was to be built st mary s church was consecrated in 1898 one of mountfort s final grand works lochhead 1999 pp 175 178 outside of his career mountfort was keenly interested in arts and a talented artist although his artistic work appears to have been confined to art pertaining to architecture his first love he was a devout member of church of england and a member of many anglican church councils and diocese committees fletcher p 1308 mountfort s later years were blighted by professional jealousies as his position as province s first architect was assailed by new and younger men influenced by new orders of architecture benjamin mountfort died in 1898 aged 73 he was buried in cemetery of holy trinity avonside church which he had extended in 1876 legacy thumb 200px left canterbury provincial council buildings one of mountfort s earliest new zealand gothic buildings in style he made his trademark evaluating mountfort s works today one has to avoid judging them against a background of similar designs in europe in 1860s new zealand was a developing country where materials and resources freely available in europe were conspicuous by their absence when available they were often of inferior quality as mountfort discovered with unseasoned wood in his first disastrous project his first buildings in his new homeland were often too tall or steeply pitched failing to take account of non european climate and landscape however he soon adapted and developed his skill in working with crude and unrefined materials thumb 200px right sunnyside asylum christchurch completed in 1891 this was one of mountfort s last major works designed in a chateauesque gothic large windows created air of a country house rather than place of incarceration christchurch and its surrounding areas are unique in new zealand for their particular style of gothic architecture something that can be directly attributed to benjamin mountfort while mountfort did accept small private domestic commissions he is today better known for designs executed for public civic bodies and church his monumental gothic stone civic buildings in christchurch which would not be out of place in oxford or cambridge are an amazing achievement over adversity of materials his hallmark wooden gothic churches today epitomise 19th century province of canterbury they are accepted and indeed appear as part of landscape in this way benjamin mountfort s achievement was to make his favoured style of architecture synonymous with identity of province of canterbury following his death one of his seven children cyril continued to work in his father s gothic style well into 20th century cyril mountfort was responsible for church of st luke s in city which was an unexecuted design of his father s retrieved on 14 september 2008 in this way and through daily public use of
