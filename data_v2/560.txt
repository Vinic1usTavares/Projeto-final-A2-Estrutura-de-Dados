pitched by jean who wanted to expand lisa s personality when he pitched plot idea to simpsons writing staff they became concerned about episode s originality they argued that series had already explored religious themes in earlier episodes but jean assured them that episode would be about lisa first and foremost rather than buddhism unlike several other episodes in series in which a character undergoes a change in their personality lisa has remained a buddhist since this episode much like her conversion to vegetarianism in lisa vegetarian freiberger pitched subplot involving model rockets in beginning of episode he based it on a real life experience in which he as a child accidentally launched a model rocket into a window in his house a scene from this subplot was removed from episode following september 11 attacks scene would show a man named hassan jay salam being arrested by policemen who tells them to call his cousin casey kasem who think rocket bart and homer launched was launched by him rocket bears abbreviation which stands for homer j simpson after attacks scene was considered too offensive by fox censors so scene was removed originally subplot would involve marge trying to get homer to build model rockets with bart homer would not want to at first but after marge convinces him he would soon get more into it than bart plot idea was encouraged by some of writers who thought that marge had gotten short shrift and according to freiberger marge would have had a really big part motivating story had subplot remained intact right 200px thumb richard
