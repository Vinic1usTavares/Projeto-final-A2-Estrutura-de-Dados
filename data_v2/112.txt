plata where he became a notable member of criollo population of buenos aires he tried to promote some of new political and economic ideals but found severe resistance from local peninsulars this

against a possible royalist attack from eastern band of uruguay river while there he created flag of argentina first triumvirate did not approve flag but because of slow communications belgrano would only learn of that many weeks later while reinforcing army of north at jujuy there knowing he was at a strategic disadvantage against royalist armies coming from upper peru belgrano ordered jujuy exodus which evacuated entire population of jujuy province to san miguel de tucuman his counter offensive at battle of tucuman resulted in a key strategic victory and it was soon followed by a complete victory over royalist army of pio tristan at battle of salta however his deeper incursions into upper peru led to defeats at vilcapugio and ayohuma leading second triumvirate to order his replacement as commander of army of north by newly arrived jose de san martin by then del ano xiii had approved use of belgrano s flag as national war flag belgrano then went on a diplomatic mission to europe along with bernardino rivadavia to seek support for revolutionary government he returned in time to take part in congress of tucuman which declared argentine independence 1816 he promoted

san carlos school where he learned latin philosophy logic physics metaphysics and literature he graduated in 1786 lagleyze p 10 domingo had sufficient success as merchant to send his two sons francisco and manuel to study in europe he expected them to study commerce but manuel decided to study law belgrano was so successful and attained such prestige that pope pius vi allowed him to study forbidden literature even books deemed as heretical excepting only astrological and obscene books luna p 11 in this way he came into contact with authors like montesquieu rousseau and who were forbidden in spain mario belgrano p 23 thumb manuel belgrano as a student at university of salamanca belgrano studied near intellectual elite of spain and by that time there were heated discussions about ongoing french revolution principles of equality and freedom universal scope of declaration of rights of man and of citizen and criticism of divine right of kings were constant topics of debate among supporters of these ideas it was thought that spain should be remade under similar principles and critics of such thought were rejected as tyrants or proponents of outdated ideas luna p 13 however spanish enlightenment was slightly different from french one as it still respected religion and monarchy thus despite new influences belgrano remained a strong catholic and monarchist belgranian national institute intelectual belgrano also studied living languages political economy and public rights authors that most influenced him were pedro rodriguez de campomanes gaspar melchor de jovellanos adam smith and francois quesnay belgrano translated quesnay s book maximes de gouvernement economique d un royaume agricole general maxims of economical government in an agricultural kingdom to spanish his main interest in works of such authors were ideas that referred to public good and popular prosperity like many south american students he became interested in physiocracy which stated that new wealth came from nature that agriculture was an economic activity that generated more income than one needed and that state should not interfere at all with it by that time south america had plenty of natural resources and a very strict state interventionism in economy belgrano developed idea that principles of physiocracy and those stated by adam smith could be applied together in viceroyalty of rio de la plata in development of this approach he was influenced by fernando who promoted study of particular cases over generalisations and antonio genovesi who thought that absolute freedom promoted by physiocrats should be tempered by a moderate intervention by state such as provision of free education for some pigna p 11 12 during his time in europe belgrano became president of an academy within university of salamanca devoted to roman legislation forensic practice and political economy work in consulate a short time before his return to buenos aires on 3

of crown this date would be later known in argentina as economist day ley 1066 he would remain in this office until 1810 and would deal with commercial disputes and promote agriculture industry and commerce not having enough freedom to make big changes in economic system he made big efforts to improve education influenced by campomanes he believed that true wealth of countries was human ingenuity and that best way to promote industrialisation was through education luna p 19 thumb left juan jose castelli shared with his cousin belgrano work in consulate and in journalism belgrano maintained frequent discussions with committee members of consulate who were all merchants with strong interests involved in commerce with cadiz mario belgrano p 26 he made many proposals influenced by free trade ideas mario belgrano p 32 by this time belgrano thought that merchant must have freedom to buy where he can be best accommodated and it s natural that he does where he is supplied with best price to be able to earn best profit those proposals were rejected by committee members his only supporters were juan jose castelli juan larrea and domingo matheu however belgrano had some successes such as creating nautical school commerce school and geometry and drawing academy he created commerce school to influence future merchants to work towards best interests of nation luna pp 23 24 and nautical and drawing ones to provide youth with prestigious and lucrative careers luna p 24 schools were situated next to consulate so that belgrano could easily supervise their development schools were in place for three years before they were closed by a ruling of manuel godoy from spanish monarchy who considered them an unnecessary luxury for a colony it was felt that buenos aires might not be able to maintain them manuel belgrano p 56 belgrano tried to promote diversification of agriculture via production of linen and hemp following experiences with his friend martin de he proposed to keep reserves of wheat to help have control over its price mario belgrano p 38 he also tried to make leather recognised as a product of country in order to promote its commercial potential mario belgrano p 27 none of these proposals were accepted he designed a system to give prizes to achievements that would boost local economy diversify agriculture or deforest pampas mario belgrano p 37 system did not work as expected and as nobody met requirements no such prize was ever given lagleyze p 13 he helped to create first newspaper of city telegrafo mercantil directed by francisco cabello y mesa mario belgrano p 42 he worked with manuel jose de and edited nearly two hundred issues newspaper was closed in 1802 because of conflicts with authorities of viceroyalty who did not like criticisms made in it or jokes and parodies he also worked at semanario de agricultura comercio e industria directed by hipolito vieytes he used this newspaper to explain his economic ideas manufacturing and exporting finished goods importing raw materials to manufacture avoiding importing luxury goods or raw materials that could be produced or extracted locally importing only vital products and owning a merchant navy newspaper specialised in philosophy of history geography and statistics many revolutionary principles were presented as essays mitre bartolome historia de belgrano buenos aires 1859 v 1 pp 202 206 belgrano had symptoms of syphilis which he had caught during his time in europe luna p 21 this sickness forced him to take long leaves from his work in consulate and to suggest his cousin juan jose castelli who had similar ideas as a possible replacement during his leaves luna pp 21 22 rejection by committee members delayed approval of castelli until 1796 british invasions belgrano was appointed as captain of urban militias in 1797 by viceroy pedro de melo who was instructed by spain to prepare defences against a possible british or portuguese attack belgranian national institute belgrano y las 1806 y 1807 belgrano by then worked in consulate and was no longer interested in pursuing a military career luna p 29 viceroy rafael de sobremonte requested that he create a militia to counter a possible british attack but he did not take interest in it his first intervention in a military conflict took place when british under william carr beresford arrived with 1 600 men and took buenos aires starting british invasions of rio de la plata belgrano moved to fortress as soon as he heard warning and gathered many men to launch resistance but without required knowledge his men marched in disorder and belgrano was ordered to disband after a single british cannon shot luna p 30 belgrano would write later in his autobiography that he regretted not having by then even most basic knowledge of militia work manuel belgrano p 57 after taking of city all spanish authorities were requested to pledge allegiance to british crown belgrano thought that members of consulate should leave city and join viceroy but others did not agree they obeyed british request belgrano refused to do so luna p 31 he said that he wanted either our old master or no master at all shumway p 17 to avoid being forced to pledge allegiance he escaped from buenos aires and sought asylum at chapel of mercedes in banda oriental british army was defeated by an army under direction of santiago de liniers and spanish authority was restored shumway p 19 it was expected that british would return and whole city started to prepare for that possibility belgrano returned to buenos aires after reconquest and put himself under command of liniers he was appointed sergeant of patricians regiment under command of cornelio saavedra and started to study military strategy luna pp 33 34 after some conflicts with other officials he resigned as sergeant and served again under command of liniers a new british attack took place in july 1807 during battle he served as field assistant to a division commanded by mario belgrano p 52 after a successful resistance against british belgrano resumed his work in consulate and discontinued his military studies because of his knowledge of french he had a brief interview with defeated robert craufurd who proposed british support for an independentist movement belgrano rejected offer considering that britain would readily remove their support if they had a more lucrative option in europe and in such case revolutionaries would be helpless against a spanish counterattack manuel belgrano p 63 carlotism thumb belgrano supported aspirations of carlota joaquina de borbon manuel belgrano was main proponent of carlotist political movement in rio de la plata a response to recent developments in europe where spain was at war with france through abdications of bayonne spanish king ferdinand vii was deposed and imprisoned and frenchman joseph bonaparte was appointed king of spain by french victors this led to a partial power vacuum in viceroyalty as legitimacy of new king was rejected by all parties purpose of carlotist movement was to replace authority of deposed king with that of carlota joaquina sister of ferdinand who was then living in rio de janeiro project was supported as a means to achieve more autonomy and perhaps independence for spanish colonies in new world luna p 38 belgrano kept a fluent mail communication with carlota and convinced many independentists to join him in project such as castelli vieytes nicolas rodriguez pena and juan jose paso mario belgrano p 55 project however found strong resistance as carlota was married to john vi a prince of portugal many people though that carlotism was a trick to conceal portuguese expansionism carlota herself had different political ideas than those of her supporters belgrano and others shared ideas of enlightenment but carlota aspired to keep full power of an absolutist monarchy luna p 39 by 1810 project was forgotten a new viceroy baltasar hidalgo de cisneros arrived from europe to replace liniers belgrano had failed to convince liniers of benefits of carlotist plan so he aimed instead to convince him of refusing to give up viceroyalty as liniers had been confirmed as viceroy by a spanish king cisneros appointed by junta of seville lacked such legitimacy manuel belgrano p 65 liniers refused this proposal as well and handed command to cisneros without resistance belgrano later convinced new viceroy to allow him to edit a new newspaper correo de comercio this allowed him to gather with other revolutionary leaders with excuse of discussing development of newspaper luna p 48 he also supported cisneros when he allowed foreign trade at port previously only spanish ships were allowed but this ruling was strongly rejected by spanish merchants lawyer mariano moreno wrote representation of hacendados an economic essay that convinced cisneros to maintain free foreign trade some historians such as miguel angel scenna suggest that essay was actually belgrano s work or a work by moreno from a draft written by belgrano scenna p 30 belgrano may not have been able to present such a work himself because he held a political office and because his past opposition to cisneros may have risked its rejection scenna p 31 belgrano resigned from his work in consulate in april 1810 and moved to countryside a short time later he received a letter from his friends requesting him to return to buenos aires and join revolutionary movements mario belgrano p 64 may revolution peninsular war was not developing favourably for spain and by may 1810 a ship arrived with news of defeat of seville and disbanding of junta of seville mario belgrano p p 20 without either a recognised spanish king or junta that had appointed cisneros many people thought that viceroy no longer had any authority cisneros tried to conceal news by gathering all newspapers brought by ship but belgrano and castelli managed to get one cisneros then explained european developments to public belgrano and members of carlotist party despite having given up their original idea plotted to remove viceroy and replace him with a junta under advice of cornelio saavedra they waited for news of defeat in spain to take action saavedra p 59 thumb left open cabildo on 22 may 1810 by pedro subercaseaux belgrano and saavedra representing military and intellectuals got an interview with cisneros to request an open cabildo but without getting an answer mario belgrano p 66 cisneros called military leaders and requested their support but they refused under grounds that his viceroyalty lacked legitimacy castelli and other patriots insisted in their request and cisneros finally accepted a massive demonstration following day ensured that cisneros would keep his word open cabildo was held on 22 may with all political leaders present and armed men filling plaza and ready to invade cabildo in case peninsulars attempted a disruption which would be indicated by a signal from belgrano manuel belgrano p 70 he supported stance of his cousin castelli who made a speech explaining concept of retroversion of sovereignty of people and that spanish america was subject to king of spain but not to spain itself at time of voting castelli s proposal was coupled with one of cornelio saavedra with belgrano among its supporters mario belgrano p 67 this joint proposal for removal of cisneros and creation of a government junta prevailed over others however cabildo attempted to keep cisneros in power in spite of this result by creating a junta with cisneros as its president this was rejected by revolutionary leaders and population a great state of turmoil ended when junta was disbanded on 25 may and replaced by primera junta belgrano was included in this junta among many other local politicians in his autobiography belgrano declared that he did not have any previous knowledge of being included in junta and that his appointment took him by surprise nevertheless he accepted role he was part of political line of mariano moreno they were expecting to use government to make big changes in social order one of his first rulings was making of a maths academy located in building of consulate and with purpose of instructing military mario belgrano p p 158 belgrano was appointed its protector he supported banishment of cisneros and members of real audience and execution of liniers and other counter revolutionaries defeated in cordoba some historians suggest that he would have promoted creation of operations plan a secret document written by moreno that set harsh ways for junta to achieve its goals while others consider whole document a literary forgery done by royalists to discredit junta a few others suspect that some paragraphs or whole document may have been result of collaborative writing between moreno belgrano and hipolito vieytes galasso pp 25 48 expedition to paraguay thumb 400px argentine armies heading to paraguay december 1810 march 1811 three months after creation of primera junta manuel belgrano was appointed chief commander of an army sent to gather support at corrientes santa fe paraguay and banda oriental a few days later his goal was made more specific he must aim for paraguay junta had been informed that patriotic party was strong and a small army would suffice to take control luna p 60 trusting this information belgrano went to paraguay with two possible goals get acknowledgment for junta in paraguay or promote a new government that would stay on friendly terms with buenos aires belgrano was unaware that on 24 july a general assembly in paraguay discussed junta of buenos aires and decided to reject it and pledge allegiance to regency council of spain mario belgrano pp 74 75 belgrano headed north with nearly two hundred men expecting to gather more people by end of parana river soldiers from blandengues regiments of san nicolas and santa fe joined them en route and later junta sent reinforcements of another two hundred soldiers army was welcomed by most of population along way receiving donations and new recruits ultimately army was composed of nearly 950 men consisting of infantry and cavalry divided in four divisions with one piece of artillery each luna p belgrano p 83 by end of october army stopped at curuzu cuatia where belgrano solved an old border conflict between corrientes and he set which territories would belong to curuzu cuatia and and organised their urban layout around chapel and school by november army arrived at coast of parana near island and there belgrano took measures to benefit natives that were living in missions with his authority as speaker of junta he gave them full civil and political rights granted lands authorised commerce with united provinces and lifted their restriction on taking public or religious office mario belgrano pp 83 85 however junta requested later that he should seek authorization for such changes in future luna p 65 from that point army moved to candelaria which was used as a stronghold for attack into paraguay terrain gave a clear advantage to paraguayan governor velazco against belgrano parana river nearly wide was an effective natural barrier and once it was crossed patriotic army would have to move a long distance across a land without supplies swamps hills rivers and lakes would force army to march slowly making a possible retreat very difficult parana was crossed with several boats on 19 december and a task force of 54 paraguayan soldiers was forced to flee during battle of campichuelo belgrano saw velazco s army from hill and despite being greatly outnumbered he ordered an attack trusting in moral strength of his soldiers luna p 68 when battle of paraguari started patriots briefly held upper hand but eventually velazco with superior numbers prevailed even with 10 deaths and 120 soldiers taken prisoner belgrano wanted to continue fight but his officials convinced him to retreat mario belgrano pp 87 98 army left for tacuari being closely watched by combined armies of and cabanas those two armies had nearly three thousand soldiers while belgrano had barely four hundred they were attacked from many sides during battle of tacuari on 9 march greatly outnumbered and losing an unequal fight belgrano refused to surrender he reorganised remaining 235 men and ordered his secretary to burn all his documents and personal papers to prevent them from falling into enemy hands belgrano arranged for troops and artillery to fire for many minutes which made paraguayan soldiers disperse when barrage stopped belgrano requested an armistice telling cabanas that he had arrived to paraguay to aid and not to conquer considering open hostility with which he was met he would leave province cabanas accepted on grounds that remaining group must leave province within a day luna p belgrano pp 99 117 campaign to paraguay was a complete military defeat for belgrano however aftermath of conflict led paraguayans to replace with a local junta and declare independence from spain under rule of jose gaspar rodriguez de francia paraguay broke ties with buenos aires as well and stayed isolated for several years afterwards mario belgrano pp 116 pp 77 78 creation of flag of argentina thumb first use of flag of argentina after defeat in tacuari government of buenos aires which by then was first triumvirate issued a series of conflicting orders first they requested he should fight royalists in banda oriental then to return to city and be judged for defeats however no charges were formulated against him mario belgrano pp 118 123 he was appointed as head of regiment of patricians replacing banished cornelio saavedra but troops did not accept him and started braids mutiny after that triumvirate requested that he fortify rosario against possible royalist attacks from banda oriental belgrano created two batteries independencia independence and libertad freedom after realising that both patriots and royalists were fighting under same colours he created cockade of argentina of light blue and white use of which was approved by triumvirate reasons for colours are usually considered to be either loyalty to house of bourbon or his esteem of virgin mary belgrano created a flag with same colours which was hoisted at rosario near parana river on 27 february 1812 on that same day he was appointed to replace pueyrredon in army of north so he travelled to yatasto luna p 77 he found demoralised officials nearly 1 500 soldiers a quarter of them hospitalised minimal artillery and no money some of officials were manuel dorrego gregorio araoz de lamadrid cornelio zelaya jose maria paz diego balcarce and diaz velez cities were much more hostile to army than those that belgrano encountered on his way into paraguay luna p 83 salta was menaced by royalist general jose manuel de goyeneche belgrano had orders to take command and retreat without fighting but he disobeyed luna p 85 he prepared a base at campo santo in salta where he improved hospital and created a military tribunal he later moved to jujuy knowing that he did not have resources to launch an attack on upper peru mario belgrano pp 118 147 thumb left blessing of flag of argentina at jujuy first triumvirate did not approve use of flag created in rosario but belgrano was initially unaware of that he had flag blessed by priest juan ignacio de at salta on second anniversary of may revolution when he found out flag was not approved he put it away when asked he would say that he was keeping it for a great victory luna p 80 three months later royalist general pio tristan advanced in north with more than three thousand men prepared to invade united provinces once again outnumbered by larger armies belgrano organised a great exodus of city of jujuy entire population of city would have to retreat with army and not leave behind anything that might be of value to royalists such as animals crops or housing by september a proper formation of columns provided them with a victory against a royalist task force of 500 men during battle of las piedras first triumvirate commanded belgrano to retreat to cordoba without fighting but he thought that doing so would mean loss of northern provinces thus instead of continuing to cordoba he was convinced by people of san miguel de tucuman to make a stand there his forces had increased by then to nearly 1 800 soldiers still much less than 3 000 at tristan s command even so he obtained a victory in battle of tucuman luna pp 85 86 by that time first triumvirate was replaced by second triumvirate which provided greater support for belgrano second triumvirate called assembly of year xiii soon after taking power which was intended to declare independence and enact a national constitution but failed to do so because of political disputes between members it did not take measures regarding national flag but allowed belgrano to use blue and white flag as flag of army of north thumb battle of salta by aristides papi after defeat in tucuman tristan garrisoned at city of salta with 2 500 men belgrano with reinforcements from government intended to gather 4 000 men and march to upper peru up to border of viceroyalty of lima battle of salta first battle with new approved banner was a decisive victory ending with capitulation of pio tristan and all of his army luna p 90 these victories ensured argentine authority in northwest and stopped royalist advance into central territory although there were a number of colonialist invasions from upper peru until 1821 belgrano s campaign is widely considered decisive one mario belgrano pp 196 197 campaign to upper peru by june 1813 belgrano set up a base in potosi with an army of 2 500 men to prepare an attack on upper peru goyeneche moved to and resigned being replaced by joaquin de la pezuela belgrano administrated zone and tried to revert bad impression left by previous campaign of juan jose castelli luna p 95 belgrano initiated good relations with natives as well belgrano s plan was to attack royalists from front and sides with aid of armies of cardenas and zelaya both armies were near 3 500 men however royalists obtained an important advantage by defeating cardenas and getting possession of his papers which gave them insight into patriotic plans luna p 99 belgrano was taken by surprise at vilcapugio on 1 october and initially gained upper hand against royalist troops who started to flee however when pezuela saw that patriotic armies were not following he reorganised his forces returned to battle and won there were barely 400 survivors belgrano said soldiers we have lost battle after so much fighting victory has betrayed us by going to enemy ranks during our triumph it does not matter flag of nation still swings in our hands luna p 100 after gathering his army at macha where he received reinforcements from cochabamba belgrano was ready for another engagement with pezuela whose troops were not in a better situation on 14 november belgrano was again vanquished by royalists at ayohuma and was forced to withdraw remains of his army towards potosi and from there to jujuy thumb left meeting of belgrano and jose de san martin at yatasto relay second triumvirate reacted by sending jose de san martin to take command of army of north with belgrano as his second in command san martin would reinforce battle weary army of north with his own soldiers luna p 112 hastened by belgrano s illness san martin travelled to rendezvous as quickly as possible they met at yatasto relay in salta luna p 113 belgrano gave san martin full freedom to implement changes and took command of first regiment second triumvirate and later supreme director gervasio posadas requested belgrano to return to buenos aires and be judged for defeats at vilcapugio and ayohuma but san martin refused to send him because of his poor health luna pp 117 119 san martin finally agreed to send belgrano to cordoba by march 1814 luna p 121 he temporarily settled in lujan to await outcome of trial and during this time he wrote his autobiography soon afterwards all charges against belgrano were dismissed as no definite accusation was formulated against him new government trusting in belgrano s diplomatic abilities sent him on a mission to europe to negotiate support for independence of united provinces luna pp 124 125 declaration of independence thumb manuel belgrano holds flag of argentina by 1814 spanish king ferdinand vii had returned to throne and started absolutist restoration which had grave consequences for governments in americas belgrano and bernardino rivadavia were sent to europe to seek support for united provinces from both spain and britain they sought to promote crowning of francisco de paula son of charles iv of spain as regent of united provinces but in end he refused to act against interests of king of spain luna p 129 diplomatic mission failed but belgrano learned of changes in ideology that had taken place in europe since his previous visit with influence of french revolution there had been a great consensus for making republican governments after government of napoleon i monarchies were preferred again but in form of constitutional monarchies such as in britain luna p 133 he also noticed that european powers approved of south american revolutions but approval was compromised when countries started to fall into anarchy when emissaries returned to buenos aires government was worried by defeats of rondeau at sipe sipe and political stir generated by jose gervasio artigas and estanislao lopez alvarez thomas appointed belgrano to head army at rosario but shortly afterwards thomas resigned pueyrredon became new supreme director with signing of santo tome pact aforementioned army was retired from rosario belgrano was then sent back to take command of army of north with strong support of san martin in case of designating who must replace rondeau i am decided for belgrano he is most methodical man of all whom i know in america he is full of integrity and natural talent he may not have military knowledge of a moreau or a bonaparte as far as army is concerned but i think he is best we have in south america luna p 132 belgrano met with congress of tucuman on 6 july 1816 to explain results of his diplomatic mission in europe he thought that enacting a local monarchy would help to prevent anarchy which would not end simply with independence from spain he felt a declaration of independence would be more easily accepted by european powers if it created a monarchic system luna p 134 to this end he formulated inca plan a monarchy ruled by a noble of inca civilisation he thought that this would generate support from indigenous populations as well and repair actions taken against inca by spanish colonisation this proposal was supported by san martin guemes deputies from upper peru and other provinces but it found a strong rejection from buenos aires they would not accept cuzco as capital city luna pp 134 135 on 9 july congress finally signed declaration of independence from spain flag created by belgrano which was being used without a law regulating it was accepted as national flag luna p 135 inca plan was still under discussion but congress delayed it due to several states of emergency in provinces caused by war luna pp 135 137 in august belgrano again took command of army of north but with very limited people and resources he was ordered to avoid trying to advance against royalists in north and was to stay in a defensive state at tucuman with guemes in salta his task was to prevent royalists from moving to south supreme director pueyrredon was supporting an alternative plan designed by jose de san martin create army of andes at cuyo and after making crossing of andes defeat royalists in chile get control of chilean navy and attack royalist stronghold of lima with it luna p 137 last years thumb tomb of manuel belgrano at santo domingo convent in 1819 buenos aires was at war with jose gervasio artigas and estanislao lopez and requested san martin and belgrano to return with their armies to take part in conflict san martin refused to do so but belgrano accepted however before his arrival governors estanislao lopez and juan jose viamonte signed an eight day truce to start peace negotiations belgrano s health was in a very bad state by this point but he refused to resign thinking that morale of army would suffer without his presence he moved to frontier between santa fe and cordoba from where he would be able to move to either litoral or north if needed his health continued to worsen and he was given an unlimited leave from work by supreme director he handed command to fernandez de la cruz and moved to tucuman where he met his daughter manuela monica just one year old governor of tucuman feliciano de la motta was deposed during his stay and belgrano was taken prisoner abraham gonzalez led uprising and attempted to put belgrano into a shrew s fiddle but belgrano s doctor josef redhead objected because of his delicate health and his sentence was changed to simple imprisonment when bernabe araoz took control of government of tucuman belgrano was immediately released mario belgrano pp 341 360 he returned to buenos aires to his parents house by that time battle of cepeda had ended authority of supreme directors starting period known as anarchy of year 20 on 20 june 1820 at age of 50 belgrano died of dropsy due to his poverty as war consumed all his old wealth he paid his doctor with his clock and his carriage some of few possessions he still had as requested he was shrouded into robes of dominican order and buried in santo domingo convent before dying belgrano said ay patria mia in spanish oh my fatherland mario belgrano pp 360 367 due to state of anarchy being experienced by city belgrano s death was largely unnoticed only newspaper of time to note his death was el written by francisco de paula castaneda and there was no government representation at his funeral former students of his educative institutions would arrive in following days with obsequies when news started to be known following year political context was less chaotic and bernardino rivadavia who was minister by then organised a massive state funeral belgranian national institute sus in 1902 during presidency of julio argentino roca belgrano s body was exhumed from atrium of santo domingo to be

modified but not towards a republic as in france or united states but towards a constitutional monarchy like in britain in economic fields he was influenced by principles of physiocracy an economic doctrine that considered that nature was source of wealth as a result much of his works and reform proposals at consulate were oriented towards improving agriculture livestock manufacturing and free trade he maintained a fluent contact with consulates of other cities developing a view of viceroyalty as a whole this led to an increased work in cartography of largely unpopulated areas of territory
