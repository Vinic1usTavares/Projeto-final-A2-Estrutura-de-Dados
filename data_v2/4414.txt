burke and hare murders were a series of 16 killings committed over a period of about ten months in 1828 in edinburgh scotland they were undertaken by william burke and william hare who sold corpses to robert knox for dissection at his anatomy lectures edinburgh was a leading european centre of anatomical study in early 19th century in a time when demand for cadavers led to a shortfall in legal supply scottish law required that corpses used for medical research should only come from those who had died in prison suicide victims or from foundlings and orphans shortage of corpses led to an increase in body snatching by what were known as resurrection men measures to ensure graves were left undisturbed such as use of exacerbated shortage when a lodger in hare s house died hare turned to his friend burke for advice and they decided to sell body to knox they received what was for them generous sum of ps7 10s a little over two months later when hare was concerned that a lodger suffering from fever would deter others from staying in house he and burke murdered her and sold body to knox men continued their murder spree probably with knowledge of their wives burke and hare s actions were uncovered after other lodgers discovered their last victim margaret docherty and contacted police a forensic examination of docherty s body indicated she had probably been suffocated but this could not be proven although police suspected burke and hare of other murders there was no evidence on which they could take action an offer was put to hare granting immunity from prosecution if he turned king s evidence he provided details of docherty s murder and confessed to all 16 deaths formal charges were made against burke and his wife for three murders at subsequent trial burke was found guilty of one murder and sentenced to death case against his wife was found not proven a scottish legal verdict to acquit an individual but not declare them innocent burke was hanged shortly afterwards his corpse was dissected and his skeleton displayed at anatomical museum of edinburgh medical school where as at 2019 it remains murders raised public awareness of need for bodies for medical research and contributed to passing of anatomy act 1832 events have made appearances in literature and been portrayed on screen either in heavily fictionalised accounts or as inspiration for fictional works background anatomy in 19th century edinburgh in early 19th century edinburgh had several pioneering anatomy teachers including alexander monro his son who was also called alexander john bell john goodsir and robert knox all of whom developed subject into a modern science because of their efforts edinburgh became one of leading european centres of anatomical study alongside leiden in netherlands and italian city of padua teaching of anatomy crucial in study of surgery required a sufficient supply of cadavers demand for which increased as science developed scottish law determined that suitable corpses on which to undertake dissections were those who died in prison suicide victims and bodies of foundlings and orphans with rise in prestige and popularity of medical training in edinburgh legal supply of corpses failed to keep pace with demand students lecturers and grave robbers also known as resurrection men began an illicit trade in exhumed cadavers situation was confused by legal position disturbing a grave was a criminal offence as was taking of property from deceased stealing body was not an offence as it did not legally belong to anyone price per corpse changed depending on season it was ps8 during summer when warmer temperatures brought on quicker decomposition and ps10 in winter months when demand by anatomists was greater because colder temperatures meant they could store corpses longer so they undertook more dissections by 1820s residents of edinburgh had taken to streets to protest at increase in grave robbing to avoid corpses being disinterred bereaved families used several techniques in order to deter thieves guards were hired to watch graves and watchtowers were built in several cemeteries some families hired a large stone slab that could be placed over a grave for a short period until body had begun to decay past point of being useful for an anatomist other families used a an iron cage that surrounded coffin high levels of vigilance from public and techniques used to deter grave robbers led to what historian ruth richardson describes as a growing atmosphere of crisis among anatomists because of shortage of corpses historian tim marshall considers situation meant burke and hare took to its logical conclusion instead of digging up dead they accepted lucrative incentives to destroy living dr robert knox thumb upright dr robert knox knox was an anatomist who had qualified as a doctor in 1814 after contracting smallpox as a child he was blind in one eye and badly disfigured he undertook service as an army physician at battle of waterloo in 1815 followed by a posting in england and then during cape frontier war 1819 in southern africa he eventually settled in his home town of edinburgh in 1820 in 1825 he became a fellow of royal college of surgeons of edinburgh where he lectured on anatomy he undertook dissections twice a day and his advertising promised a full demonstration on fresh anatomical subjects as part of every course of lectures he delivered he stated that his lessons drew over 400 pupils clare taylor his biographer in dictionary of national biography observes that he built up a formidable reputation as a teacher and lecturer and almost single handedly raised profile of study of anatomy in britain another biographer isobel rae considers that without knox study of anatomy in britain might not have progressed as it did william burke and william hare alt facial reconstruction of william burke thumb upright facial reconstruction of william burke left william burke was born in 1792 in county tyrone ireland one of two sons to middle class parents burke along with his brother constantine had a comfortable upbringing and both joined british army as teenagers burke served in donegal militia until he met and married a woman from county mayo where they later settled marriage was short lived in 1818 after an argument with his father in law over land ownership burke deserted his wife and family he moved to scotland and became a labourer working on union canal he settled in small village of near falkirk and set up home with helen mcdougal whom he affectionately nicknamed nelly she became his second wife after a few years and when works on canal were finished couple moved to tanners close edinburgh in november 1827 they became hawkers selling second hand clothes to impoverished locals burke then became a cobbler a trade in which he experienced some success earning upwards of ps1 a week he became known locally as an industrious and good humoured man who often entertained his clients by singing and dancing to them on their doorsteps while plying his trade although raised as a roman catholic burke became a regular worshipper at presbyterian religious meetings held in grassmarket he was seldom seen without a bible thumb upright death mask of burke left and life mask of hare right william hare was probably born in county armagh county londonderry or in newry his age and year of birth are unknown when arrested in 1828 he gave his age as 21 but one source states that he was born between 1792 and 1804 information on his earlier life is scant although it is possible that he worked in ireland as an agricultural labourer before travelling to britain he worked on union canal for seven years before moving to edinburgh in mid 1820s where he worked as a coal man s assistant he lodged at tanner s close in house of a man named logue and his wife margaret laird in nearby west port area of town when logue died in 1826 hare may have married margaret based on contemporary accounts brian bailey in his history of murders describes hare as illiterate and uncouth a lean quarrelsome violent and amoral character with scars from old wounds about his head and brow bailey describes margaret who was also an irish immigrant as a hard featured and debauched virago in 1827 burke and mcdougal went to penicuik in midlothian to work on harvest where they met hare men became friends when burke and mcdougal returned to edinburgh they moved into hare s tanner s close lodging house where two couples soon acquired a reputation for hard drinking and boisterous behaviour events of november 1827 to november 1828 on 29 november 1827 donald a lodger in hare s house died of dropsy shortly before receiving a quarterly army pension while owing ps4 of back rent after hare bemoaned his financial loss to burke pair decided to sell donald s body to one of local anatomists a carpenter provided a coffin for a burial which was to be paid for by local parish after he left pair opened coffin removed body which they hid under bed filled coffin with bark from a local tanners and resealed it after dark on day coffin was removed for burial they took corpse to edinburgh university where they looked for a purchaser according to burke s later testimony they asked for directions to professor monro but a student sent them to knox s premises in surgeon s square although men dealt with juniors when discussing possibility of selling body it was knox who arrived to fix price at ps7 10s hare received ps4 5s while burke took balance of ps3 5s hare s larger share was to cover his loss from donald s unpaid rent according to burke s official confession as he and hare left university one of knox s assistants told them that anatomists would be glad to see them again when they had another to dispose of there is no agreement as to order in which murders took place burke made two confessions but gave different sequences for murders in each statement first was an official one given on 3 january 1829 to sheriff substitute procurator fiscal and assistant sheriff clerk second was in form of an interview with edinburgh courant that was published on 7 february 1829 these in turn differed from order given in hare s statement although pair were agreed on many of points of murders contemporary reports also differ from confessions of two men more recent sources including accounts written by brian bailey lisa rosner and owen dudley edwards either follow one of historic versions or present their own order of events most of sources agree that first murder in january or february 1828 was either that of a miller named joseph lodging in hare s house or abigail simpson a salt seller historian lisa rosner considers joseph more likely a pillow was used to smother victim while later ones were suffocated by a hand over nose and mouth novelist sir walter scott who took a keen interest in case also thought miller was more likely first victim and highlighted that there was an additional motive to reconcile them to deed as joseph was suffering from a fever and had become delirious hare and his wife were concerned that having a potentially infectious lodger would be bad for business hare again turned to burke and after providing their victim with whisky hare suffocated joseph while burke lay across upper torso to restrict movement they again took corpse to knox who this time paid ps10 rosner considers method of murder to be ingenious burke s weight on victim stifled movement and thus ability to make noise while it also prevented chest from expanding should any air get past hare s suffocating grip in rosner s opinion method would have been practically undetectable until era of modern forensics order of two victims next after joseph is also unclear rosner puts sequence as abigail simpson followed by an english male lodger from cheshire while bailey and dudley edwards each have order as english male lodger followed by simpson unnamed englishman was a travelling seller of matches and tinder who fell ill with jaundice at hare s lodging house as with joseph hare was concerned with effect this illness might have on his business and he and burke employed same modus operandi they had with miller hare suffocating their victim while burke lay over body to stop movement and noise simpson was a pensioner who lived in nearby village of gilmerton and visited edinburgh to supplement her pension by selling salt on 12 february 1828 only exact date burke quoted in his confession she was invited into hares house and plied with enough alcohol to ensure she was too drunk to return home after murdering her burke and hare placed body in a tea chest and sold it to knox they received ps10 for each body and burke s confession records of simpson s body that dr knox approved of its being so fresh but he did not ask any questions in either february or march that year an old woman was invited into house by margaret hare she gave her enough whisky to fall asleep and when hare returned that afternoon he covered sleeping woman s mouth and nose with bed tick a stiff mattress cover and left her she was dead by nightfall and burke joined his companion to transport corpse to knox who paid another ps10 thumb upright mary paterson killed by burke while she was intoxicated burke met two women in early april mary paterson also known as mary mitchell and janet brown in canongate area of edinburgh he bought two women alcohol before inviting them back to his lodging for breakfast three left tavern with two bottles of whisky and went instead to his brother s house after his brother left for work burke and women finished whisky and paterson fell asleep at table burke and brown continued talking but were interrupted by mcdougal who accused them of having an affair a row broke out between burke and mcdougal during which he threw a glass at her cutting her over eye brown stated that she did not know burke was married and left mcdougal also left and went to fetch hare and his wife they arrived shortly afterwards and two men locked their wives out of room then murdered paterson in her sleep that afternoon pair took body to knox in a tea chest while mcdougal kept paterson s skirt and petticoats they were paid ps8 for corpse which was still warm when they delivered it fergusson one of knox s assistants asked where they had obtained body as he thought he recognised her burke explained that girl had drunk herself to death and they had purchased it from an old woman in canongate knox was delighted with corpse and stored it in whisky for three months before dissecting it when brown later searched for her friend she was told that she had left for glasgow with a travelling salesman at some point in early to mid 1828 a mrs haldane whom burke described as a stout old woman lodged at hare s premises after she became drunk she fell asleep in stable she was smothered and sold to knox several months later haldane s daughter either called margaret or peggy also lodged at hare s house she and burke drank together heavily and he killed her without hare s assistance her body was put into a tea chest and taken to knox where burke was paid ps8 next murder occurred in may 1828 when an old woman joined house as a lodger one evening while she was intoxicated burke smothered her hare was not present in house at time her body was sold to knox for ps10 then came murder of effy sometimes spelt effie a cinder gatherer who scavenged through bins and rubbish tips to sell her findings effy was known to burke and had previously sold him scraps of leather for his cobbling business burke tempted her into stable with whisky and when she was drunk enough he and hare killed her knox gave ps10 for body another victim was found by burke too drunk to stand she was being helped by a local constable back to her lodgings when burke offered to take her there himself policeman obliged and burke took her back to hare s house where she was killed her corpse raised a further ps10 from knox burke and hare murdered two lodgers in june an old woman and a dumb boy her grandson as burke later recalled in his confession while boy sat by fire in kitchen his grandmother was murdered in bedroom by usual method burke and hare then picked up boy and carried him to same room where he was also killed burke later said that this was murder that disturbed him most as he was haunted by his recollection of boy s expression tea chest that was usually used by couple to transport bodies was found to be too small so bodies were forced into a herring barrel and taken to surgeons square where they fetched ps8 each according to burke s confession barrel was loaded onto a cart which hare s horse refused to pull further than grassmarket hare called a porter with a handcart to help him transport container once back in tanner s close hare took his anger out on horse by shooting it dead in yard on 24 june burke and mcdougal departed for falkirk to visit latter s father burke knew that hare was short of cash and had even pawned some of his clothes when couple returned they found that hare was wearing new clothes and had surplus money after he was asked hare denied that he had sold another body burke checked with knox who confirmed hare had sold a woman s body for ps8 it led to an argument between two men and they came to blows burke and his wife moved into home of his cousin john broggan or brogan two streets away from tanner s close breach between two men did not last long in late september or early october hare was visiting burke when mrs ostler also given as hostler a washerwoman came to property to do laundry men got her drunk and killed her corpse was with knox that afternoon for which men received ps8 a week or two later one of mcdougal s relatives ann dougal also given as mcdougal was visiting from falkirk after a few days men killed her by their usual technique and received ps10 for body burke later claimed that about this time margaret hare suggested killing helen mcdougal on grounds that they could not trust her as she was a scotch woman but he refused burke and hare s next victim was a familiar figure in streets of edinburgh james wilson an 18 year old man with a limp caused by deformed feet he was mentally disabled and according to alanna knight in her history of murders was inoffensive he was known locally as daft jamie wilson lived on streets and supported himself by begging in november hare lured wilson to his lodgings with promise of whisky and sent his wife to fetch burke two murderers led wilson into a bedroom door of which margaret hare locked before pushing key back under door as wilson did not like excess whisky he preferred snuff he was not as drunk as most of duo s victims he was also strong and fought back against two attackers but was overpowered and killed in normal way his body was stripped and his few possessions stolen burke kept a snuff box and hare a snuff spoon when body was examined following day by knox and his students several of them recognised it to be wilson but knox denied it could be anyone students knew when word started circulating that wilson was missing knox dissected body ahead of others that were being held in storage head and feet were removed before main dissection upright 1 2 thumb idealised etching of burke murdering margaret docherty also known as margery campbell by robert seymour final victim killed on 31 october 1828 was margaret docherty a middle aged irish woman burke lured her into broggan lodging house by claiming that his mother was also a docherty from same area of ireland and pair began drinking at one point burke left docherty in company of helen mcdougal while he went out ostensibly to buy more whisky but actually to get hare two other lodgers ann and james gray were an inconvenience to men so they paid them to stay at hare s lodging for night claiming docherty was a relative drinking continued into evening by which time margaret hare had joined in at around 9 00 pm grays returned briefly to collect some clothing for their children and saw burke hare their wives and docherty all drunk singing and dancing although burke and hare came to blows at some point in evening they subsequently murdered docherty and put her body in a pile of straw at end of bed next day grays returned and ann became suspicious when burke would not let her approach a bed where she had left her stockings when they were left alone in house in early evening grays searched straw and found docherty s body showing blood and saliva on face on their way to alert police they ran into mcdougal who tried to bribe them with an offer of ps10 a week they refused while grays reported murder to police burke and hare removed body and took it to knox s surgery police search located docherty s bloodstained clothing hidden under bed burke and his wife gave different times for docherty s departure from house which raised enough suspicion for police to take them in for questioning early following morning police went to knox s dissecting rooms where they found docherty s body james gray identified her as woman he had seen with burke and hare hare and his wife were arrested that day as was broggan all denied any knowledge of events in total 16 people were murdered by burke and hare burke stated later that he and hare were generally in a state of intoxication when murders were carried out and that he could not sleep at night without a bottle of whisky by his bedside and a twopenny candle to burn all night beside him when he awoke he would take a drink from bottle sometimes half a bottle at a draught and that would make him sleep he also took opium to ease his conscience developments investigation and path to court thumb upright robert christison who undertook forensic examination on margaret docherty on 3 november 1828 a warrant was issued for detention of burke hare and their wives broggan was released without further action four suspects were kept apart and statements taken these conflicted with initial answers given on day of their arrests after dr alexander black a police surgeon examined docherty s body two forensic specialists were appointed robert christison and william newbigging they reported that it was probable victim had been murdered by suffocation but this could not be medically proven on basis of report from two doctors burkes and hares were charged with murder as part of his investigation christison interviewed knox who asserted that burke and hare had watched poor lodging houses in edinburgh and purchased bodies before anyone claimed them for burial christison thought knox was deficient in principle and heart but did not think he had broken law although police were sure murder had taken place and that at least one of four was guilty they were uncertain whether they could secure a conviction police also suspected there had been other murders committed but lack of bodies hampered this line of enquiry as news of possibility of other murders came to public s attention newspapers began to publish lurid and inaccurate stories of crimes speculative reports led members of public to assume that all missing people had been victims janet brown went to police and identified her friend mary paterson s clothing while a local baker informed them that jamie wilson s trousers were being worn by constantine burke s son on 19 november a warrant for murder of jamie wilson was made against four suspects sir william rae lord advocate followed a regular technique he focused on one individual to extract a confession on which others could be convicted hare was chosen and on 1 december he was offered immunity from prosecution if he turned king s evidence and provided full details of murder of docherty and any other because he could not be brought to testify against his wife she was also exempt from prosecution hare made a full confession of all deaths and rae decided sufficient evidence existed to secure a prosecution on 4 december formal charges were laid against burke and mcdougal for murders of mary paterson james wilson and mrs docherty thumb upright 1 15 statement by burke in january 1829 to edinburgh courant docter knox never him taught or him to murder any person knox faced no charges for murders because burke s statement to police exonerated surgeon public awareness of news grew as newspapers and broadsides began releasing further details opinion was against doctor and according to bailey many in edinburgh thought he was a sinister ringmaster who got burke and hare dancing to his tune several broadsides were published with editorials stating that he should have been in dock alongside murderers which influenced public opinion a new word was coined from murders burking to smother a victim or to commit an anatomy murder and a rhyme began circulating around streets of edinburgh trial trial began at 10 00 am on christmas eve 1828 before high court of justiciary in edinburgh s parliament house case was heard by lord justice clerk david boyle supported by lords meadowbank and mackenzie court was full shortly after doors were opened at 9 00 am and a large crowd gathered outside parliament house 300 constables were on duty to prevent disturbances while infantry and cavalry were on standby as a further precaution case ran through day and night to following morning rosner notes that even a formal postponement of case for dinner could have raised questions about validity of trial when charges were read out two defence counsels objected to mcdougal and burke being tried together james moncrieff burke s defence lawyer protested that his client was charged with three unconnected murders committed each at a different time and at a different place in a trial with another defendant who is not even alleged to have had any concern with two of offences of which he is accused several hours were spent on legal arguments about objection judge decided that to ensure a fair trial indictment should be split into separate charges for three murders he gave rae choice as to which should be heard first rae opted for murder of docherty given they had corpse and strongest evidence in early afternoon burke and mcdougal pleaded not guilty to murder of docherty first witnesses were then called from a list of 55 that included hare and knox not all witnesses on list were called and knox with three of his assistants avoided being questioned in court one of knox s assistants david paterson who had been main person burke and hare had dealt with at knox s surgery was called and confirmed pair had supplied doctor with several corpses in early evening hare took stand to give evidence under cross examination about murder of docherty hare claimed burke had been sole murderer and mcdougal had twice been involved by bringing docherty back to house after she had run out hare stated that he had assisted burke in delivery of body to knox although he was asked about other murders he was not obliged to answer questions as charge related only to death of docherty after hare s questioning his wife entered witness box carrying their baby daughter who was suffering from whooping cough margaret used child s coughing fits as a way to give herself thinking time for some of questions and told court that she had a very poor memory and could not remember many of events final prosecution witnesses were two doctors black and christison both said they suspected foul play but that there was no forensic evidence to support suggestion of murder there were no witnesses called for defence although pre trial declarations by burke and mcdougal were read out in their place prosecution summed up their case after which at 3 00 am burke s defence lawyer began his final statement which lasted for two hours mcdougal s defence lawyer began his address to jury on his client s behalf at 5 00 am boyle then gave his summing up directing jury to accept arguments of prosecution jury retired to consider its verdict at 8 30 am on christmas day and returned fifty minutes later it delivered a guilty verdict against burke for murder of docherty same charge against mcdougal they found not proven as he passed death sentence against burke boyle told him aftermath including execution and dissection thumb burke s execution from a contemporary print mcdougal was released at end of trial and returned home following day she went to buy whisky and was confronted by a mob who were angry at not proven verdict she was taken to a police building in nearby for her own protection but after mob laid siege to it she escaped through a back window to main police station off edinburgh s high street she tried to see burke but permission was refused she left edinburgh next day and there are no clear accounts of her later life on 3 january 1829 on advice of both catholic priests and presbyterian clergy burke made another confession this was more detailed than official one provided prior to his trial he placed much of blame for murders on hare on 16 january 1829 a petition on behalf of james wilson s mother and sister protesting against hare s immunity and intended release from prison was given lengthy consideration by high court of justiciary and rejected by a vote of 4 to 2 margaret hare was released on 19 january and travelled to glasgow to find a passage back to ireland while waiting for a ship she was recognised and attacked by a mob she was given shelter in a police station before being given a police escort onto a belfast bound vessel no clear accounts exist of what became of her after she landed in ireland

hired at prices ranging from 5 to 20 shillings on 1 february his corpse was publicly dissected by professor monro in anatomy theatre of university s old college police had to be called when large numbers of students gathered demanding access to lecture for which a limited number of tickets had been issued a minor riot ensued calm was restored only after one of university professors negotiated with crowd that they would be allowed to pass through theatre in batches of fifty after dissection during procedure which lasted for two hours monro dipped his quill pen into burke s blood and wrote this is written with blood of wm burke who was hanged at edinburgh this blood was taken from his head burke s skeleton was given to anatomical museum of edinburgh medical school where as at 2018 it remains his death mask and a book said to be bound with his tanned skin can be seen at surgeons hall museum hare was released on 5 february 1829 his extended stay in custody had been undertaken for his own protection and was assisted in leaving edinburgh in disguise by to dumfries at one of its stops he was recognised by a fellow passenger erskine douglas sandford a junior counsel who had represented wilson s family sandford informed his fellow passengers of hare s identity on arrival in dumfries news of hare s presence spread and a large crowd gathered at hostelry where he was due to stay night police arrived and arranged for a decoy coach to draw off crowd while hare escaped through a back window and into a carriage which took him to town s prison for safekeeping a crowd surrounded building stones were thrown at door and windows and street lamps were smashed before 100 special constables arrived to restore order in small hours of morning escorted by a sheriff officer and militia guard hare was taken out of town set down on annan road and instructed to make his way to english border there were no subsequent reliable sightings of him and his eventual fate is unknown thumb upright caricature of knox harvesting corpses knox refused to make any public statements about his dealings with burke and hare common thought in edinburgh was that he was culpable in events he was lampooned in caricature and in february a crowd gathered outside his house and burned an effigy of him a committee of inquiry cleared him of complicity and reported that they had seen no evidence that dr knox or his assistants knew that murder was committed in procuring any of subjects brought to his rooms he resigned from his position as curator of college of surgeons museum and was gradually excluded from university life by his peers he left edinburgh in 1842 and lectured in britain and mainland europe while working in london he fell foul of regulations of royal college of surgeons and was debarred from lecturing he was removed from roll of fellows of royal society of edinburgh in 1848 from 1856 he worked as a pathological anatomist at brompton cancer hospital and had a medical practice in hackney until his death in 1862 legacy legislation thumb left calling card case made of burke s skin question of supply of cadavers for scientific research had been promoted by english philosopher jeremy bentham before crimes of burke and hare took place a parliamentary select committee had drafted a bill for preventing unlawful disinterment of human bodies and for regulating schools of anatomy in mid 1828 six months before murders were detected this was rejected in 1829 by house of lords murders committed by burke and hare raised public awareness of need for bodies for medical purposes and of trade that doctors had conducted with grave robbers and murderers east london murder of a 14 year old boy and subsequent attempt to sell corpse to medical school at king s college london led to an investigation of london who had recently turned from grave robbing to murder to obtain corpses two men were hanged in december 1831 for crime a bill was quickly introduced into parliament and gained royal assent nine months later to become anatomy act 1832 this act authorised dissection on bodies from workhouses unclaimed after 48 hours and ended practice of as part of
