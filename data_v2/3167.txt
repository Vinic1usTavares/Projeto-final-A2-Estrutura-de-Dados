grave circle a is a 16th century bc royal cemetery situated to south of lion gate main entrance of bronze age citadel of mycenae in southern greece this burial complex was initially constructed outside walls of mycenae and ultimately enclosed in acropolis when fortification was extended during 13th century bc grave circle a and grave circle b latter found outside walls of mycenae represents one of significant characteristics of early phase of mycenaean civilization site circle has a diameter of 27 5 m and contains six shaft graves largest of shaft graves measures about 6 5 m 21 ft 3 in in length and about 4 1 m 13 ft 6 in in width a total of nineteen bodies of men women and children buried here with two to five bodies per shaft it has been suggested that a mound was constructed over each grave and funeral stelae were erected among funerary gifts found were a series of gold death masks full sets of weapons ornate staffs gold jewelry as well as gold and silver cups funerary gifts found here are more precious than that of those at grave circle b site was excavated by archaeologist heinrich schliemann in 1876 following descriptions of homer and pausanias one of five gold death masks he unearthed became known as death mask of agamemnon ruler of mycenae of greek mythology however it has been proved that burials date circa three centuries earlier before agamemnon is supposed to have lived valuable funerary gifts in graves suggest that powerful rulers were buried in this site although agamemnon was supposed to have lived centuries later these graves might have belonged to former ruling dynasty of mycenae in greek mythology in later greek mythology mycenae had a period where two kings ruled and archeologists have suggested that these dual graves may correspond to both kings background thumb model of mycenae grave circle a is located on upper left of main entrance during end of 3rd millennium bc circa 2200 bc indigenous inhabitants of mainland greece underwent a cultural transformation attributed to climate change local events and developments i e destruction of house of tiles as well as to continuous contacts with various areas such as western asia minor cyclades albania and dalmatia these bronze age people were equipped with horses surrounded themselves with luxury goods and constructed elaborate shaft graves acropolis of mycenae one of leading centers of mycenaean culture located in argolis northeast peloponnese was built on a defensive hill at an elevation of 128 m 420 ft and covers an area of 30 000 m2 320 000 sq ft shaft graves found in mycenae signified elevation of a new greek speaking royal dynasty whose economic power depended on long distance sea trade mycenaean civilization appeared rather suddenly with construction of spectacular royal shaft graves at mycenae dated about 1650 bce about same time as rise of hittite empire in anatolia shaft graves with their golden death masks swords spears and images of men in chariots signified elevation of a new greek speaking dynasty of unprecedented wealth whose economic power depended on long distance sea trade grave circles a and b latter found outside walls of mycenae represents one of significant characteristics of early phase of mycenaean civilization history mycenaean shaft graves are essentially an argive variant of middle helladic funerary tradition with features derived from early bronze age developed locally in mainland greece grave circle a formed circa 1600 bc as a new elite burial place was probably first restricted to men and seems to be a continuation of earlier grave circle b and correlates with general social trend of higher burial investment taking place throughout entire greece that time grave circle a site was part of a more significant funeral place from middle helladic period during late helladic i 1600 bc there might have been a small unfortified palace on mycenae while mycenaean ruling family graves remained outside city walls there is no evidence of a circular wall around site during period of burials last interment took place circa 1500 bc immediately after last interment local rulers abandoned shaft graves in favor of a new and more imposing form of tomb already developing in messenia south around 1250 bc when fortifications of mycenae were extended grave circle was included inside new wall a double ring wall was also built around area it appears that site became a temenos sacred precinct while a circular construction possibly an altar was found above one grave burial site had been as a monument an attempt by 13th century bc mycenean rulers to appropriate possible heroic past of older ruling dynasty under this context land was constructed to create a level precinct for ceremonies and re erected stelae a new entrance lion gate was constructed near site findings grave circle a with a diameter of 27 5 m 90 ft is situated on acropolis of mycenae southeast of lion gate grave circle contains six shaft graves smallest of which is measured at 3 0 m by 3 5 m and largest measured at 4 50 m by 6 40 m depth of each shaft grave ranges from 1 0 m to 4 0 m over each grave a mound was constructed and stelae were erected these stelae had been probably erected in memory of mycenaean rulers buried there three of them depict chariot scenes a total of nineteen bodies eight men nine women and two children were found in shafts shafts contained two to five bodies each except for grave ii which was a single burial between graves iv and v five golden masks were unearthed including mask of agamemnon found in grave v boars tusks were found in grave iv additionally gold and silver cups were discovered including nestor s cup and silver siege rhyton several gold rings buttons and bracelets were also found most of graves were equipped with full sets of weapons especially swords and figural depictions of objects show fighting and hunting scenes gender of those entombed here were distinguished based on grave goods that they were buried with them men were found with weapons while women received jewelry many objects were designed to signify social ranking of deceased for instance decorated daggers which were art objects and cannot be considered real weapons ornate staffs as well as a scepter from grave iv clearly indicate a very significant status of deceased items such as bulls heads with a double axe display clear minoan influences at time that grave circle was built had not yet conquered minoan crete although it seems that they recognized minoans as providers of finest design and craftsmanship most of objects buried in grave circle a were decorated in minoan style on other hand specific motifs such as fighting and hunting scenes are clearly of mycenaean style combination of luxury goods found at this site represented many different societies of time this was an example of an international style which means countries would use basic technology of one society and modify it to fit standard imagery of their society excavations site of mycenae was first in greece to be subjected to a modern archaeological excavation german archaeologist heinrich schliemann excavated it in 1876 schliemann inspired by homer s descriptions in iliad in which mycenae is termed abounding in gold began digging there he was also following accounts of ancient geographer pausanias who described once prosperous site and mentioned that according to a local tradition during 2nd century ad grave of agamemnon included his followers his charioteer eurymedon and two children of cassandra all of whom were buried within citadel what schliemann discovered in his excavation satisfied both his opinion of homer s historical accuracy and his craving for valuable treasures among objects he unearthed in grave circle a was a series of gold death masks including one he proclaimed death mask of agamemnon schliemann cleared five shafts and recognized them as graves mentioned by pausanias he stopped after fifth grave was excavated entirely believing that he had finished exploring grave circle however a year later panagiotis found a sixth shaft grave it has since been demonstrated that burials in grave circle a date from 16th century bc before traditional time of trojan war 13th 12th century bc in which agamemnon is supposed to have participated see also grave
