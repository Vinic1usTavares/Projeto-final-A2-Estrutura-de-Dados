new england in gridiron football safety american football or safety touch canadian football is a scoring play that results in two points being awarded to scoring team safeties can be scored in a number of ways such as when a ball carrier is tackled in his own end zone or when a foul is committed by offense in their own end zone after a safety is scored in american football ball is kicked off to team that scored safety from 20 yard line in canadian football scoring team also has options of taking control of ball at their own 35 yard line or kicking off ball also at their own 35 yard line ability of scoring team to receive ball through a kickoff differs from touchdown and field goal which require scoring team to kick ball off to scored upon team despite being of relatively low point value safeties can have a significant impact on result of games and brian burke of advanced nfl stats estimated that safeties have a greater abstract value than field goals despite being worth a point less due to field position and reclaimed possession gained off safety kick safeties are least common method of scoring in american football but are not rare occurrences since 1932 a safety has occurred once every 14 31 games in national football league nfl or about once a week under current scheduling rules a much rarer occurrence is one point safety which can be scored by offense on an extra point or two point conversion attempt those have occurred at least twice in ncaa division i football since 1996 most recently at 2013 fiesta bowl no conversion safeties have occurred since at least 1940 in nfl a conversion safety by defense is also possible though highly unlikely although this has never occurred it is only possible way a team could finish with a single point in an american football game scoring a safety american football in american football a safety is scored when any of following conditions occur nfl rules 2018 rule 11 scoring section 5 safety p 44 ncaa rules 2011

or as direct result of a blocked scrimmage kick ball carrier is penalized for intentional grounding or an offside pass in his own goal area resuming play after a safety american football after a safety is scored ball is put into play by a free kick team that was scored upon must kick ball from their own 20 yard line and can punt drop kick or place kick ball in professional play a kicking tee cannot be used however a tee can be used in high school or college football once ball has been kicked it can be caught and advanced by any member of receiving team and it can be recovered by kicking team if ball travels at least 10 yards or a player of receiving team touches ball nfl rules 2018 rule 6 free kicks pp 23 25 nfhs rules 2012 pp 15 46 52 53 canadian football after scoring a safety touch scoring team has option of taking control of ball and beginning play from their own 35 yard line kicking ball off from their 35 yard line or accepting a kickoff from 25 yard line of team that conceded score cfl rules 2011 p 29 if a kickoff is chosen it must be a place kick and ball can be held placed on ground or placed on a tee prior to kick as in american football ball must go at least ten yards before it can be recovered by kicking team cfl rules 2011 pp 36 39 elective safeties in american football intentionally conceded safeties are an uncommon strategy teams have utilized elective safeties to gain field position for a punt when pinned deep in their own territory and when ahead near end of a game to run down clock so as to deny other team a chance to force a turnover or return a punt teams have also taken intentional safeties by kicking a loose ball out back of their end zone with intent of preventing defense from scoring a touchdown elective safeties are more common in canadian football where they can result in better field position than a punt 2010 edmonton eskimos surrendered a canadian football league cfl record 14 safeties a factor that led cfl reporter jim mullin to suggest increasing value of safety touch from two to three points as a deterrent conversion safeties one point safeties scored by offense in american football if a team attempting an extra point or two point conversion officially known in rulebooks as a try scores what would normally be a safety that attempting team is awarded one point nfl rules 2018 rule 11 scoring section 3 try p 42 ncaa rules 2011 2012 pp 77 79 nfhs rules 2012 pp 65 66 this is commonly known as a conversion safety or one point safety there are at least two known occurrences of conversion safety in division i college football a november 26 2004 game in which texas scored against texas a m and 2013 fiesta bowl in which oregon scored against kansas state in both games point after touchdown kick was blocked and recovered by defense which then fumbled or threw ball back into its own end zone there are also at least two known ncaa division iii occurrences first being on november 11 2000 against st thomas minnesota and hamline university and most recent against bluffton university and franklin college indiana which took place on november 9 2013 no conversion safeties have been scored in nfl since 1940 although it is now slightly more likely after rule change in 2015 which allowed defense to take possession and score on a conversion attempt before 2015 only scenario in which a one point safety could have been scored in nfl would have involved defense kicking or batting a loose ball out back of its own end zone without taking possession of ball scored by defense a conversion safety can also be scored by defense though this has never occurred to accomplish this team attempting try would need to somehow be forced 98 yards back to their own end zone in theory such a scenario might in college or nfl involve a turnover on a two point conversion attempt followed by a defensive player fumbling while en route to attempting team s end zone with attempting team finally recovering ball and downing it in their own end zone while such a conversion safety has never been scored by defense it is only possible way under current rules in which a team could finish with a single point in an american football game only way such a defensive conversion safety could be scored at high school level is if offense itself retreated all way back to its own end zone without allowing defense to ever gain possession of ball which in high school football ends conversion attempt see also list of safety records touchback own goal notes footnotes citations references external links 1 point safety
