purchase land suitable for settlement in late 1839 tory arrived in what became known as wellington service with new zealand company thumb right a sketch by heaphy of maori chieftain te rauparaha heaphy s contract with company was for three years and his primary role was to create art that could be used as advertising for company in doing so he travelled extensively around country and occasionally participated in overland treks living out of a tent or staying with local maori he also sailed around parts of country aboard tory and learned surveying from its captain another employee of company travelling on tory was ernst dieffenbach who taught heaphy basic geology heaphy painted a variety of subjects including landscapes flora and fauna and notable maori including chieftain te rauparaha success of company depended on attracting emigrants to new zealand so his work was almost always intended to present country and its inhabitants in its best light heaphy was at times exposed to some danger on an expedition to chatham islands his party intervened in a skirmish between two warring tribes and he was wounded in leg it was unlikely to have been a serious wound for a few weeks later he went on a trek back in new zealand to taranaki region where he produced some of his more notable landscapes from october 1840 heaphy was based in wellington and with a friend built a small cottage that allowed him to execute several views of wellington harbour which was much used in advertising for new zealand company a few months later in early 1841 he joined arthur wakefield on expedition that led to founding of nelson heaphy was among several employees of new zealand company to scout area around tasman bay before location for nelson was decided and executed several paintings highlighting quality of land intended for settlement by late 1841 heaphy s services as an artist were no longer required given number of works that he had produced and wakefield decided to send him to london to make a report to company directors he took nearly six months to reach london by which time his three year contract had expired directors were impressed with his report and it was published as a book entitled narrative of a residence in various parts of new zealand thumb right a view of wellington harbour executed by heaphy in 1841 life in nelson although no longer employed by new zealand company heaphy emboldened by success of his report and public reception to his paintings sought further opportunities for similar work from london he wrote to company secretary seeking support for exploration of area inland of nelson response was unenthusiastic company was concentrating on developing its settlements rather than undertaking in further exploration of country despite this heaphy returned to new zealand and arrived in nelson on 22 december 1842 there was little in way of work opportunities for heaphy in nelson and he based himself in motueka here he farmed land with a friend frederick moore and this took much of what little funds he had his farming venture was hard work and not particularly successful by late 1843 new zealand company was in need of good pastoral land around nelson it had clashed with maori in wairau affray in wairau valley to south east of nelson and several company employees including arthur wakefield were killed company needed to scout area to south west and heaphy finally got chance to explore wakefield s replacement as resident agent in nelson for new zealand company william fox was a keen advocate of expansion for settlement in area around nelson fox authorised heaphy and a surveyor to scout south west to buller river in november 1843 in a subsequent expedition undertaken following month heaphy and two maori trekked to what is now known as golden bay and returned to motueka via coast a journey which he regarded as most difficult he had undertaken at time both expeditions failed to locate suitable land for settlement as did an expedition back to buller river in march 1845 heaphy was reasonably well compensated for his exploration efforts and for additional funds he undertook art commissions for nelson s more wealthy residents thumb left william fox s painting of a scene from his february 1846 expedition with heaphy and thomas brunner heaphy and brunner rest in front of a crude hut while expedition s maori guide kehu snares a weka with a lure of food on a stick and a long pole with a noose in february 1846 heaphy accompanied by fox and thomas brunner another employee of new zealand company as well as a maori named kehu undertook another expedition to south west difficult terrain faced them high mountain ranges topped with snow and ice steep bush numerous rivers and gorges food sources included roots and berries birds could be snared and eels caught from streams along coast shellfish and gull eggs added to diet party each carrying a load of trekked to buller river and walked its banks as far as maruia river here believing themselves to be only from coast dwindling provisions prevented them proceeding to mouth of buller river guided by kehu party traversed hope saddle on their way back to nelson which they reached on 1 march heaphy and brunner were keen for further exploration and with kehu left nelson on 17 march 1846 to scout along west coast to mouth of buller expedition traced western coast of south island as far south as arahura river their journey began from golden bay and they made their way to west wanganui where etau a local maori was hired as a porter local chief barred their journey south but heaphy and brunner mollified him with some tobacco they continued along coast climbing sometimes steep cliffs and fording rivers as they went and their movements were held up at times due to rain and high tides at night they sheltered in small caves augmented with a screen of nikau palm leaves they crossed karamea river on 20 april and reached buller river ten days later this had to be crossed using an old canoe that was repaired by kehu and etau and after crossing they stayed at local pa village in early may they sighted southern alps and at arahura river a tributary of grey river southernmost point of expedition they were hosted by local ngai tahu tribe at taramakau pa poor weather plagued their return along coast but they reached nelson on 18 august harsh conditions that heaphy had experienced during his travels left him disillusioned with potential prospects for settlements along west coast region life in nelson remained difficult for heaphy who had by now lost his appetite for exploration he eked out a living taking occasional jobs for next six months for much of 1847 he undertook survey work around tasman bay and later in that year was representative of new zealand company when government investigated amount of land set aside by company for local maori work had dried up by early 1848 and when he was offered employment with auckland survey office in april 1848 he accepted life in auckland moving north to auckland heaphy s new role as chief draughtsman for auckland survey office kept him occupied with preparation of maps and plans after a few years he began to spend a greater amount of time in field where he carried out survey work as he had done when living in nelson he supplemented his income with commissioned artworks he began to build on his geological knowledge taking a particular interest in and wrote an article on auckland s volcanoes for a geological journal in england he completed several paintings of volcanoes as well as thermal attractions in bay of plenty including famous pink and white terraces hoping to raise his profile he sent many of his works to london and some remain on display at offices of

around new caledonia to indulge his interest in languages he also wanted to investigate french claims on islands heaphy accompanied him as his private secretary and took opportunity to execute artworks of islands he visited and their inhabitants he gave some of his works to grey who took them back to england in december 1853 and donated them to british museum heaphy and his wife moved north of auckland to what is now known as warkworth in early 1854 following his appointment as district surveyor for peninsula which was being opened for settlement for two years heaphy surveyed plots of land that were to be sold to people moving to area in 1856 he became auckland s provincial surveyor following retirement of his predecessor he moved back to auckland and took up residence in parnell surveying kept him busy for next few years but in early 1859 he accompanied ferdinand von hochstetter who had been invited by government to make a report on a coalfield discovered south of auckland two became friendly and hochstetter was impressed with heaphy s bush skills although privately did not accord him much respect for his scientific knowledge when hochstetter left for europe later in year he took with him many examples of heaphy s artwork two later fell out when heaphy had an article published in a geological journal hochstetter felt usurped by someone he considered an inferior scholar and publicly questioned heaphy s credentials he also made allegations that heaphy had plagiarised portions of his work on coalfields heaphy mounted a spirited defence and generally had sympathy of public dispute did not stop hochstetter from using heaphy s artwork in a book he published on new zealand s geology military career soon after returning to auckland in 1856 heaphy joined a militia unit auckland rifle volunteers with rank of private in early 1863 during a period of hostilities of new zealand wars his unit was mobilised and heaphy commissioned as an officer later that

others went to his aid but heaphy and one of others were wounded and a third was killed unable to extricate themselves heaphy and remaining fit soldier provided cover to prevent wounded men from being

remained in field for much of remainder of day until ambushed party was relieved following action at paterangi heaphy was promoted to major a month later with end of war in waikato he ceased active duty and returned to civilian life victoria cross thumb right heaphy s vc which is displayed at auckland war memorial museum in late 1864 major general thomas galloway commander of new zealand colonial forces recommended heaphy for victoria cross vc for his actions at paterangi recommendation was supported by sir george grey serving a second term as governor of new zealand despite knowing that heaphy and another man recommended for vc for an action earlier in campaign was not in british army or royal navy at time only personnel from regular british military could be awarded vc and thus heaphy as a militiaman was not eligible grey argued that as heaphy was under effective command of british officers he should be made an exception in london authorities disagreed and recommendation was turned down heaphy refused to accept this and began to agitate with support from grey havelock and general duncan cameron commander of british forces in new zealand with british government he was eventually successful and on 8 february 1867 queen victoria made a declaration that local forces of new zealand would be eligible for vc that day award of a vc to heaphy first to a new zealander and

process he did not always enjoy he still advocated for aggrieved maori whose land had been stolen by colonials an added stress in heaphy s first year as commissioner was an enquiry into his conduct during period he was chief surveyor to general government of new zealand and working in waikato allegations had been raised that he took bribes for illegally adjusting land boundaries enquiry cleared heaphy of corruption although he was criticised for taking payments from young trainee surveyors in return for work in 1872 he and his wife moved to wellington which was more centrally located and
