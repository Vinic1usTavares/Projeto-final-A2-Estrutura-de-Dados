attended by both congolese and belgian dignitaries including king baudouin lumumba s speech which was itself unscheduled was in large part a response to baudouin s speech which argued that end of colonial rule in congo had been depicted as culmination of belgian civilising mission begun by leopold ii in congo free state lumumba s speech broadcast live on radio across world denounced colonialism and was interpreted as an affront to belgium and baudouin personally while it was well received within congo it was widely condemned internationally as unnecessarily confrontational and for showing ingratitude at a time when belgium had granted independence to state speech nearly provoked a diplomatic incident between congo and belgium and lumumba later gave further speeches attempting to adopt a more conciliatory tone speech itself has since been praised for its use of political rhetoric and is considered a landmark moment in independence of congo it has also been cited

belgian congo today democratic republic of congo highlighted on a map of africa colonial rule in congo began in late 19th century king leopold ii of belgium frustrated by belgium s lack of international power and prestige attempted to persuade belgian government to support colonial expansion around then largely unexplored congo basin belgian government s ambivalence about idea led leopold to eventually create colony on his own account with support from a number of western countries who viewed leopold as a useful buffer between rival colonial powers leopold achieved international recognition for a personal colony congo free state in 1885 by turn of century however violence of free state officials against indigenous congolese and ruthless system of economic extraction had led to intense diplomatic pressure on belgium to take official control of country which it did in 1908 creating belgian congo belgian rule in congo was based around colonial trinity trinite coloniale of state missionary and private company interests privileging of belgian commercial interests meant that large amounts of capital flowed into congo and that individual regions became specialised on many occasions interests of government and private enterprise became closely tied and state helped companies break strikes and remove other barriers imposed by indigenous population country was split into nesting hierarchically organised administrative subdivisions and run uniformly according to a set native policy politique indigene in contrast to british and french who generally favoured system of indirect rule whereby traditional leaders were retained in positions of authority under colonial oversight there was also a high degree of racial segregation large numbers of white immigrants who moved to congo after end of world war ii came from across social spectrum but were nonetheless always treated as superior to blacks an african nationalist movement developed in belgian congo during 1950s primarily among black middle class evolues movement was divided into a number of parties and groups which were broadly divided on ethnic and geographical lines and opposed to one another largest mouvement national congolais mnc was a united front organisation dedicated to achieving independence within a reasonable time and was led by among others patrice lumumba mnc s main rival was alliance des bakongo abako led by joseph kasa vubu who advocated a more radical ideology than mnc based around calls for immediate independence and promotion of regional identity in aftermath of rioting in capital leopoldville modern day kinshasa in 1959 independence of congo was agreed to be granted on 30 june 1960 and a constitution loi fondamentale was written creating a semi presidential constitution kasa vubu was proclaimed president and lumumba prime minister speech background and context speech was given as part of official ceremony held at palais de la nation in

both belgium and congo as well as international press king baudouin representing belgium gave first speech in which he praised genius of his ancestor king leopold ii who began colonisation of congo on his own initiative in 1880s baudouin depicted end of colonial rule in congo as culmination of belgian civilising mission and spoke of close relations he hoped would be maintained between two countries thousands of congolese listening via loudspeakers outside palais were infuriated following end of king s speech kasa vubu gave a short and uncontroversial address thanking king for his attendance and for his best wishes both speeches were applauded vigorously in a change to schedule joseph kasongo president of chamber of deputies who was presiding over ceremonies invited lumumba to give an address as lumumba had requested him to do so invitation came as a surprise to audience who had not expected lumumba to take any part in ceremony kasongo and thomas kanza a member of lumumba s government had been requested to visit lumumba at his private house on morning of 30 june before start of ceremonies to look over an early draft of lumumba s planned speech also present were two secretaries of state and two belgians one of latter may have been pacifist jean van lumumba asked kanza will you work out here with these others here to tidy up text and make it acceptable a bit less explosive less than an hour before independence ceremony a belgian officer arrived to request that lumumba depart for parliament kasongo was disturbed by what lumumba planned to say and told kanza as he left i m counting on you to do your best to tone down that speech as lumumba dressed kanza and one of secretaries andre mandi read through as much of speech as they could replacing some individual words with less inflammatory language and crossing out several full paragraphs deemed too difficult to temper lumumba then left in a motorcade for his official residence to rendezvous with rest of his government kanza and mandi followed in second car making additional revisions to speech these were so extensive that both feared lumumba would be unable to clearly read his remarks upon their arrival at residence kanza and mandi briefly explained their alterations to lumumba greatly pleased with result lumumba stated that he would read some parts of speech verbatim then improvise to respond to atmosphere in room as he saw fit he made his own alterations to script during speeches given by baudouin and kasa vubu content speech begins with lumumba addressing his speech to congolese people and praising independence as culmination of struggle of nationalist movement rather than result of belgian concessions speech continued outlining personal suffering of nationalists during course of struggle lumumba then turned to enumerating suffering of ordinary congolese people under colonialism through forced labour systematic racial discrimination land seizure wealth disparity and physical maltreatment at hand of colonial state independence lumumba argued had brought end to these forms of suffering through its democratic institutions congolese self government would deliver social justice and fair wages racial discrimination and repression would be abolished and congo would become pride of africa and an example to pan african movement lumumba called upon other states particularly belgium to support congo to establish mutually beneficial relations between two equal and independent countries he also appealed to congolese to abandon internecine tribal factionalism concluding lumumba appealed to all congolese to make sacrifices for future of congo lumumba finally called for congolese people to respect rights of non indigenous settlers in country and warned that if they breached congolese laws they would be exiled speech finishes with observation that congo s independence is a decisive step towards liberation of whole african continent and exclamations long live independence and african unity long live independent and sovereign congo speech was originally delivered in french language analysis speech has been praised for its use of political rhetoric in particular speech has been cited as exemplifying three functions of rhetoric by way it was framed within independence proceeding its deliberative function and oratorical vibrancy others have argued that dynamics between lumumba kasa vubu and baudouin during ceremony represent a microcosm of relations between africans and europeans in early post colonial africa with each representing a different stance towards others political scientist georges hailed speech as a classic of african nationalism and praised for providing a response to patronizing speech given by baudouin or as an example of speaking truth to power it was also praised as a public expose of traits of colonialism glossed over during independence ceremonies historian jean claude argued that speech was result of lumumba s growing frustration with process of independence which he believed might represent a purely nominal change in government with no real effects lumumba blamed kasa vubu and his colleagues for failing to publicly oppose this situation gender historian karen bouwer therefore argued that speech was result of lumumba s growing feeling of emasculation others have pointed to influence of belgian socialist delegates and representatives of guinean president ahmed sekou toure who had a strongly marxist ideology all of whom hoped a public and international denouncement of colonialism would help them politically david van reybrouck praised speech as memorable but argued that it damaged lumumba s own legacy since lumumba and his party represented only a third of congolese popular opinion van reybrouck accused lumumba s claim to speak for all congolese people divisive and questioned whether it was appropriate given context lumumba s address contained more of a look back than a look forward more rage than hope more rancour than magnanimity and therefore more rebellion than statesmanship he also compared it to communist julien lahaut s republican heckling of baudouin s coronation in 1950 like lumumba lahaut was subsequently murdered after he had claimed all attention at public event reception speech was applauded by congolese delegates in audience at palais de la nation and broadcast by radio across country it was also broadcast live in belgium by state broadcaster rtbf after its delivery ceremonies were halted baudouin marched out of room a short inspection of local sites was arranged with kasa vubu and lunch was served to cover delay and an official lunch was held by congo river after break lumumba was persuaded by outgoing belgian resident walter van der to give a second speech which attempted to strike a more conciliatory tone between two countries in his second speech lumumba praised baudouin and stated that i would not wish my feelings to be wrongly interpreted after lumumba s second speech official act of independence was signed by lumumba and belgian prime minister gaston eyskens as well as by foreign ministers of both countries bringing official ceremonies to an end delegates then visited a performance of congolese folklore at roi baudouin stadium before heading to an evening reception at this event lumumba gave a further conciliatory speech same evening written for him by eyskens and drank a toast to baudouin king and much of belgian delegation returned to brussels on 1 july he did not come back to congo until june 1970 thumb left lumumba s speech was interpreted as a personal attack on king baudouin pictured in 1959 which nearly caused a diplomatic incident majority international reaction was extremely critical of lumumba instead of directly reproducing speech most publications paraphrased it in negative terms lumumba s attack on colonialism was especially interpreted as an attack on belgium itself and nearly provoked a diplomatic incident between two countries international observers thought speech unwise ungrateful and tactless confrontational attitude taken by lumumba appeared to confirm belgian and american suspicions that lumumba was a dangerous radical between september 1960 and january 1961 partly at instigation of two countries lumumba was deposed from power arrested and executed with complicity of both congolese and katangese governments initial address received a mixed reception within congo in some quarters it was widely supported however some believed that it merely highlighted fact that lumumba was inexperienced and overly provocative in comparison with kasa vubu s measured and diplomatic approach members of lumumba s own party including kanza praised speech itself but believed that venue in which it had been delivered was inappropriate in parliament albert kalonji with support of other deputies filed an interpellation against lumumba requesting that he explain provocative nature of his oration he also wired an apology to brussels stating that prime minister s statements did not represent congolese opinion lumumba s address was also notably acclaimed by figures within international pan african and black power movements including malcolm x speech may have further heightened racial violence between white settlers and native congolese which were already distrustful as a result of threat to its expatriates belgium deployed troops to country and amid mounting violence several regions of congo notably katanga seceded and declared their own independence starting five years of violence and political unrest known as congo crisis legacy thumb tkm lumumba independance 1972 by tshibumba kanda matulu painting shows a romanticised portrayal of speech while speech was filmed during its delivery film of speech has only survived as fragments and in some sections only original audio survives transcriptions of speech were later published in multiple print editions some of which were altered as propaganda to show lumumba in a better light after his death in 1961 today speech forms an important part of congolese popular memory particularly among lumumbists who claim to represent lumumba s ideological position in modern congolese politics scene was painted by congolese artist tshibumba kanda matulu in his distinctive cartoon like style result entitled tkm lumumba
