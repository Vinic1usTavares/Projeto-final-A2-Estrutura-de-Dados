hualalai pronounced in hawaiian is an active volcano on island of hawaii in hawaiian islands it is westernmost third youngest and third most active of five volcanoes that form island of hawaii following kilauea and much larger mauna loa its peak stands above sea level hualalai is estimated to have risen above sea level about 300 000 years ago despite maintaining a very low level of activity since its last eruption in 1801 and being unusually inactive for last 2 000 years hualalai is still considered active and is expected to erupt again some time within next century relative unpreparedness of residents in area caused by lull in activity would worsen consequences of such an event area near volcano has been inhabited for centuries by hawaiian natives dating back to before recorded history coast west of hualalai in particular had several royal complexes volcano is also important ecologically is home to many rare species and several nature reserves near summit and is a popular hiking attraction today coast near hualalai is dotted by vacation resorts some built on historic flows and a national historical park geology structural features thumb 150px left an expedition down a lava conduit in hualalai volcano hualalai stands at with a prominence of it is westernmost of five major volcanoes which form island of hawaii being in post shield stage of development hualalai is overall much rougher in shape and structure than more youthful mauna loa and kilauea hualalai s structure is denoted by three rift zones a well developed one approximately 50deg to northwest a moderately developed one to southeast and a poorly developed one trending northwards about east of summit there are over 100 cinder and spatter cones arranged along these rift zones hualalai has no summit caldera although there is a collapse crater about across atop a small lava shield much of southern slope above modern town of kailua kona consists of lava flows covered by a layer of volcanic ash from thick in comparison with other volcanoes of island of hawaii it is third tallest third youngest third most active and second smallest making up just 7 of island a major subfeature of hualalai is puu waawaa hawaiian for many furrowed hill a volcanic cone standing tall and measuring over in diameter it extends for and has a prominence of north of summit at cone is constructed of trachyte a type of volcanic lava that exists at no other volcano on hawaii trachyte flows move more slowly than typically runny hawaiian lavas a characteristic caused by its high over 62 silica composition typical basalt is only 50 silica geologists hypothesize that puu waawaa originally formed during a pumice eruption a little over 100 000 years ago and has continued to build itself since then with at least three distinct trachyte flows recognized eruptions although partially covered by flows from hualalai and mauna loa have built a distinctive structure known as puu anahulu ridge westward facing flank of hualalai forms a large underwater slump known as north kona slump an area of about slump consists of an intricate formation of beaches and scarps below waterline this area was explored more closely in a 2001 joint japan united states project to explore volcano s flanks utilizing remotely operated vehicle rov data collected showed that lava flows there originated in shallow water deep and that unlike similar slumps at other volcanoes slump at hualalai formed gradually hualalai is a known source for xenoliths rock from earth s mantle that have been brought up in lava flows many prehistoric deposits as well as those from 1801 event contain xenoliths of large size and abundant quantity history lava attributed to a shield stage hualalai has been found just offshore of volcano s northwest rift zone tholeiitic basalt indicative of submarine of volcano s construction has been found in wells driven into volcano at a depth of these lavas persisted until an estimated 130 000 years ago hualalai entered post shield stage stage it is presently in about 100 000 years ago pumice and trachyte eruptions at puu waawaa may be a sign of this change geological mapping of volcano has indicated that as much as 80 of volcano s surface has been topped by lava flows during last 5 000 years entirely composed of shield alkalic basalt more than half of this is under 3 000 years old and about 12 is less than 1 000 years of age between years 1700 and 2016 eruptions originated from six vents four of these lava flows poured into sea to west coast eruptive history hualalai is third most active volcano making up island of hawaii behind kilauea and mauna loa although two larger volcanos have each erupted over 150 times in last 1 000 years hualalai has done so but 3 times recurrence of activity at volcano seems to be every 200 to 300 years a recent calm period with almost no earthquake or magmatic activity at hualalai has seen growth of homes businesses and resorts on mountain s flanks most recent major activity at volcano was in 1929 when an intense earthquake swarm rocked hualalai most likely caused by magmatic action near volcano s peak although it has been relatively placid in recent past hualalai is still potentially active and is expected to erupt again within next 100 years lava stratigraphy united states geological survey usgs has divided exposed lava flows

flows that entered ocean off western tip of hawaii island although five vents were active at time only two produced flows that eventually reached ocean total output volume of flow is estimated at over one volcanic vent situated high on slope produced a large a a flow dubbed ka upulehu flow that reached ocean as two distinct lobes on its way down it overran a village and a valuable fishing pond there is a local legend that after failure of several offerings of animals and other items to gods flow was finally stopped when kamehameha i threw a lock of his own hair into fire ka upulehu flow is also known for particularly large quantity of mafic and ultramafic xenoliths that came up with it other major outflow from event reached sea south of kiholo bay destroying village of ka upulehu this 1801 flow known as flow formed point where kona international airport is now located north of kailua kona eruption at hualalai was concurrent with an eruption at nearby mauna loa it is theorized that in near past hualalai has had synchronous eruptions with both mauna loa and kilauea recent activity thumb right hualalai is indicated as threat level 4 by usgs in this mapping two gray areas are two major outflows from 1800 1801 event hualalai last erupted in 1801 a severe earthquake swarm shook volcano in 1929 lasting about a month this caused 100 000 worth of damage to kona district 1 2 million as of 2010 and two earthquakes with magnitudes of 5 5 and 6 5 were felt as far away as honolulu this was probably caused by magma movement near surface but there was no surface activity or eruption 2006 kiholo bay earthquake with epicenter just to north in kiholo bay near caused much damage in area future monitoring hualalai is expected to erupt again in near future as a 200 to 300 year estimated pause in activity is coming to an end this presents a distinct hazard to communities around it as well for example in event of an eruption similar to 1801 event kailua kona which is from volcano s summit could be covered completely in a matter of hours according to usgs lava flow hazard zones on a scale of 1 to 9 all of hualalai is listed as threat level 4 for comparison almost all of kilauea and mauna loa is listed as threat levels 1 through 3 flanks of volcano do not pose a lower threat to population than area near rift zones because distance is short and slopes are steep lava poses as much of a threat as it does near its source since 1991 hawaiian volcano observatory hvo has maintained a seismic recording station east of hualalai s summit to monitor volcano during this time not a single earthquake swarm or harmonic tremor indicative of activity at volcano has occurred although hualalai does experience several magnitude 4 earthquakes per year these are attributed to a deep source off coast of north western rift zone and are not related to movement of magma usgs is currently in process of upgrading its aging monitoring and telemetry equipment using american recovery and reinvestment act funds agency plans to add another seismometer and three more sensors to help monitor activity in addition hvo uses gps to measure slight changes in tilt and slope of hualalai indicative of magmatic movement a survey has been conducted every two years since 1986 but no changes have been recorded human history thumb left kaloko fishpond hualalai has been a home to native people since ancient times centuries ago ahu a umi heiau was built on dry plateau east of mountain kaloko honokohau national historic park lies on shore west of hualalai over site of an ancient hawaiian settlement although it is called kekaha a ole wai lands without water rugged volcanic terrain attracted much sea life making it an appealing place to settle there are two main attractions within park kaloko fishpond an area of fishponds constructed of interlocking rocks across a natural embayment on coast and honokohau a former extensive settlement on south side of park holualoa bay and bay were favored retreats of hawaiian royalty long before westernization of hawaii it was here that kamehameha i rested after his eight year campaign to unite hawaiian isles his death in 1819 triggered social chaos church built for missionaries in 1837 of lava rock and crushed coral still stands today hulihee palace where many of hawaii s last kings spent their time has been maintained as a museum since 1927 today coast west of hualalai is a popular location for vacation resorts since rain shadow of mountain causes many sunny days first kona village resort was built in 1961 since then four seasons resort and golf course and vacation home complex have also been built on 1800 flow both kona village resort and four seasons resort were damaged by tsunami generated by 2011 sendai earthquake hawaii belt road traverses western slopes with an upper route called highway and lower route named for queen kaahumanu much of kona coffee crop grows on hualalai s western slope near town of holualoa family of early coffee merchant henry nicholas greenwell owned a large ranch on western side of volcano road from kailua kona up slopes of hualalai is named for frank palani greenwell hawaii route 200 known as saddle road crosses plateau north of hualalai where training area provides a remote training ground for united states army and united states marine corps ecology and environment thumb left hualalai seen from honokohau although some of hualalai is bare volcanic rock most of it is covered by some form of vegetation bushes ferns and grass are common and even a few ohia lehua trees metrosideros polymorpha grow along summit many of collapse craters in particular have vegetation and a few even have respectably sized vertical forests inside including several eucalyptus tree groves volcano is populated by many birds and animals coast in particular attracts many fish and sea dependent animals such as green sea turtle chelonia mydas and black winged stilt himantopus himantopus hualalai averages of rainfall per year summit gets more rain than coast and is typically obscured in heavy cloud cover and several ecological reserves lie on flanks of hualalai puu waa waa forest sanctuary was established in 1992 along with sister reserve on mauna kea as a testbed for long term ecological research about hawaiian moist forest and dry forest biomes and lies within a mile of volcano s summit on its northwestern flank elevation differs from sea level near coastal edge to near summit median annual rainfall is about plentiful lava flows from 19th century provide unique niches for vegetative and soil growth in region southern section of reserve closest to summit has been split into a bird sanctuary forest reserve on southwestern flank of volcano at preserves an extensive koa acacia koa forest stand with smaller and mamane sophora chrysophylla trees and an undergrowth of akala rubus and various ferns reserve measures and protects an ecosystem that has since been largely deforested in surrounding area wai aha spring reserve on lower slopes of mountain is somewhat swampy and is home to flowering evergreen ohia metrosideros polymorpha woody
