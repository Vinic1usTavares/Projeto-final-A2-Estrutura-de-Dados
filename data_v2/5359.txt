subject of transgender representation stuart cosgrove director of creative diversity at channel 4 and tim davie chairperson of bbc working group on portrayal and inclusion of lesbian gay and bisexual audiences they noted a general absence of transgender people in british broadcasting and reported that transgender storylines are frequently lacking in breadth and substance in a later interview cosgrove added that there are high levels of inaccuracy in british media reports about transgender people in an effort to improve this situation trans media watch drafted and published a memorandum of understanding for media companies signatories of memorandum agree to work toward increasing positive well informed representations of transgender people in media in march 2011 channel 4 became first

aired journalist patrick strudwick asked channel 4 why call your new documentary my transsexual summer it sounds like gender tourism a fun little trip to other side sarah dean an entertainment editor for huffington post uk called title sensationalist although sarah lake of trans media watch found title contentious she defended it by pointing out that transition is a temporary process like coming of age even so she believed title to be only slightly better than dire and totally inappropriate working title girls will be boys and boys will be girls her overall assessment was that although programme makers undeniably made some compromises to draw in viewers millions will have enjoyed company of these seven shared in their lives and learned a lesson in diversity they will now have an entry point to broadening their understanding of rich and joyful diversity of gender experience something which has always existed but of which they were previously unaware politician and activist zoe o connell described some of wording in narration as cringeworthy but felt that it s more than just a step in right direction it s a programme that pretty accurately reflected how many trans people carry on with each other in private musician activist and writer cn lester listed some ways in which show perpetuated misconceptions or otherwise fell short but still saw it as a turning point in representation of transgender people on television it felt like a game changer overall feel of it of hope of warmth that felt totally new to me and hats off to seven trans people for putting that across when second episode aired transgender journalist juliet jacques posted her thoughts to new statesman s politics blog staggers at this point limited level of improvement in trans representation on tv shown by my transsexual summer is probably best we can expect she felt major barriers to better representation to be producers prejudices about what viewers will accept or understand and extremely narrow bandwidth for minority subjects after seeing first three episodes maxwell zachs called series a disappointment one reason for this he says is that although we see lovely endearing transsexuals portrayed in show what i don t see is anything that is going to make people think or feel any differently about what gender is or how it limits us all in one way or another he lamented that their expressions of nuance in gender identity and discussions of were absent from broadcast edit of show after final episode aired juliet jacques wrote a follow up article for time out she concludes perhaps in 30 years time my transsexual summer will look as dated as 1980 documentary a change of sex does now if so this will be because it has for all its faults taken trans related television in a more positive direction participants lives after show karen drew max and donna less than a month after final episode of my transsexual summer aired karen gale delivered part of channel
