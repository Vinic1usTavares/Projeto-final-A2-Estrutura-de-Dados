adiantum viridimontanum commonly known as green mountain maidenhair fern is a rare fern found only in outcrops of serpentine rock in new england and eastern canada leaf blade is cut into finger like segments themselves once divided which are borne on outer side of a curved dark glossy rachis central stalk of leaf these finger like segments are not individual leaves but parts of a single compound leaf fingers may be drooping or erect depending on whether individual fern grows in shade or sunlight spores are borne under false indusia rolled flaps of tissue at edge of subdivisions of leaf a characteristic unique to genus adiantum until 1991 a viridimontanum was grouped with western maidenhair fern a aleuticum which grows both in western north america and as a disjunct on serpentine outcrops in eastern north america at one time a aleuticum itself was classified as a variety a pedatum var aleuticum of northern maidenhair fern a pedatum however after several years of study botanist cathy paris recognized that a aleuticum was a distinct species and that some of specimens that had been attributed to that taxon group of organisms were a third hybrid species intermediate between a pedatum and a aleuticum she named new species a viridimontanum for site of its discovery in green mountains in vermont it has since been located in quebec and in one site on serpentine in coastal maine a viridimontanum is difficult to distinguish from its parent species in field it can generally be separated from a pedatum by shape of ultimate segments smallest divisions of leaf and by its habitat on thin exposed serpentine soils rather than in rich woodlands it more closely resembles a aleuticum however stalks of ultimate segments and false indusia are longer and spores larger due to its limited distribution and similarity to other adiantum species within its range little is known of its ecology it thrives on sunny disturbed areas where ultramafic rock is covered with thin soil such as road cuts talus slopes and asbestos mines individual plants seem long lived and new individuals only infrequently reach maturity it is one of four species endemic to serpentine in eastern north america and is considered globally threatened due to its habitat restrictions description adiantum viridimontanum is a medium sized deciduous terrestrial fern about wide and high its fronds range from in length from base of leaf stalk to tip like many ferns frond of a viridimontanum is divided into a series of leaflets known as pinnae and pinnae are further divided into pinnules shape of frond in a pedatum a aleuticum and a viridimontanum is very similar they are usually described as having a rachis that forks into two branches which curve outwards and backwards several pinnae grow from outer side of curve of each rachis branch with longest pinnae located closest to fork of rachis fingerlike pinnae are pinnately divided into short stalked pinnules however this interpretation of frond architecture divided into pinnae then pinnately divided into pinnules presents a problem no other species of adiantum nor any other member of sensu lato family in which adiantum was once included has a forking rachis in fact these species are not but pseudopedate what appears to be a fork in rachis is in fact junction between rachis and a basal pinna that basal pinna makes up one of two curving branches rachis runs straight up first fingerlike segment on other branch while remainder of that curving branch is made up of other basal pinna both basal pinnae are further divided and subdivided to create other fingerlike segments therefore even though they appear structurally similar longest and most central fingerlike segment represents tip of frond pinnately divided into pinnae first level of division of frond while two shorter fingerlike segments immediately on either side of it are pinnae pinnately divided into pinnules second level of division each fingerlike segment thereafter represents a level of division one greater than one that precedes it therefore final pinnate subdivisions of each fingerlike segment may be referred to as ultimate segments to avoid technical inaccuracy of calling them pinnules rhizome shows little branching with intervals of 4 0 to 7 5 mm between nodes it measures 2 0 to 3 5 mm in diameter rhizome and stipe stalk of leaf below blade have bronze colored scales stipe and rachis range from chestnut brown to dark purple in color and are glabrous stipe is about 2 to 3 mm in diameter while rachis is smaller 1 to 2 mm basal pinnae are from three to seven times pinnate due to pseudopedate structure of blade while apical parts of blade and corresponding segments of basal pinnae are once pinnate penultimate segments of blade apparent pinnae or fingerlike segments are typically lanceolate in shape overall arrangement of penultimate segments ranges from drooping and fan shaped on plants growing in shade to funnel shaped on plants growing in full sun under latter conditions segments stand stiffly erect ultimate segments of divided blade apparent pinnules are borne on short dark stalks of 0 6 to 1 5 mm with dark color often spreading into base of each segment they are long and obliquely triangular margin forming hypotenuse tip of segments is typically acute but entire not pointed they measure from 9 5 to 22 5 mm in length and 4 2 to 7 5 mm in breadth average length being about 2 5 times breadth their tissue is herbaceous firmly leafy to parchment like in texture and bright green to bluish green in color as in other members of adiantum glabrous leaves shed water when young under shady conditions ultimate segments lie within plane of blade but tend to twist out of plane when grown in sun margins of these segments are lobed with narrow less than 1 0 mm incisions lying between lobes in fertile segments these lobes are recurved to form false indusia beneath leaf these are transversely oblong from 2 to 5 mm in length and from 0 6 to 1 4 mm in width sporangia fern s spore bearing structures are borne on underside of leaf beneath false indusium a trait found in all members of adiantum and not in any species outside it sori are round and are found on veins ending in false indusium below veins ends spores are tetrahedral to globose yellow in color and measure 41 to 58 micrometers mm in diameter averaging 51 4 mm on average larger than other species in a pedatum complex spores appear in summer and fall species has a chromosome number of 116 in sporophyte identification adiantum viridimontanum closely resembles other species in a pedatum complex a pedatum and a aleuticum and distinguishing three in field is difficult paris and windham in their study of complex noted that while each species collectively can be distinguished from others no single morphological character was absolutely distinctive among species sterile triploid hybrids between a viridimontanum and other two species may occur further complicating field identification one potentially distinguishing character is shape of ultimate segments in middle part of leaf blade which are oblong in a pedatum and long triangular or reniform kidney shaped in a viridimontanum and some specimens of a aleuticum furthermore a viridimontanum can grow in both shade and sun while a pedatum grows in shade only adiantum viridimontanum can be separated from morphologically similar individuals of a aleuticum by greater length of stalks on medial ultimate segments and of false indusia measuring greater than 0 9 mm and greater than 3 5 mm respectively in a viridimontanum spore size is also a useful character although not easily measured in field average a viridimontanum spore measures 51 4 mm in diameter while a aleuticum spores can reach up to 53 mm they average about 43 mm in a aleuticum growing as a disjunct on eastern serpentine specimens most likely to be confused with a viridimontanum rhizome is much more frequently branched with intervals of 1 0 to 2 0 mm between nodes taxonomy all species in genus adiantum are currently placed in subfamily of family on basis of molecular phylogenetic evidence work which led to recognition of adiantum viridimontanum as a distinct taxon began in early 20th century following discovery of disjunct specimens of western maidenhair fern then classified as a pedatum var aleuticum on serpentine tableland of mount albert by merritt lyndon fernald in 1905 botanists began to search for western maidenhair on ultramafic outcrops elsewhere in quebec and vermont it was first identified in vermont by l frances jolley in 1922 at belvidere mountain in eden in 1983 william j cody transferred a pedatum growing on serpentine both in eastern and western north america to a pedatum subsp instead many of stations for fern in vermont were described in 1985 in a survey of ultramafic outcrops in that state from 1983 to 1985 cathy a paris then a graduate student gathered specimens of a pedatum from non serpentine soils in midwest and vermont and from serpentine soils in new england and canada for analysis in 1988 paris and michael d windham published results of this analysis revealing a pedatum in north america to be a cryptic species complex they showed that a pedatum sensu lato included two well distinguished diploid taxa one found in eastern woodlands and other found both in western mountains and as a disjunct on serpentine in east however not all of serpentine proved to belong to western taxon several of them including most of specimens in vermont were found to be tetraploid forming a taxon distinguishable from two isozyme banding patterns suggested that tetraploid had arisen by hybridization between eastern subspecies of non serpentine woodlands and western and serpentine taxon followed by a duplication of hybrid genome through polyploidy allowing chromosomes to pair and restoring sexual fertility this was also morphologically intermediate between two taxa although it more closely resembled serpentine taxon hence its referral to var aleuticum before paris s work paris formally described tetraploid as a new species a viridimontanum in 1991 and also separated western and serpentine taxon from a pedatum as species a aleuticum type specimen of a viridimontanum was collected from a talus slope at old asbestos mine on belvidere mountain on august 28 1985 sequencing of several chloroplast dna loci has revealed that a viridimontanum chloroplast genome most closely resembles that of a aleuticum suggesting that a aleuticum was maternal parent of a viridimontanum in 2015 christopher fraser jenkins treated it as a subspecies of a broadly defined a pedatum as a pedatum subsp viridimontanum arguing that morphological similarity among members of complex should outweigh biological species concept in defining boundaries of species distribution and habitat right thumb natural distribution of a viridimontanum within eastern canada and northeastern united states adiantum viridimontanum is narrowly distributed in new england and quebec seven stations in vermont lie in missisquoi valley in northern green mountains giving fern its common name ultramafic rocks of this area extend northwards into quebec where eight stations are known in southern quebec and six in thetford mines area it is also known from one station on serpentine on deer isle maine fern thrives in thin serpentine soils on sunny disturbed habitats such as roadcuts and talus slopes in dunite and other ultramafic rocks anthropogenic disturbance has removed thicker soils and increased sun exposure in many of these sites for instance many of quebec stations are in asbestos mines both abandoned and active in more natural habitats frost weathering and erosion may promote rock fall and maintain suitable habitat eastern serpentine outcrops where a viridimontanum thrives have relatively few endemics compared to serpentine exposures globally a viridimontanum is one of only five taxa four species and a variety that are strictly endemic to serpentine in eastern north america and two of these a aleuticum and densa grow on non serpentine substrates elsewhere in north america ecology adiantum viridimontanum largely reproduces asexually by branching rather than sexually through spores while wind blown spores can result in sexual reproduction for species most spores probably fall within a relatively short radius of plant in addition reproduction through spore dispersal requires spore to land in suitable conditions for generating a gametophyte typically in bright sunlight on thin serpentine soils these requirements allow a viridimontanum to colonize recently disturbed sites on ultramafic outcrops where bedrock has been exposed and competing plants have been removed populations appear stable with long life of individuals compensating for low recruitment rates little is known about role of a viridimontanum in ecosystem in general ferns are less susceptible to herbivory than flowering plants due to higher levels of toxic and distasteful compounds in their foliage a viridimontanum is not known to be threatened by a particular predator or disease conservation under conservation status system a viridimontanum is considered globally vulnerable g3 it is considered imperiled s2 in vermont and vulnerable s3 in quebec it has not yet been classified in maine conservation of a viridimontanum is primarily limited by its restricted habitat on serpentine cliffs and talus slopes however these sites are also of little value to humans most likely threat to species is expansion of asbestos mining which often occurs near populations of fern or other reuse of abandoned asbestos mines road construction might also threaten some sites although this is mitigated by fern s ability to flourish on disturbed serpentine none of sites are as yet known to be invaded by non native plants species is considered more difficult to cultivate than either of its parent species references bibliography external links image of type specimen at harvard herbarium center for plant conservation plant
