typhoon judy known in philippines as typhoon susang was third tropical cyclone to affect japan during 1982 pacific typhoon season forming east of philippines in tandem with another system on september 4 disturbance continued to intensify and was upgraded into a tropical storm early on september 6 and a typhoon on september 8 while tracking northwestward on september 9 judy attained its peak intensity with winds of 150 km h 90 mph thereafter increased wind shear took a toll on typhoon as it turned northward on september 11 in general direction of japan under influence of a mid latitude cyclone judy passed over southeastern japan on september 12 by this time typhoon had weakened considerably judy became an extratropical cyclone almost immediately thereafter across japan a total of 26 people were killed eight others were rendered as missing and 86 were injured a total of 61 000 homes were flooded three boats sank and highways were cut in 956 locations it is estimated that 1 100 landslides occurred during passage of cyclone downtown tokyo sustained worst of damage where 8 000 homes were flooded approximately 200 000 travelers were stuck after 25 train lines were flooded including 17 000 individuals who were stranded on 40 stalled trains meteorological history origins of typhoon judy can be traced back from a highly active monsoon trough along low latitudes of western pacific basin in first week of september two tropical disturbances soon developed first of which later spawned typhoon irving by september 4 systems developed a surface circulation later that day joint typhoon warning center jtwc issued a tropical cyclone formation alert tcfa on second system this system rapidly became better organized and on september 5 japan meteorological agency jma starting watching second system following an increase in organized thunderstorm activity near center jtwc started issuing warnings on tropical depression 19 at 1600 utc that day at 2200 utc on september 6 hurricane hunters reported winds of and a pressure of based on this both jtwc and jma upgraded depression into tropical storm judy early next day tropical storm judy was initially expected by jtwc to move west northwest because a subtropical ridge was expected to build north of system however ridge did not build which enabled judy to track northeastward under influence of a tropical upper tropospheric trough tutt located to north of cyclone meanwhile storm held its intensity of about 36 hours but on september 7 jma upgraded low into a severe tropical storm due to lack of wind shear judy continued to intensify meanwhile philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration also briefly monitored storm and assigned it with local name susang at 0600 utc on september 8 jma upgraded system to typhoon status storm intensified slightly thereafter and early next day jma estimated that judy attained peak intensity of 150 km h 90 mph and a pressure of later on september 9 jtwc reported that judy reached peak intensity of equivalent to a mid level category 2 hurricane on united states based saffir simpson hurricane wind scale shortly after its peak cool air began to take a toll on system as it ingested remnants of tutt by late on september 9 virtually all deep convection associated with judy was removed from center based on this jma lowered intensity of system to moving slower than expected due strong northwesterly flow over sea of japan system became better organized due to a brief decrease in wind shear however typhoon judy failed to intensify further on september 11 judy began to accelerate in general direction of japan as interaction with tutt ceased next day wind shear once again increased significantly consequently thunderstorm activity decreased along southwest portion of judy despite this no change in intensity occurred at 0800 utc on september 12 judy moved onshore at point on honshu while still producing hurricane force winds four hours later however jma demoted judy to a severe tropical storm midday on september 12 jtwc downgraded judy to a tropical storm several hours later agency noted that judy had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone with jma following suit next day on september 15 jma ceased monitoring system impact upon making landfall in japan of rain fell in oshima including of precipitation within 24 hours additionally sustained a peak total of in an hour furthermore a wind gust of was measured in a total of 34 people were killed and 86 were hurt a total of 61 000 homes were flooded three boats sank downtown tokyo sustained worst of damage nearby kanda river overflowed their banks flooding 8 000 dwellings including 2 000 in shinjuku entertainment district throughout tokyo 590 100 homes lost power however power service was quickly restored to all but 20 000 in shizuoka and kanagawa eight people perished because of mudslides offshore one person died due to waves one person died and three others were lost when a boat with 10 anglers was capsized due to rough seas off coast of kobe throughout tokyo 12 people perished and three were reportedly missing elsewhere in a river overflowed their banks flooding 631 residencies approximately north of tokyo in sendai a three story apart complex was turned upside down all residents living in complex were rescued about 50 000 police men and soldiers were mobilized to help with rescue work a total of 105 homes were destroyed in addition 1 100 landslides were reported while river banks broke in 20 places according to officials highways were cut in 956 spots and bridges were damaged in 43 locations around 200 000 passengers were stranded after railroad lines near tokyo were inundated in 25 places moreover around 17 000 persons on 40 stalled trains were stranded for night air travel in tokyo and handa were halted due to strong winds damage nationwide were about y 125 8 billion us 505 million typhoon judy was second storm to affect japan within a month as well as third to system affect nation during 1982 pacific typhoon season from all three systems combined death toll exceeded 100 a few weeks later typhoon ken became fourth
