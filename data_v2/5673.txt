laelaps by charles r knight ottaviani mentions theory that knight drew it as an intentional allegory for cope marsh conflict ottaviani 129 jim ottaviani conceived of bone sharps while working at university of michigan library in ann arbor ottaviani s job included purchasing books for engineering topics but a new book about bone wars caught his eye he bought book himself and found himself fascinated by rivalry between cope and marsh he described his process as spending time doing research before turning an outline and timeline into a structured story using book as a starting point ottaviani read accounts and biographies of cope and marsh as well as other period sources during course of his research ottaviani found then unpublished autobiography of charles knight which inspired him to make book into a work of historical fiction ottaviani had previously written non fiction books and comics on scientific figures but had never written a work of historical fiction i found whole war aspect over hyped ottaviani recalled these guys never came to blows or even did anything that went very far beyond questionable ethics in comparison to his previous works ottaviani called scientists bad guys while majority of bone sharps is true and all of it is based on history ottaviani took liberties throughout to better serve story in real life knight did not meet cope until only a few years before cope s death in addition knight s autobiography states that it was reporter william hosea ballou who introduced two not osborn knight charles r 2005 charles r knight autobiography of an artist ann arbor mi g t labs there is also no evidence marsh and knight ever met on knight s role in story ottaviani wrote as i was reading about cope and marsh i ran across knight as something of a bit player in their lives as i got further into cope and marsh story and i liked two less and less as people which is different from liking them as characters of course i wanted to have a character in book for readers to root for and neither of scientists could fill that role when i found out that knight had met cope just before cope died i became convinced that he was character i needed ottaviani s interest in knight eventually led to his company g t labs publishing knight s autobiography with notes by ottaviani and forewords by ray bradbury and ray harryhausen other character relationships were fictionalized as well editor james gordon bennet jr never lobbied with cope and never exposed marsh s will cope s bones also never made it to new york wallace david r 1999 revenge new york houghton mifflin some conversations due to their private nature were fictionalized ottaviani makes up marsh s lobby to congress and what happened during his meeting with president grant and p t barnum never told off marsh way he did in novel jaffe mark 2000 gilded dinosaur fossil war between cope and marsh and rise of american science new york crown publishers 90 ottaviani also wove story marsh tells about mastodon from several different versions of legend adams richard c 1997 legends of delaware indians syracuse new york syracuse university press pg 57 58 a key plot point is fabricated for purposes of dramatic irony in book marsh has his agent sam smith leave a camarasaurus skull for cope to find and mistakenly put on wrong dinosaur instead hatcher finds it smith tries to keep an unwitting marsh from getting it but due to marsh s obnoxious manner he lets him after all as a result marsh mistakenly classifies non existent brontosaurus ottaviani admits in book he invented this as literary tradition of hoisting someone up by his own petard was too good to pass up ottaviani 9 10 while ottaviani was putting his ideas together he met zander cannon at 2004 san diego comic convention cannon and associates were forming a new production studio big time attic ottaviani mentioned he had a proposal he wanted to show them referring to big time attic ottaviani stated in an interview that a newly formed studio taking on a 160 page graphic novel is ambitious and that he was lucky to have had book published even format book is wider than it is tall was a departure for ottaviani he explained that since story was talking about wide expanses of territory and american west artists at big time attic wanted a more non traditional landscape page design reception book was generally well received upon release comic book letterer todd klein recommended book to his readers stating that novel was able to convey depths of cope and marsh s rivalry and we can only wonder how much more could have been accomplished if cope and marsh had only been willing to team up instead klein s complaints focused on somewhat stiff art and difficulty in telling some characters apart but said these shortcomings did not affect flow and reading johanna carlson of comics worth reading found bone central message question of whether promotion is a necessary evil to gather funds through attention or a base desire of those with wrong motivations still relevant to today s society carlson also lauded flow of novel and some of intricate details in story and setting other reviewers praised ottaviani s inclusion of notable historical figures and educational yet entertaining feel of work and expressive artwork in addition to minor issues with art entertainment weeklys tom russo felt that more fiction could have been used in mostly non fiction writing due to historical background of book bone sharps has been used in schools as part of a study testing effects of using comic books to educate young children since release of graphic novel ottaviani has published other slightly fictionalized historical stories including levitation physics and psychology in service of
