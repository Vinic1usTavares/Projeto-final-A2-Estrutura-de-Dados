spotted hyena crocuta crocuta also known as laughing hyena is a hyena species currently classed as sole extant member of genus crocuta native to sub saharan africa it is listed as being of least concern by iucn on account of its widespread range and large numbers estimated between 27 000 and 47 000 individuals species is however experiencing declines outside of protected areas due to habitat loss and poaching species may have originated in asia and once ranged throughout europe for at least one million years until end of late pleistocene spotted hyena is largest known member of hyaenidae and is further physically distinguished from other species by its vaguely bear like build its rounded ears its less prominent mane its spotted pelt its more dual purposed dentition its fewer nipples and presence of a pseudo penis in female it is only mammalian species to lack an external vaginal opening spotted hyena is most social of carnivora in that it has largest group sizes and most complex social behaviours its social organisation is unlike that of any other carnivore bearing closer resemblance to that of cercopithecine primates baboons and macaques with respect to group size hierarchical structure and frequency of social interaction among both kin and unrelated group mates however social system of spotted hyena is openly competitive rather than cooperative with access to kills mating opportunities and time of dispersal for males depending on ability to dominate other clan members females provide only for their own cubs rather than assist each other and males display no paternal care spotted hyena society is matriarchal females are larger than males and dominate them spotted hyena is a highly successful animal being most common large carnivore in africa its success is due in part to its adaptability and opportunism it is primarily a hunter but may also scavenge with capacity to eat and digest skin bone and other animal waste in functional terms spotted hyena makes most efficient use of animal matter of all african carnivores spotted hyena displays greater plasticity in its hunting and foraging behaviour than other african carnivores it hunts alone in small parties of 2 5 individuals or in large groups during a hunt spotted hyenas often run through ungulate herds in order to select an individual to attack once selected their prey is chased over a long distance often several kilometres at speeds of up to 60 km h spotted hyena has a long history of interaction with humanity depictions of species exist from upper paleolithic period with carvings and paintings from lascaux and chauvet caves species has a largely negative reputation in both western culture and african folklore in former species is mostly regarded as ugly and cowardly while in latter it is viewed as greedy gluttonous stupid and foolish yet powerful and potentially dangerous majority of western perceptions on species can be found in writings of aristotle and pliny elder though in relatively form explicit negative judgements occur in physiologus where animal is depicted as a hermaphrodite and grave robber iucn s hyena specialist group identifies spotted hyena s negative reputation as detrimental to species continued survival both in captivity and wild etymology discovery and naming spotted hyena s scientific name crocuta was once widely thought to be derived from latin loanword which translates as saffron coloured one in reference to animal s fur colour this was proven to be incorrect as correct spelling of loanword would have been and word was never used in that sense by graeco roman sources crocuta actually comes from ancient greek word krokottas krokottas which is derived from sanskrit which in turn originates from both of which were originally meant to signify golden jackal earliest recorded mention of krokottas is from strabo s geographica where animal is described as a mix of wolf and dog native to ethiopia thumb engraving of a spotted hyena from thomas pennant s history of quadrupeds one of first authentic depictions of species from classical antiquity until renaissance spotted and striped hyena were either assumed to be same species or distinguished purely on geographical rather than physical grounds hiob ludolf in his historia aethiopica was first to clearly distinguish crocuta from hyaena on account of physical as well as geographical grounds though he never had any first hand experience of species having gotten his accounts from an ethiopian intermediary confusion still persisted over exact taxonomic nature of hyena family in general with most european travelers in ethiopia referring to hyenas as wolves this partly stems from amharic word for hyena which is linked to arabic word b wolf first detailed first hand descriptions of spotted hyena by europeans come from willem bosman and peter kolbe bosman a dutch tradesman who worked for dutch west india company at gold coast modern day ghana from 1688 1701 wrote of of jackals or woodland dogs whose physical descriptions match spotted hyena kolben a german mathematician and astronomer who worked for dutch east india company in cape of good hope from 1705 1713 described spotted hyena in great detail but referred to it as a because settlers in southern africa did not know of hyenas and thus labelled them as wolves bosman and kolben s descriptions went largely unnoticed until 1771 when welsh naturalist thomas pennant in his synopsis of quadrupeds used descriptions as well as his personal experience with a captive specimen as a basis for consistently differentiating spotted hyena from striped description given by pennant was precise enough to be included by johann erxleben in his systema regni by simply translating pennant s text into latin crocuta was finally recognised as a separate genus from hyaena in 1828 local and indigenous names several languages of africa lack species specific names for hyenas for example spotted and striped species have identical names in swahili mandinka mossi ngambaye wolof and fulani in other languages other species may simply be termed small spotted hyena such as in swahili where spotted hyena is

of spotted hyenas at white river mpumalanga note great degree of individual variation in fur colour which was once used as a basis for separating species into various subspecies unlike striped hyena for which a number of subspecies were proposed in light of its extensive modern range spotted hyena is a genuinely variable species both temporally and spatially its range once encompassed almost all of africa and eurasia and displayed a large degree of morphological geographic variation which led to an equally extensive set of specific and subspecific epithets it was gradually realised that all of this variation could be applied to individual differences in a single subspecies in 1939 biologist l harrison matthews demonstrated through comparisons between a large selection of spotted hyena skulls from tanzania that all variation seen in then recognised subspecies could also be found in a single population with only set of characters standing out being pelage which is subject to a high degree of individual variation and size which is subject to bergmann s rule when fossils are taken into consideration species displayed even greater variation than it does in modern times and a number of these named fossil species have since been classed as synonymous with crocuta crocuta with firm evidence of there being more than one species within genus crocuta still lacking thumb skull of crocuta sivalensis an extinct indian hyena proposed by bjorn kurten as being ancestor of modern spotted hyena both bjorn kurten and camille arambourg promoted an asiatic origin for species kurten

phylogeographic distribution of mtdna haplotypes indicates three migration events from africa to eurasia though neither topology of phylogenetic tree or fossil record exclude possibility of an asian origin earliest migration of spotted hyenas from africa to eurasia began less than 3 5 million years ago most probably from area where first spotted hyena fossils were discovered reaching east asia and most likely also pakistan second migration of spotted hyenas occurred less than 1 3 1 5 million years ago and resulted in first arrival of hyenas in europe and a separation of african spotted hyenas into a southern and a northern population third spotted hyena migration took place 0 36 million years ago starting from northern african population and reaching both europe and asia unlike other african carnivores with exception of leopard there is no evidence to suggest that spotted hyenas underwent a genetic bottleneck during pleistocene ancestors of genus crocuta diverged from hyaena genus of striped and brown hyenas 10 million years ago ancestors of spotted hyena probably developed social behaviours in response to increased pressure from other predators on carcasses which forced them to operate in teams at one point in their evolution spotted hyenas developed sharp carnassials behind their crushing premolars this rendered waiting for their prey to die no longer a necessity as is case for brown and striped hyenas and thus became pack hunters as well as scavengers they began forming increasingly larger territories necessitated by fact that their prey was often migratory and long chases in a small territory would have caused them to encroach into another clan s land it has been theorised that female dominance in spotted hyena clans could be an adaptation in order to successfully compete with males on kills and thus ensure that enough milk is produced for their cubs another theory is that it is an adaptation to length of time it takes for cubs to develop their massive skulls and jaws thus necessitating greater attention and dominating behaviours from females its appearance in europe and china during period coincided with decline and eventual extinction of brevirostris giant short faced hyena as there is no evidence of environmental change being responsible it is likely that giant short faced hyena became extinct due to competition with spotted hyena

enlarged orifice with split lips behaviour social behaviour spotted hyenas are social animals that live in large communities referred to as clans which can consist of at most 80 individuals group size varies geographically in serengeti where prey is migratory clans are smaller than those in ngorongoro crater where prey is sedentary spotted hyena clans are more compact and unified than wolf packs but are not as closely knit as those of african wild dogs females dominate males with even lowest ranking females being dominant over highest ranking males it is typical for females to remain with their natal clan thus large clans usually contain several matrilines whereas males typically disperse from their natal clan at age of 2 1 2 years clan is a fission fusion society in which clan members do not often remain together but may forage alone or in small groups high ranking hyenas maintain their position through aggression directed against lower ranking clan members spotted hyena hierarchy is nepotistic offspring of dominant females automatically outrank adult females subordinate to their mother however rank in spotted hyena cubs is greatly dependent on presence of mother low ranking adults may act aggressively toward higher ranking cubs when mother is absent although individual spotted hyenas only care for their own young and males take no part in raising their young cubs are able to identify relatives as distantly related as great aunts also males associate more closely with their own daughters rather than unrelated cubs and latter favour their fathers by acting less aggressively toward them spotted hyena societies are more complex than those of other carnivorous mammals and are remarkably similar to those of cercopithecine primates in respect to group size structure competition and cooperation like cercopithecine primates spotted hyenas use multiple sensory modalities recognise individual conspecifics are conscious that some clan mates may be more reliable than others recognise third party kin and rank relationships among clan mates and adaptively use this knowledge during social decision making also like cercopithecine primates dominance ranks in hyena societies are not correlated with size or aggression but with ally networks drea cm frank lg 2003 social complexity of spotted hyenas in animal social complexity intelligence culture and individualized societies eds de waal tyack pl pp 121 148 harvard university press cambridge massachusetts in this latter trait spotted hyena further show parallels with primates by acquiring rank through coalition however rank reversals and overthrows in spotted hyena clans are very rare social network dynamics of spotted hyenas are determined by multiple factors environmental factors include rainfall and prey abundance individual factors include preference to bond with females and with kin and topological effects include tendency to close triads in network female hyenas are more flexible than males in their social bonding preferences higher ranking adult spotted hyenas tend to have higher telomere length and therefore are healthier naturally live longer and reproduce more territory size is highly variable ranging from less than 40 km2 in ngorongoro crater to over 1 000 km2 in kalahari home ranges are defended through vocal displays scent marking and boundary patrols clans mark their territories by either pasting or pawing in special latrines located on clan range boundaries clan boundaries are usually respected hyenas chasing prey have been observed to stop dead in their tracks once their prey crosses into another clan s range hyenas will however ignore clan boundaries in times of food shortage males are more likely to enter another clan s territory than females are as they are less attached to their natal group and will leave it when in search of a mate hyenas travelling in another clan s home range typically exhibit bodily postures associated with fear particularly when meeting other hyenas an intruder can be accepted into another clan after a long period of time if it persists in wandering into clan s territory dens or kills mating reproduction and development thumb left female nursing cub amboseli national park kenya spotted hyena is a non seasonal breeder though a birth peak does occur during wet season females are polyestrous with an estrus period lasting two weeks like many species spotted hyena is promiscuous and no enduring pair bonds are formed members of both sexes may copulate with several mates over course of several years males will show submissive behaviour when approaching females in heat even if male outweighs his partner females usually favour younger males born or joined into clan after they were born older females show a similar preference with addition of preferring males with whom they have had long and friendly prior relationships livescience staff 15 august 2007 how hyenas avoid incest passive males tend to have greater success in courting females than aggressive ones it s a dog s life aggressive male hyenas fail to impress girls innovations report com 14 may 2003 copulation in spotted hyenas is a relatively short affair lasting 4 12 minutes and typically only occurs at night with no other hyenas present mating process is complicated as male s penis enters and exits female s reproductive tract through her pseudo penis rather than directly through vagina which is blocked by false scrotum and testes these unusual traits make mating more laborious for male than in other mammals while also ensuring that rape is physically impossible once female retracts her clitoris male enters female by sliding beneath her an operation facilitated by penis s upward angle once this is accomplished a typical mammalian mating posture is adopted copulation may be repeated multiple times during a period of several hours both partners usually lick their genitals for several minutes after mating thumb three cubs at

occasionally being reported males take no part in raising of young giving birth is difficult for female hyenas as females give birth through their narrow clitoris and spotted hyena cubs are largest carnivoran young relative to their mothers weight during parturition clitoris ruptures in order to facilitate passage of young and may take weeks to heal cubs are born with soft brownish black hair and weigh 1 5 kg on average unique among carnivorous mammals spotted hyenas are also born with their eyes open and with 6 7 mm long canine teeth and 4 mm long incisors also cubs will attack each other shortly after birth this is particularly apparent in same sexed litters and can result in death of weaker cub this neonatal siblicide kills an estimated 25 of all hyenas in their first month male cubs which survive grow faster and are likelier to achieve reproductive dominance while female survivors eliminate rivals for dominance in their natal clan lactating females can carry of milk in their udders spotted hyena milk has highest protein and fat content of any terrestrial carnivore cubs will nurse from their mother for 12 16 months though they can process solid food as early as three months mothers do not regurgitate food for their young females are very protective of their cubs and will not tolerate other adults particularly males approaching them spotted hyenas exhibit adult behaviours very early in life cubs have been observed to ritually sniff each other and mark their living space before age of one month within ten days of birth they are able to move at considerable speed cubs begin to lose black coat and develop spotted lighter coloured pelage of adults at 2 3 months they begin to exhibit hunting behaviours at age of eight months and will begin fully participating in group hunts after their first year spotted hyenas reach sexual maturity at age of three years average lifespan in zoos is 12 years with a maximum of 25 years denning behaviour thumb upright spotted hyena and two cubs in their den ngorongoro crater tanzania clan s social life revolves around a communal den while some clans may use particular den sites for years others may use several different dens within a year or several den sites simultaneously spotted hyena dens can have more than a dozen entrances and are mostly located on flat ground tunnels are usually oval in section being wider than they are high and narrow down from an entrance width of 1 2 1 metre 1 6 7 7 ft to as small as in rocky areas of east africa and congo spotted hyenas use caves as dens while those in serengeti use as resting areas in daylight hours dens have large bare patches around their entrances where hyenas move or lie down on because of their size adult hyenas are incapable of using full extent of their burrows as most tunnels are dug by cubs or smaller animals structure of den consisting of small underground channels is likely an effective anti predator device which protects cubs from predation during absence of mother spotted hyenas rarely dig their own dens having been observed for most part to use abandoned burrows of warthogs and jackals faeces are usually deposited away from den though they urinate wherever they happen to be dens are used mostly by several females at once and it is not uncommon to see up to 20 cubs at a single site general form of a spotted hyena den is tunnel shaped with a spacious end chamber used for sleeping or breeding this chamber measures up to in width height being rather less females generally give birth at communal den or a private birth den latter is primarily used by low status females in order to maintain continual access to their cubs as well as ensure that they become acquainted with their cubs before to communal den intelligence compared to other hyenas spotted hyena shows a greater relative amount of frontal cortex which is involved in mediation of social behavior studies strongly suggest convergent evolution in spotted hyena and primate intelligence a study done by evolutionary anthropologists demonstrated that spotted hyenas outperform chimpanzees on cooperative problem solving tests captive pairs of spotted hyenas were challenged to tug two ropes in unison to earn a food reward successfully cooperating and learning maneuvers quickly without prior training experienced hyenas even helped inexperienced clan mates to solve problem in contrast chimps and other primates often require extensive training and cooperation between individuals is not always as easy for them livescience staff 28 september 2009 hyenas surprisingly good at cooperative tasks intelligence of spotted hyena was attested to by dutch colonists in 19th century south africa who noted that hyenas were exceedingly cunning and suspicious particularly after successfully escaping from traps spotted hyenas seem to plan on hunting specific species in advance hyenas have been observed to indulge in activities such as scent marking before setting off to hunt zebras a behaviour which does not occur when they target other prey species also spotted hyenas have been recorded to utilise deceptive behaviour including giving alarm calls during feeding when no enemies are present thus frightening off other hyenas and allowing them to temporarily eat in peace similarly mothers will emit alarm calls in attempting to interrupt attacks on their cubs by other hyenas hunting behaviour unlike other large african carnivores spotted hyenas do not preferentially prey on any species and only african buffalo and giraffe are significantly avoided spotted hyenas prefer prey with a body mass range of with a mode of when hunting medium to large sized prey spotted hyenas tend to select certain categories of animal young animals are frequently targeted as are old ones though latter category is not so significant when hunting zebras due to their aggressive anti predator behaviours spotted hyena tracks live prey by sight hearing and smell carrion is detected by smell and sound of other predators feeding during daylight hours they watch vultures descending upon carcasses their auditory perception is powerful enough to detect sounds of predators killing prey or feeding on carcasses over distances of up to unlike grey wolf spotted hyena relies more on sight than smell when hunting and does not follow its prey s prints or travel in single file small prey is killed by being shaken in mouth while large prey is eaten alive spotted hyenas usually hunt wildebeest either singly or in groups of two or three they catch adult wildebeest usually after chases at speeds of up to 60 km h 37 mi h chases are usually initiated by one hyena and with exception of cows with calves there is little active defence from wildebeest herd wildebeest will sometimes attempt to escape hyenas by taking to water although in such cases hyenas almost invariably catch them zebras require different hunting methods to those used for wildebeest due to their habit of running in tight groups and aggressive defence from stallions typical zebra hunting groups consist of 10 25 hyenas though there is one record of a hyena killing an adult zebra unaided brockmann h jane snowdon charles t macedo regina 2010 behavioral ecology of tropical animals volume 42 of advances in study of behavior academic press p 206 during a chase zebras typically move in tight bunches with hyenas pursuing behind in a crescent formation chases are usually relatively slow with an average speed of 15 30 km h a stallion will attempt to place himself between hyenas and herd though once a zebra falls behind protective formation it is immediately set upon usually after a chase of though hyenas may harass stallion they usually only concentrate on herd and attempt to dodge stallion s assaults unlike stallions mares typically only react aggressively to hyenas when their foals are threatened unlike wildebeest zebras rarely take to water when escaping hyenas when hunting thomson s gazelles spotted hyenas usually operate alone and prey primarily on young fawns chases against both adult and young gazelles can cover distances of with speeds of 60 km h 37 mi h female gazelles do not defend their fawns though they may attempt to distract hyenas by feigning weakness ecology diet thumb spotted hyena with a wildebeest skeleton in arusha tanzania spotted hyena is most carnivorous member of hyaenidae unlike its brown and striped cousins spotted hyena is a predator not a scavenger this has been shown since 1960s one of earliest studies to demonstrate their hunting abilities was done by hans kruuk an african wildlife ecologist and he showed through a 7 year study of hyena populations in africa that spotted hyenas hunt as much as lions and with later studies this has been shown to be average in all areas of africa tyrants of cenozoic evolution of bone crushing hyenas and dogs youtube however spotted hyenas remain being mislabeled as scavengers often even by ecologists and wildlife documentary channels efficiency spotted hyena is very efficient at eating its prey not only is it able to splinter and eat largest ungulate bones it is also able to digest them completely spotted hyenas can digest all organic components in bones not just marrow any inorganic material is excreted with faeces which consist almost entirely of a white powder with few hairs they react to alighting vultures more readily than other african carnivores and are more likely to stay in vicinity of lion kills or human settlements prey

hyena can eat at least 14 5 kg of meat per meal and although they act aggressively toward each other when feeding they compete with each other mostly through speed of eating rather than by fighting as lions do spotted hyenas can take less than two minutes to eat a gazelle fawn while a group of 35 hyenas can completely consume an adult zebra in 36 minutes spotted hyenas do not require much water and typically only spend 30 seconds drinking when feeding on an intact carcass spotted hyenas will first consume meat around loins and anal region then open abdominal cavity and pull out soft organs once stomach its wall and contents are consumed hyenas will eat lungs and abdominal and leg muscles once muscles have been eaten carcass is disassembled and hyenas carry off pieces to eat in peace spotted

demonstrated by field experiments during which lions repeatedly approached whenever tape recorded calls of hyenas feeding were played when confronted on a kill by lions spotted hyenas will either leave or wait patiently at a distance of 30 100 metres until lions have finished eating in some cases spotted hyenas are bold enough to feed alongside lions and may occasionally force lions off a kill this mostly occurs during nighttime when hyenas are bolder spotted hyenas usually prevail against groups of lionesses unaccompanied by males if they outnumber them 4 1 in some instances they were seen to have taken on and routed two pride males while outnumbering them 5 1 pope steve 2 november 2009 hyena scavenger or predator human influence on hyena lion com two species may act aggressively toward one another even when there is no food at stake lions may charge at hyenas and maul them for no apparent reason one male lion was filmed killing two hyenas on separate occasions without eating them and lion predation can account for up to 71 of hyena deaths in etosha spotted hyenas have adapted to this pressure by frequently mobbing lions which enter their territories experiments on captive spotted hyenas revealed that specimens with no prior experience with lions act indifferently to sight of them but will react fearfully to scent cheetahs and leopards although cheetahs and leopards preferentially prey on smaller animals than those hunted by spotted hyenas hyenas will steal their kills when opportunity presents itself cheetahs are usually easily intimidated by hyenas and put up little resistance while leopards particularly males may stand up to hyenas there are records of some male leopards preying on hyenas hyenas are nonetheless dangerous opponents for leopards there is at least one record of a young adult male leopard dying from a sepsis infection caused by wounds inflicted by a spotted hyena there is also a case of two spotted hyenas killing and eating a young leopard

confronting african wild dogs sabi sand game reserve spotted hyenas will follow packs of african wild dogs in order to appropriate their kills they will typically inspect areas where wild dogs have rested and eat any food remains they find when approaching wild dogs at a kill solitary hyenas will approach cautiously and attempt to take off with a piece of meat unnoticed though they may be mobbed by dogs in attempt when operating in groups spotted hyenas are more successful in pirating dog kills though dog s greater tendency to assist each other puts them at an advantage against spotted hyenas who rarely work in unison cases of dogs scavenging from spotted hyenas are rare although wild dog packs can easily repel solitary hyenas on whole relationship between two species is a one sided

spotted hyenas in kalahari where brown outnumber spotted two species typically encounter each other on carcasses which larger spotted species usually appropriate sometimes brown hyenas will stand their ground and raise their manes while emitting growls this usually has effect of seemingly confusing spotted hyenas which will act bewildered though they will occasionally attack and maul their

neutral though it will change position according to situation when a high tendency to flee an attacker is apparent tail is curled below belly during an attack or when excited tail is carried forward on back an erect tail does not always accompany a hostile encounter as it has also been observed to occur when a harmless social interaction occurs although they do not wag their tails spotted hyenas will flick their tails when approaching dominant animals or when there is a slight tendency to flee when approaching a dominant animal subordinate spotted hyenas will walk on knees of their forelegs in submission greeting ceremonies among clan members consist of two individuals standing parallel to each other and facing opposite directions both individuals raise their hind legs and lick each other s anogenital area during these greeting ceremonies penis or pseudo penis often becomes erect in both males and females erection is usually a sign of submission rather than dominance and is more common in males than in females vocalisations spotted hyena has an extensive vocal range with sounds ranging from whoops fast whoops grunts groans lows giggles yells growls soft grunt laughs loud grunt laughs whines and soft squeals loud who oop call along with maniacal laughter are among most recognisable sounds of africa typically very high pitched calls indicate fear or submission while

believe hyenas presence keeps devils at bay and associate mystical properties such as fortune telling to them bierbaum bernd 2011 in ethiopia bod books on demand p 45 in western culture traditional western beliefs about spotted hyena can be traced back to aristotle s historia animalium which described species as a necrophagous cowardly and potentially dangerous animal he further described how hyena uses retching noises to attract dogs in on generation of animals aristotle criticised erroneous belief that spotted hyena is a hermaphrodite which likely originated from confusion caused by genitalia of female though his physical descriptions are more consistent with striped hyena pliny elder supported aristotle s depiction though he further elaborated that hyena can imitate human voices additionally he wrote how hyena was held in high regard among magi and that hyena body parts could cure different diseases give protection and stimulate sexual desire in people author of physiologus who infused pagan tales with spirit of christian moral and mystical teaching reactivated myth that hyena is a hermaphrodite author compared species to double minded men who are neither man nor woman that is neither faithful nor unfaithful he further states that sons of israel are like this animal since in beginning they served living god but later given over to pleasure and lust they adored idols bestiaries of middle ages embraced physiologus s descriptions but further elaborated on animal s necrophagous habits these bestiaries almost invariably depict hyenas feeding on human corpses these illustrations were largely based on descriptions given by aristotle and pliny though animals have no spots or other bodily markings thus making it unlikely that authors had ever seen hyenas first hand during 15th and 16th centuries travellers to africa provided further descriptions of species leo africanus repeated some of old concepts on hyena with addition of describing its legs and feet as similar to those of men in 1551 swiss naturalist conrad gesner rejected belief of hyena s hermaphroditism and theorised that it originated from confusion over an androgynous fish bearing same name he adds three other animals within category of hyenas including an ethiopian quadruped named which was thought to be a hybrid between a hyena and a lioness sir thomas browne also argued against hyena s supposed hermaphroditism stating that all animals follow their own law of coition and that a hermaphrodite would transgress this sir walter raleigh in an attempt to rationalise how noah s ark could have fitted all extant species of animal wrote that hyenas were hybrids between foxes and wolves which originated after great flood references to spotted hyena s vocalisations are referenced in numerous contemporary examples of english literature including shakespeare s as you like it and george chapman s eastward ho john milton in his samson agonistes compares species to natural historians of 18th and 19th centuries rejected stories of hermaphroditism in hyenas and recognised differences between spotted and striped hyena however they continued to focus on species scavenging habits their potential to rob graves and their perceived cowardice during 20th century western and african stereotypes of spotted hyena converged in both ernest hemingway s green hills of africa and disney s lion

hyenas to reach 15 20 years of age nevertheless spotted hyena was historically scantily represented in zoos and was typically obtained in order to fill empty cages until a more prestigious species could be obtained in subsequent years animals considered to be more charismatic were allocated larger and better quality facilities while hyenas were often relegated to inferior exhibits in modern times species faces spatial competition from more popular animals especially large canids also many captive individuals have not been closely examined to confirm their sexes thus resulting in non breeding pairs often turning out to be same sexed individuals as a result many captive hyena populations are facing extinction during 19th century species was frequently displayed in travelling
