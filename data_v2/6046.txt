zoo station is a song by irish rock band u2 it is opening track from their 1991 album achtung baby a record on which group reinvented themselves musically by incorporating influences from alternative rock industrial and electronic dance music as album s opening track zoo station introduces band s new sound delivering industrial influenced percussion and several layers of distorted guitars and vocals similarly lyrics suggest group s new intents and anticipations introduction featuring an explosion of percussion and a descending glissando for a guitar hook was meant to make listener think album was mistakenly not u2 s latest record or that their music player was broken song s lyrics were inspired by a surrealistic story about berlin from world war ii that lead vocalist bono heard when overnight bombing damaged zoo and allowed animals to escape and wander around city s rubble bono was also inspired by city s berlin zoologischer garten railway station and used it as a metaphor for a reuniting germany zoo station was performed as opening song at every concert on u2 s zoo tv tour song received positive reviews from critics many of whom analysed song as a representation of band s reinvention writing and recording following difficult recording sessions at hansa studios in berlin in late 1990 u2 undertook second phase of recording sessions for achtung baby in dublin mccormick 2006 pp 224 225 232 they struggled with song lady with spinning head later released as a b side but three separate tracks zoo station ultraviolet light my way and fly were derived from it band ultimately decided to take zoo station in a more industrial direction than lady with spinning head thumb right alt exterior of a railway station at night a rectangular building on right has 2 of its sides visible both of their walls windowed a shorter connecting structure on left is suspended over a street and lined with advertisements berlin zoologischer garten railway station colloquially called bahnhof zoo zoo station in germany partially inspired song s lyrics zoo station came together near end of recording sessions when audio engineer flood was mixing song and introduced distortion to drums song s direction was largely influenced by production team of daniel lanois brian eno and flood lead vocalist bono had been disappointed with his vocals from early recording sessions for album and told production team let s just try something that s gonna put me in a completely different place stokes 2005 p 96 after they distorted his voice to make it sound as if it were coming from a megaphone bono was inspired to sing in a persona as effect gave his vocals a different emotional feel flood mixed final track with assistance of shannon strong along with robbie adams strong also assisted flood with engineering lanois provided additional guitar during recording with achtung baby group sought to recover some of dadaist characters and stage antics they had dabbled with in late 1970s as teenagers u2 had abandoned these ideas for more literal themes in 1980s however for new album band was interested in no longer making obvious sense accordingly lyrics for zoo station were inspired by surrealism of a story about berlin during world war ii that bono heard animals escaped city s zoo after it was damaged in overnight bombing and as a result rhinoceroses pelicans and flamingoes wandered around next morning while people were sifting through rubble bono was also inspired by berlin zoologischer garten railway station also known as zoo station previously main railway station in west berlin station was notorious as a haunt for drug dealers prostitutes and pimps pick pockets and transients particularly prior to german reunification when it was run by east german railway he compared song to station saying it was written as an opening track beasts breaking out of their cages and was interested in using zoo as a metaphor and he took further inspiration from subway station representing europe at a crossroads during recording eno created several prototype mixes of song edge recalled how these different mixes assisted band in creating final version of track one of these early versions was later released under title bottoms watashitachi no ookina yume as a bonus track on uk and japanese promotional releases of experimental 1995 album original soundtracks 1 by passengers a side project by u2 and eno as well as a b side on some versions of miss sarajevo single bottoms watashitachi no ookina yume is an instrumental track and was described by edge as a crazy mix stokes 2005 p 194 he added bottoms was done in japan and we just built on that mix sometimes you can end up with something completely distinctive although zoo station was not released as a single it was included on a 12 inch promotional recording to promote u2 s zoo tv tour in north america along with studio and remix versions of lady with spinning head composition as first track on an album that was a major reinvention for band zoo station was an introduction to u2 s new sound song features layers of distorted guitar and vocals and industrial influenced percussion irish rock journalist bill graham cites david bowie s album low as a major influence on zoo station which he called a new brand of glam rock with spartan rhythms and sudden flurries of melody graham 2004 pp 43 47 song is played at a tempo of 130 beats per minute in a 4 4 time signature but only one element of song s introduction a marimba like texture is played in common time fast 2000 pp 45 48 this sound which has been compared to that of a clock ticking was achieved by picking guitar s d string behind bridge and on second half of third beat song s signature guitar riff a distorted descending glissando enters glissando descends past octave it begins in by a major second before returning to it after second time it is played an explosion of percussion is heard playing on beat four of every second measure on two occasions this percussion sound played by flood enters early third time being played on beat two assayas 2005 p 75 drums then enter before stopping and starting again much like song s guitar sounds drums timbre is noticeably different from previous u2 songs as it exhibits a cold processed sound something like beating on a tin can zak 2001 pp 68 70 amidst layers of various guitar sounds bass enters part played in introduction and verses consisting of repeating g and a notes mimicking ascending portion of guitar riff after glissando overshoots octave after bass begins song s regular groove is established at 0 45 chord progression changes fifteen seconds later song returns to previous chord progression and introduction ends guitarist edge explained that some of sounds in introduction that resemble keyboards were actually created by him on guitar of song s introduction bassist adam clayton says when people put on record we wanted their first reaction to be either this record is broken or this can t be new u2 record there s been a mistake so there is quite a dramatic extended intro where you just don t know what you are listening to author albin zak in his book poetics of rock says of introduction before any words are sung sounds alone alert listener that band has moved into new expressive territory after introduction song follows a conventional verse chorus form first verse begins one minute into song with bono announcing i m ready i m ready for laughing gas during verses he sings primarily in a medium to low range and his vocals are treated with heavy processing which takes out bottom of sound and s his voice processing also introduces a wavering quality to his vocals guitar glissando continues to be played during verses first chorus begins at 1 44 and music mirrors change in chord progression from introduction s last 15 seconds during chorus bassline becomes more dynamic playing descending quarter notes of g f d c d c a g a before resuming previous g and a pattern bono s vocals also become more dynamic in chorus featuring layers of both open throated singing and monotone lyric recitation as well as both processed and unprocessed vocals along with introducing band s new sound song opens album as a statement of intent lyrically new anticipations and appetites are suggested i m ready for what s next as is a willingness to throw caution to wind and take risks i m ready to let go of steering wheel some of lyrics particularly those in bridge before final chorus use eponymous subway station as a metaphor for time time is a train makes future past leaves you standing in station your face pressed up against glass bono cites enjoyment of his first child born in 1989 as a major influence on achtung baby as was his wife s second pregnancy during album s 1991 recording bono says babies influenced lines from first verse i m ready to say i m glad to be alive i m ready i m ready for push mccormick 2006 pp 216 221 reception and legacy upon release of achtung baby zoo station was praised by many critics steve morse of boston globe said song was one on which sonic assaults are teamed with dreamily processed vocals that recall beatles psychedelia orlando sentinel called it blistering and praised low mixing of bono s vocals which allowed edge s new versatility on guitar to draw more attention bbc music enjoyed edge s guitar squall and electronics creating a dense sound that is irresistible noting that zoo station was one track where strategy creates moods rather than hummable tunes jon pareles of new york times stated that song announces a change starting with a metallic clank a buzzing guitar slide and a repeated electronic crunch nothing ethereal he also noted that bono s voice was electronically masked and band s old style traded for a pushy bassline and a percussive stomp although u2 can t resist some sweeter interludes rolling stone was complimentary of edge comparing his style of guitar playing on song to using a rhythm instrument by repeating a dark buzzing phrase that drives beat allmusic reviewed track favourably saying there are layers to bono s lyrics and that by end of track song and band are soaring greg kot of chicago tribune likened song s introduction to trying to out demolish ministry with grating metal on metal percussion and a belching guitar he commented that rude awakening that song provides on album as opening track could only compare with fingernails on chalkboard guitar scuzz of neil young s hey hey my my into black from rust never sleeps song subsequently appeared as one of seven u2 songs in 2006 music reference book 1001 songs great songs of all time and artists stories and secrets creswell 2006 pp 377 378 zoo station is
