choosing songs which worked well together phantom power was recorded at band s own studio av happenings in cardiff with super furries producing and engineering themselves for first time album features

of band s career origins and recording phantom power was originally conceived as a ten song cycle in unconventional d a d d a d guitar tuning singer gruff rhys wrote many of songs on album in this tuning and in key of d major during space of a few days these tracks which included father father instrumentals golden retriever hello sunshine valet parking and out of control were then demoed at house of regular producer gorwel owen with overdubs added at band s own office block based studio av happenings in cardiff group took a hands on approach to actual recording sessions for phantom power engineering and producing themselves for first time recording largely took place at av happenings during second half of 2002 with band working through night so as not to disturb staff who worked in other parts of building during day according to bassist guto pryce this involved a fair amount of trial and error as band didn t really know what they were doing soundproof booths were improvised by setting up tents in office corridors we d record a guitar and it d sound rubbish and we had to figure out why so we started experimenting with different tent designs in end it was wigwam that was easiest to put up and sounded best band had to take these booths down before office workers arrived in morning a process that guitarist huw bunford has described as ghosts in night a bit clandestine a brief two week session with gorwel owen at rockfield studios saw some of album s more straight ahead tracks recorded with live vocals before band returned to av happenings and messed around with them when album was almost finished band enlisted services of tony doogan who engineered sessions during which several vocal parts were recorded right thumb alt huw bunford playing guitar while looking to his right away from camera guitarist has a large beard and is wearing a brown jacket huw bunford wrote track sex war robots for phantom power and also provided lead vocals ten song d a d d a d concept was eventually abandoned with pryce stating we don t like constraining ourselves and if you ve got a concept you re doing that and we had some other really nice tunes so we just chose best songs according to rhys only plan group stuck to was to make a more coherent record in past we d put ideas kind of side by side and on this record we wanted all those sounds to be more blended following arguments over track listing of previous album rings around world after a lot of songs were recorded necessitating four months worth of discussions about which tracks to leave off record group recorded just 16 largely acoustic based songs during sessions for phantom power rhys s initial batch of songs were augmented by among others huw bunford penned sex war robots first time guitarist had had one of his songs included on a super furry animals album and also first time he had sung lead vocals for group slow life which grew out of an electronic piece of music keyboardist cian ciaran had been working on for several years and piccolo snare which was partly written in studio music after more produced rings around world which relied heavily on computers and electronics group were keen to make phantom power a little more human with guitarist huw bunford stating with technology you can do anything these days but sometimes less is more many songs on album are acoustic based and bass player guto pryce has claimed that they sounded pretty good right from start which also contributed to decision to avoid over tweak ing them in studio despite this group did work electronic loops into several tracks after ciaran bought a large number of sound effect and light music vinyl records from a man who worked in same building according to rhys he knocked on door just as we were beginning album hey i ve got these records to sell are ya interested and cian went down to check them out and gave him a hundred pounds on spot and carried 700 albums back to our tiny room album showcases an eclectic range of sounds from country rock of sex war robots featuring pedal steel guitar to heavy metal and punk of out of control and glam rock of first single golden retriever slow life a track which singer gruff rhys has described as most sonically impressive song on phantom power features techno influences and is based on a piece of electronic music written by keyboardist cian ciaran several years earlier ciaran encouraged band to jam on top of his original track to produce a fusion of techno and guitar pop undefeated is inspired by ska and reggae music although group removed a cheesy white reggae section from song because it sounded fucking horrible and actively tried not to make it sound too much like a ska or reggae track as they felt they couldn t pull it off many tracks feature close vocal harmonies with all band apart from pryce contributing these harmonies give album a california west coast of america feel with comparisons being drawn to work of beach boys particularly on song venus and serena lyrical themes right thumb chief lyricist gruff rhys describes phantom power as a record about broken relationships and war with a positive outlook to future singer and chief lyric writer gruff rhys has claimed that phantom power is about broken relationships and war with a positive outlook to future as bbc news 24 addicts rhys and band absorbed fucked up war images from iraq war during making of album which affected way songs were written we seem to be living in such a heavy time we re just absorbing all words thrown at us from tv and regurgitating them back frustration with george bush administration and its foreign policy influenced record with rhys claiming that he feels qualified to address subject as united states foreign policy effectively decides what foreign policy is in uk two most overtly political tracks on phantom power are piccolo snare and liberty belle piccolo snare is about societies torn apart by war and waste of human life track uses vocabulary of falklands war skyhawks etc but rhys claims it is applicable to any war liberty belle tells story of two cartoon characters devised by rhys liberty belle and memory lane former representing bells of freedom specifically american dream and latter representing history s harsh lessons which liberty belle has failed to learn song is told from perspective of a bird living almost in a parallel universe to humans oblivious to gravity of games which are being played around us something which rhys admits to feeling himself much of time venus and serena uses a story of a child who talks to his pet tortoises venus and serena as he can t communicate with his elders to make a similar point that people feel alienated from their elected leaders both out of control and slow life feature regurgitated media buzzwords with out of control s flippant lyrics designed to create feel of an over dramatic theme to a current affairs programme bleed forever deals specifically with nuclear fallout from chernobyl disaster which fell over north wales allegedly causing an increase in incidents of leukaemia among children in area however rhys has been keen to point out that record is not a forcefully political one claiming that most of band s songs are fragments of daily life occasionally politics are a part of that super furry animals is about exploration not political campaigning valet parking for example is a song about glories of pan european travel documenting a road trip from cardiff to vilnius golden retriever is about relationship between gruff rhys s girlfriend s two dogs a male and a female and undefeated inspired by a poor run of results for welsh football team is about underdogs and dvd dvd of phantom power contains 14 songs featured on cd version of album in surround sound 16 remixes commentary by mario caldato jr who mixed record and provided one of remixes and song lyrics according to singer gruff rhys concept behind dvd was based on success of platform games listener can play album as if it were a game and spend months instead of weeks exploring content unlike dvd version of previous album rings around world which featured videos for every track songs on dvd are accompanied by slowly moving animations rhys has stated that super furry animals wanted to use really bland images as viewers began to place too much emphasis on videos on rings around world and band wanted them to concentrate on music keyboardist cian ciaran stated at time of phantom power s release that band would issue a dvd with every future album claiming that this is just way we make records now however band s next two albums love kraft and hey venus were not made available on dvd and in a 2008 interview with uncut rhys suggested that release had been something of a failure no one gave a shit because people just want to rock n roll remixes on dvd version of phantom power vary from radical reworkings such as killa kella s beatbox treatment of golden retriever and wauvenfold s unrecognisable version of sex war and robots to likes of mario caldato jr s take on liberty belle and high llamas valet parking which are merely up majority of remixes were reissued on cd as album phantom phorce in 2004 according to drummer dafydd ieuan band didn t have money to pay artists involved for their remix work so in order to provide them with royalties promised
