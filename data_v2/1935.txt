dynasty from whose reign coins are known rekaya 1986 pp 68 1993 pp 541 2008 pp 312 313 according to traditional account dabuyids had established themselves as autonomous rulers of tabaristan in 640s during tumults of muslim conquest of persia and collapse of sassanid empire they owed only payment tribute and nominal vassalage to arab caliphate and managed despite repeated muslim attempts at invasion to maintain their autonomy by exploiting inaccessible terrain of their country madelung 1975 pp 198 199 a more recent interpretation of sources by p pourshariati however supports that farrukhan was one who actually established family s rule over tabaristan sometime in 670s pourshariati 2008 pp 308 313 in earlier works on dynasty khurshid is named khurshid ii due to erroneous interpretation of numismatic evidence which led earlier scholars to interpolate a first khurshid before farrukhan whose rule was thought to have begun ca 710 khurshid succeeded his father at age of only six and for eight years regency was exercised by his uncle farrukhan i kuchak farrukhan little when khurshid came of age farrukhan s own sons refused to recognize his claim and tried to usurp

rebelling against caliph marwan ii r 744 750 and even sending an embassy to tang court in 746 which recognized him king hu lu ban as a vassal prince during abbasid revolution however he was forced to submit to abbasid armies under abu muslim as one of abu muslim s vassals he supported latter in his quarrel with caliph al mansur r 754 775 after caliph had abu muslim murdered in 755 khurshid supported anti abbasid rebellion of sunbadh who entrusted part of abu muslim s treasure to khurshid s keeping when sunbadh s revolt was defeated sunbadh fled to tabaristan but was killed there by one of khurshid s cousins ostensibly because he had failed to show man proper respect it is possible however that murder was instigated by khurshid in hope of acquiring remainder of abu muslim s treasure pourshariati 2008 pp 314 315 al mansur sent his son and heir al mahdi r 775 785 to recover treasure of abu muslim khurshid denied having it and al mansur tried to unseat khurshid by crowning one of his cousins as ispahbadh this did not have desired effect of challenging loyalty of khurshid s subjects but khurshid was eventually forced to accommodate abbasids by accepting an increase in annual tribute which brought it to level paid to sassanids madelung 1975 pp 199 200pourshariati 2008 p 316 soon after nevertheless khurshid took advantage of rebellion of abd al ibn abd al rahman governor of

tabaristan became a regular province of caliphate ruled from amul by an arab governor although local dynasties of bavandids and formerly subject to dabuyids continued to control mountainous interior as tributary vassals of abbasid government coins were minted in tabaristan in khurshid s name until 764 whereafter name of abbasid governor was substituted as a result some earlier works also mention 767 as date of khurshid s death family after their capture khurshid s sons crown prince dadmihr hormozd and hormozd received arabic names but otherwise their fate is unknown according to chinese sources on other hand one of them was on embassy in tang court at time tabaristan was conquered khurshid s daughters were distributed as concubines to members of abbasid dynasty names and genealogy of
