roman parthian war of 58 63 or war of armenian succession was fought between roman empire and parthian empire over control of armenia a vital buffer state between two realms armenia had been a roman client state since days of emperor augustus but in 52 53 parthians succeeded in installing their own candidate tiridates on armenian throne these events coincided with accession of nero to imperial throne in rome and young emperor decided to react vigorously war which was only major foreign campaign of his reign began with rapid success for roman forces led by able general gnaeus domitius corbulo they overcame forces loyal to tiridates installed their own candidate tigranes vi on armenian throne and left country romans were aided by fact that parthian king vologases was embroiled in suppression of a series of revolts in his own country as soon as these had been dealt with however parthians turned their attention to armenia and after a couple of years of inconclusive campaigning inflicted a heavy defeat on romans in battle of rhandeia conflict ended soon after in an effective stalemate and a formal compromise a parthian prince of arsacid line would henceforth sit on armenian throne but his nomination had to be approved by roman emperor bivar 1983 p 85 this conflict was first direct confrontation between parthia and romans since crassus disastrous expedition and mark antony s campaigns a century earlier and would be first of a long series of wars between rome and iranian powers over armenia see roman persian wars bivar 1983 p 80 background ever since expanding roman republic and parthian empire had come into contact in mid 1st century bc there had been friction between two great powers of near east over control of various states lying between them largest and most important of these was kingdom of armenia in 20 bc augustus succeeded in establishing a roman protectorate over country when tigranes iii was enthroned as king of armenia roman influence was secured through a series of roman sponsored kings until 37 ad when a parthian supported candidate orodes assumed throne roman supported king mithridates recovered his throne with support of emperor claudius in 42 ad bivar 1983 p 76 but was deposed in 51 ad by his nephew rhadamistus of iberia his rule quickly became unpopular however and this gave newly crowned king vologases i of parthia opportunity to intervene bivar 1983 p 79 his forces quickly seized two capitals of armenia artaxata and tigranocerta and put his younger brother tiridates on throne onset of a bitter winter and outbreak of an epidemic forced parthian forces to withdraw allowing rhadamistus to retake control of country his behavior towards his subjects however was even worse than before and they rose in rebellion against him thus in 54 ad rhadamistus fled to his father s court in iberia and tiridates re established himself in armenia tacitus annales xii 50 51 in same year in rome emperor claudius died and was succeeded by his stepson nero parthian encroachment in an area regarded as lying within roman sphere of influence worried roman leadership and was widely seen as a major test of new emperor s ability tacitus annales xiii 6 nero reacted vigorously appointing gnaeus domitius corbulo a general who had distinguished himself in germania and now served as governor of asia to supreme command in east tacitus annales xiii 7 8 diplomatic maneuvers and preparations thumb right 300px armenia and roman east in ca 50 ad before outbreak of war corbulo was given control over two provinces cappadocia and galatia modern day central turkey with and later proconsular authority or imperium goldsworthy 2007 p 309 although galatia was considered a good recruiting ground and cappadocia had a few units of auxiliaries bulk of his army came from syria where half garrison of four legions and several units of auxiliaries was transferred to his command tacitus annales xiii 8 initially romans hoped to resolve situation by diplomatic means corbulo and ummidius quadratus governor of syria both sent embassies to vologases proposing that he give up hostages as was customary during negotiations to ensure good faith tacitus annales xiii 9 vologases himself preoccupied by revolt of his son which forced him to withdraw his troops from armenia readily complied bivar 1983 p 81 a period of inactivity ensued while armenian issue remained in limbo corbulo used this lull to restore his troops discipline and combat readiness which had diminished in peaceful garrisons of east goldsworthy 2007 p 311 according to tacitus corbulo discharged all who were old or in ill health kept entire army under canvas in harsh winters of anatolian plateau to acclimatize them to snows of armenia and enforced a strict discipline punishing deserters by death at same time however he took care to be constantly present amongst his men sharing their hardships tacitus annales xiii 35 in meantime tiridates backed by his brother refused to go to rome and even engaged in operations against those armenians whom he deemed were loyal to rome tacitus annales xiii 37 tension mounted and finally in early spring of 58 war broke out outbreak of war roman offensive corbulo had placed a large number of his auxiliaries in a line of forts near armenian frontier under a former primus pilus disobeying corbulo s orders he used some newly arrived auxiliary cavalry alae to stage a raid against armenians who appeared to be unprepared in event his raid failed and retreating troops even spread their panic amongst garrisons of other forts tacitus annales xiii 36 it was an inauspicious start for a campaign and corbulo severely punished survivors and their commanders having drilled his army for two years corbulo despite this misadventure was ready he had three legions at his disposal iii gallica and vi ferrata from syria and iv scythica goldsworthy 2007 p 312 to which were added a large number of auxiliaries and allied contingents from eastern client kings like of lesser armenia and polemon ii of pontus situation was furthermore favorable to romans vologases faced a serious revolt by hyrcanians in region of caspian sea as well as incursions of and nomads from central asia and was unable to support his brother war thus far had featured mostly skirmishing along roman armenian border corbulo tried to protect pro roman armenian settlements from attack and simultaneously retaliated against parthians supporters given that tiridates avoided confrontation in a pitched battle corbulo divided his force so that they could attack several places simultaneously and instructed his allies kings antiochus iv of commagene and i of iberia to raid armenia from their own territories in addition an alliance was concluded with a tribe living in northwestern armenia tiridates reacted by sending envoys to ask why he was under attack since hostages had been given to this corbulo reiterated demand to seek recognition of his crown from nero eventually two sides agreed on a meeting tiridates announced that he would bring 1 000 men to meeting implying that corbulo should bring same number of men in peaceful fashion without breastplates and helmets tacitus suggests that tiridates intended to overwhelm romans as parthian cavalry would be superior to an equal number of roman infantry in any case tacitus annales xiii 38 at any rate in a show of force corbulo decided to take with him larger part of his force not only iv ferrata but also 3 000 men from iii gallica plus auxiliaries tiridates also appeared at agreed site but seeing romans in full battle array and in turn distrusting their intentions he did not come closer and withdrew during night tacitus annales xiii 39 tiridates then resorted to a tactic that had worked well a century earlier against mark antony he sent forces to raid roman army s supply route which stretched over mountains back to in black sea they failed however since romans had taken care to secure mountain routes by a series of forts goldsworthy 2007 p 314 fall of artaxata thumb right 300px operations during first two years of war corbulo s invasion and conquest of armenia corbulo now resolved to directly attack tiridates fortified strongholds not only were they instrumental in controlling surrounding country and sources of revenue and soldiers but in addition a threat to them might force tiridates to risk a pitched battle since in words of historian a goldsworthy a king who could not defend communities loyal to him lost prestige goldsworthy 2007 p 315 corbulo and his subordinates successfully stormed three of these forts including possibly modern igdir southern 2007 p 301 strongest of all in that province according to tacitus within a day with minimal casualties and massacred their garrisons terrified by this display of roman might several towns and villages surrendered and romans prepared to move against northern armenian capital artaxata this forced tiridates to confront romans with his army as they approached artaxata roman force reinforced by a vexillatio of x fretensis marched in a hollow square with legions supported by auxiliary horsemen and foot archers roman soldiers were under strict orders not to break formation and despite repeated probing attacks and feigned retreats by parthian horse archers they held together until nightfall tacitus annales xiii 40 during night tiridates withdrew his army abandoning his capital its inhabitants promptly surrendered and were allowed to leave unmolested but city was torched since romans could not spare sufficient men for garrisoning it tacitus annales xiii 41 fall of tigranocerta in 59 romans marched to south towards tigranocerta armenia s second capital city on their way corbulo s men punished those who withstood or hid from them while leniency was shown to those who surrendered tacitus annales xiv 23 in harsh dry terrain of northern mesopotamia army suffered from lack of provisions especially water until they reached more fertile areas near tigranocerta during that time a plot to murder corbulo was uncovered and suppressed several armenian nobles who had joined roman camp were implicated and executed tacitus annales xiv 24 according to a story provided by frontinus when roman army arrived at tigranocerta they launched severed head of one of conspirators into city by chance it landed right where city council was assembled they immediately decided to surrender city which was consequently spared frontinus ii 9 5 shortly after an attempt by parthian army under king vologases to enter armenia was blocked by severus commander of auxiliaries tacitus annales xiv 26 romans were now in control of armenia and they promptly installed its new king tigranes vi last descendant of cappadocian royal house in tigranocerta some outlying western parts of armenia were also ceded to roman vassals corbulo left 1 000 legionaries three auxiliary cohorts and two cavalry alae ca 3 4 000 men behind to support new monarch and retired with rest of his army to syria governorship of which he now in 60 ad assumed as a reward for his success parthian counterattack thumb 200px right relief depicting a parthian horse archer highly skilled and mobile they formed backbone of parthian army in combination with heavy cataphract cavalry they formed a very effective force that had already annihilated a roman army at carrhae goldsworthy 2007 pp 305 306 romans were well aware that their victory was still fragile and that as soon as parthian king had dealt with rebellion he would turn his attention to armenia despite vologases reluctance to risk an all out conflict with rome in end he was forced to act when tigranes raided parthian province of adiabene in 61 enraged protests of its governor and his pleas for protection could not be ignored by vologases whose prestige and royal authority were at stake tacitus annales xv 1 vologases therefore hastily concluded a treaty with hyrcanians so as to be free to campaign against rome and called an assembly of grandees of his realm there he publicly reaffirmed tiridates position as king of armenia by crowning him with a diadem in order to reinstall his brother on armenian throne parthian king assembled a force of picked cavalry under monaeses complemented by infantry from adiabene tacitus annales xv 2 in response corbulo sent legions iv scythica and xii fulminata to armenia while he detailed three other legions under his command iii gallica vi ferrata and xv apollinaris to fortify line of river euphrates fearing that parthians might invade syria at same time he petitioned nero to appoint a separate legate for cappadocia with responsibility for conducting war in armenia goldsworthy 2007 pp 318 319 parthian siege of tigranocerta monaeses meanwhile entered armenia and approached tigranocerta tigranes had taken care to gather supplies and city was well fortified and garrisoned with romans and armenians alike siege was largely undertaken by contingent since parthians being cavalrymen were unskilled and unwilling to engage in goldsworthy 2007 p 319 parthian assault failed and was driven back with loss by a successful roman sally tacitus annales xv 4 at this point corbulo sent an envoy to vologases who had encamped with his court at nisibis near tigranocerta and roman parthian border failed siege and a shortage of fodder for his cavalry forced vologases to agree to withdraw monaeses from armenia tacitus annales xv 5 at same time however romans also left armenia which according to tacitus raised suspicions as to corbulo s motives some whispered that he had reached an agreement of mutual withdrawal with parthians and that he was unwilling to risk his reputation by renewing hostilities against them tacitus annales xv 6 at any rate a truce was arranged and a parthian embassy was dispatched to rome negotiations failed to reach an agreement and war was resumed in spring of 62 tacitus annales xv 7 in meantime asked for legate for cappadocia had arrived in person of lucius caesennius paetus consul of previous year 61 ad army was divided between him and corbulo with iv scythica xii fulminata newly arrived v macedonica and auxiliaries from pontus galatia and cappadocia going to paetus while corbulo retained iii gallica vi ferrata and x fretensis because of their competition for glory relations between two roman commanders were strained from beginning it is notable that corbulo kept legions with which he had spent past few years campaigning and gave his colleague who after all was expected to conduct main campaign more inexperienced units goldsworthy 2007 p 320 total roman force arrayed against parthians was nevertheless considerable six legions alone totaled some 30 000 men exact number and disposition of auxiliary units is unclear but there were seven cavalry alae and seven infantry cohorts in syria alone comprising a force of 7 9 000 troops sartre 2005 p 61 battle of rhandeia thumb 200px right silver coin of vologases i king of parthia paetus nonetheless appeared confident of victory and followed parthian declaration of war and capture of tigranocerta with his own invasion of armenia tacitus annales xv 8 while corbulo remained at syria further strengthening fortifications in euphrates frontier tacitus annales xv 9 paetus had only two legions with him iv scythica and xii fulminata and advanced towards tigranocerta a few minor forts were taken but a lack of supplies forced him to withdraw westwards for winter parthians had originally intended to invade syria but corbulo put on a convincing display of military might building a strong flotilla of ships equipped with catapults and a bridge over euphrates which allowed him to establish a foothold on parthian shore therefore parthians abandoned their plans for syria and turned their attention towards armenia there paetus had dispersed his forces and granted extended leaves to his officers so that he was taken unawares at parthian advance upon learning of it he initially advanced to meet vologases but after a reconnaissance detachment was defeated he panicked and withdrew hastily paetus sent his wife and son to safety in fortress of arsamosata and tried to block parthian advance by occupying passes of taurus mountains with detachments from his army tacitus annales xv 10 in so doing however he further dispersed his forces which were then defeated in detail by parthians roman morale plunged and panic set in among army which was now besieged in a series of hastily erected camps near rhandeia paetus who appears to have fallen into desperate inactivity sent urgent messages to corbulo to come to his rescue tacitus annales xv 11 thumb left 300px operations during final years of war raids of tigranes into parthian territory provoked a parthian counterattack which culminated in surrender of roman army of l caesennius paetus corbulo in meantime had been aware of danger faced by his colleague and put part of his forces on standby but he did not march to join paetus and some accused him of delaying in order to reap more glory from rescuing him nevertheless when calls for assistance arrived he responded quickly and marched forth with half of syrian army carrying many provisions laden on camels he soon met dispersed men of paetus army and managed to rally them around his force tacitus annales xv 12 but before he could arrive to rescue paetus had capitulated parthians aware that relief was nearing increasingly harassed romans until paetus was forced to send a letter to vologases to seek terms tacitus annales xv 13 14 subsequent treaty was humiliating not only would romans leave armenia and surrender all forts they held but they also agreed to build a bridge over nearby arsanias river over which vologases could pass in triumph sitting atop an elephant cassius dio historia romana lxii 21 in addition roman army was liberally plundered by armenians who took even romans weapons and clothes without facing any resistance still worse according to rumors reported by tacitus romans were made to pass under yoke a gesture of ultimate humiliation in roman eyes tacitus annales xv 14 15 two roman forces met on banks of euphrates near melitene amidst scenes of mutual grief tacitus annales xv 16 while corbulo lamented undoing of his achievements paetus tried to convince him to attempt to reverse situation by invading armenia corbulo however refused claiming that he did not have authority to do so and that either way army was too worn out to be able to campaign effectively tacitus annales xv 17 in end paetus retired to cappadocia and corbulo to syria where he received envoys from vologases who demanded that he evacuate his bridgehead over euphrates in turn corbulo demanded parthian evacuation of armenia vologases agreed to this and both sides withdrew their forces leaving armenia once again masterless but de facto under parthian control until a parthian delegation could travel to rome corbulo s return and peace settlement rome meanwhile appears to have been largely unaware of real situation in armenia tacitus records that trophies for parthian war and arches were erected in center of capitoline hill by decree of senate even while war was not yet decided tacitus annales xv 18 whatever illusions roman leadership had they were shattered by arrival of parthian delegation to rome in spring of 63 their demands and subsequent interrogation of centurion who accompanied them revealed to nero and senate true extent of disaster which paetus had concealed in his dispatches tacitus annales xv 25 nevertheless in words of tacitus romans decided to accept a dangerous war over a disgraceful peace paetus was recalled and corbulo placed again in charge of campaign into armenia with extraordinary imperium which placed him above all other governors and client rulers in east corbulo s post as governor of syria was entrusted to gaius cestius gallus corbulo reordered his forces withdrawing defeated and demoralized iv scythica and xii fulminata legions to syria leaving x fretensis to guard cappadocia and leading his veteran iii gallica and vi ferrata to melitene where invasion army was to be assembled to these he also added v macedonica which had remained in pontus throughout previous year and not been tainted by defeat newly arrived xv apollinaris and large numbers of auxiliaries and contingents of client kings tacitus annales xv 26 after his army crossed euphrates following a route opened up by lucullus over a hundred years before he received envoys from tiridates and vologases at approach of such a large force and aware of corbulo s ability as a general two arsacids were anxious to negotiate indeed corbulo no doubt on instructions from nero reiterated old roman position if tiridates would accept his crown from rome then renewed war could be averted tacitus annales xv 27 tiridates readily agreed to negotiations and rhandeia scene of last year s roman defeat was agreed upon as a meeting place to armenians this place was intended as a reminder of their strength while corbulo agreed to it because there he hoped to expunge earlier disgrace by peace or war cassius dio historia romana lxii 22 once there corbulo put paetus son who served under him as a legate in charge of a party that was to gather remains of roman soldiers and ensure them a proper burial on agreed day both tiridates and corbulo each accompanied by 20 horsemen met between two camps tacitus annales xv 28 tiridates agreed to travel to rome and seek confirmation of his crown from nero in sign of this agreement a few days later both armies put on a display arrayed in full parade gear tiridates approached roman camp where a statue of emperor nero had been erected upon a raised platform and placed his royal diadem at its feet in submission tacitus annales xv 29 aftermath thumb 200px celebratory as struck in 66 showing gates of temple of janus closed as a symbol of universal peace it would not last long in same year jewish revolt broke out and many of units involved in armenian war would be deployed against jewish rebels in 66 tiridates visited rome to receive his crown and was lavishly received by nero who used occasion to boost his own popularity he ordered gates of temple of janus to be shut thus declaring that peace reigned throughout roman empire shotter 2005 p 39 nero celebrated this peace as a major achievement he was hailed as imperator and held a triumph cassius dio historia romana lxii 23 4 although no new territory had been won and peace reflected a compromise rather than a true victory for although rome could prevail militarily in armenia politically she had no genuine alternatives to arsacid candidacy on offer for armenian throne wheeler 2007 p 242 armenia would henceforth be ruled by an iranian dynasty and despite its nominal allegiance to rome it would come under increasing parthian influence in judgment of later generations nero had lost armenia festus breviarium xx 1 and although peace of rhandeia ushered in a period of relatively peaceful relations that would last for 50 years armenia would continue to be a constant bone of contention between romans parthians and their sassanid successors farrokh 2007 p 150 for short term however peace that nero secured was kept by both sides even while bulk of rome s eastern forces was involved in suppression of jewish revolt shotter 2005 pp 40 41 as for corbulo he was honoured by nero as man who had brought this triumph to be but his popularity and influence with army made him a potential rival together with involvement of his son in law lucius annius in a foiled plot against nero in 66 corbulo became suspect in eyes of emperor shotter 2005 pp 69 70 in 67 while journeying in greece nero ordered him to be executed upon hearing of this corbulo committed suicide cassius dio historia romana lxiii 17 5 2005 p 72 war had also demonstrated to romans that defensive system in east as put in place by augustus was no longer adequate thus following years saw a major reorganization of roman east client kingdoms of pontus and colchis in 64 ad cilicia commagene and lesser armenia in 72 ad were made into roman provinces number of legions in area increased and roman presence in caucasian client states of iberia and albania strengthened with aim of strategically encircling armenia wheeler 2007 p 243 direct roman control was
