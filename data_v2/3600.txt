2001 atlantic hurricane season was a fairly active atlantic hurricane season that produced 17 tropical cyclones 15 named storms nine hurricanes and four major hurricanes season officially lasted from june 1 2001 to november 30 2001 dates which by convention limit period of each year when tropical cyclones tend to form in atlantic ocean basin season began with tropical storm allison on june 4 and ended with hurricane olga which dissipated on december 6 most intense storm was hurricane michelle which attained category 4 strength on saffir simpson hurricane scale most damaging storms of season were tropical storm allison which caused extensive flooding in texas hurricane iris which struck belize and hurricane michelle which affected several countries three tropical cyclones made landfall on united states three directly affected canada and three directly affected mexico and central america overall season caused 117 fatalities and 11 3 billion 2001 usd in damage due to their severe damage names allison iris and michelle were retired by world meteorological organization seasonal forecasts predictions of tropical activity in 2001

associates at colorado state university and separately by noaa forecasters klotzbach s team formerly led by gray defined average number of storms per season 1950 to 2000 as 9 6 tropical storms 5 9 hurricanes 2 3 major hurricanes storms reaching at least category 3 strength in saffir simpson hurricane scale and ace index 96 1 noaa defines a season as above normal near normal or below normal by a combination of number of named storms number reaching hurricane strength number reaching major hurricane strength and ace index pre season forecasts on december 7 2000 gray s team issued its first extended range forecast for 2001 season predicting above average activity 13 named storms 8 hurricanes and about 4 of category 3 or higher it listed a 63 percent chance of at least one major hurricane striking u s mainland this included a 43 percent chance of at least one major hurricane strike on east coast including florida peninsula and a 36 percent chance of at least one such strike on gulf coast from florida panhandle westward potential for major hurricane activity in caribbean was forecast to near average on april 5 2001 a new forecast was issued calling for 12 named storms 7 hurricanes and 3 major hurricanes increase in forecast was attributed to warm sea surface temperatures although agency noted that season would likely not be as active as previous ones due to effect of a weak to moderate el nino estimated potential for at least one major hurricane to affect u s was upped slightly to 65 percent east coast potential also went up slightly and from florida panhandle westward to brownsville texas probability remained nearly same mid season forecasts on august 7 2001 gray s team issued their first mid season forecast for 2001 season keeping forecast number at 12 named storms with 7 becoming hurricanes and 3 becoming a major hurricane noting that sea surface temperatures and sea level pressures continued to be favorable for above average hurricane activity estimated potential for at least one major hurricane to affect u s was upped slightly once again to 69 percent east coast potential also went up slightly to 50 and from florida panhandle westward to brownsville texas probability was also upped slightly on august 8 2001 noaa revised its season estimate slightly upwards to nine to twelve named storms of which 6 to 8 were to be hurricanes and 2 to 4 major hurricanes agency noted that sea surface temperatures continued to be favorable for above average hurricane activity and due to likelihood that el nino would not develop during peak of season there was a reduced likelihood of a below average year season summary season s activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy ace rating of 110 ace is broadly speaking a measure of power of hurricane multiplied by length of time it existed so storms that last a long time as well as particularly strong hurricanes have high aces ace is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34 knots 39 mph 63 km h or tropical storm strength subtropical cyclones including latter portion of allison and initial portions of karen noel and olga are excluded from total systems tropical storm allison tropical storm allison developed from a tropical wave in northern gulf of mexico on june 4 2001 and struck northern texas coast shortly thereafter it drifted northward through state turned to south and re entered gulf of mexico storm continued towards east northeast made landfall on louisiana and then moved across southeast united states and mid atlantic allison was first storm since tropical storm frances in 1998 to affect northern texas coastline storm was a major flood disaster throughout its path from texas to mid atlantic worst of flooding occurred in houston texas where over 35 in 890 mm of rain fell when allison stalled over southeastern texas storm killed 41 people including 27 who drowned storm also caused 8 5 billion in damage 2001 usd making it costliest and second deadliest tropical storm on record in united states allison destroyed 2 744 homes leaving 30 000 homeless with residential damages totaling to 1 76 billion 2001 usd tropical depression two a tropical depression formed from a low level circulation on july 11 well to east of windward islands it attained a maximum strength of 30 mph 45 km h with a pressure of though vertical wind shear from a subtropical ridge to north caused it to dissipate on july 12 it died in one day tropical storm barry on july 24 a tropical wave moved off coast of africa and tracked westward wave entered caribbean on july 29 and gained in organization and convection and organized into tropical storm barry on august 3 after fluctuations in intensity system attained peak winds of 70 mph 110 km h in gulf of mexico and headed northward before moving ashore along gulf coast storm affected florida rainfall peaked at at tallahassee and winds gusts topped out at three people in florida were killed by storm and total damage is estimated at around 30 million 2001 usd tropical storm chantal tropical storm chantal developed from a tropical wave on august 14 in tropical atlantic ocean it tracked rapidly westward for much of its duration and after degenerating into a tropical wave it passed through windward islands chantal reformed and reached a peak intensity of 70 mph 110 km h twice in caribbean sea and each time wind shear and later land interaction prevented strengthening to hurricane status on august 21 chantal moved ashore near border of mexico and belize and it dissipated next day storm produced a wind gust of 71 mph 115 km h in caye caulker although stronger winds were possible in a convective band to north on yucatan peninsula heavy rainfall led to mudslides across quintana roo leaving some areas isolated tropical storm dean a tropical wave spawned tropical storm dean on august 22 over lesser antilles strong wind shear quickly weakened dean to cause it to dissipate on august 23 remnants turned northward and redeveloped on august 26 to north of bermuda located over warm waters and in an area of favorable conditions dean steadily strengthened while moving to northeast and peaked just below hurricane status on august 27 southwest of newfoundland storm subsequently weakened over cooler waters and became extratropical on august 28 tropical storm dean lightly affected newfoundland though no damages were reported hurricane erin hurricane erin developed from a tropical wave on september 1 and strengthened to a 60 mph 95 km h tropical storm as it moved to west northwest after weakening due to wind shear remnants re organized into a tropical depression next day and erin strengthened into a hurricane on september 9 while moving northwestward hurricane quickly intensified and reached peak winds of 120 mph 195 km h later on september 9 a trough turned erin to northeast and after passing just east of cape race newfoundland it became extratropical on september 15 extratropical remnant continued northeastward and lost its identity near greenland on september 17 hurricane erin brushed newfoundland producing a sustained wind of 53 mph 85 km h with a gust of 67 mph 108 km h at cape race along coast passage of storm led to wave heights of up to 30 ft 9 3 m hurricane felix a tropical wave spawned a tropical depression on september 7 near cape verde islands which degenerated back into a tropical wave next day due to strong shear it redeveloped back into a tropical depression on september 10 and intensified into tropical storm felix next day while tracking generally northward by september 13 it intensified into a hurricane and subsequently it underwent rapid deepening becoming a major hurricane on september 14 with peak winds of by that time felix had turned to northeast and subsequently entered an area of unfavorable conditions hurricane gradually weakened deteriorating to a tropical storm on september 17 cool waters and higher wind shear caused additional weakening while felix nearly stalled to southwest of azores late on september 18 storm weakened to a tropical depression and early next day felix dissipated hurricane gabrielle hurricane gabrielle originated in a weak low to mid level trough that was nearly stationary a short distance off southeastern coastline of united states a cut off low formed over florida on september 9 and an associated surface low pressure system formed that was soon designated tropical depression eight storm gradually intensified and made landfall on florida before emerging into atlantic ocean and accelerating northeastward as it reached peak intensity as a minimal hurricane hurricane gabrielle produced moderate winds along coastal areas of western florida reaching at venice tide flooded northern shoreline of charlotte harbor and at entrance to peace river while further to south a surge of greater than inundated barrier island at fort myers beach and flooded some cars gabrielle brushed eastern coast of newfoundland rainfall set all time six hour precipitation record at st john s with a total of hundreds of homes and buildings were damaged by passage of gabrielle totaling several million canadian dollars in damage tropical depression nine a tropical depression formed from a tropical wave in caribbean on september 19 north northwest of san andres island it attained a maximum strength of and made landfall near puerto cabezas on september 20 after losing its closed circulation over land it reformed into hurricane juliette in east pacific hurricane humberto hurricane humberto formed from an area of low pressure generated by hurricane gabrielle low formed into a tropical depression on september 21 while south of bermuda tracking northwest and was named tropical storm humberto next day it began moving north and then northeast as it passed bermuda and strengthened into a hurricane humberto headed over colder waters of far north atlantic ocean and dissipated quickly on september 27 hurricane iris tropical depression eleven formed just southeast of barbados on october 4 it traveled across windward islands and was named tropical storm iris while south of puerto rico on october 5 iris continued to west and intensified after passing just south of jamaica iris reached category 4 hurricane strength and made landfall near monkey river town belize on october 9 at category 4 strength but weakened rapidly it dissipated later that day storm produced an storm surge numerous homes were destroyed and banana crop suffered extensive damage an exact death toll is unknown but 31 are confirmed dead three in dominican republic eight in guatemala and 20 from m v wave dancer a ship that capsized off belize coast tropical storm jerry tropical storm jerry formed as a tropical depression from a tropical wave on october 6 near barbados storm intensified into a tropical storm early following day on october 7 while initially located under an environment of weak vertical wind shear after reaching its peak of 50 mph 80 km h jerry passed just south of barbados late on october 7 and through windward islands on october 8 deterioration in organization occurred and jerry dissipated while moving rapidly westward well south of puerto rico hurricane karen a cold front and an upper level trough interacted on october 10 to south of bermuda and formed an extratropical storm storm passed near bermuda on october 12 producing hurricane force winds on island it then organized becoming a subtropical cyclone on october 12 and a tropical cyclone on october 13 karen strengthened to reach 80 mph 130 km h winds as a category 1 hurricane on saffir simpson hurricane scale and after weakening over cooler waters it made landfall on nova scotia as a tropical storm it quickly became extratropical tropical storm karen produced light to moderate winds across atlantic canada peaking at 47 mph 76 km h with a gust of 64 mph 103 km h in cape george in antigonish county nova scotia along with a 26 mph 42 km h report in charlottetown prince edward island later in newfoundland and nova scotia storm system that absorbed hurricane noel produced strong winds that downed several trees and power lines which resulted in power outages tropical storm lorenzo an upper level tropospheric trough persisted in eastern atlantic ocean developing a circulation by october 26 which quickly organized on october 27 it developed into tropical depression fourteen about 860 miles 1380 kilometers south southwest of western azores moving westward depression was forecast to attain winds of at least 60 mph 95 km h although it failed to reach that intensity banding features developed over storm and on october 30 it was upgraded to tropical storm lorenzo by early on october 31 convection had begun to separate from circulation and later in day lorenzo became extratropical shortly thereafter its remnants merged with a frontal system about 690 mi 1 110 km west of azores hurricane michelle hurricane michelle developed from a tropical wave that moved across atlantic and formed into a tropical depression on october 29 convection increased and system formed into tropical storm michelle on november 1 it strengthened further reaching its peak strength as a category 4 one of only four november category 4 hurricanes michelle made landfall on south central cuba with winds of 140 mph 225 km h strongest cuban landfall since hurricane fox in 1952 atlantic hurricane season system that eventually became hurricane michelle dropped torrential rains in several countries causing six deaths in honduras and four deaths in nicaragua with an extensive yet unknown amount of damage an additional 26 people were reported missing in central america michelle went on to affect cuba where storm produced waves along with a heavy storm surge rainfall amounts up to 29 69 in 754 mm were recorded across island hurricane noel a non tropical frontal low developed from a cold front on november 1 to west of azores it intensified while moving west northwestward and gradually dissipated its frontal structure it became a subtropical storm on november 4 about 775 nautical miles 1435 km south of cape race newfoundland operationally storm was considered a non tropical low and national hurricane center did not begin issuing advisories until it became a tropical cyclone it moved slowly northward as convection organized into a ring around center as a result of a ship reporting hurricane force winds near center and due to development of a weak mid level warm core subtropical cyclone was reclassified as hurricane noel on november 5 increasing westerly wind shear limited convection near center and noel weakened to a tropical storm early on november 6 progressively cooler water temperatures contributed to weakening and noel became extratropical later on november 6 about 330 mi 530 km southeast of newfoundland extratropical remnant continued to northeast and was absorbed by a larger extratropical storm later that day hurricane olga hurricane olga formed as a subtropical cyclone on november 24 and meandered westward where it reached hurricane status on november 26 storm attained peak winds of 90 mph 150 km h before turning southeastward and weakening back into a tropical storm olga dissipated as a
