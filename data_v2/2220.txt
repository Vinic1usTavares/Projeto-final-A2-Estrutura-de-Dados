games despite intending super columbine massacre to be only game he created super columbine massacre was created by danny ledonne of alamosa colorado then a student and independent filmmaker as a high school student columbine shootings resonated with ledonne who said that he himself had once been a loner a misfit and a bullied kid in high school like shooters i was an easy target to be picked on and that started in kindergarten he said it was kind of bullying that most kids who were bullied experienced when you get pushed every day and when you are ostracized not once not twice but years in and out your perception of reality is distorted these things really do warp your understanding and your perception of humanity in some almost irrevocable way he said in 1999 director stanley kubrick s death and columbine high school massacre occurred within months of each other ledonne credited two events with changing his life after seeing a clockwork orange ledonne discovered that film could comment on culture after columbine shootings he realized he was headed down same path as shooters it was a bit scary once i learned more about these boys because it was like i was looking in mirror and i didn t want same fate for myself ledonne said he began taking martial arts studying film and saw a therapist by time he graduated from alamosa high school ledonne had a 4 0 grade point average and was voted most likely to succeed by his peers he studied film at emerson college and moved back to colorado to form his own production company productions which mostly edits wedding videos in november 2004 ledonne discovered a program called rpg maker which allows a developer to add images text story and objectives to design a game rpg maker creates necessary programming automatically ledonne had always conceptualized video games throughout his childhood but never produced one due to his lack of technical knowledge with rpg maker he was able to fulfill his ambition ledonne decided to make a game that would explore why columbine shootings occurred as well as refuting pervasive myths about shooters and alleged role video games played in massacre researching planning design and programming of game took about six months and between 200 and 300 hours of work all footage and pictures in game were taken from internet final fantasy vi influenced sprite based design many of songs in game are midi versions of 1990s grunge and alternative bands such as radiohead nirvana and smashing pumpkins ledonne paid meticulous attention to detail including giving players access to exact inventory gunmen used on their rampage he watched videos read newspaper articles and pored over 11 000 pages of documents released by county government regarding massacre and killers ledonne added elements to game to criticize subjects varying from public reaction to disaster to stereotypical role playing game conventions every victory in battle displays message another victory for trenchcoat mafia in reference to gang that harris and klebold were mistakenly affiliated with by media ledonne added hell segment and populated it with characters from video game doom explaining that having shooters battle these monsters in an eternal recreation of their favorite videogame was a statement in and of itself super columbine massacre is only video game ledonne has created and he has no future plans to create another release thumb brian crecente then a games writer for rocky mountain news helped bring wider attention to super columbine massacre game was made available for download on april 20 2005 sixth anniversary of columbine massacre ledonne sought to remain anonymous at game s debut to avoid any possible controversy which he would later regret as it created impression he had something to hide under alias ledonne regularly engaged gamers and critics alike on a message board he established to discuss game s depiction of shooting and broader implications of shooting ledonne s identity was revealed by roger kovacs a friend of one of columbine victims rachel scott kovacs found out ledonne s name by donating to site via paypal after his name and address were posted online ledonne stepped forward and was greeted with requests for interviews that s when i decided that i had to grow a backbone and stand up for my creation ledonne said game is distributed as freeware with donations in amount of 1 requested to defray bandwidth costs initially game attracted little attention and was downloaded 10 000 times in its first year in april 2006 patrick dugan of web site gamasutra wrote about game after meeting its host at game developers conference impressed dugan sent an email to georgia institute of technology professor ian bogost who blogged about game brian crecente of gaming news site kotaku and rocky mountain news subsequently interviewed bogost and associated press and mainstream media picked up story increased visibility resulted in increased coverage controversy and downloads in first half of may 2006 game was downloaded more than 30 000 times ledonne announced in september 2006 that game was no longer available for download directly through its website instead providing download links as title s popularity cost too much to sustain in a single day in september he reported 8 000 downloads by march 2007 game had been downloaded more than 400 000 times reaction reception of super columbine massacre has been negative amongst mainstream media and those personally affected by shootings upon revealing columbine s identity as ledonne kovacs said one of girls who died in shootings was a friend of mine rachel we were in same church group anyone playing this game can kill rachel over and over again father of one victim remarked to press that game disgusts me you trivialize actions of two murderers and lives of innocent one victim of shooting played game and voiced reserved support remarking that it probably sounds a bit odd for someone like me to say but i appreciate fact at least to some degree that something like this was made while he took issue with what he saw as glamorization of shooters he also believed it would help open a dialogue about shooting super columbine massacre was largely condemned by press betty nguyen of cnn labeled game as an example of a subculture that worships terrorists newspapers called game exploitive and a monstrosity pc world declared game 2 on its list of 10 worst games of all time even critics who were supportive of ledonne s intent found game hard to play ben kuchera of ars technica said that he left game shaken but that as an easily misunderstood game people who are most likely to gain anything from it will never play it crecente felt that message of game was obscured by cartoon graphics of medium ledonne has refused to alter game as it represents his thoughts on subject at a particular point in time but has encouraged others to rework game themselves most positive reviews of super columbine massacre came from critics who accepted ledonne s intended message wired magazine writer clive thompson appreciated game s attention to narrative detail writing that upshot of game is that ledonne has done a surprisingly good job of painting emotional landscape of gunmen whipsawing from self pity to pompous grandiosity and blinding rage then back again thompson called game subtle including jabs at participants and gaming culture by using language of games as a way to think about killings writing for courier mail paul s advice to those who found game controversial and in bad taste was to lighten up bogost summed up his review of game by writing this game is not fun it is challenging and difficult to play not technically difficult but conceptually difficult we need more of that david a professor at emerson college agreed with bogost and commented that controversy should be that there aren t more games like super columbine massacre rpg that are as demanding and as artistically innovative dugan responded to common criticisms of game including that game was made in bad taste by writing a rebuttal on his blog i think everyone who disses columbine rpg is gutless most haven t played game or have played it with such preconceptions that they re blinded to sic honesty beauty of its social commentary super columbine massacre rpg is riddled with design flaws and has mediocre graphics by 1995 maker of game admits this but it regardless is a work of art it puts you in mindset of killers and provides a very clear suggestion of why they did what they did they were enacting an ideological demonstration through a terrorist act and game shines light on this as an indictment of american dream and way of life painfully close to main nerve after dawson college shooting in september 2006 when gunman kimveer gill killed one student and injured 19 others toronto sun wrote that kimveer had self reported playing columbine massacre on a web site story was picked up by media and reported widely upon hearing media reports of a link to game one of shooting victims at dawson college contacted ledonne and told him that i just suffered multiple gunshot wounds and i think you should take this game down ledonne expressed his reaction to shooting and renewed media attention towards his game in an interview a week later if one is interested in making something for public to view be it a painting a book an album a film or a video game should possible harm that may come out of this work be grounds for its suppression from society this is in a sense pre crime if you believe in what you re doing and you want to express yourself expression should be primary and any interpretations that come after must always remain of secondary importance to creation of work itself on another level entire correlation between dawson college shooting and my game is unfounded what else did kimveer like black clothes goth music pizza if anything dawson college shooting is proof positive that games like super columbine massacre should be made until video games are no longer among usual suspects for homicidal rampages public needs to more carefully consider why interactive electronic media is somehow manufacturer of manchurian candidates developer ryan lambourn created a flash game called v tech rampage in 2007 which allows players to control actions of gunman seung hui cho in virginia tech massacre lambourn professed empathy for cho and said that he was a target of bullying in high school no one listens to you unless you ve got something sensational to do and that s why i feel sympathy for cho seung hui sic he had to go that far lambourn stated on v tech rampage site lambourn posted a statement that he would take game off of newgrounds if donations reached 1000 at 2000 in donations he would take game down from main site and for another 1000 he would apologize for creating it ledonne posted a comment on lambourn s website after v tech rampage drew comparisons to super columbine massacre calling lambourn s statement tantamount to a hostage note and asking bloggers to consider not whether a game about virginia tech shooting should be made but how we might go about making a game that accomplishes more than v tech rampage does with subject matter ledonne stated that he emailed lambourn sympathetically but that creator responded to his emails with profanity he reiterated that two games had different motivations and were not easily comparable in content slamgate and legacy in october 2006 sam roberts guerilla gamemaker competition director of slamdance festival emailed ledonne encouraging him to submit game to contest ledonne looked at selection of game as one of competition s finalists in december as evidence that all forms of art can be valid tools for societal exploration even painful topics like school shootings event s organizer peter baxter announced removal of game from festival s guerrilla gamemaker competition after its selection as a finalist several reasons for change of mind were given including threatened sponsor withdrawal possible lawsuits and moral grounds baxter denied that sponsor pressure caused drop instead affirming that shootings are still a very touchy subject and rightly so we have to be sensitive to victims and their families feelings an additional consideration reported was that unnamed parties might sue for copyright violations in game itself announcement marked first time festival had pulled jury selected content from contest incident was dubbed slamgate by gaming press thumb left independent game developers like jonathan blow defended super columbine massacre rpg after it was removed from slamdance competition following announcement usc interactive media division withdrew its sponsorship of festival seven of fourteen finalist games were removed from contest by their developers in protest braid flow once upon a time toblo everyday shooter book and volume and castle crashers toblo was later reinstated by digipen institute of technology who owns rights to game developer jonathan blow of braid stated super columbine massacre lacks compassion and i find artist s statement disingenuous but despite this game does have redeeming value it does provoke important thoughts and it does push boundaries of what games are about it is composed with more of an eye toward art than most games clearly it belongs at festival blow and other developers sent an open letter to festival encouraging reinstatement of game as keeping with festival s trailblazing efforts despite protests baxter refused to change his mind citing consideration for shooting s victims and their families ledonne told other finalists that he planned to go to festival anyway and distribute copies of game acknowledging that withdrawal of six finalists compromised competition roberts let attendees vote on whether any prizes would be awarded they decided not to brian flemming director of god who wasn t there saw ledonne s demo of super columbine massacre outside festival and convinced two fellow slamdance film jurors to award game a special jury prize for best documentary an unofficial award not endorsed by slamdance itself jurors intended to present special prize alongside award for best documentary shortly before ceremony baxter informed flemming that he could not present award due to music clearance issues and refused to allow it despite flemming s protests according to ledonne flemming tried to hold his ground but eventually gave in to baxter s request ledonne produced a documentary film based on his experiences after release of super columbine massacre titled playing columbine documentary uses controversy surrounding game to investigate large issues facing video games as a medium for artistic expression film premiered at afi fest in los angeles california on november 7 2008 as a result of controversy of his game ledonne became an unwitting spokesman for games industry facing medium s opponents in debates and forums furor resulting from slamgate was called out by ledonne and others in media as a sign that video games had not yet outgrown traditional stereotype of children s games keith stuart of guardian wrote that despite being confused and tawdry super columbine massacre symbolizes a growing understanding that videogames have more to say than shoot enemies and pick up health authors andreas jahn and ralf consider controversial video games such as super columbine massacre and grand theft auto hot coffee mod evidence of sociopolitical tensions present between gamers and older generations game and others like it continue to be at center of video games as art debate and gamasutra credited super columbine massacre and slamgate as having two highly positive and far reaching effects first forcing print game journalism to focus on issue and second evangelization of notion that games can be as meaningful and important as other media even if example is offensive to sensibilities of most americans to win is to lose but to play is to experience an enrichment that cannot be scored see also school shooter north american
