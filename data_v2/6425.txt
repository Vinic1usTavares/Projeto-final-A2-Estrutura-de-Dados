hms albemarle was a pre dreadnought of royal navy named after george monck 1st duke of albemarle built to counter a group of fast russian battleships albemarle and her sister ships were capable of steaming at making them fastest battleships in world duncan class battleships were armed with a main battery of four guns and they were broadly similar to s though of a slightly reduced displacement and thinner armour layout as such they reflected a development of lighter second class ships of albemarle was built between her keel laying in january 1900 and her completion in november 1903 albemarle had a fairly uneventful career she spent her first years in service with mediterranean fleet from 1903 to 1905 when she was transferred to channel fleet in 1907 she was reassigned to atlantic fleet in early 1910 she transferred to home fleet first as part of 4th battle squadron and later 6th battle squadron she served with grand fleet on northern patrol during early stages of first world war she was later dispatched to murmansk in russia for guard and icebreaking duties for most of 1916 on her return to england she underwent a refit and was in reserve for remainder of war decommissioned in april 1919 she was scrapped in 1920 design thumb left right elevation and deck plan as depicted in brassey s naval annual 1915 six ships of were ordered in response to russian s that had been launched in 1898 russian ships were fast second class battleships so william henry white british director of naval construction designed duncan class to match purported top speed of russian vessels to achieve higher speed while keeping displacement from growing white was forced to reduce ships armour protection significantly effectively making ships enlarged and improved versions of s of 1896 rather than derivatives of more powerful and series of first class battleships duncans proved to be disappointments in service owing to their reduced defensive characteristics though they were still markedly superior to peresvets they had been built to counter albemarle was long overall with a beam of and a draft of duncan class battleships displaced normally and up to fully loaded her crew numbered 720 officers and ratings duncan class ships were powered by a pair of 4 cylinder triple expansion engines that drove two screws with steam provided by 24 belleville boilers boilers were trunked into two funnels located amidships duncan class ships had a top speed of from this made albemarle and her sisters fastest battleships in world for several years at a cruising speed of ship could steam for albemarle had four 40 calibre guns mounted in twin gun turrets fore and aft ships also mounted twelve 45 calibre guns mounted in casemates in addition to ten 12 pounder guns and six 3 pounder guns as was customary for battleships of period she was also equipped with four torpedo tubes submerged in hull albemarle had an armoured belt that was thick transverse bulkhead on aft end of belt was thick her main battery turrets sides were thick atop barbettes and casemate battery was protected with 6 in of krupp steel her conning tower had 12 inch thick sides she was fitted with two armoured decks thick respectively operational history pre world war i hms albemarle named for george monck 1st duke of albemarle was laid down on 1 january 1900 at chatham dockyard and launched on 5

4th battle squadron in first fleet there on 15 may 1913 she was reduced to a nucleus crew and assigned to 6th battle squadron second fleet to serve as a gunnery training ship world war i thumb left albemarle in canada in 1908 when world war i began in august 1914 plans originally called for albemarle and battleships and to form 6th battle squadron and serve in channel fleet where it was to patrol english channel and cover movement of british expeditionary force to france however plans also existed for 6th battle squadron to be assigned to grand fleet and when war began commander in chief grand fleet admiral sir john jellicoe requested that albemarle and her four surviving sister ships of duncan class cornwallis duncan exmouth and russell be assigned to 3rd battle squadron in grand fleet for patrol duties to make up for grand fleet s shortage of cruisers accordingly 6th battle squadron was abolished temporarily and albemarle joined 3rd battle squadron at scapa flow on 8 august 1914 and worked with grand fleet cruisers on northern patrol albemarle and her four duncan class sisters as well as battleships of temporarily were transferred to channel fleet on 2 november 1914 to reinforce that fleet in face of imperial german navy activity in channel fleet s area following day german fleet raided yarmouth at time albemarle and rest of 3rd squadron were dispersed on northern patrol and were thus unavailable during german attack on 13 november 1914 king edward vii class ships returned to grand fleet but albemarle and other duncans stayed in channel fleet where they reconstituted 6th battle squadron on 14 november 1914 this squadron was given a mission of bombarding german submarine bases on coast of belgium and was based at portland although it transferred to dover immediately on 14 november 1914 however due to a lack of anti submarine defenses at dover particularly after harbour s anti submarine boom was swept away in a gale squadron returned to portland on 19 november 1914 squadron was intended to guard against an attempt by german fleet to land an invasion force in britain 6th battle squadron returned to dover in december 1914 then transferred to sheerness on 30 december 1914 to relieve 5th battle squadron there in guarding against a german invasion of united kingdom between january and may 1915 6th battle squadron was dispersed
