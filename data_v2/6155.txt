was frank spotnitz s idea from there story went together fairly easily john doe was co executive maclaren s directorial debut although she had never helmed an episode before maclaren had learned much working with kim manners one of series prolific directors she later noted kim taught me how he breaks down a script and prepares his shot list most powerful thing he said to me was that he imagines show all cut together and sees movie in his head and really visualizes it hurwitz and knowles p 202 gilligan later said that maclaren really rose to occasion and really did her homework bus crash

lighting it was dark and warm and brown when you go inside you can barely see things but when you re outside it s just blaring to create mexican town featured in episode scenes were filmed at a small
