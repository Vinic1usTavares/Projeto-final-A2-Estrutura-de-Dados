adar oilfield also known as adar yale adar yeil or adaril field is an oilfield situated in melut basin in south sudan estimated to contain about of oil chevron corporation discovered adar yale field in 1981 shortly before start of second sudanese civil war 1983 2005 soon after chevron had suspended operations in 1984 sudanese government troops began attacking civilian settlements in area burning houses and driving people away and in late 1990s nuer militias from nasir helped army in clearing away people to make way for roads and infrastructure of oilfield president omar al bashir inaugurated site in march 1997 and it initially produced just a day production from this oilfield which lies close to borders with sudan and ethiopia has potential to bring significant economic benefits to region however until recently focus has been on clearing population away from oilfield rather than on a longer term strategy for developing region china has provided a large investment in adar oilfield and others in south sudan and sudan and has made plans to make extensive further investments background and location adar is an area southeast of melut which lies on white nile in upper nile state and to west of ethiopia khor adar which drains machar marshes flows through region in a northwest direction to nile which it reaches just above melut khor machar swamps lie in a triangle north of sobat river and east of white nile when flooded during wet season they extend for swamps and marshes are fed by local rainfall and by many small torrents from ethiopian foothills which extend for along eastern border and by spill water from channels of sobat discharge from marshes along adar river is low except in years with exceptionally heavy rainfall most of water is lost through evaporation before reaching nile it has been proposed to build a canal from machar via adar to white nile to increase volume of water flowing to northern sudan and egypt which apparently could be done without major environmental impact but political instability has prevented project from starting chevron corporation discovered adar yale field in 1981 shortly before start of second sudanese civil war 1983 2005 four exploratory wells had flow rates that exceeded a day oil is held in formation sandstone from paleogene age field has an area of about but average pay zone is only initially field was estimated to hold but seismic data acquired in 2000 pushed that up to also three small oil pools were discovered south of adar yale with another chevron started to pull out of sudan in 1984 when three of its employees were killed finally selling all of its sudanese interests in 1992 development and production chevron suspended operations in 1984 and their concession was later divided into smaller units in 1992 gulf petroleum corporation sudan gpc was awarded melut basin blocks 3 and 7 gpc was owned 60 by qatar s gulf petroleum corporation 20 by sudapet and 20 by a company owned by national islamic front nif financier mohamed abdullah jar al nabi gpc consortium was reported to have invested us 12m in developing adar yale field in october 1996 gpc began to drill and reopen chevron s wells and to build an all weather road connecting adar yale to garrison town of melut president omar al bashir inaugurated adar yale site in march 1997 at first production was just a day taken by truck to melut and then by barge down nile to khartoum for export although export volumes were tiny compared to field s potential it was first sudanese crude to be exported and therefore had symbolic significance in march 2000 fosters resources a canadian company signed an agreement with government of sudan to develop concession that covered most of melut basin including adar yeil field in partnership with a consortium of arab and sudanese companies fosters was forced to withdraw in may 2000 when its financial backing collapsed due to pressure from human rights groups u s government had been highly critical of canadian involvement in sudan oil development and in february 2000 u s treasury announced that american persons were forbidden to do business with greater nile petroleum operating company and sudapet petrodar was incorporated in october 2001 owned 41 by china national petroleum company and 40 by petronas of malaysia petrodar implemented major upgrades to oil development infrastructure including day production facilities at adar yale field now largely cleared of its original inhabitants in november 2005 brought petrodar pipeline into operation linking blocks 3 and 7 adar yale and fields to port sudan on red sea pipeline has throughput of per day and maximum capacity of by january 2007 combined output from blocks 3 and 7 was 165 000 with potential to reach a peak of by late 2007 by 2009 two blocks were producing close to of dar blend because this blend of crude oil is heavy and highly acidic it fetches lower prices than benchmark such as brent or minas people adar is predominantly inhabited by dinka people who mainly cultivate crops and raise cattle many of dinka use riverine pastures along east bank of white nile but in dry seasons can usually find alternative pasturage along khor adal and khor wol and on edges of marshes country is well suited to cultivation of crops watered by rain soon after chevron had closed operations government troops began attacking civilian settlements in area burning houses and driving people away this resulted in many deaths in late 1990s nuer militias from nasir helped army in clearing away people to make way for roads and infrastructure of oilfield aid workers were also targeted in attacks with ngo compounds farm supply distribution centers and primary health care centers vandalized and destroyed one estimate is that
