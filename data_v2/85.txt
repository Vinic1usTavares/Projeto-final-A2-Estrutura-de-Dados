recovered and bond is sent to hospital with domino characters and themes according to continuation bond author raymond benson there was further development of bond character in thunderball with glimpses of both his sense of humour and his own sense of mortality being shown felix leiter had his largest role to date in a bond story and much of his humour came though whilst his incapacity suffered in live and let die had not led to bitterness or to his being unable to join in with underwater fight scene towards end of novel academic christoph linder sees thunderball as part of second wave of bond villains first wave consisted of smersh second of blofeld and spectre undertaken because of thawing of relations between east and west although cold war escalated again shortly afterwards with bay of pigs invasion construction of berlin wall and cuban missile crisis all occurring in an eighteen month period from april 1961 to november 1962 introduction of spectre and its use over a number of books gives a measure of continuity to remaining stories in series according to academic jeremy black black argues that spectre represents evil unconstrained by ideology and it partly came about because decline of british empire led to a lack of certainty in fleming s mind this is reflected in bond s using us equipment and personnel in novel such as geiger counter and nuclear submarine background as with previous novels in series aspects of thunderball come from fleming s own experiences visit to health clinic was inspired by his own 1955 trip to hall health farm and bond s medical record as read out to him by m is a slightly modified version of fleming s own name of health farm shrublands was taken from that of a house owned by parents of his wife s friend peter quennell fleming dedicates a quarter of novel to shrublands setting and naturalist cure bond undergoes thumb 200px ordzhonikidze was a class cruiser similar to that shown in this photograph alexander nevsky bond s examination of hull of disco volante was inspired by ill fated mission undertaken on 19 april 1956 by ex royal navy frogman buster crabb on behalf of mi6 as he examined hull of soviet cruiser ordzhonikidze that had brought nikita khrushchev and nikolai bulganin on a diplomatic mission to britain crabb disappeared in portsmouth harbour and was never seen again as well as having buster crabb in mind fleming would also recall information about 10th light flotilla an elite unit of italian navy frogmen who used wrecked ships in gibraltar to launch attacks on allied shipping specifications for disco volante herself had been obtained by fleming from italian ship designer leopold rodriguez as often happened in fleming s novels a number of names were taken from people of whom he had known ernst stavro blofeld s name partially comes from tom blofeld a norfolk farmer and a fellow member of fleming s club boodle s who was a contemporary of fleming s at eton tom blofeld s son is henry blofeld a sports journalist best known as a cricket commentator for test match special on bbc radio additionally when largo rents his beachside villa it is from an englishman named bryce whose name was taken from old etonian ivar bryce fleming s friend who had a beachside property in jamaica called xanadu other names used by fleming included a colleague at sunday times robert harling who was transformed into commissioner of police harling whilst an ex colleague from his stock days hugo pitman became chief of immigration pitman and fleming s golfing friend bunny roddick became deputy governor roddick title thunderball came from a conversation fleming had about a us atomic test writing and copyright chronology in mid 1958 fleming and his friend ivar bryce began talking about possibility of a bond film later that year bryce introduced fleming to a young irish writer and director kevin mcclory and three of them together with fleming and bryce s friend ernest cuneo formed partnership xanadu productions named after bryce s bahamian home but which was never actually formed into a company in may 1959 fleming bryce cuneo and mcclory met first at bryce s essex house and then in mcclory s london home as they came up with a story outline which was based on an aeroplane full of celebrities and a female lead called fatima blush mcclory was fascinated by underwater world and wanted to make a film that included it over next few months as story changed there were ten outlines treatments and scripts numerous titles were proposed for these works including spectre james bond of secret service and longitude 78 west much of attraction fleming felt working alongside mcclory was based on mcclory s film boy and bridge which was official british entry to 1959 venice film festival however when film was released in july 1959 it was poorly received and did not do well at box office fleming became disenchanted with mcclory s ability as a result in october 1959 with fleming spending less time on project mcclory introduced experienced screenwriter jack whittingham to writing process in november 1959 fleming left to travel around world on behalf of sunday times material for which fleming also used for his non fiction travel book thrilling cities on his travels through japan hong kong and into us fleming met with mcclory and ivar bryce in new york and mcclory told fleming that whittingham had completed a full outline which was ready to shoot back in britain in december 1959 fleming met with mcclory and whittingham for a script conference shortly afterwards mcclory and whittingham sent fleming a script longitude 78 west which fleming considered to be good although he changed title to thunderball in january 1960 mcclory visited fleming s jamaican home goldeneye where fleming explained his intention of delivering screenplay to mca with a recommendation from him and bryce that mcclory act as producer additionally fleming told mcclory that if mca rejected film because of mcclory s involvement then mcclory should either sell his services to mca back out of deal or file suit in court fleming then wrote novel thunderball at goldeneye over period january to march 1960 based on screenplay written by himself whittingham and mcclory in march 1961 mcclory read an advance copy of book and he and whittingham immediately petitioned high court in london for an injunction to stop publication plagiarism case was heard on 24 march 1961 and allowed book to be published although door was left open for mcclory to pursue further action at a later date he did so and on 19 november 1963 case of mcclory v fleming was heard at chancery division of high court case lasted three weeks during which time fleming was unwell suffering a heart attack during case itself and under advice from his friend ivar bryce offered a deal to mcclory settling out of court mcclory gained literary and film rights for screenplay while fleming was given rights to novel although it had to be recognised as being based on a screen treatment by kevin mcclory jack whittingham and author on settlement fleming ultimately admitted t hat novel reproduces a substantial part of copyright material in film scripts t hat novel makes use of a substantial number of incidents and material in film scripts and t hat there is a general similarity of story of novel and story as set out in said film scripts on 12 august 1964 nine months after conclusion of trial fleming suffered a further heart attack and died at age of 56 script elements when script was first drafted in may 1959 with storyline of an aeroplane of celebrities in atlantic it included elements from fleming s friend ernie cuneo who included ships with underwater trapdoors in their hulls and an underwater battle scene russians were originally villains then sicilian mafia but this was later changed again to internationally operating criminal organisation spectre both mcclory and fleming claim to have come up with concept of spectre fleming biographer andrew lycett and john cork both note fleming as originator of group lycett saying that fleming proposed that bond should confront not russians but spectre while cork produced a memorandum in which fleming called for change to spectre my suggestion on b is that spectre short for special executive for terrorism revolution and espionage is an immensely powerful organisation armed by ex members of smersh gestapo mafia and black tong of peking which is placing these bombs in nato bases with objective of then blackmailing western powers for ps100 million or else ian fleming memo to whittingham and mcclory cork also noted that fleming used word spectre previously in fourth novel diamonds are forever for a town near las vegas called and for spektor decoder in from russia with love others such as continuation bond author raymond benson disagree saying that mcclory came up with spectre concept those elements which fleming used which can be put down to mcclory and whittingham either separately or together include airborne theft of a nuclear bomb jo and his sister sophie and jo s death at hands of sophie s boss remainder of screenplay was a two year collaboration among fleming whittingham mcclory bryce and cuneo release and reception thunderball was published on 27 march 1961 in uk as a hardcover edition by publishers

603 outside uk artist richard chopping once again provided cover art for novel on 20 july 1960 fleming wrote to chopping to ask if he could undertake art for next book agreeing on a fee of 200 guineas saying that i will ask jonathan cape to produce an elegant skeleton hand and an elegant queen of hearts as to dagger i really have no strong views i had thought of ordinary flick knife as used by teenagers on people like you and me but if you have a nice dagger in mind please let us use it title of book will be thunderball it is immensely long immensely dull and only your jacket can save it reviews thunderball was generally well received by critics francis iles writing in guardian wrote that it is a good tough straightforward thriller on perfectly conventional lines referring to negative publicity that surrounded dr no in particular article by paul johnson in new statesman entitled sex snobbery and sadism iles was left wondering what all fuss is about noting that there is no more sadism nor sex than is expected of author of this kind of thriller peter duval smith writing in financial times also took opportunity to defend fleming s work against negative criticism also specifically naming paul johnson and his review one should not make a cult of fleming s novels a day dream is a day dream but nor should one make mistake of supposing he does not know what he is doing duval smith thought that thunderball was an exciting story is skilfully told with a romantic sub plot and denouement involves great events he also considered it best written since diamonds are forever four books back it has pace and humour and style violence is not so unrelenting as usual an improvement i think he also expressed concern for central character saying i was glad to see him bond in such good form earlier he seemed to be softening up he was having bad hangovers on half a bottle of whisky a day which i don t call a lot unless he wasn t eating properly writing in times literary supplement philip john stead thought that fleming continues to deploy his story telling talents within limits of commander bond formula stead saw that hijacking of two bombs gives bond some anxiety but needless to say does not prevent him from having a good deal of fun in luxury surroundings whilst usual beatings up modern style are ingeniously administered to lady and gentleman like as to why novels were so appealing stead considered that mr fleming s special magic lies in his power to impart sophistication to his mighty nonsense his fantasies connect with up to date and lively knowledge of places and of general sphere of crime and espionage overall in stead s opinion with thunderball mixture exotic as ever generates an extravagant and exhilarating tale and bond connoisseurs will be glad to have it critic for times wrote that thunderball relies for its kicks far less than did dr no or goldfinger on sadism and a slightly condescending sophistication upshot in critic s opinion was that mixture of good living sex and violent action is as before but this is a highly polished performance with an ingenious plot well documented and plenty of excitement writing in washington post harold noted that thunderball was not top fleming but still well ahead of pack whilst charles poore writing in new york times considered bond novels to be post ventures in crime and punishment thunderball he found to be a mystery story a thriller a chiller and a pleasure to read poore identified aspects of author s technique to be part of success saying suspense and surprises that animate novel arise from conceits with which mr fleming decorates his tapestry of thieving and deceiving critic from sunday times considered fleming to have a sensational imagination but informed by style zest and above all knowledge anthony boucher wrote that as usual ian fleming has less story to tell in 90 000 words than buchan managed in 40 000 but thunderball is still an extravagant adventure critic for daily herald implored hey that man is taking his clothes off again so is girl can anybody stop this unfortunately not not this side of best seller lists i don t envy mr bond s wealthy creator ian fleming i wish i could pity him whilst l g offord considered thunderball to be just about as wild as ever with a walloping climax adaptations comic strip 1961 1962 a comic strip adaptation was published daily in daily express newspaper and syndicated worldwide beginning on 11 december 1961 however owner of daily express lord beaverbrook cancelled strip on 10 february 1962 after fleming
