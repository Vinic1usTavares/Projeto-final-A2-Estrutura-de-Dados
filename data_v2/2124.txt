these investments and buyouts is unknown owing to a lack of records and bain capital s penchant for privacy on behalf of itself and its investors maximizing value of acquired companies and return to bain s investors not job creation was firm s primary investment goal bain capital s acquisition of ampad exemplified a deal where it profited handsomely from early payments and management fees even
