in mid 1946 his fame spread rapidly as crowds were drawn to his stories of angelic visitations and reports of miracles happening at his meetings his ministry spawned many emulators and set in motion broader healing revival that later became modern charismatic movement from 1955 branham s campaigning and popularity began to decline as pentecostal churches began to withdraw their support from healing campaigns for primarily financial reasons by 1960 branham transitioned into a teaching ministry unlike his contemporaries who followed doctrinal teachings known as full gospel tradition branham developed an alternate theology that was primarily a mixture of calvinist and arminian doctrines and had a heavy focus on dispensationalism and branham s own unique eschatological views while widely accepting restoration doctrine he espoused during healing revival his divergent post revival teachings were deemed increasingly controversial by his charismatic and pentecostal contemporaries who subsequently disavowed many of doctrines as revelatory madness many of his followers however accepted his sermons as oral scripture and refer to his teachings as message in 1963 branham preached a sermon in which he indicated he was a prophet with anointing of elijah who had come to herald christ s second coming despite branham s objections some followers of his teachings placed him at center of a cult of personality during his final years branham claimed to have made over one million converts during his career his teachings continue to be promoted through william branham evangelistic

drinking alcoholic beverages branham stated he never violated command branham s father was an alcoholic and he grew up in deep poverty much like their neighbors as a child he would often wear a coat held closed only by safety pins without a shirt underneath branham s neighbors reported him as someone who always seemed a little different but said he was a dependable youth his tendency towards mystical experiences and moral purity caused misunderstandings among his friends family and other young people he was a black sheep from an early age branham called his childhood a terrible life at 19 branham left home seeking a better life he traveled to phoenix arizona where he worked for two years on a ranch and began a successful career in boxing he returned to jeffersonville when his brother

pentecostal baptist church of jeffersonville where he converted to christianity six months later he was ordained as an independent baptist minister his early ministry was an impressive success he quickly attracted a small group of followers who helped obtain a tent in which he could hold a revival at time of branham s conversion first pentecostal baptist church of jeffersonville was a nominally baptist church that observed some pentecostal doctrines including divine healing as a result he may have been exposed to some pentecostal teachings from his conversion he was first exposed to a pentecostal denominational church in 1936 which invited him to join but he refused during june 1933 branham held revival meetings in his tent on june 2 that year jeffersonville evening news said branham campaign reported 14 converts his followers believed his ministry was accompanied by miraculous signs from its beginning and that when he was baptizing converts on june 11 1933 in ohio river near jeffersonville a bright light descended over him and that he heard a voice say as john baptist was sent to forerun first coming of jesus christ so your message will forerun his second coming belief in baptismal story is a critical element of faith among branham s followers branham initially interpreted this in reference to restoration of gifts of spirit to church and made regular references to baptismal story from earliest days of healing revival in later years branham also connected story to his teaching ministry baptist historian doug weaver said branham may have embellished baptismal story when he was achieving success in healing revival alt front of a brick building with white double doors and windows on either side and a sign above door thumb right branham tabernacle c

continued resistance to holding revivals for oneness pentecostals branham married marie broy in 1941 and together they had three children rebekah b 1946 sarah b 1950 and joseph b 1955 healing revival background branham is known for his role in healing revivals that occurred in united states in 1940s and 1950s and most participants in movement regarded him as its initiator christian writer john crowder described period of revivals as most extensive public display of miraculous power in modern history some like christian author and activist hank hanegraaff rejected entire healing revival as a hoax and condemned evangelical and charismatic movements as cults divine healing is a tradition and belief that was historically held by a majority of christians but it became increasingly associated with evangelical protestantism fascination of most of american christianity with divine healing played a significant role in popularity and inter denominational nature of revival movement branham held massive inter denominational meetings from which came reports of hundreds of miracles historian david harrell described branham and oral roberts as two giants of movement and called branham its unlikely leader early campaigns alt two middle aged men stand side by side wearing overcoats and holding their hats in their hands thumb right william branham and f f bosworth branham held his first

campaign manager w e kidston was editor of apostolic herald and had many contacts in pentecostal movement kidston was instrumental in helping organize branham s early revival meetings time magazine reported on his st louis campaign meetings and according to article branham drew a crowd of over 4 000 sick people who desired healing and recorded him diligently praying for each branham s fame began to grow as a result of publicity and reports covering his meetings following st louis meetings branham launched a tour of small oneness pentecostal churches across midwest and southern united states from which stemmed reports of healing and one report of a resurrection by august his fame had spread widely he held meetings that month in jonesboro arkansas and drew a crowd of 25 000 with attendees

meetings claimed to be healed during revival helping to bring branham a sizable african american following from early days of revival dedicated to ministering to both races branham insisted on holding interracial meetings even in southern states to satisfy segregation laws when ministering in south branham s team would use a rope to divide crowd by race after holding a very successful revival meeting in shreveport during mid 1947 branham began assembling an evangelical team that stayed with him for most of revival period first addition to team was jack moore and young brown who periodically assisted him in managing his meetings following shreveport meetings branham held a series of meetings in san antonio phoenix and at various locations in california moore invited his friend gordon lindsay to join campaign team which he did beginning at a meeting in sacramento california in late 1947 lindsay was a successful publicist and manager for branham and played a key role in helping him gain national and international recognition in 1948 branham and lindsay founded voice of healing magazine which was originally aimed at reporting branham s healing campaigns lindsay was impressed with branham s focus on humility and unity and was instrumental in helping him gain acceptance among trinitarian and oneness pentecostal groups by expanding his revival meetings beyond

initiate in january 1948 meetings were held in florida f f bosworth met branham at meetings and also joined his team bosworth was among pre eminent ministers of pentecostal movement and lent great weight to branham s campaign team he remained a strong branham supporter until his death in 1958 bosworth endorsed branham as most sensitive person to presence and working of holy spirit he had ever met during early 1947 a major campaign was held in kansas city where branham and lindsay first met oral roberts roberts and branham had contact at different points during revival roberts said branham was set apart just like moses alt five men wearing suites stand side by side thumb right from left young brown jack moore william branham oral roberts gordon lindsay photo taken at kansas city in 1948 branham spent many hours ministering and praying for sick during his campaigns and like many other leading evangelists of time he suffered exhaustion after one year of campaigning his exhaustion began leading to health issues attendees reported seeing him staggering from intense fatigue during his last meetings just as branham began to attract international attention in may 1948 he announced that due to illness he would have to halt his campaign his illness shocked growing movement and his abrupt departure from field caused a rift between him and lindsay over voice of healing magazine branham insisted that lindsay take over complete management of publication with main subject of magazine no longer actively campaigning lindsay was forced to seek other ministers to promote he decided to publicize oral roberts during branham s absence and roberts quickly rose to prominence in large part due to lindsay s coverage branham partially recovered from his illness and resumed holding meetings in october 1948 in that month he held a series of meetings around united states without lindsay s support branham s return to movement led to his resumed leadership of it in november 1948 he met with lindsay and moore and told them he had received another angelic visitation instructing him to hold a series of meetings across united states and then to begin holding meetings internationally as a result of meeting lindsay rejoined branham s campaigning team style thumb right alt two men stand facing each other on a platform as thousands of spectators on ground floor and a balcony watch branham at a healing campaign meeting most revivalists of era were flamboyant but branham was usually calm and spoke quietly only occasionally raising his voice his preaching style was described as halting and simple and crowds were drawn to his stories of angelic visitation and constant communication with god he refused to discuss controversial doctrinal issues during early years of his campaigns and issued a policy statement that he would only minister on great evangelical truths he insisted his calling was to bring unity among different churches he was ministering to and to urge churches to return to roots of early christianity in first part of his meetings one of branham s companion evangelists would preach a sermon ern baxter or f f bosworth usually filled this role but other ministers also participated in branham s campaigns baxter generally focused on bible teaching bosworth counseled supplicants on need for faith and doctrine of divine healing following their build up branham would take podium and deliver a short sermon in which he usually related stories about his personal life experiences after completing his sermon he would proceed with a prayer line where he would pray for sick branham would often request god to confirm his message with two or three faith inspired miracles his campaign manager organized prayer line sending supplicants forward to be prayed for on stage individually branham generally prayed for a few people each night and believed witnessing results on stage would inspire faith in audience and permit them to experience similar results without having to be personally prayed for describing branham s method bosworth said he does not begin to pray for healing of afflicted in body in healing line each night until god anoints him for operation of gift and until he is conscious of presence of angel with him on platform without this consciousness he seems to be perfectly helpless branham told audiences angel that commissioned his ministry had given him two signs by which they could prove his commission he described first sign as vibrations he felt in his hand when he touched a sick person s hand which communicated to him nature of illness but did not guarantee healing branham s use of what his fellow evangelists called a word of knowledge gift separated him from his contemporaries this second sign did not appear in his campaigns until after his recovery in 1948 and was used to amaze tens of thousands at his meetings according to bosworth this gift of knowledge allowed branham to see and enable him to tell many events of people s lives from their childhood down to present this caused many in healing revival to view branham as a seer like old testament prophets branham amazed even fellow evangelists which served to further push him into a legendary status in movement branham s audiences were often awestruck by events during his meetings at peak of his popularity in 1950s branham was widely adored and neo pentecostal world believed branham to be a prophet to their generation opposition branham faced criticism and opposition from early days of healing campaign according to historian ronald kydd branham evoked strong opinions from people with whom he came into contact most people either loved him or hated him in 1947 rev alfred pohl a minister in saskatchewan canada stated that many people branham pronounced as healed later died a year later w j taylor a district superintendent with pentecostal assemblies of canada raised same concern and asked for a thorough investigation taylor presented evidence that claims of number of people healed were vastly overestimated he stated there is a possibility that this whole thing is wrong number of people who claimed to be healed in branham s campaign meetings is impossible to approximate and numbers vary greatly between sources according to kydd by watching films of revival meetings viewer would assume almost everyone was healed but results proved otherwise few times follow up was made no consistent record of follow ups was made making analysis of claims difficult to subsequent researchers pentecostal historian walter hollenweger said very few were actually healed some attendees of branham s meetings believed healings were a hoax and accused him of selectively choosing who could enter prayer line some people left his meetings disappointed after finding branham s conviction that everyone in audience could be healed without being in prayer line proved incorrect branham generally attributed failure of supplicants to receive healing to their lack of faith word of knowledge gift was likewise subject to much criticism hollenweger investigated branham s use of word of knowledge gift and found no instances in which branham was mistaken in his often detailed pronouncements criticism of branham s use of this gift was primarily around its nature some accused him of witchcraft and telepathy branham was openly confronted with such criticisms and rejected assertions growing fame thumb right photo of branham taken at sam houston coliseum in 1950 alt a man stands at a podium with a light colored object above his head in january 1950 branham

widespread media reports was a story in los angeles times that described it as perhaps most effective healing testimony this generation has ever seen upshaw died in november 1952 at age of 86 branham s meetings were regularly attended by journalists who wrote articles about miracles reported by branham and his team throughout years of his revivals and claimed patients were cured of various ailments after attending prayer meetings with branham durban sunday tribune and natal mercury reported wheelchair bound people rising and walking winnipeg free press reported a girl was cured of deafness el paso herald post reported hundreds of attendees at one meeting seeking divine healing logansport press reported a father s claim that his four year old son who suffered from a rare brain ailment benefited from branham s meetings despite such occasional glowing reports most of press coverage branham received was negative according to hollenweger branham filled largest stadiums and meeting halls in world during his five major international campaigns branham held his first series of campaigns in europe during april 1950 with meetings in finland sweden and norway attendance at meetings generally exceeded 7 000 despite resistance to his meetings by state churches in norway directorate of health forbade branham from laying hands on sick and sent police to his meetings to enforce order branham was first american deliverance minister to successfully tour in europe a 1952 campaign in south africa had largest attendance in branham s career with an estimated 200 000 attendees according to lindsay altar call at his durban meeting received 30 000 converts during international campaigns in 1954 branham visited portugal italy and india branham s final major overseas tour in 1955 included visits to switzerland and germany financial difficulties in 1955 branham s campaigning career began to slow following financial setbacks even after he became famous branham continued to wear inexpensive suits and refused large salaries he was not interested in amassing wealth as part of his ministry and was reluctant to solicit donations during his meetings during early years of his campaigns donations had been able to cover costs but from 1955 donations failed to cover costs of three successive campaigns one of which incurred a 15 000 deficit some of branham s business associates thought he was partially responsible because of his lack of interest in financial affairs of campaigns and tried to hold him personally responsible for debt branham briefly stopped campaigning and said he would have to take a job to repay debt but full gospel business men s fellowship international ultimately offered financial assistance to cover debt branham became increasingly reliant on full gospel businessmen to finance his campaign meetings as pentecostal denominations began to withdraw their financial support finances became an issue again in 1956 when internal revenue service irs charged branham with tax evasion american government targeted other leading revivalists with lawsuits during same time period including oral roberts jack coe and a a allen irs asserted income reported by ministers as non taxable gifts was taxable despite fact branham had not kept gifts for himself except allen who won his legal battle evangelists settled their cases out of court irs investigation showed branham did not pay close attention to amount of money flowing through his ministry it also revealed that others were taking advantage of him branham s annual salary was 7 000 while his manager s was 80 000 oral roberts earned a salary of 15 000 in same years case was eventually settled out of court with payment of a 40 000 penalty branham was never able to completely pay off debt amid financial issues lindsay left branham s campaign team branham eventually criticized voice of healing magazine as a massive financial organization that put making money ahead of promoting good end of revival by mid 1950s dozens of ministers associated with branham and his campaigns had launched similar healing campaigns in 1956 healing revival reached its peak as 49 separate evangelists held major meetings through voice of healing magazine branham and lindsay ineffectively attempted to discourage their activities by saying branham wished they would help their local churches rather than launch national careers swelling number of competitors and emulators further reduced attendance at branham s meetings his correspondence also decreased sharply whereas he had once received a thousand letters a day his mail dropped to 75 letters a day but branham thought decline was temporary he continued expecting something greater which he said nobody will be able to imitate in 1955 he reported a vision of a renewed tent ministry and a third pull which would be dramatically different than his earlier career among branham s emulators was jim jones founder and leader of peoples temple according to historian catherine wessinger while rejecting christianity as a false religion jones covertly used popular christian figures to advance his own ideology wessinger p 217 220 to draw crowds he was seeking jones needed a religious headliner and invited branham to share platform with him at a self organized religious convention held at cadle tabernacle auditorium in indianapolis from june 11 to 15 1956 branham critics peter duyzer and john collins reported that branham performed numerous miracles drawing a crowd of 11 000 jones later became known for mass murder and suicide at jonestown in november 1978 according to collins jim jones and paul schafer were influenced to move to south america by branham s 1961 prophecy concerning armageddon but concluded that jones and branham did not see eye to eye and that jones rejected branham as a dishonest person by 1960 number of evangelists holding national campaigns dropped to 11 several perspectives on decline of healing revival have been offered crowder suggested branham s gradual separation from gordon lindsay played a major part in decline harrell attributed decline to increasing number of evangelists crowding field and straining financial resources of pentecostal denominations weaver agreed pentecostal churches gradually withdrew their support for healing revival mainly over financial stresses put on local churches by healing campaigns assemblies of god were first to openly withdraw support from healing revival in 1953 weaver pointed to other factors that may have helped destroy initial ecumenism of revival tension between independent evangelists and pentecostal churches caused by evangelists fund raising methods denominational pride sensationalism and doctrinal conflicts particularly between oneness and trinitarian factions within pentecostalism later life teaching ministry as healing revival began to wane many of branham s contemporaries moved into leadership of emerging charismatic movement which emphasized use of spiritual gifts charismatic movement is a global movement within both protestant and non protestant christianity that supports adoption of traditionally pentecostal beliefs especially spiritual gifts charismata movement began in teachings of healing revival evangelists and grew as their teachings came to receive broad acceptance among millions of christians grenz p 162 at same time charismatic movement was gaining broad acceptance branham began to transition to a teaching ministry he began speaking on controversial doctrinal issues he had avoided for most of revival by 1960s branham s contemporaries and pentecostal denominations that had supported his campaigns regarded him as an extremely controversial teacher leadership of pentecostal churches pressed branham to resist his urge to teach and to instead focus on praying for sick branham refused arguing that purpose of his healing ministry was to attract audiences and having thus been attracted it was time to teach them doctrines he claimed to have received through supernatural revelation branham argued that his entire ministry was divinely inspired and could not be selectively rejected or accepted saying it s either all of god or none of god at first branham taught his doctrines only within his own church at jeffersonville but beginning in 1960s he began to preach them at other churches he visited his criticisms of pentecostal organizations and especially his views on holiness and role of women led to his rejection by growing charismatic movement and pentecostals from whom he had originally achieved popularity branham acknowledged their rejection and said their organizations had choked out glory and spirit of god as a result of their view of his teachings many pentecostals judged that branham had stepped out of his anointing and had become a bad teacher of heretical doctrine despite his rejection by growing charismatic movement branham s followers became increasingly dedicated to him during his later life some even claimed he was messiah branham quickly condemned their belief as heresy and threatened to stop ministering but belief persisted many followers moved great distances to live near his home in jeffersonville and led by leo mercer subsequently set up a colony in arizona following branham s move to tucson in 1962 branham lamented mercer and actions of his group as he worried that a cult was potentially being formed among his most fanatical followers branham continued to travel to churches and preach his doctrine across north america during 1960s he held his final set of revival meetings in shreveport at church of his early campaign manager jack moore in november 1965 teachings branham developed a unique theology and placed emphasis on a few key doctrines including his eschatological views annihilationism oneness of godhead predestination eternal security and serpent s seed his followers refer to his teachings collectively as message kydd and weaver have both referred to branham s teachings as most of branham s teachings have precedents within sects of pentecostal movement or in other non pentecostal denominations doctrines branham imported from non pentecostal theology and unique combination of doctrines that he created as a result led to widespread criticism from pentecostal churches and charismatic movement his unique arrangement of doctrines coupled with highly controversial nature of serpent seed doctrine caused alienation of many of his former supporters full gospel tradition which has its roots in wesleyan arminianism is theology generally adhered to by charismatic movement and pentecostal denominations branham s doctrines are a blend of both calvinism and arminianism which are considered contradictory by many theologians as a result his theology seemed complicated and bizarre to many people who admired him personally during years of healing revival many of his followers regard his sermons as oral scripture and believe branham had rediscovered true doctrines of early church divine healing throughout his ministry branham taught a doctrine of faith healing that was often central teaching he espoused during healing campaign he believed healing was main focus of ministry of jesus christ and believed in a dual atonement salvation for soul and healing for body he believed and taught that miracles ascribed to christ in new testament were also possible in modern times branham believed all sickness was a result of demonic activity and could be overcome by faith of person desiring healing branham argued that god was required to heal when faith was present this led him to conclude that individuals who failed to be healed lacked adequate faith branham s teaching on divine healing were within mainstream of pentecostal theology and echoed doctrines taught by smith wigglesworth bosworth and other prominent pentecostal ministers of prior generation annihilationism annihilationism is a doctrinal conflict within pentecostalism that first appeared within movement in teachings of charles fox parham not all pentecostal sects accepted teaching douglas gordon jacobsen 2006 a reader in pentecostal theology voices from first generation indiana university press p 31 prior to 1957 branham taught a doctrine of eternal punishment in hell by 1957 he had adopted an position in keeping with parham s teachings he began promoting belief that punishment of damned in hell would not last for eternity and that eventually damned would cease to exist he believed that eternal life was reserved only for god and his children in 1960 branham claimed holy spirit had revealed this doctrine to him as one of end time mysteries promoting annihilationism led to alienation of pentecostal groups that had rejected parham s teaching on subject godhead like other doctrines godhead formula was a point of doctrinal conflict within pentecostalism as branham began offering his own viewpoint it led to alienation of pentecostal groups adhering to trinitarianism branham shifted his theological position on godhead during his ministry early in his ministry branham espoused a position closer to an orthodox trinitarian view by early 1950s he began to privately preach oneness doctrine outside of his healing campaigns by 1960s he had changed to openly teaching oneness position according to which there is one god who manifests himself in multiple ways in contrast with trinitarian view that three distinct persons comprise godhead branham came to believe that trinitarianism was and insisted members of his congregation be re baptized in jesus s name in imitation of paul apostle branham believed his doctrine had a nuanced difference from oneness doctrine and to end of his ministry he openly argued that he was not a proponent of oneness doctrine he distinguished his baptismal formula from oneness baptism formula in name of jesus by teaching that baptismal formula should be in name of lord jesus christ he argued that there were many people named jesus but there is only one lord jesus christ by end of his ministry his message required an acceptance of oneness of godhead and baptism in name of lord jesus christ predestination branham adopted and taught a calvinistic form of doctrine of predestination and openly supported calvin s doctrine of eternal security both of which were at odds with arminian view of predestination held by pentecostalism unlike his views on godhead and annihilationism there was no precedence within pentecostalism for his views on predestination and opened him to widespread criticism branham lamented that more so than any other teaching pentecostals criticized him for his predestination teachings branham believed term predestination was widely misunderstood and preferred to use word foreknowledge to describe his views opposition to modern culture as branham s ministry progressed he increasingly condemned modern culture according to weaver branham s views on modern culture were primary reason growing charismatic movement rejected him his views also prevented him from following his contemporaries who were transitioning from healing revival to new movement he taught that immoral women and education were central sins of modern culture and were a result of serpent s seed branham viewed education as satan s snare for intellectual christians who rejected supernatural and satan s tool for obscuring simplicity of message and messenger weaver wrote that branham held a christ against culture opinion according to which loyalty to christ requires rejection of non christian culture an opinion not unique to branham pentecostalism inherited wesleyan doctrine of entire sanctification and outward holiness from its founders who came from wesleyan influenced denominations of post american civil war era rigid moral code associated with holiness movement had been widely accepted by pentecostals in early twentieth century branham s strict moral code echoed traditions of early pentecostalism but became increasingly unpopular because he refused to accommodate mid century pentecostalism s shifting viewpoint he denounced cigarettes alcohol television rock and roll and many forms of worldly amusement branham strongly identified with lower class roots of pentecostalism and advocated an ascetic lifestyle when he was given a new cadillac he kept it parked in his garage for two years out of embarrassment branham openly chastised other evangelists who seemed to be growing wealthy from their ministries and opposed prosperity messages being taught branham did not view financial prosperity as an automatic result of salvation he rejected prosperity gospel that originated in teachings of oral roberts and a a allen branham condemned any emphasis on expensive church buildings elaborate choir robes and large salaries for ministers and insisted church should focus on imminent return of christ branham s opposition to modern culture emerged most strongly in his condemnation of immorality of modern women he taught that women with short hair were breaking god s commandments and according to weaver ridiculed women s desire to artificially beautify themselves with makeup branham believed women were guilty of committing adultery if their appearance was intended to motivate men to lust and viewed a woman s place as in kitchen citing creation story in which eve is taken from adam s side branham taught that woman was a byproduct of man according to weaver his pronouncements with respect to women were often contradictory and he regularly offered glowing praise of women weaver stated that branham once told women who wore shorts not to call themselves christians but qualified his denunciations by affirming that obedience to holiness moral code was not a requirement for salvation branham did not condemn women who refused holiness moral code to hell but he insisted they would not be part of rapture weaver wrote that branham s attitude to women concerning physical appearance sexual drive and marital relations was misogynistic and that branham saw modern women as essentially immoral sexual machines who were to blame for adultery divorce and death they were tools of devil some of branham s contemporaries accused him of being a woman hater but he insisted he only hated immorality according to edward babinski women who follow holiness moral code branham supported regard it as a badge of honor serpent s seed branham taught an unorthodox doctrine of source of original sin he believed story of fall of man in garden of eden is allegorical and interpreted it to mean serpent had sexual intercourse with eve and that their offspring was cain branham taught that cain s modern descendants were masquerading as educated people and scientists and that cain s descendants were a big religious bunch of illegitimate bastard children who comprised majority of society s criminals he believed serpent was missing link between chimpanzee and man and speculated that serpent was possibly a human like giant branham held belief that serpent was transformed into a reptile after it was cursed by god weaver commented on branham s interpretation of story consequently every woman potentially carried literal seed of devil branham first spoke about original sin in 1958 he rejected orthodox view of subject and hinted at his own belief in a hidden meaning to story in later years he made his opinion concerning sexual nature of fall explicitly known weaver wrote that branham may have become acquainted with serpent s seed doctrine through his baptist roots daniel parker an american baptist minister from kentucky promulgated a similar doctrine in mid 1800s according to pearry green branham s teaching on serpent s seed doctrine was viewed by broader pentecostal movement as filthy doctrine that ruined his ministry no other mainstream christian group held a similar view branham was widely criticized for spreading doctrine his followers view doctrine as one of his greatest revelations eschatology in 1960 branham preached a series of sermons on seven church ages based on chapters two and three of book of revelation sermons closely aligned with teachings of c i scofield and clarence larkin leading proponents of dispensationalism in preceding generation like larkin and scofield branham said each church represents a historical age and taught that angel of each age was a significant church figure message included description of a messenger to laodicean church age which branham believed would immediately precede rapture branham explained laodicean age would be immoral in a way comparable to sodom and gomorrah and it would be a time in which christian denominations rejected christ as described by branham characteristics of laodicean age resemble those of modern era branham described characteristics of laodicean messenger by comparing his traits to elijah and john baptist he asserted messenger would be a mighty prophet who put word of god first that he would be a lover of wilderness that he would hate wicked women and be an uneducated person branham claimed messenger to this last age would come in spirit of elijah prophet and cited book of malachi 4 5 6 as basis for claiming elijah spirit would return his belief in a seventh church age messenger came from his interpretation of book of revelation 3 14 22 branham preached another sermon in 1963 further indicating he was a prophet who had anointing of elijah and was a messenger heralding second coming of christ branham did not directly claim to be end time messenger in either of his sermons weaver believed branham desired to be eschatological prophet he was preaching about but had self doubt branham left identity of messenger open to interpretation of his followers who widely accepted that he was that messenger branham regarded his 1963 series of sermons on seven seals as a highlight of his ministry according to weaver they were primarily a restatement of dispensationalism espoused in sermons on seven church ages sermons focused on book of revelation 6 1 17 and provided an interpretation of meaning of each of seals branham claimed sermons were inspired through an angelic visitation anti denominationalism branham believed denominationalism was a mark of beast which added to controversy surrounding his later ministry branham was not opposed to organizational structures his concern focused on road block to salvation and spiritual unity he believed denominations created by emphasizing loyalty to their organizations branham s doctrine was similar to anti catholic rhetoric of classical pentecostalism and protestantism which commonly associated mark of beast with catholicism branham though uniquely associated image of beast with protestant denominations in his later years he came to believe all denominations were synagogues of satan a key teaching of branham s message was a command to true christians to come out of denominations and accept message of laodicean messenger who had message of hour he argued that continued allegiance to a denomination was an acceptance of mark of beast which would mean missing rapture prophecies branham issued a series of prophecies during his ministry he claimed to have had a prophetic revelation in june 1933 that predicted seven major events would occur before second coming of christ his followers believe he predicted several events including 1937 ohio river flood in 1964 branham said judgement would strike west coast of united states and that los angeles would sink into ocean his most dramatic prediction following both 1933 and 1964 prophecies branham predicted rapture would happen by 1977 and would be preceded by various worldwide disasters unification of denominational christianity and rise to power of roman catholic pope peter duyzer among other of branham s critics wrote that either none of branham s prophecies came true or that they were all made after fact weaver wrote that branham tended to embellish his predictions over time branham s followers believe his prophecies came true or will do so in future restorationism of all of branham s doctrines his teachings on christian restorationism have had most lasting impact on modern christianity charismatic writer michael moriarty described his teachings on subject as extremely significant because they have impacted every major restoration movement since as a result moriarty concluded branham has profoundly influenced modern charismatic movement branham taught doctrine widely from early days of healing revival in which he urged his audiences to unite and restore a form of church organization like primitive church of early christianity teaching was accepted and widely taught by many of evangelists of healing revival and they took it with them into subsequent charismatic and evangelical movements paul cain bill hamon kenneth hagin and other restoration prophets cite branham as a major influence they played a critical role in introducing branham s restoration views to apostolic prophetic movement association of vineyard churches and other large charismatic organizations toronto blessing brownsville revival and other nationwide revivals of late 20th century have their roots in branham s restorationist teachings teaching holds that christianity should return to a form mirroring primitive christian church it supports restoration of apostles and prophets signs and wonders spiritual gifts spiritual warfare and elimination of non primitive features of modern christianity branham taught that by end of first century of christianity church had been contaminated by entrance of an antichrist spirit as a result he believed that from a very early date church had stopped following pure word of god and had been seduced into a false form of christianity he stated corruption came from desire of early christianity s clergy to obtain political power and as a result became increasingly wicked and introduced false creeds this led to denominationalism which he viewed as greatest threat to true christianity branham viewed martin luther as initiator of a process that would result in restoration of true form of christianity and traced advancement of process through other historic church figures he believed rapture would occur at culmination of this process although branham referred in his sermons to culmination of process as a future event affecting other people he believed he and his followers were fulfilling his restoration beliefs death on december 18 1965 branham and his family except his daughter rebekah were returning to jeffersonville indiana from tucson for christmas holiday about east of texas and about southwest of amarillo on us highway 60 just after dark a car driven by a drunken driver traveling westward in eastbound lane collided head on with branham s car he was rushed to hospital in amarillo where he remained comatose for several days and died of his injuries on christmas eve december 24 1965 branham s death stunned pentecostal world and shocked his followers his funeral was held on december 29 1965 but his burial was delayed his body was finally buried on april 11 1966 easter monday most eulogies only tacitly acknowledged branham s controversial teachings focusing instead on his many positive contributions and recalled his wide popularity and impact during years of healing revival gordon lindsay s eulogy stated that branham s death was will of god and privately he accepted interpretation of kenneth e hagin who claimed to have prophesied branham s death two years before it happened according to hagin god revealed that branham was teaching false doctrine and god was removing him because of his disobedience in confusion immediately following branham s death expectations that he would rise from dead developed among his followers most believed he would have to return to fulfill a vision he had regarding future tent meetings weaver attributed belief in branham s imminent resurrection to pearry green though green denied it even branham s son billy paul seemed to expect his father s resurrection and indicated as much in messages sent to branham s followers in which he communicated his expectation for easter 1966 expectation of his resurrection remained strong into 1970s in part based on branham s prediction that rapture could occur by 1977 after 1977 some of his followers abandoned his teachings legacy and influence branham was initiator of post world war ii healing revival and along with oral roberts was one of its most revered leaders branham is most remembered for his use of sign gifts that awed pentecostal world according to writer and researcher patsy sims power of a branham service and his stage presence remains a legend unparalleled in history of charismatic movement many revivalists who attempted to emulate branham during 1950s spawned a generation of prominent charismatic ministries branham has been called principal architect of restorationist thought of charismatic movement that emerged out of healing revival charismatic view that christian church should return to a form like that of early church has its roots in branham s teachings during healing revival period belief is widely held in modern charismatic movement and legacy of his restorationist teaching and ministering style is evident throughout televangelism and charismatic movement more controversial doctrines branham espoused in closing years of his ministry were rejected by charismatic movement which viewed them as revelatory madness charismatics are apologetic towards branham s early ministry and embrace his use of sign gifts charismatic author john crowder wrote that his ministry should not be judged by small sliver of his later life but by fact that he indirectly lit a fire that began modern charismatic movement non charismatic christianity completely rejected branham crowder said branham was a victim of adoration of man because his followers began to idolize him in later part of his ministry harrell took a similar view attributing branham s teachings in his later career to his close friends who manipulated him and took advantage of his lack of theological training weaver also attributed branham s eschatological teachings to influence of a small group of his closest followers who encouraged his desire for a unique ministry according to weaver to branham s dismay his followers had placed him at center of a pentecostal personality cult in final years of his ministry edward babinski describes branham s followers as odd in their beliefs but for most part honest hard working citizens and wrote that calling them a cult seems unfair while rejecting branham s teachings duyzer offered a glowing review of branham s followers stating he had never experienced friendship or love like we did there though branham is no longer widely known outside pentecostalism his legacy continues today summarizing contrasting views held of branham kydd stated some thought he was god some thought he was a dupe of devil some thought he was an end time messenger sent from god and some still do followers of branham s teachings can be found around world branham claimed to have made over one million converts
