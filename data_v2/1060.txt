criticized contradictory nature of taibbi as a member of press himself taking time in book to criticize media review concluded readers new to taibbi will regret not reading his reporting as events unfolded as his analysis is equal parts entertaining and enlightening kirkus reviews wrote that throughout chronology of taibbi s recounting of 2016 campaign book unfolds as a comedy that slowly turns into a horror movie kirkus reviews criticized author s tone in beginning of book taibbi is about populist forces and fractured media landscape trump exploited but given his admission of underestimating trump s chances his first chapter victory lap which annotates a chapter from his 2008 book great derangement to show how much he s correctly predicted feels defensive if not unseemly piece from kirkus reviews concluded a lively set of dispatches that shows how even harshest skeptic in pundit class can be blindsided los angeles review of books writer greg lagambina commented of book s acknowledgement of trump s win at end of election insane clown president dispatches from 2016 circus would have been a raucous good time chuckle of a read had ending not ruined ride lagambina

francisco chronicle book reviewer john diaz said work contained a rich trove of sharply written essays from campaign diaz wrote that insane clown president evokes a distinct aura of spare no niceties outsider approach that hunter s thompson brought to 1972 nixon mcgovern campaign in his seminal work fear and loathing on campaign trail diaz concluded insane clown president is a breezy read and will bring knowing chuckles among liberals who will savor its wickedly clever shots at all jesters in clown car who constituted republican primary field daily beast journalist john batchelor called book raucous trenchant knee slapping new york times reviewed work with john williams observing matt taibbi didn t see much moderation while covering most recent campaign season for rolling stone williams pointed out work did not make a pretense of having an objective viewpoint writing if his title or familiarity with his previous work didn t tip you off taibbi doesn t aim for a neutral tone bustle writer kerri jarema observed matt taibbi tells story of western civilization s very own train wreck from its tragicomic beginnings to its apocalyptic conclusion jarema described author s writing as dead on real time analysis david knight reviewed book for adelaide review and wrote of its author he is one of finest exponents of polemic journalism and regularly punches reader in gut with analogies and metaphors that brutally describe world around him knight observed taibbi s been called modern hunter s thompson many times but unlike overrated gonzo pioneer taibbi is able to brutally assess what s going on as well as cover mood of public with humour heart and venom minus ego his review concluded here his venom is not aimed at middle america but republican party democrats and media writing for pittsburgh post gazette journalist chris potter compared book to fear and loathing on campaign trail 72 by hunter s thompson commenting nearly a half century later another rolling stone writer matt taibbi has assembled a selection of his own 2016 reports and spoiler alert outcome is arguably not much different potter criticized work for not devoting more space to russian interference in 2016 united states elections he lamented i wish mr taibbi had delved into kremlin s meddling in 2016 election which was on display as early as last fall he s lived in and written extensively about contemporary russia and might have revealed some interesting correspondences between political culture there and here santa barbara independent journalist brian tanguay wrote in his book review that taibbi was spiritual heir of legendary presidential campaign scribes including hunter s thompson and timothy crouse tanguay said of taibbi s writing style taibbi is incisive and often incredibly funny as he recounts foibles of candidates and long enervating presidential primary process he observed a veteran of four presidential campaigns taibbi knows how game works or at least he knew until trump came tanguay s review concluded insane clown president is a valuable work about one of most bizarre electoral outcomes in american history references further reading external links at website of
