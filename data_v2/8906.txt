thumb a portion of julian scott portrait of mcclellan in national portrait gallery in washington d c george brinton mcclellan december 3 29 1885 was an american soldier civil engineer railroad executive and politician a graduate of west point mcclellan served with distinction during mexican american war and later left army to work in railroads until outbreak of american civil war early in conflict mcclellan was appointed to rank of major general and played an important role in raising a well trained and organized army which would become army of potomac in eastern theater he served a brief period november 1861 to march 1862 as general in chief of union army mcclellan organized and led union army in peninsula campaign in southeastern virginia from march through july 1862 it was first large scale offensive in eastern theater making an amphibious clockwise turning movement around confederate army in northern virginia mcclellan s forces turned west to move up virginia peninsula between james and york rivers landing from chesapeake bay with confederate capital richmond as their objective initially mcclellan was somewhat successful against general joseph e johnston but emergence of general robert e lee to command army of northern virginia turned subsequent seven days battles into a partial union defeat though historians note that lee s victory was in many ways pyrrhic as he failed to destroy army of potomac and suffered a bloody repulse at malvern hill historian stephan sears in to gates of richmond notes mcclellan s army of potomac inflicted 20 204 losses while only sustaining 15 855 themselves mcclellan s army would be withdrawn from peninsula in august 1862 military theorist emory upton noted at time that worst that could be said of peninsula campaign was that thus far it had not been successful to make it a failure was reserved for agency of general halleck general mcclellan failed to maintain trust of president abraham lincoln he did not trust his commander in chief and was privately derisive of him mcclellan was removed from command in november in aftermath of 1862 midterm elections this decision has contributed to mcclellan s supposed failure to decisively pursue lee s army following tactically inconclusive but strategic union victory at battle of antietam outside sharpsburg maryland future commander of army of potomac george gordon meade noted in his letters that decision was for political rather than military reasons even critics such as william swinton lamented timing of mcclellan s removal moment chosen was an inopportune and an ungracious one for never had mcclellan acted with such vigor and rapidity never had he shown so much confidence in himself or army in him mcclellan would never receive another field command and went on to become unsuccessful democratic party nominee in 1864 presidential election against republican lincoln s reelection effectiveness of his campaign was damaged when he repudiated his party s platform which promised an end to war and negotiations with southern confederacy he served as 24th governor of new jersey from 1878 to 1881 and eventually became a writer and vigorously defended his civil war conduct most classic histories have presented mcclellan as a poor battlefield general in recent decades however this view has been challenged some historians view him as a highly capable commander whose reputation suffered unfairly at hands of pro lincoln partisans who made him a scapegoat for union s military setbacks in particular mcclellan s role in maryland campaign has undergone a positive reassessment notably after war subsequent commanding general and 18th president ulysses s grant was asked for his opinion of mcclellan as a general he replied mcclellan is to me one of mysteries of war rowland mcclellan and civil war history p 166 early life and career george brinton mcclellan was born in philadelphia on december 3 1826 son of a prominent surgeon dr george

west point he was an energetic and ambitious cadet deeply interested in teachings of dennis hart mahan and theoretical strategic principles of antoine henri jomini his closest friends were aristocratic southerners such as james stuart dabney maury cadmus wilcox and a p hill these associations gave mcclellan what he considered to be an appreciation of southern mind and an understanding of political and military implications of sectional differences in united states that led to civil war rowland leaders p 260 rafuse p 36 mcclellan s friend james stuart was a south carolinian killed skirmishing with indians in 1851 he graduated at age 19 in 1846 second in his class of 59 cadets losing top position to charles seaforth stewart only because of poor drawing skills rowland leaders p

taylor awaited action mcclellan was stricken with dysentery and malaria which kept him in hospital for nearly a month malaria would recur in later years he called it his mexican disease sears young napoleon pp 14 15 he served as an engineering officer during war was frequently subject to enemy fire and was appointed a brevet first lieutenant for his services at contrerassmith 2001 pp 40 41 44

in war would shape his military and political life he learned that flanking movements used by scott at cerro gordo are often better than frontal assaults and value of siege operations veracruz he witnessed scott s success in balancing political with military affairs and his good relations with civil population as he invaded enforcing strict discipline on his soldiers to minimize damage to property mcclellan also developed a disdain for volunteer soldiers and officers particularly politicians who cared nothing for discipline and training rafuse pp 47 49 rowland leaders pp 260 61 sears young napoleon pp 16 17 peacetime service mcclellan returned to west point to command his engineering company which was attached to academy for purpose of training cadets in engineering activities he

given up for dead a sensational story had reached press that expedition had been ambushed by 2 000 comanches and killed to last man mcclellan blamed story on a set of scoundrels who seek to keep up agitation on frontier in order to get employment from govt in one way or other sears young napoleon pp 32 34 in fall of 1852 mcclellan published a manual on bayonet tactics that he had translated from original french he also received an assignment to department of texas with orders to perform a survey of texas rivers and harbors in 1853 he participated in pacific railroad surveys ordered by secretary of war jefferson davis to select an appropriate route for planned transcontinental railroad mcclellan surveyed western portion of northern corridor along 47th and 49th parallels from st paul to puget sound in doing so he demonstrated a tendency for insubordination toward senior political figures isaac stevens governor of washington territory became dissatisfied with mcclellan s performance in his scouting of passes across cascade range mcclellan selected yakima pass without a thorough reconnaissance and refused governor s order to lead a party through it in winter conditions relying on faulty intelligence about depth of snowpack in that area in so doing he missed three greatly superior passes in near vicinity which were eventually used for railroads and interstate highways governor ordered mcclellan to turn over his expedition logbooks but mcclellan steadfastly refused most likely because of embarrassing personal comments that he had made throughout his adventures sears young napoleon pp 40 41 returning to east mcclellan began courting his future wife mary ellen marcy 1836 1915 daughter of his former commander ellen or nelly refused mcclellan s first proposal of marriage one of nine that she received from a variety of suitors including his west point friend a p hill ellen accepted hill s proposal in 1856 but her family did not approve and he withdrew sears young napoleon p 61 in june 1854 mcclellan was sent on a secret reconnaissance mission to santo domingo at behest of jefferson davis mcclellan assessed local defensive capabilities for secretary information was not used until 1870 when president ulysses s grant unsuccessfully attempted to annex dominican republic davis was beginning to treat mcclellan almost as a protege and his next assignment was to assess logistical readiness of various railroads in united states once again with an eye toward planning for transcontinental railroad sears young napoleon pp 43 44 in march 1855 mcclellan was promoted to captain and assigned to 1st u s cavalry regiment because of his political connections and his mastery of french mcclellan received assignment to be an official observer of european armies in crimean war in 1855 traveling widely and interacting with highest military commands and royal families mcclellan observed siege of sevastopol upon his return to united states in 1856 he requested an assignment in philadelphia to prepare his report which contained a critical analysis of siege and a lengthy description of organization of european armies he also wrote a manual on cavalry tactics that was based on russian cavalry regulations like other observers though mcclellan did not appreciate importance of emergence of rifled muskets in crimean war and fundamental changes in warfare tactics it would require sears young napoleon pp 46 49 army adopted mcclellan s cavalry manual and also his design for a saddle dubbed mcclellan saddle which he claimed to have seen used by hussars in prussia and hungary it became standard issue for as long as u s horse cavalry existed and is still used for ceremonies civilian pursuits thumb george b mcclellan and mary ellen marcy nelly mcclellan mcclellan resigned his commission january 16 1857 and capitalizing on his experience with railroad assessment became chief engineer and vice president of illinois central railroad and then president of ohio and mississippi railroad in 1860 he performed well in both jobs expanding illinois central toward new orleans and helping ohio and mississippi recover from panic of 1857 despite his successes and lucrative salary 10 000 per year he was frustrated with civilian employment and continued to study classical military strategy assiduously during utah war against mormons he considered rejoining army he also considered service as a filibuster in support of benito juarez in mexico sears young napoleon p 56 before outbreak of civil war mcclellan became active in politics supporting presidential campaign of democrat stephen a douglas in 1860 election he claimed to have defeated an attempt at vote fraud by republicans by ordering delay of a train that was carrying men to vote illegally in another county enabling douglas to win county sears young napoleon p 59 in october 1859 mcclellan was able to resume his courtship of mary ellen and they were married in calvary church new york city on may 22 1860 sears young napoleon p 63 civil war ohio and strategy at start of civil war mcclellan s knowledge of what was called big war science and his railroad experience suggested he might excel at military logistics this placed him in great demand as union mobilized governors of ohio pennsylvania and new york three largest states of union actively pursued him to command their states militia ohio governor william dennison was most persistent so mcclellan was commissioned a major general of volunteers and took command of ohio militia on april 23 1861 unlike some of his fellow union officers who came from abolitionist families he was opposed to federal interference with slavery for this reason some of his southern colleagues approached him informally about siding with confederacy but he could not accept concept of secession sears young napoleon pp 66 69 on may 3 mcclellan re entered federal service as commander of department of ohio responsible for defense of states of ohio indiana illinois and later western pennsylvania western virginia and missouri on may 14 he was commissioned a major general in regular army at age 34 he outranked everyone in army except lt gen winfield scott general in chief mcclellan s rapid promotion was partly due to his acquaintance with salmon p chase treasury secretary and former ohio governor and senator sears young napoleon p 72 as mcclellan scrambled to process thousands of men who were volunteering for service and to set up training camps he also applied his mind to grand strategy he wrote a letter to gen scott on april 27 four days after assuming command in ohio that presented first proposal for a strategy for war it contained two alternatives each envisioning a prominent role for himself as commander first would use 80 000 men to invade virginia through kanawha valley toward richmond second would use same force to drive south instead crossing ohio river into kentucky and tennessee scott rejected both plans as logistically unfeasible although he complimented mcclellan and expressed his great confidence in your intelligence zeal science and energy he replied by letter that 80 000 men would be better used on a river based expedition to control mississippi river and split confederacy accompanied by a strong union blockade of southern ports this plan which would require considerable patience of northern public was derided in newspapers as anaconda plan but eventually proved to be outline of successful prosecution of war relations between two generals became increasingly strained over summer and fall sears young napoleon pp 75 76 western virginia mcclellan s first military operations were to occupy area of western virginia that wanted to remain in union and subsequently became state of west virginia he had received intelligence reports on may 26 that critical baltimore and ohio railroad bridges in that portion of state were being burned as he quickly implemented plans to invade region he triggered his first serious political controversy by proclaiming to citizens there that his forces had no intentions of interfering with personal property including slaves notwithstanding all that has been said by traitors to induce you to believe that our advent among you will be signalized by interference with your slaves understand one thing clearly not only will we abstain from all such interference but we will on contrary with an iron hand crush any attempted insurrection on their part he quickly realized that he had overstepped his bounds and apologized by letter to president lincoln controversy was not that his proclamation was diametrically opposed to administration s policy at time but that he was so bold in stepping beyond his strictly military role sears young napoleon pp 79 80 his forces moved rapidly into area through grafton and were victorious at tiny skirmish called battle of philippi arguably first land conflict of war his first personal command in battle was at rich mountain which he also won his subordinate commander william s rosecrans bitterly complained that his attack was not reinforced as mcclellan had agreed sears young napoleon pp 89 91 nevertheless these two minor victories propelled mcclellan to status of national hero beagle p 1274 new york herald entitled an article about him gen mcclellan napoleon

line from wheeling through pittsburgh philadelphia and baltimore and on to washington city and was greeted by enthusiastic crowds that met his train along way sears young napoleon p 95 carl sandburg wrote mcclellan was man of hour pointed to by events and chosen by an overwhelming weight of public and private opinion sandburg p 62 on july 26 day he reached capital mcclellan was appointed commander of military division of potomac main union force responsible for defense of washington on august 20 several military units in virginia were consolidated into his department and he immediately formed army of potomac with himself as its first commander beatie p 480 eicher pp 372 856 he reveled in his newly acquired power and influence thumb general george b mcclellan with staff dignitaries from left to right gen george w morell lt col a v colburn gen mcclellan lt col n b sweitzer prince de joinville son of king louis phillippe of france and on very right prince s nephew count de paris during summer and fall mcclellan brought a high degree of organization to his new army and greatly improved its morale with frequent trips to review and encourage his units it was a remarkable achievement in which he came to personify army of potomac and reaped adulation of his men sears young napoleon p 111 he created defenses for washington that were almost impregnable consisting of 48 forts and strong points with 480 guns manned by 7 200 artillerists sears young napoleon p 116 army of potomac grew in number from 50 000 in july to 168 000 in november becoming largest military force united states had raised until that time but this was also a time of tension in high command as he continued to quarrel frequently with government and general in chief lt gen scott on matters of strategy mcclellan rejected tenets of scott s anaconda plan favoring instead an overwhelming grand battle in napoleonic style he proposed that his army should be expanded to 273 000 men and 600 guns and crush rebels in one campaign he favored a war that would impose little impact on civilian populations and require no emancipation of slaves mcclellan s antipathy to emancipation added to pressure on him as he received bitter criticism from radical republicans in government sears young napoleon pp 98 99 he viewed slavery as an institution recognized in constitution and entitled to federal protection wherever it existed lincoln held same public position until august 1862 mcpherson tried by war p 122 mcclellan s writings after war were typical of many northerners i confess to a prejudice in favor of my own race can t learn to like odor of either billy goats or niggers but in november 1861 he wrote to his wife i will if successful throw my sword onto scale to force an improvement in condition of those poor blacks he later wrote that had it been his place to arrange terms of peace he would have insisted on gradual emancipation guarding rights of both slaves and masters as part of any settlement but he made no secret of his opposition to radical republicans he told ellen i will not fight for abolitionists this put him in opposition with officials of administration who believed he was attempting to implement policies of opposition party sears young napoleon pp 116 17 immediate problem with mcclellan s war strategy was that he was convinced confederates were ready to attack him with overwhelming numbers on august 8 believing that confederacy had over 100 000 troops facing him in contrast to 35 000 they had actually deployed at bull run a few weeks earlier he declared a state of emergency in capital by august 19 he estimated 150 000 rebel soldiers on his front mcclellan s subsequent campaigns were strongly influenced by overblown enemy strength estimates of his secret service chief detective allan pinkerton but in august 1861 these estimates were entirely mcclellan s own result was a level of extreme caution that sapped initiative of mcclellan s army and dismayed government historian and biographer stephen w sears observed that mcclellan s actions would have been essentially sound for a commander who was as outnumbered as mcclellan thought he was but mcclellan in fact rarely had less than a two to one advantage over armies that opposed him in 1861 and 1862 that fall for example confederate forces ranged from 35 000 to 60 000 whereas army of potomac in september numbered 122 000 men in early december 170 000 by year end 192 000 sears young napoleon pp 101 04 110 confederate returns for december 1861 found in official record ser 4 vol 1 place confederate aggregate present and absent in virginia at 133 876 men this places mcclellan s estimates as significantly closer than previously thought dispute with scott became increasingly personal scott as well as many in war department was outraged that mcclellan refused to divulge any details about his strategic planning or even such basic information as strengths and dispositions of his units mcclellan claimed he could not trust anyone in administration to keep his plans secret from press and thus enemy in course of a disagreement about defensive forces on potomac river mcclellan wrote to his wife on august 10 scott is great obstacle he will not comprehend danger is either a traitor or an incompetent i have to fight my way against him beatie pp 471 72 scott became so disillusioned with young general that he offered his resignation to president lincoln who initially refused to accept it rumors traveled through capital that mcclellan might resign or instigate a military coup if scott were not removed lincoln s cabinet met on october 18 and agreed to accept scott s resignation for reasons of health mcpherson battle cry p 360 however subsequently formed army of potomac had high morale and was extremely proud of their general some even referring to mcclellan as saviour of washington he prevented army s morale from collapsing at least twice in aftermath of first and second battles of bull run many historians argue that he was talented in this aspect general in chief thumb quaker guns logs used as ruses to imitate cannons in former confederate fortifications at manassas junction on november 1 1861 winfield scott retired and mcclellan became general in chief of all union armies president expressed his concern about vast labor involved in dual role of army commander and general in chief but mcclellan responded i can do it all lincoln as well as many other leaders and citizens of northern states became increasingly impatient with mcclellan s slowness to attack confederate forces still massed near washington union defeat at minor battle of ball s bluff near leesburg in october added to frustration and indirectly damaged mcclellan in december congress formed a joint committee on conduct of war which became a thorn in side of many generals throughout war accusing them of incompetence and in some cases treason mcclellan was called as first witness on december 23 but he contracted typhoid fever and could not attend instead his subordinate officers testified and their candid admissions that they had no knowledge of specific strategies for advancing against confederates raised many calls for mcclellan s dismissal sears young napoleon pp 136 37 mcclellan further damaged his reputation by his insulting insubordination to his commander in chief he privately referred to lincoln whom he had known before war as a lawyer for illinois central as nothing more than a well meaning baboon a gorilla and ever unworthy of his high position mcpherson battle cry p 364 on november 13 he snubbed president who had come to visit mcclellan s house by making him wait for 30 minutes only to be told that general had gone to bed and could not receive him sears young napoleon pp 132 33 on january 10 lincoln met with top generals mcclellan did not attend and directed them to formulate a plan of attack expressing his exasperation with general mcclellan with following remark if general mcclellan does not want to use army i would like to borrow it for a time mcpherson tried by war p 66 on january 12 1862 mcclellan was summoned to white house where cabinet demanded to hear his war plans for first time he revealed his intentions to transport army of potomac by ship to urbanna virginia on rappahannock river outflanking confederate forces near washington and proceeding overland to capture richmond he refused to give any specific details of proposed campaign even to his friend newly appointed war secretary edwin m stanton on january 27 lincoln issued an order that required all of his armies to begin offensive operations by february 22 washington s birthday on january 31 he issued a supplementary order for army of potomac to move overland to attack confederates at manassas junction and centreville mcclellan immediately replied with a 22 page letter objecting in detail to president s plan and advocating instead his urbanna plan which was first written instance of plan s details being presented to president although lincoln believed his plan was superior he was relieved that mcclellan finally agreed to begin moving and reluctantly approved on march 8 doubting mcclellan s resolve lincoln again interfered with army commander s prerogatives he called a council of war at white house in which mcclellan s subordinates were asked about their confidence in urbanna plan they expressed their confidence to varying degrees after meeting lincoln issued another order naming specific officers as corps commanders to report to mcclellan who had been reluctant to do so prior to assessing his division commanders effectiveness in combat even though this would have meant his direct supervision of twelve divisions in field sears young napoleon pp 140 41 149 160 two more crises would confront mcclellan before he could implement his plans confederate forces under general joseph e johnston withdrew from their positions before washington assuming new positions south of rappahannock which completely nullified urbanna strategy mcclellan revised his plans to have his troops disembark at fort monroe virginia and advance up virginia peninsula to richmond an operation that would be known as peninsula campaign then however mcclellan came under extreme criticism in press and congress when it was learned that johnston s forces had not only slipped away unnoticed but had for months fooled union army with logs painted black to appear as cannons nicknamed quaker guns congress s joint committee visited abandoned confederate lines and radical republicans introduced a resolution demanding dismissal of mcclellan but it was narrowly defeated by a parliamentary maneuver sears young napoleon pp 168 69 second crisis was emergence of confederate ironclad css virginia which threw washington into a panic and made naval support operations on james river seem problematic on march 11 1862 lincoln removed mcclellan as general in chief leaving him in command of only army of potomac ostensibly so that mcclellan would be free to devote all his attention to move on richmond lincoln s order was ambiguous as to whether mcclellan might be restored following a successful campaign in fact general in chief position was left unfilled lincoln stanton and a group of officers who formed war board directed strategic actions of union armies that spring although mcclellan was assuaged by supportive comments lincoln made to him in time he saw change of command very differently describing it as a part of an intrigue to secure failure of approaching campaign sears young napoleon pp 164 65 peninsula campaign thumb peninsula campaign map of events up to battle of seven pines thumb seven days battles june 25 july 1 1862 mcclellan s army began to sail from alexandria on march 17 it was an armada that dwarfed all previous american expeditions transporting 121 500 men 44 artillery batteries 1 150 wagons over 15 000 horses and tons of equipment and supplies an english observer remarked that it was stride of a giant sears young napoleon pp 167 69 army s advance from fort monroe up virginia peninsula proved to be slow mcclellan s plan for a rapid seizure of yorktown was foiled by removal of 1st corps from army of potomac for defense of washington mcclellan had hoped to use 1st corps to capture point and thus outflank confederate position when he discovered that confederates had fortified a line across peninsula he hesitated to attack as swinton notes it is possible however and there is a considerable volume of evidence bearing upon this point that general mcclellan during all earlier portion of month before yorktown had it in his mind even without mcdowell s corps to undertake decisive turning movement by north side of york in this event it would not only be in direction of his plan to make no attack but it would play into his hands that his opponent should accumulate his forces on peninsula yet this halting between two opinions had result that when he had abandoned purpose of making turning movement it had become too late for him to make a direct attack mcclellan asked for opinion of his chief engineer john g barnard who recommended against an assault this caused him to decide on a siege of city which required considerable preparation mcclellan continued to believe intelligence reports that credited confederates with two or three times men they actually had early in campaign confederate general john b prince john magruder defended peninsula against mcclellan s advance with a vastly smaller force he created a false impression of many troops behind lines and of even more troops arriving he accomplished this by marching small groups of men repeatedly past places where they could be observed at a distance or were just out of sight accompanied by great noise and fanfare bailey forward to richmond p 99 during this time general johnston was able to provide magruder with reinforcements but even then there were far fewer troops than mcclellan believed were opposite him after a month of preparation just before he was to assault confederate works at yorktown mcclellan learned that johnston had withdrawn up peninsula towards williamsburg mcclellan was thus required to give chase without any benefit of heavy artillery so carefully amassed in front of yorktown battle of williamsburg on may 5 is considered a union victory mcclellan s first but confederate army was not destroyed and a bulk of their troops were successfully moved past williamsburg to richmond s outer defenses while battle was waged and for several days thereafter bailey forward to richmond pp 107 13 mcclellan had also placed hopes on a simultaneous naval approach to richmond via james river that approach failed following union navy s defeat at battle of drewry s bluff about downstream from confederate capital on may 15 basing artillery on a strategic bluff high above a bend in river and sinking boats to create an impassable series of obstacles in river itself confederates effectively blocked this potential approach to richmond bailey forward to richmond pp 128 29 mcclellan s army moved towards richmond over next three weeks coming to within four miles 6 km of it he established a supply base on pamunkey river a navigable tributary of york river at white house landing where richmond and york river railroad extending to richmond crossed and commandeered railroad transporting steam locomotives and rolling stock to site by barge sears gates pp 103 04 on may 31 as mcclellan planned an assault his army was surprised by a confederate attack johnston saw that union army was split in half by rain swollen chickahominy river and hoped to defeat it in detail at seven pines and fair oaks mcclellan was unable to command army personally because of a recurrence of malarial fever but his subordinates were able to repel attacks nevertheless mcclellan received criticism from washington for not counterattacking which some believed could have opened city of richmond to capture johnston was wounded in battle and general robert e lee assumed command of army of northern virginia mcclellan spent next three weeks repositioning his troops and waiting for promised reinforcements as lee recounted mcclellan was attempted to make this a battle of posts which would lock confederate army in an battle with superior union firepower at end of june lee began a series of attacks that became known as seven days battles first major battle at mechanicsville was poorly coordinated by lee and his subordinates and resulted in heavy casualties for little tactical gain however battle had a significant impact on mcclellan s nerve surprise appearance of maj gen stonewall jackson s troops in battle when they had last been reported to be many miles away in shenandoah valley convinced mcclellan that he was even more outnumbered than he had thought he reported to washington that he faced 200 000 confederates perhaps due to a false report on arrival of another confederate army p g t beauregard number of men mcclellan was actually faced varies with joseph harsh in confederate tide rising placing lee s army at 112 220 men compared with 105 857 under mcclellan thumb left federal troops under heavy attack at battle of gaines s mill sketched by alfred r waud and published in harper s weekly july 26 1862 lee continued his offensive at gaines s mill to east that night mcclellan decided to withdraw his army to a safer base well below richmond on a portion of james river that was under control of union navy in doing so lee had assumed that union army would withdraw to east toward its existing supply base and mcclellan s move to south delayed lee s response for at least 24 hours sears young napoleon p 216 ethan rafuse notes mcclellan s change of base to james however thwarted lee s attempt to do this not only did mcclellan s decision allow federals to gain control of time and place for battles that took place in late june and early july it enabled them to fight in a way that inflicted terrible beating on confederate army more importantly by end of seven days battles mcclellan had dramatically improved his operational situation but mcclellan was also tacitly acknowledging that he would no longer be able to invest richmond object of his campaign heavy siege artillery required would be almost impossible to transport without railroad connections available from his original supply base on york river in a telegram to secretary of war edwin stanton reporting on these events mcclellan blamed lincoln administration for his reversals if i save this army now i tell you plainly i owe no thanks to you or to any other persons in washington you have done your best to sacrifice this army beagle p 1275 fortunately for mcclellan lincoln never saw that inflammatory statement at least at that time because it was censored by war department telegrapher thumb wounded men after battle of savage s station one of seven days battles mcclellan was also fortunate that failure of campaign left his army mostly intact because he was generally absent from fighting and neglected to name any second in command who might direct his retreat sears young napoleon p 217 military historian stephen w sears wrote when he deserted his army on glendale and malvern hill battlefields during seven days he was guilty of dereliction of duty had army of potomac been wrecked on either of these fields at glendale possibility had been real that charge under articles of war would likely have been brought against him sears controversies p 16 in battle of glendale mcclellan was five miles 8 km away behind malvern hill without telegraph communications and too distant to command his army in battle of malvern hill he was on a gunboat u s s galena which at one point was ten miles 16 km away down james river sears gates pp 280 309 in both battles effective command of army fell to his friend and v corps commander brigadier general fitz john porter when public heard about galena it was yet another great embarrassment comparable to quaker guns at manassas editorial cartoons published in course of 1864 presidential campaign lampooned mcclellan for having preferred safety of a ship while a battle was fought in distance sears young napoleon p 221 mcclellan was reunited with his army at harrison s landing on james debates were held as to whether army should be evacuated or attempt to resume an offensive toward richmond mcclellan maintained his estrangement from abraham lincoln with his repeated call for reinforcements and by writing a lengthy letter in which he proposed strategic and political guidance for war continuing his opposition to abolition or seizure of slaves as a tactic he concluded by implying he should be restored as general in chief but lincoln responded by naming maj gen henry w halleck to post without consulting or even informing mcclellan sears young napoleon p 227 lincoln and stanton also offered command of army of potomac to maj gen ambrose burnside who refused appointment sears young napoleon p 235 back in washington a reorganization of units created army of virginia under maj gen john pope who was directed to advance toward richmond from northeast mcclellan not wishing to abandon his campaign delayed return of army of potomac from peninsula enough so that reinforcements arrived while northern virginia campaign was already underway sixth corps under porter from army of potomac would serve with pope during campaign a frustrated mcclellan wrote to his wife before battle pope will be thrashed be disposed of by lee such a villain as he is ought to bring defeat upon any cause that employs him mcpherson battle cry p 525 lee had gambled on removing significant units from peninsula to attack pope who was beaten decisively at second bull run in august maryland campaign thumb mcclellan riding through frederick maryland september 12 1862 from frank leslie s illustrated newspaper thumb maryland campaign actions september 3 15 1862 after defeat of pope at second bull run president lincoln reluctantly returned to man who had mended a broken army before he realized that mcclellan was a strong organizer and a skilled trainer of troops able to recombine units of pope s army with army of potomac faster than anyone on september 2 1862 lincoln named mcclellan to command fortifications of washington and all troops for defense of capital appointment was controversial in cabinet a majority of whom signed a petition declaring to president our deliberate opinion that at this time it is not safe to entrust to major general mcclellan command of any army of united states sears young napoleon p 260 president admitted that it was like curing bite with hair of dog but lincoln told his secretary john hay we must use what tools we have there is no man in army who can man these fortifications and lick these troops of ours into shape half as well as he if he can t fight himself he excels in making others ready to fight bailey bloodiest day p 15 northern fears of a continued offensive by robert e lee were realized when he launched his maryland campaign on september 4 hoping to arouse pro southern sympathy in slave state of maryland mcclellan s pursuit began on september 5 he marched toward maryland with six of his reorganized corps numbers vary as to size of mcclellan s forc with its paper strength at 87 164 steven r stotelmyer in too useful to sacrifice places it about 60 000 men noting that 87 000 number includes non combat soldiers and units not immediately available mcclellan would leave two corps behind to defend washington mcclellan s reception in frederick maryland as he marched towards lee s army was described by correspondent for harper s magazine lee divided his forces into multiple columns spread apart widely as he moved into maryland and also maneuvered to capture federal arsenal at harpers ferry this was a risky move for a smaller army but lee was counting on his knowledge of mcclellan s temperament he told one of his generals he is an able general but a very cautious one his army is in a very demoralized and chaotic condition and will not be prepared for offensive operations or he will not think it so for three or four weeks before that time i hope to be on susquehanna bailey bloodiest day p 21 lee s assessment proved to be inaccurate as mcclellan reacted quickly with confederate leader remarking that mcclellan was advancing more rapidly than was convenient many classic histories have portrayed mcclellan s army was moving lethargically averaging only a day bailey bloodiest day p 23 however as noted by stotelmyer this number comes from halleck and does not match primary source data numerous regimental histories from period recall movements more than double reported six miles meanwhile union soldiers accidentally found a copy of lee s orders dividing his army wrapped around a package of cigars in an abandoned camp they delivered order to mcclellan s headquarters in frederick on september 13 upon realizing intelligence value of this discovery mcclellan threw up his arms and exclaimed now i know what to do he waved order at his old army friend brig gen john gibbon and said here is a paper with which if i cannot whip bobbie lee i will be willing to go home he telegraphed president lincoln i have whole rebel force in front of me but i am confident and no time shall be lost i think lee has made a gross mistake and that he will be severely punished for it i have all plans of rebels and will catch them in their own trap if my men are equal to emergency will send you trophies sears landscape p 113 battle of south mountain thumb battle of south mountain despite this initial show of bravado mcclellan soon became faced with fact that lee s order was now obsolete incomplete missing first two sections and was not clear as to troop numbers despite its acclaim by many historians order gave mcclellan little he did not already know mcclellan within hours of receiving order dispatched his cavalry to assess its accuracy by 6 20 he was issuing his orders for following day some have inaccurately claimed mcclellan delayed some 18 hours before reacting this however is easily disproven by fact that his army was in motion all day on 13th due to orders mcclellan from following day it was mcclellan s practice to write his orders night before for following day mcclellan ordered his units to set out for south mountain passes and was able to punch through defended passes that separated them from lee stubborn confederate defenses gave lee enough time to concentrate many of his men at sharpsburg maryland as noted by historians such as stotelmyer significance of union victory at south mountain should not be underestimated it ruined lee s plans to invade pennsylvania and took initiative away from confederate commander battle of south mountain also presented mcclellan with an opportunity for one of great theatrical moments of his career as historian sears describes union army reached antietam creek to east of sharpsburg on evening of september 15 a planned attack on september 16 was put off because of early morning fog allowing lee to prepare his defenses with an army less than half size of mcclellan s bailey bloodiest day pp 61 64 battle of antietam thumb overview of battle of antietam thumb lincoln with mcclellan and staff after battle of antietam notable figures

of antietam on september 17 1862 was single bloodiest day in american military history mcclellan developed a complex battle plan to defeat lee s army as ethan rafuse in mcclellan s war outlines it was an excellent tactical plan that took advantage of merits of attacks on both left and right ensured that mcclellan had ability to control his army and flexibility to respond to events and all contingencies outnumbered confederate forces however fought desperately and well lee was able to shift his defenders to parry each of three union thrusts launched separately and sequentially against confederate left center and finally right union efforts were also frustrated by wounding of two corps commanders and difficult terrain some classic histories james m mcpherson have criticized mcclellan from keeping two corps reserve during battle mcpherson crossroads pp 129 30 stotelmyer however believes that mcclellan s reserve poll was far smaller than previously thought further he states that two corps in question were not in reserve per existing doctrine as they were manning portions of line he additionally notes that mcclellan did not display his famed caution at battle as he attacked an enemy he believed outnumbered him on high ground thumb left lincoln in mcclellan s tent after battle of antietam battle was tactically inconclusive with union suffering a higher overall number of casualties although lee technically was defeated because he withdrew first from battlefield and retreated back to virginia and lost a larger percentage of his army than did mcclellan wired to washington our victory was complete enemy is driven back into virginia yet there was obvious disappointment that mcclellan had not crushed lee who was fighting with a smaller army with its back to potomac river although mcclellan s subordinates can claim their share of responsibility for delays such as ambrose burnside s misadventures at burnside bridge and blunders edwin v sumner s attack without reconnaissance these were localized problems from which full army could have recovered historians have faulted mcclellan for accepting cautious advice about saving his reserves such as when a significant breakthrough in center of confederate line could have been exploited but fitz john porter is said to have told mcclellan remember general i command last reserve of last army of republic bailey bloodiest day p 141 however veracity of this supposed statement is in doubt porter in post war period never claimed to have made statement and it also fails to note several union corps at that time defending washington despite being a tactical draw antietam is considered a turning point of war and a victory for union because it ended lee s strategic campaign his first invasion of north and it allowed president lincoln to issue emancipation proclamation on september 22 taking effect on january 1 1863 although lincoln had intended to issue proclamation earlier he was advised by his cabinet to wait until a union victory to avoid perception that it was issued out of desperation union victory and lincoln s proclamation played a considerable role in dissuading governments of france and britain from recognizing confederacy some suspected they were planning to do so in aftermath of another union defeat mcpherson crossroads p 155 mcclellan had no prior knowledge that plans for emancipation rested on his battle performance lincoln ordered mcclellan s removal from command on november 5 1862 maj gen ambrose burnside assumed command of army of potomac on november 9 1862 sears young napoleon pp 238 41 mcclellan wrote to his wife those in whose judgment i rely tell me that i fought battle splendidly and that it was a masterpiece of art i feel i have done all that can be

trenton new jersey for further orders although none were issued as war progressed there were various calls to return mcclellan to an important command following union defeats at fredericksburg and chancellorsville as robert e lee moved north at start of gettysburg campaign and as jubal early threatened washington in 1864 when ulysses s grant became general in chief he discussed returning mcclellan to an unspecified position but all of these opportunities were impossible given opposition within administration and knowledge that mcclellan posed a potential political threat mcclellan worked for months on a lengthy report describing his two major campaigns and his successes in organizing army replying to his critics and justifying his actions by accusing administration of undercutting him and denying him necessary reinforcements war department was reluctant to publish his report because just after completing it in october 1863 mcclellan openly declared his entrance to

november 8 1864 mcclellan supported continuation of war and restoration of union but not abolition of slavery but party platform written by copperhead leader clement of ohio was opposed to this position platform called for an immediate cessation of hostilities and a negotiated settlement with confederacy mcclellan was forced to repudiate platform which made his campaign inconsistent and

his qualities as a commander so minutely and we may add so fiercely discussed sears young napoleon p 401 this fierce discussion has continued for over a century mcclellan is usually ranked in lowest tier of civil war generals however debate over mcclellan s ability and talents remains subject of much controversy among civil war and military historians he has been universally praised for his organizational abilities and for his very good relations with his troops they referred to him affectionately as little mac others sometimes called him young napoleon mcclellan himself summed up his style of warfare in a draft of his memoirs stephen sears notes that one of reasons that mcclellan s reputation has suffered is his own memoirs historian allan nevins wrote students of history must always be grateful mcclellan so frankly exposed his own weaknesses in this posthumous book nevins pp 294 95 doris kearns goodwin claims that a review of his personal correspondence during war reveals a tendency for self aggrandizement and unwarranted self congratulation goodwin pp 378 79 his original draft was completed in 1881 but only copy was destroyed by fire he began to write another draft of what would be published posthumously in 1887 as mcclellan s own story however he died before it was half completed and his literary executor william c prime editor of pro mcclellan new york journal of

mcclellan s reputation has suffered over time especially over later half of 20th century there is a small but intense cadre of american civil war historians who believe that general has been poorly served in at least four regards first mcclellan proponents say that because general was a conservative democrat with great personal charisma radical republicans fearing his political potential deliberately undermined his field operations eckenrode conrad pp 46 47 170 second that as radical republicans were true winners coming out of american civil war they were able to write its history placing their principal political rival of time mcclellan in worst possible light eckenrode conrad p 280 third that historians eager to jump on bandwagon of lincoln as america s greatest political icon worked to outdo one another in shifting blame for early military failures from lincoln and secretary of war edwin m stanton to mcclellan rowland mcclellan and civil war history pp 46 50 and fourth that lincoln and stanton deliberately undermined mcclellan because of his conciliatory stance towards south which might have resulted in a less destructive end to war had richmond fallen as a result of peninsula campaign eckenrode conrad p 238 rowland mcclellan and civil war history pp 97 99 proponents of this school claim that mcclellan is criticized more for his admittedly abrasive personality than for his actual field performance rowland mcclellan and civil war history pp 7 8 rowland leaders pp 268 70 provides a concise historiography of mcclellan s legacy stating that mcclellan has had few supporters in literature over last half century rafuse pp 384 96 presents an analysis of mcclellan that is more sympathetic than majority of current works focusing not only on his military strategy but how his whig political heritage affected way he proposed to wage war in a manner that would promote reconciliation with south several geographic features and establishments
