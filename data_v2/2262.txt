courtyard containing many houses for exclusive use of ashkenazim adjacent to a synagogue built on pillars referring to ramban synagogue shulman 1992 p 51 52 ramban synagogue had been used jointly by both ashkenazim and sephardim until 1586 when ottoman authorities confiscated building thereafter ashkenazim established a synagogue within their own adjacent courtyard judah hehasid and aftermath 1700s in winter of 1700 a group of around 500 ashkenazim led by judah hehasid arrived from europe they were mystics who were intent on advancing arrival of messianic era by settling in jerusalem and leading ascetic lives millgram 1990 pp 109 14 a few days after their arrival in city hehasid died and without a leader their messianic hopes dissipated and community began to disintegrate those who remained managed to build forty dwellings and a small synagogue in ashkenazic compound soon after they endeavoured to construct a larger synagogue but task proved expensive they found themselves having to bribe ottoman authorities in order to enable them to proceed with their building project unexpected costs relating to construction financial hardships and burden of various other taxes drained their funds they became impoverished and were forced to take loans from local arabs eventually falling into severe debt pressure and threats from creditors led to a rabbinical emissary being sent abroad to solicit funds for repayment of loans rossoff 1997 in late 1720 with debts still outstanding lis 2008 arab lenders lost patience and set synagogue and its contents alight leaders of community were imprisoned and shortly after all ashkenazim were banished from city rossoff 1998 p 119 over course of time shops were built in courtyard and synagogue was left desolate in a pile of rubble it thus became known as ruin of rabbi judah hehasid efforts of perushim 1812 37 between 1808 and 1812 another group of ascetic jews known as perushim immigrated to palestine from lithuania they were disciples of vilna gaon and had settled in city of safed to north some had wished to settle in jerusalem and reclaim ashkenazic compound they were worried however that descendants of arab creditors still held old promissory notes relating to century old debts incurred by he hasid s followers and that a new group of ashkenazic immigrants would possibly inherit responsibility for repayment descendants of a group of hasidim who made aliyah in 1777 also presented a problem they apparently objected to any effort by perushim to take control of synagogue ruin claiming it had never belonged to perushim or their ancestors hasidim claimed they had closer ties with original owners and that their rights to parcel of land were greater morgenstern 2006 p 99 nevertheless in late 1815 leader of safed perushim rabbi menachem mendel of arrived in jerusalem with a group of followers they directed their main efforts to rebuilding he hasid s synagogue which had symbolised expulsion of ashkenazim from jerusalem by this they intended to demonstrate re establishment of ashkenazic presence in city rebuilding one of jerusalem s ruins would also have symbolic kabbalistic significance repairing of an earlier destruction would represent first step of rebuilding entire city a prerequisite for arrival of messiah in 1816 they pleaded with powers in city of constantinople to obtain a royal decree that arabs residing in jerusalem would not be permitted to enforce debts of ashkenazim but nothing came of it a year later several leaders of group including avraham shlomo zalman zoref a lithuanian born silversmith and travelled to constantinople endeavouring to obtain such a firman imperial decree two years later in 1819 their efforts were realised and century old debts were cancelled morgenstern 2006 pp 114 15 group acquired a legal document delineating entire site acquired by he hasid in 1700 area now included dilapidated dwellings and shops built by creditors heirs on part of site next they had to secure another firman that would permit construction at site including building of a large synagogue two successive missions in 1820 and 1821 to obtain firman from sultan s court failed still awaiting imperial permission to build in courtyard perushim wished to rely on an old firman given to jews in 1623 which stated that there could be no objection to them building in their own quarters having received a supporting document issued by qadi of jerusalem in march 1824 it was possible for them begin rebuilding dwellings in courtyard in practice however construction never materialised as they were unable to exercise their authority over plot of land this was apparently due to confrontation with arab squatters and local government s disregard of documents proving their ownership of courtyard morgenstern 2006 p 117 in 1825 following disruption group were experiencing shapira travelled to europe once again he hoped to secure necessary firman which would place courtyard firmly in perushim s possession and also to raise funds to cover costs incurred trying to redeem courtyard his mission however was unsuccessful as was a later mission attempted in 1829 by zoref egypt gives ambiguous consent with annexation of jerusalem by egypt in 1831 a new opportunity arose for perushim they petitioned muhammad ali regarding rebuilding of synagogue but concerns about deviating from longstanding muslim tradition and pact of umar which restricted repair or construction of non muslim houses of worship meant permission was not forthcoming however five months after earthquake of may 1834 prohibition was relaxed and sephardim were allowed to carry out repair works to their existing synagogues this consent gave rise to further efforts by ashkenazim to receive authorisation to rebuild theirs morgenstern 2006 p 118 on june 23 1836 after traveling to egypt zoref together with backing of austrian and russian consuls in alexandria obtained long awaited firman it seems he was successful in gaining support of austrian consul and muhammad ali by invoking name of baron salomon mayer von rothschild of vienna muhammad ali was hopeful that by giving his permission to rebuild ruin rothschild would be inclined to forge financial and political ties with him which would in turn secure political support of austria and france in fact rothschild s involvement was a ruse as soon as zoref received firman he contacted zvi hirsch lehren of clerks organisation in amsterdam requesting that funds his brother had pledged towards building of synagogues in palestine be applied to ruin morgenstern 2006 p 119 but lehren had doubts as to what exactly firman permitted explicit authorisation for construction of a large synagogue was absent a letter from leaders of amsterdam community to moses montefiore in 1849 confirms that permission for a synagogue in ashkenasic compound had not been sanctioned they had only been allowed to build dwellings in area morgenstern 2006 p 120 menachem zion synagogue in spite of doubts highlighted in relation to construction of a synagogue perushim confidently in possession of ambiguous firman began clearing away rubble from ruin courtyard in september 1836 as foundations of he hasid s original synagogue were revealed they discovered a few old documents dating from 1579 signed by israel ben moses rossoff 1998 pp 185 86 after much debate they decided not to rebuild ruin but initially erect a small structure on edge of ashkenasic compound arab creditors however still refused to relinquish claims they had on jews and continued to interfere with works zoref claiming that ashkenazim currently in jerusalem were not related in any way to those who had borrowed money at turn of 18th century was forced to appear in court requesting a further ruling cancelling debts he mentioned that an injunction had already been passed that absolved ashkenazim from repaying 2006 p 121 and maintained that turkish statute of limitations cancelled out debts of judah hehasid s followers although court ruled in ashkenazim s favour zoref nevertheless had to appease arab instigators with annual bribes in order to allow building to continue at some point this arrangement ceased and in 1851 he was struck on head with a sword and died of his wounds three months later shragai 2008 benvenisti 2007 p 113 by january

upon which he hasid s synagogue had stood 130 years earlier however remained in ruins rebuilding he hasid s ruin 1857 64 in early 1850s perushim felt ready to attempt building a larger synagogue on he hasid s original site an outcome of crimean war was british government s willingness to use its increased influence at constantinople to intervene on behalf of its jewish subjects who resided in jerusalem on july 13 1854 james finn of british consulate in jerusalem wrote to british ambassador in constantinople describing wishes of 2 000 strong ashkenazic community to build a new synagogue he
