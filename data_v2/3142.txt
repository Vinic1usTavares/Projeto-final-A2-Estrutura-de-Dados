working on first version of song stewart came up with track while magnet developed melody on a piano and some of lyrics american producer dream became involved after stewart proposed him to work together on track for spears he explained i was just getting into business i m in atlanta driving home in a 92 cadillac and i get call i hung up and just screamed out joyous sounds during recording sessions stewart recalls that studio s air conditioning died for three days but spears didn t complain or anything and for me that shows she s where she is for a reason while rehearsing for their performance at 2003 mtv video music awards spears played a finished version of me against music to madonna after madonna commented that she liked track spears asked her to do song with her redzone then handed me against music to madonna who arranged and recorded her vocal additions on her own therefore making song a duet spears who has been a madonna fan for years was beyond surprised when she heard madonna s verse she said i just asked her to do a little thing but she really went there she did a lot of stuff to it jive records hoped outrageous would be released as first single from album but spears pushed for me against music after she performed song for first time at 2003 nfl kickoff live spears refused to answer if it was first single from album but said that there are some surprises that are going to come up in song that i m really excited about on september 16 2003 it was confirmed that me against music would be released as first single from in zone composition and remixes me against music is a dance and hip hop song with usage of funk guitars song features madonna but was constructed as a duet after she was added to track spears and madonna trade lines during verses and madonna sings solo in bridge stewart described sound as half rapping half singing and beat driven according to sheet music published at musicnotes com by hal leonard corporation me against music is set in a moderate dance beat with a tempo of 120 beats per minute spears s vocal range span from low note of g2 to high note of b4 gavin mueller of stylus magazine deemed spears s vocals as sexy and sultry and compared them to those of prince in song spears and madonna sing of pleasures of letting go on dancefloor in lyrics such as i m up against speaker trying to take on music it s like a competition spears explained concept of song as basically about just going to a club and letting yourself go and battling with whoever is around you and battling against music as well magnet continued saying like she was hearing music and trying to out dance track or out beat drum or out pluck guitar it s as if she s in club losing herself in music william shaw of blender stated madonna s verse could be interpreted as her passing baton to a new talent as well as a taunt from old guard to uptight youngster a number of remixes were commissioned by jive records to accompany song australian cd singles included remixes by artists such peter rauhofer rishi rich passengerz and terminalhead us cd single also contained remixes by trak starz gabriel dresden bloodshy avant and kanye west rishi rich s desi kulcha remix was later included in track list of in zone remix removes original melody of song and adds a clattering backbeat and punjabi shouts kelefa sanneh of new york times called remix excellent noting that it is so frenetic you barely notice ms spears and madonna it s odd to hear two such ubiquitous figures sounding so anonymous britney had also contacted outkast to remix me against music but remix was not released critical response upright thumb spears performing me against music at onyx hotel tour alt a woman wearing a red ensemble standing in front of a metallic staircase around a group of dancers stephen thomas erlewine of allmusic selected me against music as one of track picks from in zone caryn ganz of spin called song a fine specimen of britney 4 0 a fast paced dance anthem all grinding percussion shuttling through a traffic jam of synths dave de sylvia of sputnikmusic said that aside from numerous rather awful name dropping passages and a disappointing chorus track is an ideal way to open album it s an up tempo dance track with a big name attached what else could you ask for sal cinquemani of slant magazine deemed it as arguably one of britney s finest moments and one of her mentor s worst nick southall of stylus magazine said that madonna vamps it up literally her appearance here is not sapphic but vampiric wizened old crone bleeding another period of forced longevity into her career like a corpse leaking plasma backwards on me against music but can t make it a bad tune gavin mueller also writing for stylus magazine said that single benefits from a kinetic garage inspired beat even when a tepid madonna threatens to spoil fun spence d of ign commented initially catchy it s ultimately forgettable other than it s musical counterpart fallout to from duo s lip lock publicity stunt on 2003 mtv music video awards jamie gill of yahoo music radio stated that madonna s appearance on brilliantly titled but deeply dreary me against music was a postmodern prank designed to make all sane listeners think actually american life was pretty good after all while reviewing singles collection mayer nissim of digital spy said that only arguable weak link is madonna featuring me against music but in this context what once looked like a respectful passing of baton now seems like an unconditional surrender of pop to its rightful heir david browne of entertainment weekly called me against music album s coy overly busy single dorian lynskey of guardian noted it as only duff track of album jon pareles of rolling stone wrote madonna shows up in album s first song me against music as if endorsing spears s foray into come hither posing and club land beats larry flick from advocate denounced track as an into groove redux he added that song propels listener into spears collaborations with heavy hitting producers there s nary a hint of her pristine pop past on kelly s hip grinding outrageous or perry s girls boys instead spears swims through dark often hip hop hued waters with occasional forays into minor keyed electro dance terrain ali fenwick of johns hopkins news letter said despite bringing out big guns in a duet with madonna me against music is not danceable measure of success in any pop tune linda mcgee of rte ie commented that although much of content of in zone is catchy it is hard to see any potential singles impressing as much as me against music kelefa sanneh of new york times deemed it as an odd overstuffed track not so much a song as a series of party chants mim udovitch of blender called it lackluster while ranking madonna s singles in honor of her 60th birthday guardians jude rogers placed song at number 71 writing that madonna is usually better when she s striding alone this duet with britney is all raunch and no solid roots commercial performance upright thumb spears performing me against music at 2003 nfl kickoff live alt a blond female performer in a black and white ensemble

over three days in october 2003 at silvercup studios in long island city new york it was directed by paul hunter who revealed that concept was setting spears and madonna apart hence spears wore a black outfit whereas madonna sported a white suit spears stated video is more sensual than i m used to it was my first time doing a collaboration and i got madonna it s really interesting to see two different styles together kevin tancharoen was choreographer of video vehicle used in video a mazda rx 8 was autographed by spears on hood and auctioned off to benefit britney spears foundation in 2009 hunter talked to mtv news about video saying madonna is an icon of an earlier generation and then britney of newer generation she was at her peak at that point so it was a challenge to kind of bring both of worlds together i wanted it to be a bit of a cat and mouse sort of game and a little bit of a foreplay between britney and madonna and just sort of tease audience synopsis video starts with britney parking mazda vehicle and going into a new york nightclub she enters a wooden room populated with cool kids flaunting pink and purple hair while taking from an oxygen tank madonna who is in a room filled with men smoking cigars observes her from television monitors throughout club she wears a white trouser suit and carries a cane signifying a position of moneyed power her suit is also notably fitted especially in waistcoat revealing madonna s body to be female and not masculine although areas are separated by a wall spears and madonna sense their presences through extrasensory perception and dance in synchronicity julie andsager in sex in consumer culture 2006 noted that video hints at a same sex relationship between two this is followed with spears performing a dance routine inside a blacklight paint graffiti room and two women dancing around a metal spears then begins chasing madonna in a wooden like maze and latter enters a room covered with fallen leaves and stands in a swing once spears finds room madonna is nowhere to be found throughout video madonna gradually loses her symbolic power paralleled by her disposing cane and jacket becoming less phallic and more noticeably female biologically and more feminine socially although it ultimately seems that spears becomes dominant figure madonna recovers her phallic power in form of a cigar from an onlooking male spears appears in madonna s room and throws her against wall and madonna vanishes just as they are about to kiss video ends as madonna s laugh is heard in background release and reception video premiered on television on making video on october 21 2003 at 23 00 edt its online premiere was on yahoo music it was viewed more than 2 million times in its first five days video

weeks after snogging at mtv video music awards they teamed up for another raunchy double act video highlight comes with pair embracing against a wall only for madonna to vanish just as they are about to kiss julie andsager stated fantasy fulfillment strategy of spears continued with madonna kiss and me against music video but added that she has perhaps taken her sexuality to its extreme for network television at least at age of 22 said that it showcases an entire range of different female roles between older and younger sign systems author judith ann commented in 1963 judy garland presented barbra streisand as her protegee as songstress and gay icon in 2003 madonna instated spears as her protegee in same sex erotica and icon of polymorphous sexuality live performances left
