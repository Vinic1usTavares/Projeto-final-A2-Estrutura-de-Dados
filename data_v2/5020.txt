singapura is one of smallest breeds of cats noted for its large eyes and ears brown ticked coat and blunt tail reportedly established from three drain cats imported from singapore in 1970s it was later revealed that cats were originally sent to singapore from us before they were exported back to us investigations by cat fanciers association cfa concluded no wrongdoing and singapura kept its status as a natural breed history foundation in 1975 after working in singapore tommy and hal meadow returned to us with what they say were three local brown ticked cats these three cats a pair of male and female kittens from same litter and another young female were foundation used to establish singapura breed takes its name from malay name for singapore in 1981 a breeder visited singapore and chanced upon a cat fitting profile of singapura with exception of tail in local society for prevention of cruelty to animals cat was imported to us and adopted into breeding program thumb left singapuras at a cat show singapura was accepted for registration by tica in 1979 for championship competition and by cfa in 1982 and granted championship status in 1988 in between this period breeders found that occasional litter would have a solid colored kitten caused by recessive gene for solid color in a desire for singapura to breed true many breeders chose to do test matings to pinpoint and remove from their breeding programs individuals with recessive gene it was discovered that two of three foundation cats carried this gene controversy in 1987 while on a cat finding trip to singapore american breeder jerry mayes discovered importation papers which revealed that three foundation cats were actually taken into singapore from us in 1974 lucy koh a friend of mayes made efforts to correct history of singapura presented by meadows but that went relatively unnoticed until 1990 when singapore tourist promotion board currently singapore tourism board started a campaign to use singapura as a national mascot reporter sandra davie was informed of discrepancy and published an article about it in national broadsheet straits times thumb an abyssinian left and singapura because cats were registered as abyssinians in import certificates and because meadows had been breeders of abyssinian burmese and siamese some have speculated that singapura is a burmese abyssinian cross and it has even been described as such by cfa judges resemblance of some burmese abyssinian cross to singapura as well as singapura s small litter size which is uncommon in natural breeds added more doubts to meadows story cfa investigated incident at request of a singapura breed club in investigation hal meadow told investigation board that three cats were grandchildren of four local cats he sent back to us during a previous sensitive business trip to singapore in 1971 contradicting meadows earlier claim of foundation cats origin apparently tommy meadow lied about it to conceal secret trip cfa found no wrongdoing and kept singapura s status as a natural breed cfa s joan miller said that whether they mated on streets of singapore or whether they mated in michigan it doesn t really matter referring to cat picked up from spca in 1981 she said that in addition there is at least one documented cat that is behind many singapura pedigrees and it was picked up at pound even with none of cats meadows brought in we still have a legitimate cat from singapore behind our singapuras recent studies in 2007 based on feline dna showed that there are very few genetic differences between singapura and burmese adding support to claim that singapura is not a natural breed singapuras in singapore thumb common singapore drain cat singapore tourist and promotion board stpb proceeded with decision to use breed advertised under name kucinta as a tourism mascot after cfa concluded its investigation name kucinta is an amalgamation of malay words kucing cat and cinta love and taken from

issue that affects breed is pyruvate kinase deficiency which leads to hemolytic anemia typical symptoms includes lethargy diarrhea lack of appetite poor coat quality weight loss and jaundice some breeders have shown concern regarding lack of genetic diversity in breed due to inbreeding caused by a small gene pool researchers who completed 2007 dna study found that singapura along with burmese have least genetic diversity among 22 breeds studied possibility of outcrossing with another breed to increase genetic diversity had been raised among cfa breeders but not many were receptive to idea preferring to use singapuras from around world that are not so closely related to cfa line in april 2013 uk s governing council of cat fancy started allowing outcrossing for breed individuals chosen
