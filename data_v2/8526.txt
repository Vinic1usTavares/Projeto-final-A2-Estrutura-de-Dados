infobox character image jpg caption admiral ackbar in return of jedi 1983 name ackbar series star wars first last ackbar s appearance in film was created using a combination of either a half body puppet or a full body costume depending on camera angle required for shot puppet and mask were created by monster shop of industrial light magic motion picture visual effects company founded by lucas in close up scenes of ackbar that required dialogue puppeteer timothy m rose sat inside chest of character and operated head like a traditional hand puppet from below rose moved mouth using his hand while mike quinn operated eyes via cables jumpsuit of that version of costume was cut off at waist and each sleeves included additional access points where a puppeteer could insert his or her arm to control ackbar s hands for wider shots that showed ackbar s full body rose wore mask and costume while quinn operated mouth via remote though most other rebel officers in return of jedi briefing room scene wore earth tones felt ackbar s costume should be more crisp and distinctive he was an admiral he was more military his costume looks hard costume designer aggie rodgers helped create ackbar costume for which rose wore a beanbag like piece around his belly to create ackbar s distinctive silhouette rose wore a white nylon jumpsuit over it which had a pattern loosely based on ski jumpsuits used in costuming other background characters as well as yellow striping down side of legs artificial fabric used on jumpsuit made a distinct scratching sound whenever actor walked which rodgers said was a nuisance for film s sound crew over jumpsuit rose wore a vest made of white felt along with a white plastic utility belt a rank badge on left side of his chest and a large collar to accommodate unique profile of ackbar s head white boots ackbar wears in film are same design as those worn by imperial stormtroopers a white helmet with an elongated back to accommodate ackbar s large oval shaped head was featured in original character sketches and was created for ackbar however it created too many complications with operation of puppet head so it was worn by another mon calamari character instead edwina a textile artist who handled breakdown and aging of costumes in film said she was unhappy with final result of ackbar s costume she later reflected that all white costume could have used more aging saying i had to airbrush it which was done very fast and it does look kind of like it s outlined not enough was done with that filming ackbar has 14 lines of dialogue in return of jedi and character s scenes took six weeks to shoot due to uncertainty whether mouth about movement ackbar puppet would look realistic while delivering dialogue alternative scenes were shot with general crix madine a human character delivering ackbar s most important lines in case they had to be used instead none of these shots ultimately had to be used in final film occasionally members of film crew jokingly referred to ackbar character as ernie ackbar and his name appeared that way on some of film s progress reports when inside of costume became hot visual effects artist phil tippett who designed most of film s creatures would use a hair dryer to blow cool air through mouth of ackbar mask to keep rose comfortable although character was created with best available puppetry technology at time lucas was not entirely pleased with final result and felt it was a compromise according to book star wars costumes original trilogy published in 2014 original masks used for ackbar costumes are in a fragile state today during filming of 2005 star wars film revenge of sith lucas was so impressed with animatron mask used on mon calamari character meena tills that he briefly considered return of jedi and replacing footage of admiral ackbar with an improved mask this ultimately never occurred portrayals timothy rose thumb 195 px right timothy rose pictured here in 2016 portrayed

at workshop where several alien puppets were stored rose saw ackbar s sculpt on a display stand and asked phil tippett if he could play part tippett told him it was a background character and rose did not know ackbar would play a major supporting role in film he only asked to portray him because he liked look of character and said he was thinking he was going to be in third row in a new cantina sequence or something rose was not required to audition for part of ackbar before being given role rose returned to portray ackbar in force awakens and last jedi each day he was provided with pages from script only for specific scenes that were being shot so he knew little about final role ackbar would play in films until shooting took place rose was frustrated by amount of secrecy on set which he felt prevented him and other actors from having everything they needed to do their jobs as well as possible many of ackbar s scenes were cut from first film which rose said was a disappointment to him after waiting 30 years to reprise ackbar after character s scenes in last jedi were complete crew took footage of rose in ackbar s costume saying it s a wrap a reference to character s death and

disappointment with ackbar s sudden death in last jedi calling it abrupt and unceremonious fans particularly criticized that ackbar was only featured in background of shot where he dies with camera focused primarily on leia organa and that his death is mentioned only in passing by other characters later scott chitwood of theforce net said he deserved a little more attention i would have liked to see him killed in action in final battle but i guess that s asking a lot of a sickly old admiral screen rant writer ben sherlock wrote of ackbar s death it was such a fleeting moment that many fans

death scene disrespectful and rude and that ackbar deserved better than to go out in a throwaway moment ackbar actors tim rose and tom kane also said they were disappointed with how character s death was handled rose hoped ackbar would have a more substantial role in last jedi than he had in latter film and was unhappy character again received little screen time and was abruptly killed rose said each day i would come to work going is today day when ackbar gets something a bit more involving and i looked at my script and i went oh ackbar s going out of window well that s that then kane likewise thought death scene was poorly handled and believed ackbar should have been given larger role in last jedi that went to vice admiral holdo a new character played by laura dern last jedi editor bob said he was also disappointed with how scene was handled saying it was slightly incidental though he said scene was intentionally designed that way and he did not come to have second thoughts about it until after watching completed film gary whitta who co wrote story for film rogue one and wrote several other star wars projects said he was saddened by how quickly ackbar died others defended way ackbar s character was killed alex leadbeater features editor of website screen rant felt scene was widely misunderstood by fans and served to advanced storyline particularly to establish ensuing conflict between holdo and resistance pilot poe dameron leadbeater wrote ackbar had no place in last jedi s narrative you can argue he should have had a greater send off but it must be said that to do so would undercut entire set piece in last jedi episode of comedic animated webseries how it should have ended which parodies and reimagines aspects of popular films ackbar s
