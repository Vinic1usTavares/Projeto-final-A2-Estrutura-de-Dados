section of building reserved for drunk people meyers 254 poe is said to have repeatedly called out name reynolds on night before his death though no one has ever been able to identify person to whom he referred one possibility is that he was recalling an encounter with jeremiah n reynolds a newspaper editor and explorer who may have inspired novel narrative of arthur gordon pym of nantucket almy robert f j n reynolds a brief biography with particular reference to poe and symmes colophon 2 2 posner memorial collection another possibility is henry r reynolds one of judges overseeing fourth ward

convinced that poe died from alcoholism and did a great deal to popularize this idea he was a supporter of temperance movement and found poe a useful example in his temperance work however snodgrass s writings on topic have been proven untrustworthy moran contradicted snodgrass by stating in his own 1885 account that poe did not die under effect of any intoxicant moran claimed that poe had not
