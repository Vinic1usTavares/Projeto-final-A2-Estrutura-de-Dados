thumb 350px right figure 1 in classic cyclol reaction two peptide groups are linked by a n c bond converting carbonyl oxygen into a hydroxyl group although this reaction occurs in a few cyclic peptides it is disfavored by free energy mainly because it eliminates resonance stabilization of peptide bond this reaction was basis of dorothy wrinch s cyclol model of proteins cyclol hypothesis is first structural model of a folded globular protein it was developed by dorothy wrinch in late 1930s and was based on three assumptions firstly hypothesis assumes that two peptide groups can be crosslinked by a cyclol reaction figure 1 these crosslinks are covalent analogs of non covalent hydrogen bonds between peptide groups these reactions have been observed in and other compounds secondly it assumes that under some conditions amino acids will naturally make maximum possible number of cyclol crosslinks resulting in cyclol molecules figure 2 and cyclol fabrics figure 3 these cyclol molecules and fabrics have never been observed finally hypothesis assumes that globular proteins have a tertiary structure corresponding to platonic solids and semiregular polyhedra formed of cyclol fabrics with no free edges such closed cyclol molecules have not been observed either although later data demonstrated that this original model for structure of globular proteins needed to be amended several elements of cyclol model were verified such as cyclol reaction itself and hypothesis that hydrophobic interactions are chiefly responsible for protein folding cyclol hypothesis stimulated many scientists to research questions in protein structure and chemistry and was a precursor of more accurate models hypothesized for dna double helix and protein secondary structure proposal and testing of cyclol model also provides an excellent illustration of empirical falsifiability acting as part of scientific method historical context by mid 1930s analytical ultracentrifugation studies by theodor svedberg had shown that proteins had a well defined chemical structure and were not aggregations of small molecules same studies appeared to show that molecular weight of proteins fell into a few well defined classes related by integers such as mw da where p and q are nonnegative integers however it was difficult to determine exact molecular weight and number of amino acids in a protein svedberg had also shown that a change in solution conditions could cause a protein to disassemble into small subunits now known as a change in quaternary structure chemical structure of proteins was still under debate at that time most accepted and ultimately correct hypothesis was that proteins are linear polypeptides i e unbranched polymers of amino acids linked by peptide bonds however a typical protein is remarkably long hundreds of amino acid residues and several distinguished scientists were unsure whether such long linear macromolecules could be stable in solution further doubts about polypeptide nature of proteins arose because some enzymes were observed to cleave proteins but not peptides whereas other enzymes cleave peptides but not folded proteins attempts to synthesize proteins in test tube were unsuccessful mainly due to chirality of amino acids naturally occurring proteins are composed of only left handed amino acids hence alternative chemical models of proteins were considered such as hypothesis of emil however no alternative model had yet explained why proteins yield only amino acids and peptides upon hydrolysis and proteolysis as clarified by linderstrom lang these proteolysis data showed that denatured proteins were polypeptides but no data had yet been obtained about structure of folded proteins thus denaturation could involve a chemical change that converted folded proteins into polypeptides process of protein denaturation as distinguished from coagulation had been discovered in 1910 by harriette chick and charles martin but its nature was still mysterious tim anson and alfred mirsky had shown that denaturation was a reversible two state process that results in many chemical groups becoming available for chemical reactions including cleavage by enzymes in 1929 hsien wu hypothesized correctly that denaturation corresponded to protein unfolding a purely conformational change that resulted in exposure of amino acid side chains to solvent preliminary reports were presented before international congress of physiology at boston 19 24 august 1929 and in october 1929 issue of american journal of physiology wu s hypothesis was also advanced independently in 1936 by mirsky and linus pauling nevertheless protein scientists could not exclude possibility that denaturation corresponded to a chemical change in protein structure a hypothesis that was considered a distant possibility until 1950s x ray crystallography had just begun as a discipline in 1911 and had advanced relatively rapidly from simple salt crystals to crystals of complex molecules such as cholesterol however even smallest proteins have over 1000 atoms which makes determining their structure far more complex in 1934 dorothy crowfoot hodgkin had taken crystallographic data on structure of small protein insulin although structure of that and other proteins were not solved until late 1960s however pioneering x ray fiber diffraction data had been collected in early 1930s for many natural fibrous proteins such as wool and hair by william astbury who proposed rudimentary models of secondary structure elements such as alpha helix and beta sheet since protein structure was so poorly understood in 1930s physical interactions responsible for stabilizing that structure were likewise unknown astbury hypothesized that structure of fibrous proteins was stabilized by hydrogen bonds in b sheets idea that globular proteins are also stabilized by hydrogen bonds was proposed by dorothy jordan lloyd in 1932 and championed later by alfred mirsky and linus pauling at a 1933 lecture by astbury to oxford junior scientific society physicist frederick frank suggested that fibrous protein a keratin might be stabilized by an alternative mechanism namely covalent crosslinking of peptide bonds by cyclol reaction above cyclol crosslink draws two peptide groups close together n and c atoms are separated by 1 5 a whereas they are separated by 3 a in a typical hydrogen bond idea intrigued j d bernal who suggested it to mathematician dorothy wrinch as possibly useful in understanding protein structure basic theory thumb right 300px figure 2 alanine cyclol 6 molecule proposed by dorothy wrinch is a cyclic in which three peptide groups are fused by cyclol reactions into a central ring three outer unfused peptide groups are not planar but have dihedral angle o 60deg three red atoms in central ring represent hydroxyl groups formed by cyclol reactions whereas three outer red atoms represent of carbonyl groups inner oxygen atoms are separated by only 2 45 a which is extremely close even for hydrogen bonded atoms this hypothetical molecule has not been observed in nature wrinch developed this suggestion into a full fledged model of protein structure basic cyclol model was laid out in her first paper 1936 she noted possibility that polypeptides might to form closed rings true and that these rings might form internal crosslinks through cyclol reaction also true although rare assuming that cyclol form of peptide bond could be more stable than amide form wrinch concluded that certain cyclic peptides would naturally make maximal number of cyclol bonds such as cyclol 6 figure 2 such cyclol molecules would have hexagonal symmetry if chemical bonds were taken as having same length roughly 1 5 a for comparison n c and c c bonds have lengths 1 42 a and 1 54 a respectively these rings can be extended indefinitely to form a cyclol fabric figure 3 such fabrics exhibit a long range quasi crystalline order that wrinch felt was likely in proteins since they must pack hundreds of residues densely another interesting feature of such molecules and fabrics is that their amino acid side chains point axially upwards from only one face opposite face has no side chains thus one face is completely independent of primary sequence of peptide which wrinch conjectured might account for sequence independent properties of proteins in her initial article wrinch stated clearly that cyclol model was merely a working hypothesis a potentially valid model of proteins that would have to be checked her goals in this article and its successors were to propose a well defined testable model to work out consequences of its assumptions and to make predictions that could be tested experimentally in these goals she succeeded however within a few years experiments and further modeling showed that cyclol hypothesis was untenable as a model for globular proteins stabilizing energies thumb left 350px figure 3 stick model of alanine cyclol fabric proposed by dorothy wrinch cyclol fabric is conceptually similar to a beta sheet but more uniform and laterally denser fabric has large lacunae arranged in a hexagonal pattern in which three cb atoms shown in green and three ha atoms shown in white converge on a relatively empty spot in fabric two sides of fabric are not equivalent all cb atoms emerge from same side which is upper side here red atoms represent hydroxyl groups not carbonyl groups and emerge in sets of three from both sides of fabric blue atoms represent nitrogen this hypothetical structure has not been observed in nature in two tandem letters to editor 1936 wrinch and frank addressed question of whether cyclol form of peptide group was indeed more stable than amide form a relatively simple calculation showed that cyclol form is significantly less stable than amide form therefore cyclol model would have to be abandoned unless a compensating source of energy could be identified initially frank proposed that cyclol form might be stabilized by better interactions with surrounding solvent later wrinch and irving langmuir hypothesized that hydrophobic association of nonpolar sidechains provides stabilizing energy to overcome energetic cost of cyclol reactions lability of cyclol bond was seen as an advantage of model since it provided a natural explanation for properties of denaturation reversion of cyclol bonds to their more stable amide form would open up structure and allows those bonds to be attacked by proteases consistent with experiment early studies showed that proteins denatured by pressure are often in a different state than same proteins denatured by high temperature which was interpreted as possibly supporting cyclol model of denaturation langmuir wrinch hypothesis of hydrophobic stabilization shared in downfall of cyclol model owing mainly to influence of linus pauling who favored hypothesis that protein structure was stabilized by hydrogen bonds another twenty years had to pass before hydrophobic interactions were recognized as chief driving force in protein folding steric complementarity in her third paper on cyclols 1936 wrinch noted that many physiologically active substances such as steroids are composed of fused hexagonal rings of carbon atoms and thus might be sterically complementary to face of cyclol molecules without amino acid side chains wrinch proposed that steric complementarity was one of chief factors in determining whether a small molecule would bind to a protein wrinch speculated that proteins are responsible for synthesis of all biological molecules noting that cells digest their proteins only under extreme starvation conditions wrinch further speculated that life could not exist without proteins hybrid models from beginning cyclol reaction was considered as a covalent analog of hydrogen bond therefore it was natural to consider hybrid models with both types of bonds this was subject of wrinch s fourth paper on cyclol model 1936 written together with dorothy jordan lloyd who first proposed that globular proteins are stabilized by hydrogen bonds a follow up paper was written in 1937 that referenced other researchers on hydrogen bonding in proteins such as maurice loyal huggins and linus pauling wrinch also wrote a paper with william astbury noting possibility of a keto enol isomerization of caha and an amide carbonyl group c o producing a crosslink ca c oha and again converting oxygen to a hydroxyl group such reactions could yield five membered rings whereas classic cyclol hypothesis produces six membered rings this keto enol crosslink hypothesis was not developed much further space enclosing fabrics thumb right 350px figure 4 stick model of cyclol c1 protein structure proposed by dorothy wrinch molecule is a truncated tetrahedron composed of four planar cyclol fabrics each surrounding one lacuna 48 residues and joined together pairwise by four residues along each edge two residues at each corner thus this molecule has 72 amino acid residues altogether it is viewed here face on i e looking into lacuna of one cyclol fabric side chains taken here as alanine all point into interior of this cage like structure this hypothetical structure has not been observed in nature in her fifth paper on cyclols 1937 wrinch identified conditions under which two planar cyclol fabrics could be joined to make an angle between their planes while respecting chemical bond angles she identified a mathematical simplification in which non planar six membered rings of atoms can be represented by planar median hexagon s made from midpoints of chemical bonds this median hexagon representation made it easy to see that cyclol fabric planes can be joined correctly if dihedral angle between planes equals tetrahedral bond angle d 1 3 109 47deg a large variety of closed polyhedra meeting this criterion can be constructed of which simplest are truncated tetrahedron truncated octahedron and octahedron which are platonic solids or semiregular polyhedra considering first series of closed cyclols those modeled on truncated tetrahedron wrinch showed that their number of amino acids increased as where n is index of closed cyclol cn thus c1 cyclol has 72 residues c2 cyclol has 288 residues etc preliminary experimental support for this prediction came from max bergmann and carl niemann whose amino acid analyses suggested that proteins were composed of integer multiples of 288 amino acid residues n 2 more generally cyclol model of globular proteins accounted for early analytical ultracentrifugation results of theodor svedberg which suggested that molecular weights of proteins fell into a few classes related by integers cyclol model was consistent with general properties then attributed to folded proteins 1 centrifugation studies had shown that folded proteins were significantly denser than water 1 4 g ml and thus tightly packed wrinch assumed that dense packing should imply regular packing 2 despite their large size some proteins crystallize readily into symmetric crystals consistent with idea of symmetric faces that match up upon association 3 proteins bind metal ions since metal binding sites must have specific bond geometries e g octahedral it was plausible to assume that entire protein also had similarly crystalline geometry 4 as described above cyclol model provided a simple chemical explanation of denaturation and difficulty of cleaving folded proteins with proteases 5 proteins were assumed to be responsible for synthesis of all biological molecules including other proteins wrinch noted that a fixed uniform structure would be useful for proteins in templating their own synthesis analogous to watson francis crick concept of dna templating its own replication given that many biological molecules such as sugars and sterols have a hexagonal structure it was plausible to assume that their synthesizing proteins likewise had a hexagonal structure wrinch summarized her model and supporting molecular weight experimental data in three review articles predicted protein structures having proposed a model of globular proteins wrinch investigated whether it was consistent with available structural data she hypothesized that bovine tuberculin protein 523 was a c1 closed cyclol consisting of 72 residues and that digestive enzyme pepsin was a c2 closed cyclol of 288 residues these residue number predictions were difficult to verify since methods then available to measure mass of proteins were inaccurate such as analytical ultracentrifugation and chemical methods wrinch also predicted that insulin was a c2 closed cyclol consisting of 288 residues limited x ray crystallographic data were available for insulin which wrinch interpreted as confirming her model however this interpretation drew rather severe criticism for being premature careful studies of patterson diagrams of insulin taken by dorothy crowfoot hodgkin showed that they were roughly consistent with cyclol model however agreement was not good enough to claim that cyclol model was confirmed implausibility of model thumb left 350px figure 5 diagram of alanine cyclol fabric as seen from side where none of cb atoms emerge this figure shows threefold symmetry of fabric and also its extraordinary density for example in lacunae where three cb atoms shown in green and three ha atoms shown as white triangles converge carbons and hydrogens are separated by only 1 68 a larger green spheres represent cb atoms ca atoms are generally not visible except as little triangles next to blue nitrogen atoms as before red atoms represent hydroxyl groups not carbonyl oxygen atoms cyclol fabric was shown to be implausible for several reasons hans neurath and henry bull showed that dense packing of side chains in cyclol fabric was inconsistent with experimental density observed in protein films maurice huggins calculated that several non bonded atoms of cyclol fabric would approach more closely than allowed by their van der waals radii for example inner ha and ca atoms of lacunae would be separated by only 1 68 a figure 5 showed chemically that outside of proteins could not have a large number of hydroxyl groups a key prediction of cyclol model whereas meyer and showed that cyclol condensations of amino acids did not exist even in minute quantities as a transition state more general chemical arguments against cyclol model were given by bergmann and niemann and by neuberger infrared spectroscopic data showed that number of carbonyl groups in a protein did not change upon hydrolysis and that intact folded proteins have a full complement of amide carbonyl groups both observations contradict cyclol hypothesis that such carbonyls are converted to hydroxyl groups in folded proteins finally proteins were known to contain proline in significant quantities typically 5 since proline lacks amide hydrogen and its nitrogen already forms three covalent bonds proline seems incapable of cyclol reaction and of being incorporated into a cyclol fabric an encyclopedic summary of chemical and structural evidence against cyclol model was given by pauling and niemann moreover a supporting piece of evidence result that all proteins contain an integer multiple of 288 amino acid residues was likewise shown to be incorrect in 1939 wrinch replied to steric clash free energy chemical and residue number criticisms of cyclol model on steric clashes she noted that small deformations of bond angles and bond lengths would allow these steric clashes to be relieved or at least reduced to a reasonable level she noted that distances between non bonded groups within a single molecule can be shorter than expected from their van der waals radii e g 2 93 a distance between methyl groups in hexamethylbenzene regarding free energy penalty for cyclol reaction wrinch disagreed with pauling s calculations and stated that too little was known of intramolecular energies to rule out cyclol model on that basis alone in reply to chemical criticisms wrinch suggested that model compounds and simple reactions studied need not pertain to cyclol model and that steric hindrance may have prevented surface hydroxyl groups from reacting on residue number criticism wrinch extended her model to allow for other numbers of residues in particular she produced a minimal closed cyclol of only 48 residues and on that incorrect basis may have been first to suggest that insulin monomer had a molecular weight of roughly 6000 da therefore she maintained that cyclol model of globular proteins was still potentially viable and even proposed cyclol fabric as a component of cytoskeleton however most protein scientists ceased to believe in it and wrinch turned her scientific attention to mathematical problems in x ray crystallography to which she contributed significantly one exception was physicist gladys anslow wrinch s colleague at smith college who studied ultraviolet absorption spectra of proteins and peptides in 1940s and allowed for possibility of cyclols in interpreting her results as sequence of insulin began to be determined by frederick sanger anslow published a three dimensional cyclol model with sidechains based on backbone of wrinch s 1948 minimal cyclol model partial redemption thumb 300px right figure 6 a typical azacyclol molecule red in a rapid equilibrium with its bislactam form blue amide groups of bislactam form are crosslinked in cyclol form these two have similar stability giving an equilibrium constant of 1 however open form black is unstable and not observed downfall of overall cyclol model generally led to a rejection of its elements one notable exception was j d bernal s short lived acceptance of langmuir wrinch hypothesis that protein folding is driven by hydrophobic association nevertheless cyclol bonds were identified in small naturally occurring cyclic peptides in 1950s clarification of modern terminology is appropriate classic cyclol reaction is addition of nh amine of a peptide group to c o carbonyl group of another resulting compound is now called an azacyclol by analogy an oxacyclol is formed when an oh hydroxyl group is added to a peptidyl carbonyl group likewise a is formed by adding an sh thiol moiety to a peptidyl carbonyl group wieland t and m world of peptides

molecules should not exist because of their unfavorably high energy after a long hiatus during which she worked mainly on mathematics of x ray crystallography wrinch responded to these discoveries with renewed enthusiasm for cyclol model and its relevance in biochemistry she also published two books describing cyclol theory and small peptides in general illustration of scientific method cyclol model of protein structure is an example of empirical falsifiability acting as part of scientific method an original hypothesis is made that accounts for unexplained experimental observations consequences of this hypothesis are worked out leading to predictions that are tested by experiment in this case key hypothesis was that cyclol form of peptide group could be favored over amide form this hypothesis led to predictions of cyclol 6 molecule and cyclol fabric which in turn suggested model of semi regular polyhedra for globular proteins a key testable prediction was that a folded protein s carbonyl groups should be largely converted to hydroxyl groups however spectroscopic and chemical experiments showed that this prediction was incorrect cyclol model also predicts a high lateral density of amino acids in folded proteins and in films that does not agree with experiment hence cyclol model could be rejected and search begun for new hypotheses of protein structure such as models of alpha helix proposed in 1940s and 1950s it is sometimes argued that cyclol hypothesis should never have been advanced because of its a priori flaws e g its steric clashes its inability to accommodate proline and high free energy cyclol reaction itself although such flaws rendered cyclol hypothesis implausible they did not make it impossible cyclol model was first well defined structure proposed for globular proteins and too little was then known of intramolecular forces and protein structure to reject it immediately it neatly explained several general properties of proteins and accounted for then anomalous experimental observations although generally incorrect some elements of cyclol theory were eventually verified such as cyclol reactions and role of hydrophobic interactions in protein folding a useful comparison is bohr model of hydrogen atom which was considered implausible from its inception even by its creator yet led way to ultimately correct theory of quantum mechanics similarly linus pauling proposed a well defined model of dna that was likewise implausible yet thought provoking to other investigators conversely cyclol model is an example of an incorrect scientific theory of great symmetry and beauty two qualities that can be regarded as signs of obviously true scientific theories for example watson crick double helix model of dna is sometimes said to be obvious because of its plausible hydrogen bonding and symmetry nevertheless other less symmetrical structures of dna are favored under different conditions similarly beautiful theory of general relativity was considered by albert einstein as not needing experimental verification yet even this theory will require revision for consistency with quantum field theory references
