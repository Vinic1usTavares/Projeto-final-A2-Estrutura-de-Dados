illinois class was a group of three pre dreadnought battleships of united states navy commissioned at beginning of 20th century three ships and were built between 1896 and 1901 they were transitional ships they incorporated advances over preceding designs including first modern gun turrets for main battery and new rapid firing secondary guns but they were also last american battleships to feature dated technologies like fire tube boilers and harvey armor they were armed with a main battery of four guns in two twin turrets supported by a secondary battery of fourteen guns ships had a designed speed of though they exceeded that speed by a significant margin three ships served in a variety of roles and locations throughout their career illinois served with north atlantic squadron and european squadron early in her career while wisconsin served as flagship of pacific fleet and then in asiatic fleet illinois and alabama started cruise of great white fleet in december 1907 from east coast of united states though by time they had rounded south america and stopped in california alabama was forced to leave fleet due to machinery problems wisconsin joined fleet there and continued on with it to conclusion of its tour in february 1909 all three ships were modernized in 1909 and served in atlantic fleet for a short time by 1912 all three ships had been reduced to reserve fleet and were primarily employed as training ships they continued in this role during world war i training men to operate machinery of warships and transports for war effort they were all decommissioned by 1920 illinois was loaned to new york naval militia and was converted into a floating arsenal renamed prairie state in 1941 she was eventually sold for scrapping in 1956 wisconsin was broken up for scrap in 1922 while alabama was expended as a target ship in september 1921 in bombing tests with us army air service design design work on what became illinois class began on 25 march 1896 when rear admiral j g walker convened a board to consider future battleship designs at this time only modern battleship in service was low freeboard high freeboard battleship and low freeboard were under construction as navy had little experience with modern battleships question settled on whether to repeat one of low freeboard designs which were suitable for coast defense to build another iowa or to request a new design altogether walker board determined that another coastal battleship design would be imprudent since united states had long coastlines and therefore new ships would need to have better seakeeping qualities than indiana or kearsarge designs war games conducted by fleet led board to specify a draft of no more than to allow ships to enter comparatively shallow ports of gulf coast this limitation had a significant effect on design to meet it weight would have to be kept to a minimum which prevented copying iowa design outright unless main armament was reduced from to guns board was unwilling to make that concession and so a new design would be required in addition board had determined that secondary gun was unnecessary since though it could penetrate thinner casemate armor on enemy battleships it could not deliver a high explosive shell through armor instead board decided that a new rapid firing gun would be superior it would also simplify ammunition supply since there would be only one secondary caliber board determined that armor layout of kearsarge design was sufficient and adopted it without change for new ships they did discard superposed turrets of though by mounting most of secondary guns in a battery amidships a new turret design for main battery was adopted instead of old round style turrets of earlier ships illinois design featured a balanced turret with sloped armor on face since it was balanced it would prevent ship from listing when battery was trained to either broadside as was case with indianas us congress authorized three new battleships on 10 june 1896 bureau of construction and repair issued its requests for tenders from various american shipbuilding companies twelve days later contracts for new ships to be named illinois alabama and wisconsin were awarded on 28 august general characteristics and machinery ships of illinois class were long at waterline and long overall they had a beam of and a draft of they displaced as designed and up to at full load as built they were fitted with heavy military masts but these were replaced by cage masts in 1909 they had a crew of 40 officers and 496 enlisted men crew increased to 690 713 later in her career steering was controlled with a single rudder and ships had a turning radius of at a speed of ships transverse metacentric height was ships were powered by two shaft triple expansion steam engines rated at steam was provided by eight coal fired fire tube boilers that were trunked into a pair of funnels that were arranged side by side they were last ships of us navy to use fire tube boilers subsequent designs changed to more efficient and lighter water tube boilers engines generating a top speed of though they exceeded their rated performance on trials with illinois reaching on ships could store up to of coal which allowed them to steam for at a cruising speed of armament ships were armed with a main battery of four 35 caliber guns guns in two twin gun turrets on centerline one forward and aft these guns fired a shell with a brown powder charge though this was replaced with a smokeless powder charge which produced a muzzle velocity of gun had a range of though navy regulations prescribed opening fire at even this was beyond range at which gunners at time could reliably hit at a range of shells could penetrate of steel gun was slow firing requiring 320 seconds between shots guns were mounted in mark iv turrets which had a range of elevation of 15 degrees to 5 degrees turrets required guns to return to 2 degrees for loading ammunition storage was 60 shells per gun secondary battery consisted of fourteen 40 caliber mark iv guns which were placed in casemates in hull they fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of for close range defense against torpedo boats they carried sixteen 6 pounder guns mounted in casemates along side of hull and six 1 pounder guns these guns fired and shells respectively as was standard for capital ships of period illinois class carried four torpedo tubes in above water hull mounted torpedo launchers they were initially equipped with mark ii whitehead design which carried a warhead and had a range of at a speed of armor all three ships were protected with harvey armor they were last ships of us navy to rely entirely on harvey steel ships main armored belt was thick over magazines and machinery spaces and reduced to on lower edge it gradually reduced to toward bow transverse bulkheads that were thick connected both ends of central belt and main battery barbettes ships armored deck was thick on flat portion with thick sloped sides forward sloped sides aft were thick conning tower had 10 in thick sides with a thick roof main battery gun turrets had thick faces and thick roofs and supporting barbettes had of armor plating on their exposed sides portion of barbettes that were behind belt armor were reduced to armor that was thick protected secondary battery and lower half of casemate armor was backed by coal bunkers which increased level of protection anti splinter bulkheads that were thick were placed between each of secondary guns to reduce possibility of one shell from disabling

illinois served with north atlantic squadron both ships made visits to europe during their early careers and illinois served as flagship of european squadron for a short time in 1902 she accidentally ran aground outside oslo norway in 1902 and returned to north atlantic squadron in january 1903 wisconsin having been built on west coast of united states instead served in pacific fleet as its flagship in 1903 she was transferred to asiatic fleet and remained there until late 1906 when she returned to california illinois and alabama steamed with great white fleet on its world cruise that started in december 1907 wisconsin joined fleet after it had rounded south america in july 1908 alabama had to leave fleet owing to engine damage that required repairs alabama was detached along with battleship two ships continued journey independently and on a greatly shortened itinerary rest of ships then crossed pacific and stopped in australia philippines and japan before continuing on through indian ocean they transited suez canal and toured mediterranean before crossing atlantic arriving bank in hampton roads on 22 february 1909 for a naval review with president theodore roosevelt three ships were modernized after their return in 1909 from 1912 they were placed in reserve commission and employed as training ships for midshipmen from us naval academy and naval militia units they continued in this role through world war i which united states entered on 6 april 1917 ships trained engine room personnel armed guards for merchant ships and other specialties following german surrender in november 1918 most of battleships of atlantic fleet were used as transports to ferry american soldiers back from france illinois class ships were not so employed however owing to their short range and small size which would not permit sufficient additional accommodations illinois class ships served with fleet only briefly after war still as training ships by 1920 they had all been decommissioned wisconsin was sold for scrapping in january 1922 and broken up for scrap illinois was instead converted into a floating armory for new york naval militia renamed prairie state in 1941 she served in this role until 1956 when she too was sold for scrap alabama met a more spectacular end as a target ship for bombing experiments conducted with us army air service in september 1921 she was hit with several bombs including white phosphorus weapons and armor piercing bombs before eventually foundering footnotes notes citations references category battleship classes illinois class
