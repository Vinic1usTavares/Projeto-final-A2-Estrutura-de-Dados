gmb class 71 is an electric multiple unit used by flytoget for airport express trains on gardermoen line of norway sixteen three car train sets were built by adtranz between 1997 and 1998 units are capable of connecting oslo central station and other stations in metropolitan oslo to oslo airport gardermoen along norway s only high speed railway in a three car configuration units weigh and are long with a power output of units are similar to nsb class 73 and are related to swedish x2 units by 2009 all units were expanded with a fourth car specifications unit is based on swedish x2 designed by kalmar verkstad in 1980s and delivered from 1990 to swedish state railways for use in their x 2000 high speed intercity trains although technology involved is similar like spot welded stainless steel car bodies class 71 differs in several ways first unit does not have a separate locomotive unit but has motors spread throughout train with one powered and one unpowered bogie in each car car bodies are totally different in layout including doors between bogies instead of at end of cars in addition trains are pressure tight to increase comfort for passengers while passing through tunnels they also have hydraulic couplers at ends which are hidden behind covers when not used class 71 is also shorter with only three cars and does not have any tilting technology installed exterior design especially nose is quite different norges statsbaner later took order of 22 units of class 73 that is almost identical but has four cars and tilting technology class 73 s pantograph is pivoted in order to keep it centred under catenary when body tilts thumb left detail of doors showing inside steps each train has a power output this is an unusually high power to weight ratio for trains with that maximum speed units use standard norwegian voltage of up to four units can be run in multiple creating 12 car or 16 car after upgrade trains however trains normally only operate as single or double units limiting length to eight cars end cars are and weigh while center cars are and weigh pantograph is located on center car each unit has 168 seats that are built so that seating can be reconfigured sixteen units cost during construction weight had increased from 149 to 170 tonnes to reduce this to 158 tonnes original idea of step free access was discontinued instead a wheelchair lift was installed but it proved not to work area around doors are step free from platform but within trains steps must be taken to reach seating area norwegian federation of organisations of disabled people have criticized flytoget for ordering identical additional cars that will not ease access for disabled thumb left interior of a class 71 train class 71 is capable of speeds up to compared to in original this speed was chosen to make it possible to get from oslo central station to oslo airport gardermoen in less than 20 minutes signalling system atc 2 is built for 200 km h and could not be adopted for much more than that three car units resp four car units can only be separated at a railway workshop and are never used in anything but their native car configuration history when parliament of norway decided to build oslo airport gardermoen on 8 october 1992 they also decided to build a high speed airport rail link from oslo central station to airport this railway gardermoen line was to be built and operated by a subsidiary of norwegian state railways nsb to operate railway they needed sixteen electric multiple units thumb unit operating on gardermoen line in addition to tests in sweden x2 was tried out on randsfjord line on 12 march 1993 order for units was placed on 23 february 1995 after nsb had received bids from abb that later merged with daimler benz s train division to become adtranz aeg fiat ferroviaria talbot linke hofmann busch siemens and gorlitz during 1996 an x2 train was hired to test out performance on norwegian railway system and for a short period put into service on sorland line first class 71 unit was delivered on 19 september 1997 and last on 30 january 1998 last unit no 71 16 was delivered with tilting mechanism to be used to test performance on norwegian railways due to similarities between class 71 and class 73 it could be seen during winter on challenging bergen line and dovre line after a few years tilting mechanism was removed in 2007 flytoget announced that they had ordered a fourth car for each of units this increased capacity of each unit by 40 to 244 seats and allows company to manage annual 10 growth in passengers delivery of fourth cars started in 2008 and were built by bombardier transportation who has bought adtranz with rebuilding scheduled to be completed during 2009 rebuilding created several challenges for bombardier since most of components used in class were no longer available significant components such as car body and rectifiers had to be built by bombardier based on abandoned production lines and many of original manufacturers for interior have become defunct from 2010 norwegian rail school operates a simulator center for training motormen it consists of six mock ups of class 71 driver s cab and is used both by school and to train existing airport express train drivers in exceptional circumstances simulators were built by and cost nok 35 million incidents thumb train awaiting departure from oslo airport station sister trains in service with nsb were prone to technical failures since they have to operate on hundred year old infrastructure on cross mountain services class 71 has more lenient operating conditions thanks to better infrastructure and therefore has not been prone to as much malfunction only incident to ground all class 71 trains occurred on 17 june 2000 after a class 73 train operated by nsb derailed at station owing to stress on axles oslo airport express trains were back in service next day while 73 series had to wait another month before returning to service on 24 january 2004 a class 71 unit had to be taken out of service due to smoke from a stressed bearing causing replacement of bearings on all units within days several deaths have taken place on route but only one due to an accident in 1999 an employee of norwegian national rail administration was killed after impact with a train authorities stated that cause was due to train operating at instead of temporarily reduced limit of company was fined for not informing driver of speed limit reduction several other deaths on line have been classified as suicides and so are not part of accident statistics they do however cause delays on all services for hours after incidents take place in 2000 and 2001 flytoget experienced three derailments with empty trains at gardermoen one caused by engineer falling asleep and two by train passing a red signal no more such accidents occurred after automatic train control was installed in 2001 references category multiple units of
