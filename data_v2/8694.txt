rhinesuchidae is a family of tetrapods that lived primarily in permian period they belonged to broad group temnospondyli a successful and diverse collection of semiaquatic tetrapods which modern amphibians are probably descended from rhinesuchids can be differentiated from other temnospondyls by details of their skulls most notably interior structure of their otic notches at back of skull they were among earliest diverging members of stereospondyli a subgroup of temnospondyls with flat heads and aquatic habits although more advanced stereospondyls evolved to reach worldwide distribution in triassic period rhinesuchids primarily lived in high latitude environments of gondwana what is now south america and africa during guadalupian and lopingian epochs of permian taxonomy of this family has been convoluted with more than twenty species having been named in past a 2017 review recognized only eight of them distributed among seven genera to be valid while several purported members of this group have been reported to have lived in triassic period most are either dubious or do not belong to group however at least one valid genus of rhinesuchid is known from early triassic a small member known as broomistega most recent formal definition of rhinesuchidae advocated by mariscano et al 2017 is that of a stem based clade containing all taxa more closely related to rhinesuchus than to lydekkerina huxleyi or a similar alternate definition is that rhinesuchidae is a stem based clade containing all taxa more closely related to uranocentrodon than to lydekkerina huxleyi or mastodonsaurus giganteus description rhinesuchids generally had a conventional body type for tetrapods with four limbs and a moderately long tail in addition their bodies were also somewhat elongated and their limbs were small and weak but still rather well developed some were very large up to 3 meters 10 feet in length like most stereospondyls their skulls were flattened and triangular with upward pointing eyes most rhinesuchids had relatively short snouts although snout of australerpeton was very long and thin only other giant long snouted permian amphibians were members of family such as and otic notch left thumb skull of uranocentrodon with otic region expanded to show rhinesuchid otic features like most ancient amphibians rhinesuchids had a pair of indentations at rear edge of skull known as otic notches while sometimes considered to have housed hearing organs such as a tympanum eardrum these notches are more likely to have held spiracles fleshy holes used for breathing rhinesuchids can be characterized by a unique system of ridges and grooves within inner cavity of each otic notch walls of otic notch cavity sometimes referred to as a tympanic cavity are mainly made up of ascending branch of pterygoid bones nevertheless inside edge of each cavity is formed by a tabular bone tabular bones are a pair of triangular bones along rear edge of skull which form pointed structures known as tabular horns upper part of outer wall of cavity is also formed partly from squamosal bones which mostly occupy flat upper face of skull portion of squamosal which forms cavity wall is separated by portion outside of cavity by a pronounced boundary known as a falciform crest outer wall of cavity has a long and pronounced groove known as a stapedial groove which extends lengthwise along wall lower edge of groove is formed by a ridge crest known as an oblique ridge although it has also been called a crista obliqua otic flange or simply an oblique crest upper edge of stapedial groove is formed by another ridge crest bordering squamosal bone which eltink et al 2016 named dorsal pterygoid crest however mariscano et al 2017 preferred to use name lamella for this structure so that it would not be confused with a different ridge present in lydekkerinids which is sometimes termed an oblique crest of pterygoid but more commonly called a tympanic crest confusingly enough many rhinesuchids are also known to possess a tympanic crest this ridge was positioned further back than other ridges near intersection of pterygoid quadrate and squamosal bones and extends down along rear face of cheek inner edge of outer wall of cavity was formed by a ledge which most studies simply label membrane this convention exists as a result of old and likely incorrect hypothesis that otic notches housed eardrums under this hypothesis inner ledge may have attached to a membrane stretching along inner cavity of ear this combination of otic cavity grooves and ridges is unique to rhinesuchids lamella and stapedial groove are unknown in any other groups although they are present in practically every rhinesuchid except broomistega which lacks a lamella tympanic crest is present in most rhinesuchids but absent in a few and it is additionally present in lydekkerinids oblique ridge crest and falciform crest are present in most other although former is less well developed while membrane ledge is present in practically every palate and braincase various bones and openings comprised palate roof of mouth in rhinesuchids as in other amphibians at tip of palate lied vomers while areas near edge of mouth were made of palatine and ectopterygoid bones in middle of rear part of mouth was a rectangular bone known as a parasphenoid most of parasphenoid formed lower face of flattened braincase although it also possesses a thin forward projecting rod known as a process which extends down midline of skull to meet vomers towards back of mouth there were multi pronged pterygoid bones on each side of skull each pterygoid had several branches including posterior branch which stretches back and to side of skull short medial branch which extends inwards and connects to parasphenoid bone an ascending branch which projects upwards to form otic notch and finally anterior branch which extends forward along palatine and ectopterygoid pterygoids of most rhinesuchids have very long anterior branches in most members of this family anterior branch reaches as far forward as vomers although australerpeton has relatively short anterior branches a pair of large openings known as interpterygoid vacuities fill areas between these bones making majority of palate open space when seen from behind upper branches of braincase paroccipital processes extends from side to side partially concealing ascending branch of pterygoids each paroccipital process is also perforated by a small hole known as post temporal fenestrae these holes are very thin in rhinesuchids above these paroccipital processes lie otic notches as well as tabular bones paroccipital processes also point backwards to some extent forming horns which in some rhinesuchids are slightly longer than those of when seen from below most prominent portion of braincase is parasphenoid bone rear corners of parasphenoid have small pockets bordered by ridges known as crista these ridges may have anchored muscles capable of maneuvering head on neck other skull and jaw features many bones made up upper side of skull although a particular pair of bones acquired a specific design in rhinesuchids these bones were elongated jugal and prefrontal bones which formed front edge of orbits eye holes in most rhinesuchids edge between two bones possessed a stepped shape with a triangular outer extension of prefrontal pushing suture with jugal towards a more lateral outwards position however suture is more straight in australerpeton like in other stereospondyls lower jaw has a pair of holes only visible from inside edge of jaw larger hole at rear part of bone complex known as a posterior meckelian foramen was thin and elongated in rhinesuchids an additional hole on underside of jaw joint is only visible from below this hole chorda tympanic foramen was large in this family on upper side of jaw joint a thin groove known as an arcadian groove stretches towards lingual tongue side of jaw and separates other bony bumps located among jaw joint as a whole grooves and ridges of jaw joint were poorly developed in rhinesuchids compared to that of many other stereospondyl groups instead resembling simple joint of such as paleobiology most rhinesuchids are only known from skull material although a few members of group uranocentrodon broomistega and australerpeton for example include specimens preserving a significant portion of rest of skeleton a juvenile specimen of broomistega had ankles and vertebrae which were poorly ossified indicating that its joints had a large amount of cartilaginous material to supplement low amount of bone this trait is often correlated with an aquatic lifestyle features of skull such as upwards pointing eyes also support this hypothesis thumb left 260x260px broomistega green preserved in a fossilized burrow with thrinaxodon brown despite this support for an aquatic lifestyle other pieces of evidence show that rhinesuchids were capable of some terrestrial movement although rhinesuchids did not possess any adaptations for digging poorly ossified juvenile specimen of broomistega was found in a flooded burrow which was also inhabited by a thrinaxodon various conditions of way these animals were preserved indicate that they co inhabited burrow peacefully likely to survive a drought by aestivating staying in a dormant state during hot and dry conditions fact that a broomistega was able to enter burrow of a terrestrial animal such as thrinaxodon indicates that rhinesuchids were not exclusively aquatic in addition it has been noted that larger temnospondyls generally have more well ossified joints for example large specimens of australerpeton possessed robust hips several completely bony ankle bones and ossified part of vertebrae nevertheless these skeletons were not as strongly built as those of eryops a supposedly terrestrial temnospondyl with smaller shoulder girdles and less prominent sites for muscle attachment dias schultz 2003 suggested that lifestyle of australerpeton and presumably other rhinesuchids was that of a semiaquatic fish eater preferring to hunt in shallow bodies of freshwater yet retaining ability to walk on land during droughts a histological study of several indeterminate rhinesuchid fossils referred to rhinesuchus indicate that members of family grew seasonally as in modern amphibians individuals also had fairly long life span with one specimen being 30 to 35 years old at time of its death based on number of lines of arrested growth rings in bone used to tell age like tree rings present in a hip fragment some lines of arrested growth were very narrow indicating that individuals could reduce their growth and metabolism during times of hardship this ability may be reason why rhinesuchids were rather successful at end of permian as well as how a few small members of group survived permian triassic extinction event gills three rows of tiny bones branchial ossicles covered with thin tooth like structures branchial denticles have been preserved near neck of one specimen of uranocentrodon these bones almost certainly attached to branchial arches of gills while animal was alive although such bones are rare among stereospondyls and unknown in any other rhinesuchids this may simply be due to fact that bones of other genera were preserved in more rough grained sediments where such delicate bones could be broken or difficult to find although evidently uranocentrodon had gills of some kind it is difficult to determine what kind of gills they were on one hand they could have been internal gills like those of fish which were hardly visible from outside of body on other hand they could have been stalk like external gills like those of modern salamander larvae or even neotenic adult salamanders such as or axolotl external gills had to have evolved from internal gills sometime during amphibian evolution although precise location of this transition is controversial gill supporting bones preserved in ancient amphibians show many similarities with those of fish gills and salamander gills paleontologists who prefer comparing ancient tetrapods to modern amphibians generally find many similarities between fossil bones and modern salamander gill bones on other hand paleontologists who compare fossil tetrapods to fossil fish consider bones to correlate with internal gills this conundrum known as bystrow s paradox has made it difficult to assess gills in ancient amphibians such as uranocentrodon as different paleontologists come to different conclusions based on their field of study thumb 277x277px uranocentrodon a very large member of family which possessed gills and body armor bystrow s paradox was finally resolved by a 2010 study which found that grooved structures components of branchial arches are correlated with internal gills ancient tetrapods which preserved grooved such as dvinosaur probably only had internal gills as adults nevertheless external gills have been directly preserved as soft tissue in some temnospondyls however these situations only occur in larval specimens or members of specialized groups such as one living species of lungfish lepidosiren has external gills as larvae which transform into internal gills as adults despite adult dvinosaur specimens having skeletal features correlated with internal gills some larval specimens of another dvinosaur preserved soft tissue external gills thus gill development of and presumably other temnospondyls such as uranocentrodon mirrored that of lepidosiren despite this feature likely being an example of convergent evolution as other lungfish exclusively possessed internal gills it still remains a useful gauge for how temnospondyl gills developed study s writers concluded that gills of temnospondyls including uranocentrodon and other rhinesuchids which may have possessed gills were probably internal like those of a fish as an adult but external like those of a salamander as a larva body armor one uranocentrodon skeleton also preserved large patches of bony scutes or scales around body scutes which would have been on belly of animal were arranged in parallel diagonal rows which converged at midline of body and diverged as rows stretched towards tail each scute had a ridge running down middle and scutes further towards midline overlapped ones further out along midline a row of flat and wide scales stretched from throat to tail while these belly scales were made of bone scales on other parts of body had less bone structure and were probably made of keratin instead scales on sides of body were flatter and smaller than bony belly scutes scutes on back of body were similar although more rounded in shape with a few larger scutes near midline scales of hind limbs and underside of hip region were similar to those of back although no integument was preserved on forelimbs or tail thus it is likely that at least tail was unarmored and only covered with naked skin scales have also been preserved in australerpeton specimens they are similar in distribution to those of uranocentrodon but are generally rounder in shape they also possessed a honeycomb like internal structure and histological features which indicate that they were deeply embedded in skin therefore it is unlikely that they would have been visible from outside of body it cannot be determined whether scales or scutes of rhinesuchids would have enabled or restricted cutaneous respiration breathing through skin as in modern amphibians other potential applications of scales included protection against predators retaining water during droughts and possibly even for storing calcium when conditions are harsh a technique used by female african crocodiles this last hypothesis is least likely as rhinesuchids did not lay hard shelled eggs which is reason female crocodiles need to store calcium classification when family was first named in 1919 rhinesuchidae was already recognized as a group of basal stereospondyls a position which it retains even in present day among traits used to support this position include fact that most rhinesuchids had long anterior branches of their pterygoids more advanced stereospondyls had shorter anterior branches in 1947 alfred romer placed family which he believed only included rhinesuchus in a broad superfamily which he called rhinesuchoidea rhinesuchoidea was intended to be part of an evolutionary grade of temnospondyls linking primitive such as eryops to advanced stereospondyls such as and this grade termed was separated into capitosauroidea which contained capitosaurs and and rhinesuchoidea apart from containing rhinesuchidae rhinesuchoidea also contained various genera as well as families and finally uranocentrodontidae romer felt that certain taxa i e uranocentrodon and possibly synonymous dubious genus often considered rhinesuchids were best placed in separate family uranocentrodontidae while others i e rhinesuchoides were not placed in any family in particular other families were later placed in this rhinesuchoidea such as rhinecepidae in 1966 and australerpetonidae in 1998 left thumb australerpeton a long snouted putative member of family arrival of cladistics in late 20th century has caused grades to fall out of favor in recent years replaced by clades which are defined by close relations rather than ancestral assemblages however basic idea behind rhinesuchoidea which states that advanced stereospondyls descended from animals similar to rhinesuchids is still considered valid rhinecepidae and uranocentrodontidae were found to be synonymous with rhinesuchidae according to a 2000 analysis by schoch and milner one study placed rhinesuchidae within superfamily capitosauroidea however this interpretation has not been followed by other studies which consider rhinesuchids to be more basal than capitosaurs australerpetonidae a monotypic family only containing genus australerpeton has been more difficult to compare to rhinesuchidae some studies place australerpeton as a basal stereospondyl outside of rhinesuchidae while others consider it an outside of stereospondyli entirely a comprehensive review of australerpeton published by eltink et al 2016 favored hypothesis that it was deeply nested within rhinesuchidae a phylogenetic study performed as part of study split family into two clades one clade was a subfamily termed rhinesuchinae rhinesuchinae contains rhinesuchus and rhineceps this subfamily is mainly characterized by features of palate such as an anterior branch of pterygoid lacking ridges and palatine bones covered in tiny denticles other main clade of family contained uranocentrodon as well as another subfamily termed australerpetinae this clade is united by presence of a tympanic crest and a foramen magnum hole for spinal cord at back of braincase which has a curved upper edge australerpetinae is a modified version of australerpetonidae which has been reduced to subfamily status in order to fit within rhinesuchidae this subfamily contains australerpeton broomistega laccosaurus and rhinesuchoides members of this subfamily had somewhat longer and more tapered snouts than other rhinesuchids although according to eltink et al their pterygoids had short anterior branches letting palatine bones contact interpterygoid vacuities most parsimonious evolutionarily simplest tree found by eltink et al 2016 is seen below structure of rhinesuchidae following eltink et al s study was challenged by a different study on rhinesuchids published less than a year later this study mariscano et al 2017 agreed that australerpeton was a rhinesuchid but considered it most basal member of family they disagree with eltink et al s recognition of short anterior pterygoid branches in multiple genera according to their analysis only australerpeton possessed this trait main feature which separates it from rest of rhinesuchidae other traits which support this separation include fact that other rhinesuchids have stepped jugal prefrontal contact and toothless coronoid bones in lower jaw rest of family was poorly resolved in their phylogenetic analysis although three clades did have moderate bremer support values of 2 bremer support is gauged by counting number of times analyzed traits are acquired lost or reacquired within a family tree some family trees include more of these transitions than others meaning that some possible trees assumed that more than bare minimum amount of evolution had taken place family tree with least amount of these steps transitions is likely to be most accurate based on principal of occam s razor simplest answer is most accurate bremer support is used to label how well supported clades are by analyzing how they are distributed among more complex alternatives to simplest most parsimonious tree clades which do not exist in a family tree which is only one total step more complex than mpt most parsimonious tree have a bremer support of 1 meaning that clade s existence is very uncertain even if mpt of present analysis supports their existence new data may make a competing family tree more parsimonious dissolving clades which are only supported in current mpt other clades may have much higher bremer support values indicating that more drastic assumptions have to be formulated to render clade invalid rhinesuchidae as a whole for example has a bremer support of 6 in mariscano et al 2017 which is considered high support a bremer support of 2 as is case with three specific clades in this analysis is considered moderate one of these clades included two valid species of rhinesuchoides while another clade connected rhineceps and uranocentrodon and last contained rhinesuchus and laccosaurus arrangement of these clades as well as placement of broomistega could not be resolved with absolute confidence with bremer support values of only 1 regardless of where three clades were placed among non australerpeton rhinesuchidae most parsimonious tree found by mariscano et al 2017 is seen below references
