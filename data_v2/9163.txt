thumb right sikorski atop rock of gibraltar surveying fortifications wladyslaw sikorski s death controversy revolves around death of commander in chief of polish army and prime minister of polish government in exile general wladyslaw sikorski in 1943 b 24 crash in gibraltar sikorski s liberator ii crashed off gibraltar almost immediately after take off with plane s pilot being only survivor catastrophe while officially classified as an accident has led to several conspiracy theories that persist to this day and often propose that crash was an assassination which has variously been blamed on soviets british and even nazis incident is still described by some historians as mysterious and was investigated by polish institute of national remembrance they concluded that injuries sustained were consistent with a plane crash and that there was not enough evidence to support or reject theory that plane was deliberately sabotaged death of sikorski thumb sikorski s liberator lying on its back in sea just off gibraltar following crash thumb sikorski s body being carried onto a ship at gibraltar naval base after his funeral in late may 1943 sikorski went to inspect polish forces stationed in middle east he was inspecting forces and raising morale of polish troops there he was also occupied with political matters around that time a conflict was growing between him and general wladyslaw anders main reason for this was that sikorski was still open to some normalization of polish soviet relations to which anders vehemently objected on 4 july 1943 while returning from middle east sikorski perished together with his daughter zofia his chief of staff tadeusz klimecki and seven others when his aircraft a consolidated liberator ii serial number crashed into sea 16 seconds after takeoff from gibraltar airport at 23 07 hours passengers and crew only survivor of accident was pilot flight lieutenant eduard prchal one of six crew on aircraft 11 passengers killed were colonel victor cazalet mc british liaison officer to polish forces jan an armia krajowa courier major general tadeusz klimecki polish army chief of general staff sikorski s adjutant zofia lesniowska

exile brigadier john percival whiteley obe conservative party member of parliament for buckingham brig j p whiteley m p obituary in times dated 7 july 1943 p 7 investigation and controversy thumb memorial plaque dedicated to sikorski located at end of great siege tunnels in gibraltar plaque notes that cause of this mysterious accident has never been ascertained a fact which has given rise to many speculations doubts and rumours a british court of inquiry convened on july 7 that year investigated crash of sikorski s liberator ii serial al 523 but was unable to determine cause finding only that it was an accident and due to jamming of elevator controls noting that it has not been possible to determine how jamming occurred but it has been established that there was no sabotage polish government refused to endorse report due to contradiction about cause not being determined but sabotage being ruled out and pursued its own investigation which suggested that cause of accident cannot be easily determined political context of event coupled with a variety of circumstances immediately gave rise to numerous speculation that sikorski s death had been no accident and may have been direct result of a german soviet british or even polish conspiracy some of earliest suggestions of a conspiracy were popularized by nazi propaganda which suggested that sikorski s death was result of a british soviet conspiracy some modern sources still note that accident is not fully explained for example jerzy jan in his historical dictionary of poland 1996 entry on gibraltar catastrophe of notes that there are several theories explaining event but mystery was never fully solved as roman noted in his biographical entry on sikorski in polish biographical dictionary in 1997 no conclusive evidence of any wrongdoing has been found and sikorski s death is officially classified as an accident unresolved questions surrounding his death have led to a number of publications in historical and mainstream press in poland and abroad commenting on them in 2009 polish historian andrzej garlicki building on a similar argument by historian marian kukiel stated that all conspiracy theories about sikorski s deaths are irresponsible fiction in 2008 polish institute of national remembrance ipn began an official inquiry into incident sikorski was exhumed and his remains were examined by polish scientists who in 2009 concluded that he died due to injuries consistent with an air crash and that there was no evidence that sikorski was murdered ruling out theories that he was shot or strangled before incident however they did not rule out possibility of sabotage one of ipn historians maciej has stated that many facts suggest an assassination although another andrzej chwalba notes that there is insufficient evidence to support this claim he also complains that some british and spanish documents still remain classified hindering investigation investigation concluded in 2013 it returned that deliberate tampering to aircraft could not be confirmed or ruled out british documents concerning accident will not be uncovered until 2050 until that date they will remain top secret alternative explanations and conspiracy theories since day of accident there was uncertainty about who boarded plane and about exact cargo manifest all leading to uncertainty as to identity of bodies recovered from crash site some bodies including that of sikorski s daughter zofia were never recovered since several bodies were never found and bodies of several members of sikorski s entourage were never positively identified some conspiracy theorists such as journalist and amateur historian dariusz baliszewski postulate that some might have been murdered on ground while others might have been abducted to soviet union baliszewski and tadeusz kisielewski are among those who point out opportunity soviets had at gibraltar at about same time that sikorski s plane was left unguarded at gibraltar airfield a soviet plane was parked nearby it carried soviet ambassador ivan maisky giving soviets an officially confirmed presence at site of accident head of british secret intelligence service s counterintelligence for iberian peninsula from 1941 to 1944 was kim philby soviet double agent who would defect in 1963 and later claim to have been a double agent since 1940s before 1941 philby had served as an instructor with special operations executive an organization specializing in sabotage and diversion behind enemy lines among rumoured kidnap victims a prominent role is given to sikorski s daughter zofia lesniowska who was reported in 1945 to have been spotted in a soviet gulag by a member of elite polish commandos attempted in 1945 or 1946 to gather armia krajowa personnel for a mission to rescue lesniowska another controversy surrounds sole survivor of flight a czech officer eduard prchal prchal like many pilots who did not wish to tempt fate was known for never wearing his mae west life jacket but on this occasion when rescued from sea he was wearing one during inquiry he denied this and later blamed inconsistency on post crash shock affecting his actions and memory essentially on amnesia later he explained that he must have instinctively put vest on when he realised plane was in trouble polish aviation expert jerzy created a simulation of crash in which he concluded that plane must have been under control up until very moment of crash kisielewski argues that plane was likely under control of second pilot who died in crash other conspiracy theories point to british german abwehr intelligence agency or poles themselves some of whom especially under command of general anders had shown animosity toward sikorski for at least from their point of view his policy of colluding with soviet premier joseph stalin which reached new heights by germans april 1943 discovery of mass graves filled with thousands of polish prisoners of war murdered by soviets at katyn forest in 1940 most notably though in 1967 holocaust denier david irving published a book dedicated to this incident and suggesting british complicity in incident in his book disasters in air former klm pilot and one time president jan bartelski of polish origin suggests that crash of liberator that carried gen sikorski was caused by a half empty mail bag jammed between horizontal stabilizer and elevator thus freezing controls and preventing f lt prchal from gaining altitude after takeoff mail bag was in cargo compartment and was blown out of aircraft through side hatch which in normally configured liberators would have served to protect machine gun position by a strong airflow rushing through nose gear door in popular culture crash of sikorski s liberator is portrayed in 1958 film silent enemy in which team of royal navy divers charged with retrieving sikorski s briefcase from wrecked aircraft is led by lionel buster crabb himself later to disappear in 1956 in mysterious circumstances while diving in vicinity of a visiting soviet warship in 1968 play soldaten nekrolog auf soldiers an obituary for geneva by german writer rolf hochhuth debuted in london play
