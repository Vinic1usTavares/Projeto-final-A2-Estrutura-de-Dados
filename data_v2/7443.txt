age of adz pronounced is sixth studio album by american singer songwriter sufjan stevens released on october 12 2010 by asthmatic kitty it was stevens first song based full length album in five years since release of illinois in 2005 album features a heavy use of electronics augmented by orchestration and takes inspiration from apocalyptic artwork of schizophrenic artist royal robertson stevens use of electronics marked a radical departure from much of his previous work most notably from seven swans and michigan unlike illinois lyrics do not explore events characters or setting but deal instead with themes and emotions on a personal level critics praised intimacy of album but many were divided over change in style that stevens had taken nonetheless it appeared on several best of 2010 lists including those of paste new york times and mtv commercially album gave stevens his career s best first week sales to date and was his highest charting album to date peaking at number seven on billboard 200 background and recording left alt stevens on stage wearing a colorful suit and a string of lights while playing guitar and singing into a microphone thumb stevens musical interests have shifted dramatically he is seen here in 2011 wearing a colorful light up outfit that fits obscure electronic themes of age of adz in 2006 sufjan stevens released an album of extra material left over from illinois originally conceived as a double album titled avalanche as well as an album of christmas music titled songs for christmas produced in parts between 2001 and 2006 following release of avalanche stevens expressed a dissatisfaction with his music stating in an interview with pitchfork in 2006 i m getting tired of my voice i m getting tired of banjo i m getting tired of trumpet in 2009 stevens admitted that his fifty states project an attempt to write an album for each of 50 u s states had been a promotional gimmick and not something that he had seriously intended to complete in same year he released bqe an orchestral suite accompanying a home made film dedicated to brooklyn queens expressway in an interview with magazine in 2010 stevens stated bqe kinda sabotaged mechanical way of approaching my music which was basically narrative long form it really opened things up for me it also confused things as well i don t think i ever really fully recovered from that process on august 20 2010 without prior announcement stevens released ep all delighted people and less than one week later announced age of adz to be released on october 12 in interviews stevens stated that during 2009 2010 he suffered from a mysterious debilitating viral infection that affected his nervous system he experienced chronic pain and was forced to stop working on music for several months he said age of adz is in some ways a result of that process of working through health issues and getting much more in touch with my physical self that s why i think record s really obsessed with sensation and has a hysterical melodrama to it my brightest diamond frontwoman shara nova who previously collaborated with stevens as a backing vocalist on albums avalanche and illinois has a solo performance on track impossible soul and provides backing vocals throughout album artwork artwork of royal robertson a self proclaimed prophet from louisiana was used for album s cover and interior will hermes of rolling stone said that sufjan stevens uses artwork as a springboard for music that evokes a visionary psyche stevens became interested in work of robertson after recording music for a friend s documentary on artist and said that more i studied him and his work more i felt a weird affinity to this guy and story of his life he began to transcribe some of text that appears in robertson s artwork and says this process stayed with him a long time and that some of it started to come up in lyrics in songs i was writing musical style and themes musical style age of adz marked a radical departure in musical style from that of stevens previous album illinois robin hilton summarised changes as stevens replacing delicately plucked banjo lines wispy vocals and sentimental melodies with glitchy soundscapes hip hop beats and heavily filtered vocals amongst his other work 2001 electronic album enjoy your rabbit was regarded as being most close in style to this album nevertheless critics highlighted first track futile devices as being stylistically consistent with his earlier acoustic work sufjan stevens himself has said that album s tracks are pop songs but they re based on sound experimentation and noise he contrasted way in which album was made for listeners who understood his interest in electronic music and noise and in sound sculpting and minimalism and with illinois which he described as a populist record professional music critics dubbed album experimental electronic pop electronica art rock electropop glitch and synthpop themes age of adz departs from geography based concepts of stevens previous albums until his announcement in 2009 that he had never seriously intended to complete project it had been expected that his next work might continue fifty states project that he had begun with michigan and continued with illinois album contains no conceptual underpinnings instead focusing on themes that are personal and intimate to stevens himself label asthmatic kitty describes themes as personal and primal love sex death disease illness anxiety and suicide a recurrent focus of album is love a theme that sometimes overlaps with spirituality as stevens seems to address both a lover and a divine power another important theme is that of mortality song now that i m older has been noted as repeatedly acknowledging mortality and importance of making most of life acknowledging interplay of these two themes album has been described as having songs in which love and death reign darkly over an imaginative landscape peopled with apparitions ghosts orators and space travellers release and reception age of adz debuted at number seven on billboard 200 with 36 000 copies sold giving stevens his career s best first week sales to

and loss life and death humanity and divinity entertainment ie s jenny mulligan described stevens as a strange one that s for sure but he may just be a genius uncut commented that album provides plenty of evidence to argue that he is either one of most important songwriters of his generation or just an infuriating neurotic show off alexis petridis of guardian said that although album goes a bit barmy and over top there are some incredible tune s that are not only genuinely remarkable but genuinely enjoyable alex denney of nme similarly commented that album conjures just enough moments of heart stopping gorgeousness to foot bill for its dizzying excesses sam lewis of bbc remarked on same point that album is suffused with individual moments of brilliance but overall it is let down by its self conscious incoherence most discussed track of album among reviewers was impossible soul which at 25 minutes in length comprises a third of overall album pitchforks reviewer ryan dombal described track as having more engaging ideas than most artists could muster in a career although no ripcord reviewer alan shulman criticized middle sections as being an epic train wreck saying that closing minutes come as a breath of fresh air one thirty bpm reviewer rob was mixed in his reception of track and commented that it would make or break album for listeners describing it as a successful proclamation of love but also bloated and way over top accolades many reviewing sites included age of adz in their best of 2010 lists best of year 2010 lists publisher accolade rank time
