1852 atlantic hurricane season was one of only three atlantic hurricane seasons in which every known tropical cyclone attained hurricane status five tropical cyclones were reported during season which lasted from late august through middle of october these dates fall within range of most atlantic tropical cyclone activity and none of cyclones coexisted with another though there were officially five tropical cyclones in season hurricane scholar michael chenoweth assessed two of cyclones as being same storm there may have been other unconfirmed tropical cyclones during season as meteorologist christopher landsea estimated that up to six storms were missed each year from official database this estimate was due to small tropical cyclone size sparse ship reports and relatively unpopulated coastlines toc season summary every tropical cyclone in season was of hurricane status or with winds at or exceeding 74 mph 119 km h in only two other seasons did every cyclone attain hurricane status those years were 1858 and 1884 all five cyclones affected land strongest was first storm which caused severe damage and loss of life when it made landfall near border between mississippi and alabama second storm of season struck puerto rico where it caused over 100 deaths primarily from flooding in middle of september third storm moved across florida with strong wind gusts and light rainfall and a week later fourth storm passed over or north of lesser and greater antilles last storm hit florida panhandle though damage was less than expected timeline systems hurricane one great mobile

heaviest between and mayaguez more than 100 people were killed in puerto rico many of which due to flooding hurricane three a hurricane was located in central gulf of mexico on september 9 potentially same hurricane as previous storm it tracked generally eastward toward coast of florida with its hurricane intensity estimation based on two ship reports at about 0000 utc on september 12 it moved ashore near clearwater florida as a minimal hurricane with an estimated minimum barometric central pressure of 985 mbar accelerating east northeastward while crossing state cyclone emerged into atlantic ocean as a weakened tropical storm before regaining hurricane status on september 13 later that day it was last observed about 250 mi 400 km east southeast of cape hatteras a post in fort meade florida reported at least 0 55 in 14 mm of rainfall during storm s passage hurricane was considered violent and gusts were estimated to have reached hurricane force rough seas and strong
