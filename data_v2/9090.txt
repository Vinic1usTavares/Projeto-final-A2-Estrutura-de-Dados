new york class was a pair of battleships built for united states navy between 1908 and 1914 two ships of class and saw extensive service beginning in occupation of veracruz world war i and world war ii designed as a more heavily armed improvement over previous new york class was first battleship to feature 45 caliber gun but was one of last battleship classes designed with a five turret layout and coal for fuel class also suffered several deficiencies such as a lack of anti aircraft weaponry and armor layout which were addressed with subsequent because of these deficiencies both ships saw several extensive overhauls over course of their careers which greatly changed their appearance both new york and texas entered service in 1914 and immediately served in occupation of veracruz and service reinforcing royal navy s grand fleet in north sea during world war i during which time new york is believed to have sunk a u boat in an accidental collision both ships undertook numerous training exercises and overhauls during interwar era and joined neutrality patrol at beginning of world war ii outmoded by more advanced battleships in service both ships served primarily as convoy escorts and naval artillery during war new york supported operation torch in north africa undertook convoy patrols and training in atlantic and supported battle of iwo jima and battle of okinawa texas supported operation torch operation overlord bombardment of cherbourg operation dragoon and battles at iwo jima and okinawa following war new york was used as a target ship in operation crossroads and sunk as a target in 1948 while texas was converted into a museum ship and remains permanently moored in san jacinto state park today background new york class was fifth of 11 separate classes planned by united states navy between 1906 and 1919 a total of 29 battleships and 6 battlecruisers virtually entire american battle line was being designed from pre dreadnought experience and observation of foreign designs design of new york class battleship originated in 1908 newport conference which resulted in a new method for battleship design with general board taking a more active role in design process of ships and navy s board on construction would implement design instead of creating it while new york class was mostly designed by board on construction lessons learned on class allowed general board to take lead on following s newport conference established a general consensus among leaders that us navy ships should carry larger batteries in response to increasing caliber of battleships in other countries notably bl 13 5 inch mk v naval gun which had been introduced by royal navy s as well as german navy s shift from to guns there was debate at time as to whether s laid down in 1909 should carry heavier armament than 45 caliber mark 5 gun ultimately on 30 march 1909 us congress approved construction of two design 601 battleships also known as battleship 1910 with six 12 inch turrets which general board had selected over two 14 inch designs in 1909 these would become at same time general board began planning for next class of ships and on 21 april 1909 decided on two battleships with similar sizes and after some debate about main guns approval of two battleships was granted on 24 june 1910 in 1911 us senate s naval affairs committee suggested reducing size of ships as part of a 24 000 000 budget reduction but secretary of navy george von lengerke meyer fought to keep original design and ships were not altered class is generally referred to as new york class but it is also occasionally called texas class because new york was completed several months after her sister texas design general characteristics as designed ships had a standard displacement of and a full load displacement of they were in length overall at waterline and had a beam of and a draft of ships underwent significant changes and increases in armor and armament over their operational lives following her fourth and final refit in 1943 new york increased her displacement to standard and full load final refit for texas came in 1945 after which she displaced standard and at full load as designed ships had a crew complement consisting of 1 042 officers and enlisted men by 1945 texas was carrying 1 723 officers and enlisted men with addition of crews for additional weapons as well as a new complement of marines armament thumb 250px turrets 1 and 2 aboard texas showing 14 inch guns new york class was first us navy ship type to carry this heavy gun thumb 150px 3 50 caliber antiaircraft gun on platform atop a boat crane on texas installed in 1916 and said to be first aa gun installation on a us battleship main battery of class consisted of ten 14 inch 45 caliber guns arrayed in five 2 gun turrets designated 1 2 3 4 and 5 and able to elevate to 15 degrees class was last to feature a turret mounted amidships in 1910 us navy s bureau of ordnance had successfully designed and tested its 14 inch naval gun gun proved to have remarkable accuracy and uniformity of pattern new york class was fifth class of us dreadnought battleship design created and work had already started on sixth design by 1910 no us dreadnought class battleship had yet hit water as all were either at some stage of building or in design virtually entire us navy battle line was being designed by drawing on experience from pre dreadnought designs or from observation of foreign battleship designs as built both ships also carried 21 51 caliber guns arrayed ten to a side with one in stern primarily for defense against destroyers and torpedo boats many of 5 inch guns were poor in accuracy in rough seas due to being mounted near ends of ship and below main deck ships were not designed with anti aircraft aa defense in mind and with development of naval aviation this was seen as a serious drawback to class new york class was first us battleship to mount anti aircraft guns with two 50 caliber guns mounted on platforms on top of boat cranes of texas in 1916 in 1918 secondary armament was reduced to 16 5 inch 51 caliber guns eight to a side as guns near ends of ship were difficult to work in any kind of sea when both ships were refitted 1925 26 aa defense was increased with eight 3 inch 50 caliber guns arrayed four to a side six of 16 remaining 5 inch guns were relocated higher in ship to new casemates on main deck new york class also initially featured four torpedo tubes 1 each on port side bow and stern and starboard bow and stern for bliss leavitt mark 3 torpedo instead of previous two because of advances in torpedo performance increasing prominence of weapon torpedo rooms held 12 torpedoes total plus 12 naval defense mines however torpedo tubes were removed in 1925 26 refit magazine and machinery spaces were enclosed in protected hull magazine volume was reduced for increased machinery with each magazine accommodating 75 to 80 shells and charges while more shells were carried in their turrets and handling rooms in 1937 eight 75 caliber aa guns in two quadruple mounts were added to improve light aa armament ships were more extensively refitted with large amounts of light aa guns at expense of 5 inch 51 caliber guns in 1942 as attack on pearl harbor had shown pre war light aa armament to be inadequate 1 1 inch quad mounts were removed and 24 bofors 40 mm guns were added in six quadruple mounts later increased to 40 guns while 42 oerlikon 20 mm guns in single mounts were also added 3 inch aa gun armament was increased to 10 guns while 5 inch gun armament was reduced to 6 guns armor ships continued armor suite of wyoming class with minor improvements deck armor scheme would continue to remain distinctly inferior to succeeding nevada class with their all or nothing armor scheme however leap forward in range provided by improved fire control was not yet envisioned and had it been there would not have been time to include it within current design ship provided a belt tapering to and casemate armor with internal partitioning new york class was first to incorporate an armored central plotting room below decks but atop protective deck and enclosed in a thin box of splinter armor armor on new york class consisted of belt armor from 10 to 12 inches thick their lower casemates had between and of armor and their upper casemate had of armor deck armor was thick and turret armor was 14 inches on face on top 2 inches on sides and on rear armor on her barbettes was between 10 and 12 inches conning towers were protected by 12 inches of armor with 4 inches of armor on tops in all armor totaled on upper casemate on lower casemate along belt on bulkheads on splinter deck on barbettes and on conning tower for a total protection of propulsion ships were powered by 14 babcock wilcox coal fired boilers driving two dual acting triple expansion reciprocating steam engines with producing a maximum speed of they had a range of at initially designs called for a 14 percent increase in power to over of preceding class however it was discovered that greater propulsive efficiency of reciprocating engine allowed a reduction in installed power needing only 28 100 shp to make 21 knots new york class was final class of us battleship to be powered by coal class was designed to carry of coal most of any battleship class in 1910 succeeding battleships of nevada class were designed with fuel oil in mind both ships were converted to carry fuel oil in 1926 and had a capacity of of oil six new bureau express oil fired boilers replaced 14 older design coal fired boilers at that time with no loss of power construction left thumb 250px new york under construction in 1912 funding for battleships was authorized by a 24 june 1910 act which called for ships to cost no more than 6 000 000 act also specified new labor policies for their construction which put strict limits on labor hours and working conditions for shipyard employees bids were solicited only for battleship no 35 texas on 27 september 1910 while battleship no 34 new york was to be built by new york navy yard bids opened for no 35 on 1 december ultimately newport news shipbuilding company won contract with a bid of 5 830 000 battleship no 35 began construction first on 17 april 1911 launched 18 may 1912 and completed on 12 march 1914 battleship no 34 was laid down on 11 september 1911 launched on 30 october 1912 and completed on 15 april 1914 by 1926 new york class was considered obsolete compared with other battleships in service so both ships received a complete refit while several other battleships in service including and were converted to training ships or scrapped new york and texas were chosen to be overhauled to increase their speed armor and armament in accordance with washington naval treaty of 1922 an additional were added for defense against aerial targets and submarines her 14 coal fired boilers were replaced by six bureau express oil fired boilers and twin funnels were trunked into one aft of forward superstructure tripods were fitted in place of lattice masts and atop forward tripod a control tower was installed a tower was built amidships that contained additional fire control to backup system on foremast a new aircraft catapult was installed atop turret number 3 and cranes were installed on either side of funnel for boat and aircraft handling additional deck protection was added and each ship s beam was widened ships were fitted with anti torpedo bulges though these made maneuvering harder at low speeds and both rolled badly and gunfire accuracy was reduced in rough seas service history uss new york thumb new york right during training in 1932 shortly after commissioning new york became flagship for united states occupation of veracruz in 1914 during world war i she became flagship of battleship division 9 commanded by rear admiral hugh rodman sent to reinforce british grand fleet in north sea she conducted blockade and escort duties she twice came into contact with german u boats and is believed to have accidentally sunk one she returned to united states at end of war and began taking on patrol and training duties new york was fitted with xaf radar in february 1938 including first united states so a single antenna could both send and receive she was a part of neutrality patrol following outbreak of world war ii in september 1939 and spent beginning of war escorting convoys between new york and iceland she saw action supporting operation torch allied invasion of north africa where she targeted shore batteries threatening landings in november 1942 she remained in convoy patrol and training for several years until she was moved to pacific fleet late in war and supported landings on iwo jima in february 1945 and later invasion of okinawa in april 1945 she was lightly damaged by a kamikaze attack in this battle following war she was used as a target ship during operation crossroads and subsequently studied for its effects before being sunk as a target in 1948 uss texas thumb right texas at her permanent berth in san jacinto state park where she remains as a museum ship texas also participated in occupation of veracruz for several months in 1914 before conducting training and upgrades to become first ship of us navy to mount anti aircraft weapons she conducted convoy patrols early in world war i and was first us ship to fire on a german one during a convoy mission in 1917 she joined other us battleships in reinforcing british fleet near end of war and was present for german surrender in inter war period she became one of first battleships to launch and operate aircraft and frequently alternated her time between atlantic and pacific waters on training exercises she was part of neutrality patrol at beginning of world war ii and supported allied landings at north africa and then conducted convoy patrol duty to north african and european ports throughout 1943 on 6 june 1944 she supported operation overlord covering allied landings on beaches of normandy france in particular battle at pointe du hoc later that month on 25 june she supported bombardment of cherbourg and there was damaged when she was hit with a german artillery shell in july she moved to support operation dragoon allied invasion of southern france following extensive repairs and training she moved to pacific and supported invasion of iwo jima in february 1945 she then moved to support landings on okinawa in april following end of war texas was decommissioned and in 1948 she was moved to san jacinto state park and converted into a museum ship where she remains today ships of class thumb right new york class battleship on reverse of a 1918 us
