with producer ken horton to create smallvilles score snow composed music as he watched picture and tweaked his performance when he reviewed his initial recordings he then sent music to producers who sent it back for recomposition if needed individual episodes have their own soundtrack comprising one or more songs jennifer pyken and madonna wade reed of daisy music looked for songs for soundtrack their choices were discussed by producers who decided which songs they wanted and secured their rights although snow said it initially seemed odd to combine two types of music on a typical action adventure television show producers seem to like contrast of modern songs and traditional orchestral approach to score simpson paul season 1 companion pp 154 155 main smallville theme was not composed by snow although he composed opening themes for other shows including x files series opening music is save me by remy zero snow composed closing credits music which was intended as smallvilles theme during first two seasons closing credits music was a potential theme for series before save me was selected it was more heroic and in your face snow was told during season two that closing credits needed new music since show had evolved and existing music was no longer suitable and he created a new toned down score with a more melodic sound snow has also reworked music from previous superman films john williams musical score for krypton sequence in opening credits of superman was used in season two s rosetta which featured a guest appearance by christopher reeve and several times in season two finale to save money snow recorded his version of williams score since using original version would have required team to pay williams orchestra simpson paul pp 102 115 in an interview with randall larson on may 23 2008 snow said that he would not be returning to smallville citing joint workload of smallville and ghost whisperer but would return for ghost whisperer reminiscing about his work on show snow said that much of music had not changed during series and agreed with larson that it was more about maintaining heroic concept and mythology than progressing through specific changes louis febre who worked closely with snow from beginning became sole composer for smallville in season seven febre said that since he began composing for smallville there was a shift to thematic development in score paralleling characters growth as clark grew emotionally and intellectually more complex i found a need to comment musically on his growth and as he drew closer to his superman persona it became obvious that a superman theme would be required creative team had a number of opportunities to try different music to enhance an episode s storyline pyken and wade reed chose and coordinated music on show when snow and febre s scores were not used in season three s slumber producer ken horton wondered if they could get a band to provide music for entire episode during a breakfast meeting with music department of warner bros r e m was suggested and pyken and wade reed immediately saw an opportunity to connect episode s featured band with its story which revolved around rem sleep that season al gough wanted to use johnny cash s cover of nine inch nails song hurt for final scene of shattered when lionel luthor looks at lex through a one way mirror at belle reve

with lex and lana to symbolize question are we ever going to figure out what these two people think of each other simpson paul season 3 companion pp 70 73 for memoria gough wanted to use evanescence s my immortal for episode s final scene telling wade reed that he saw song as being about mothers in that scene clark tells martha that his first childhood memory was of his mother lara simpson paul

concerns that smallville had become a villain of week series said that season two would introduce smaller mini arcs over three to four episodes and become less of a serialized show according to gough although each succeeding season relied more on season long story arcs an occasional villain of week story was necessary villain of week stories were more harshly criticized by fans of superman mythology but gough wanted to please them and wb s general audience teenagers who preferred villain of week stories over episodes focusing on superman mythology simpson paul season 3 companion pp 38 41 christopher reeve star of superman films expressed his approval of show i was a little bit skeptical when i heard about smallville at first but i must say writing acting and special effects are quite remarkable in 1977 a big stunt scene would have taken us a week to film it s pretty impressive what they are able to do with computers and effects technology today on a weekly tv show it gives it a lot more production value and inventiveness than i thought i was going to see when i first heard about series i think show is doing a really good job following mythology and tom is doing a good job following tradition simpson paul pp 78 81 according to mtv s karl heitmueller smallville s clark kent was a better representation of original material and remained true to heart of story by showing clark s selflessness and his struggle between his desires and his obligations however heitmueller wrote that series would have a difficult time addressing why no one in smallville including lex luthor recognized clark when he put on suit tv guide s michael schneider called it one of best examples of a superhero adaptation for television schneider michael tv s new heroes tv guide july 11 2011 pages 18 19 but christopher hooton of metro wrote that smallville was a story which did not need to be told no one bothered to follow bruce wayne s tedious years spent manufacturing microchips
