landed near charles town were quickly driven off by militia called out by governor nathaniel johnson when word of fleet s approach reached area and an improvised flotilla commanded by colonel william rhett successfully captured brillant which arrived after other five ships had already sailed away in defeat background news of start of war of spanish succession had come to southeastern north america in mid 1702 and officials of english province of carolina had acted immediately after failing in december 1702 to capture st augustine capital of spanish florida they launched a series of destructive raids against spanish indian settlements of northern florida french authorities in small settlement at mobile on gulf coast were alarmed by these developments since as allies of spanish their territory might also come under attack gallay p 151 idea of a combined franco spanish expedition first arose in 1704 when governor of florida jose de zuniga y la cerda discussed idea with a french naval captain as a means of revenge for carolina raids however no concrete action came of this discussion tepaske p 117 pierre lemoyne d iberville founder of mobile and an experienced privateer who had previously wrought havoc against english colonial settlements in nine years war in 1703 developed a grandiose plan for assaulting carolina using minimal french resources d iberville planned for a small french fleet to join with a large spanish fleet at havana which would then descend on carolina s capital then known as charles town expedition was to be paid for by holding other english colonial communities hostage after destroying charles town it was not until late 1705 that d iberville secured permission from king louis xiv for expedition crouse p 250 king provided ships and some troops but required d iberville to bear upfront cost of outfitting expedition crouse p 251 prelude thumb right upright pierre le moyne d iberville was organizer of expedition two small fleets one

troops were recruited at martinique crouse p 252 and d iberville successfully ransacked english held nevis d iberville then released part of his squadron and sailed for havana higginbotham p 238 there he attempted to interest spanish authorities in supporting expedition with limited success due in part to a raging epidemic of yellow fever in addition to decimating expedition s troops spanish governor pedro alvarez de died of disease on july 6 and d iberville himself succumbed on july 8 higginbotham p 284 before he died d iberville handed control of expedition to captain jacques lefebvre higginbotham p 285 lefebvre sailed from havana with five ships carrying about 300 french soldiers under command of general arbousset and 200 spanish volunteers led by general esteban de gallay p p p

sailed from st augustine on august 31 during passage a sloop was spotted and brillant gave chase she consequently became separated from rest of squadron sloop was a privateer sent out by carolina governor nathaniel johnson to intercept spanish supply ships its captain quickly returned to charles town with word of fleet s movement snowden p 145 countryside and town then also suffering ravages of a yellow fever epidemic rallied in response to governor johnson s calling out of militia exact number of militia mustered is not known of non slave population of 4 000 an estimated 900 men served in colonial militia anticipating that a landing would be attempted on james island which guarded southern approach to harbor johnson posted militia there under command of lieutenant colonel william rhett northern point of james island was fortified by fort johnson which housed a few cannon whose range was inadequate to prevent ships from entering harbor simms p 80 militia also improvised a small flotilla of ships which even included a fire ship attacks spanish fleet arrived off harbor bar on september 4 this date is recorded in contemporary english documents and histories such as francis le s diary as august 24 due to differences between julian calendar then in use in english colonies and modern gregorian calendar despite absence of brillant which carried much of french force including campaign guns shovels spades shells and land commander latter being general arbousset captain lefebvre and his fleet crossed bar on september 7 and delivered an ultimatum next day jones p 8 he demanded a ransom of 50 000 spanish pesos threatening to destroy charles town if it was not paid governor johnson contemptuously dismissed demand as paltry claiming town was worth 40 million pesos and that it had cost much blood so let them come thumb left 200px a 1733 map showing charles town and surrounding area fort johnson is visible at very bottom of map on september 9 invaders landed two separate forces one large force numbering about 160 plundered some plantations near charleston neck but was recalled when governor johnson sent militia out in boats to oppose them a second smaller force was landed on james island but was also driven away by threat of opposition jones p 9 late that night johnson received word that party on neck was still active and sent lieutenant colonel rhett with 100 men to investigate arriving around daybreak on 10th they apparently surprised invaders invaders fled after a brief skirmish but about 60 were captured and as many as 12 invaders were killed along with one of defenders jones p p 82 on september 11 lieutenant colonel rhett sailed colonial flotilla out to find invaders only to discover that they had sailed off snowden p 146 next day brillant showed up unaware of what had just transpired her captain had misjudged distance from st augustine and had made landfall further north before turning around general arbousset landed his troops east of charles town but brillant was captured by colonial fleet arbousset and his men surrendered after suffering 14 30 killed in a brief battle with english militia prisoners included 90 to 100 indians most of these were sold for slaves aftermath carolina officials declared october 17 a day of thanksgiving for their successful defense jones p 6 large number of prisoners however caused them some trouble they sent about one third of them off to virginia expecting that they would be transported to england however by time prisoners arrived in virginia annual merchant fleet had already sailed virginia authorities were unhappy that they now had to hold prisoners who would otherwise have been set free with ship they arrived on jones p 5 in response to franco spanish expedition carolinians led native american raiding expeditions that besieged pensacola one of few remaining spanish outposts in florida crane p 88 they also mobilized native american forces to attack mobile but these efforts were frustrated by french diplomatic activities in native american communities and also by false rumors of another franco spanish expedition crane pp 89 91 notes references category
