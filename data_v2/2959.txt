original production in hub network s broadcast history and leading to new merchandising opportunities for hasbro including books clothing collectible trading cards and comics despite target demographic of young girls friendship is magic has also gained a large following of older viewers mainly young and middle aged men who call themselves bronies portions of show have become part of remix culture and have formed basis for a variety of internet memes a feature length film adaptation directly based on tv series titled my little pony movie was theatrically released on october 6 2017 in united states a spin off franchise my little pony equestria girls was launched in 2013 first two films equestria girls and rainbow rocks were shown in limited theatrical screenings prior to television broadcast and home media release a spin off series titled my little pony pony life is scheduled to premiere sometime in 2020 on discovery family origin hasbro inc has produced several incarnations and lines of toys and entertainment related to my little pony franchise often labeled by collectors as generations animated series my little pony tales which premiered in 1992 was toy line s most recent television series before friendship is magic featuring pony designs of first toy line it was followed by various direct to video releases which featured later designs up to third incarnation of franchise just as michael bay s film had helped to boost new transformers toy line hasbro wanted to retool my little pony franchise and update it to better suit current demographic and taste of young girls according to margaret loesch ceo of hub network revisiting properties that had worked in past was an important programming decision influenced to an extent by opinions of network s programming executives a number of whom were once fans of such shows senior vice president linda steiner also stated that they intended to have show appeal to a larger demographic with concept of co viewing of parents with their children being a central theme of hub network s programming central themes that hasbro sought for show included friendships and working together factors they determined from market research in how girls played with their toys upright thumb left lauren faust developer and initial showrunner of my little pony friendship is magic animator and writer lauren faust approached hasbro seeking to develop her girls toys property galaxy girls into an animated series faust who had previously worked on cartoon network s powerpuff girls and foster s home for imaginary friends had been pitching original animation aimed at girls for years but had always been rejected by studios and networks because cartoons for girls were considered unsuccessful when she pitched to lisa licht of hasbro studios licht showed faust one of their recent my little pony animated works princess promenade completely on fly licht considered that faust s style was well suited to that line and asked her to consider some ideas where to take a new version of franchise faust was initially hired by hasbro to create a pitch bible for show allowing her to get additional help with conceptualization faust said she was extremely skeptical about taking job at first because she had always found shows based on girls toys to be boring and my little pony was one of her favorite childhood toys but she was disappointed that her imagination at time was nothing like animated shows in which characters according to faust just had endless tea parties giggled over nothing and defeated villains by either sharing with them or crying with chance to work on my little pony she hoped to prove that cartoons for girls don t have to be a puddle of cutesy goody two to do this she incorporated into design of characters and show many elements that contradicted idealized stereotypes of girls such as diverse personalities message that friends can be different and can get into arguments but still be friends and idea that girls should not be limited by what others say they can or cannot do elements of characters personalities and show s settings were based on her own childhood imagination of ponies adventures in part inspired by animated shows that her brothers would watch while growing up such as transformers and g i joe she considered that she was making friendship is magic for me as an eight year old faust still aimed for characters to be relatable characters using stereotypical icons of such as waif or bookworm in order to broaden appeal of characters for young female audience faust stated that as she provided hasbro with more of her ideas for show she was inspired by their positive response to non traditional elements faust had initially pitched show to include adventure stories in a similar proportion to relationship stories but recognizing younger target audience as well as difficulty of basing complex plots on adventure elements she trimmed back this content focusing more on exchanges between characters show still incorporates episodic creatures intended to be frightening to children such as dragons and hydras but it places more emphasis on friendships among characters displayed with a comedic tone by time show was approved faust had developed three full scripts for series faust began to work out concept sketches several of which appeared on her deviantart page including ponies from original series twilight applejack firefly surprise posey and sparkler which later provided core for main cast of show hasbro approved show with faust as executive producer and asked her to complete pitch bible in order to do so faust brought in martin and paul rudish who had worked on other animated shows with her faust credits rudish for inspiration of pegasus ponies controlling weather in equestria as well as character of nightmare moon during this period faust also consulted craig mccracken her husband and also an animator and creator of powerpuff girls and foster s home for imaginary friends after seeing initial version of pitch bible hasbro requested more character designs from faust s team subsequently faust brought aboard dave dunnet and lynne naylor to further refine background and character styles on completion of pitch bible hasbro and faust began looking at studios for animation studio b productions renamed to dhx media on september 8 2010 after its parent company along with dhx s other previously worked on macromedia flash based animations and on shows that featured a large number of animals and faust felt they would be a good selection studio b requested that jayson thiessen be director a choice faust agreed with she thiessen and james wootton led completion of a two minute short to pitch final product to hasbro resulting in company s sanctioning full production faust estimates that from being initially asked to develop show until this point took roughly one year production show is developed at hasbro studios in los angeles where most of writing staff is located and at dhx media vancouver in vancouver british columbia for animation work and most of voice acting thumb left a sample storyboard from episode call of cutie boarded by sabrina containing rough sketches of main characters rendered backgrounds to establish settings and instructions for flash animators such as panning shot shown in second panel faust s initial writing staff at hasbro studios included several writers who had worked with her on her previous shows and were approved by hasbro these included amy keating rogers cindy morrow meghan mccarthy chris savino charlotte fullerton m a larson and dave writing process began with faust and renzetti coming up with broad plots for each show two then held a brainstorming session with each episode s writer allowing writer to script out scenes and dialogue faust and renzetti then worked with writer to finalize scripts and assign some basic storyboard instructions hasbro was involved throughout this process and laid down some of concepts to be incorporated into show examples of hasbro s influence include having celestia be a princess rather than a queen making one of ponies focused on fashion and portraying toy sets in relevant places within story such as rarity s boutique in some cases hasbro requested that show include a setting but allowed faust and her team to create its visual style and hasbro then based toy set on it an example is ponyville schoolhouse faust also had to write to e i educational and informational standards that hasbro required of show making crafting of some of situations she would have normally done on other animated shows more difficult for example faust cited having one character call another an egghead as treading a very delicate line and having one character cheat in a competition as worrisome to some each episode also generally includes a moral or life lesson but these were chosen to cross a broad spectrum of personal experiences and not just to suit children because intellectual property issues had caused hasbro to lose some of rights on original pony names show includes a mix of original characters from toy line and new characters developed for show thumb left jayson thiessen supervising director left and shaun founder of fansite equestria daily at 2011 completed scripts were sent to studio b for pre production and animation using macromedia flash professional 8 thiessen s production team was also allowed to select key personnel subject to hasbro s approval one of those selected was art director ridd sorensen studio b team storyboarded provided scripts incorporating any direction and sometimes managing to create scenes that writers had believed impossible to show in animation animators then prepared key character poses layout background art and other main elements and send these versions back to production team in los angeles for review by hasbro and suggestions from writers thiessen credited much of technical expertise in show to wooton who created flash programs to optimize placement and posing of pony characters and other elements simplifying and economizing on amount of work needed from other animators for example ponies manes and tails are generally fixed shapes animated by bending and stretching them in curves in three dimensions and giving them a sense of movement without high cost of individual animated hairs storyboard artists and animators also need to fill in background characters for otherwise scripted scenes as to populate world according to writer meghan mccarthy many of small nods to fandom pop culture references or other easter eggs were added at this point by studio once pre production work was approved and completed episode was then animated though studio b performed initial animation work final steps were passed to top draw animation in philippines an animation studio that studio b had worked with in later part of season one and beyond voice casting and production is handled by voicebox productions with terry klassen as series voice director faust thiessen and others participated in selecting voice actors and hasbro gave final approval voice work is performed prior to animation with animators in room to help provide direction according to libman this allows herself and other actors to play character without certain limitations libman noted that for recording her lines as hyperactive pinkie pie i learned that i can go as over top as i want and they animators rarely pull me back thumb right upright daniel ingram at everfree northwest 2012 series background music is composed by william kevin anderson and daniel ingram composes songs which are only included if they make sense in episode s script production team identifies specific parts of episode where they want music cues allowing anderson to create appropriate music for each ingram works alongside anderson s compositions to create vocal songs that mesh with background music while filling out show s fantasy setting composition of music and songs far precedes broadcast of episode for example songs for show s third season that began airing in november 2012 were composed in 2011 ingram considered that songs from previous shows of my little pony were a little bit dated and decided to bring more interesting work to friendship is magic series such changes include making songs with more emotional depth than typical for children s animation and tending to write songs that can be enjoyed musically outside of context of episode ingram s songs have became bigger and more epic more broadway and more cinematic over time with hasbro blessing effort to try something groundbreaking for daytime television according to ingram lyrics and overall musical themes may be suggested by writers two examples include songs written by amy keating rogers who is a self professed stephen sondheim fan song art of dress in first season episode suited for success is inspired by putting it together from musical sunday in park with george while season one finale s song at gala is based on sondheim s into woods a large musical number in episode super speedy cider squeezy 6000 paid homage to song ya got trouble from meredith willson s musical music man before show was approved hasbro and faust had planned for episodes to be 11 minutes long to which faust conformed in her first full length script ticket master which was part of pitch bible however faust preferred more traditional 22 minute episodes and hasbro eventually agreed to this initial production stages were very tight requiring a schedule twice as fast as faust had previously experienced and frequent remote communication between los angeles writing offices and animation studio in vancouver at times two teams held writer s summits to propose new ideas for characters and situations at which animation team provided suggestions on visuals body language and characterization faust estimates that time to complete one episode was one year at one point team was simultaneously working on various stages of all 26 episodes of first season and when second season was approved that number rose temporarily to 32 episodes then aired about a month after completion thiessen explained that they had pushed to start work on second season as soon as first was completed to prevent staff turnover after airing of first season s finale faust announced that she had left show and would be credited in future as consulting producer her involvement in second season consists mainly of story conception and scripts and involvement ceased after second season despite leaving she still has high hopes for staff members stating that gaps i have left are being filled by same amazing artists writers and directors who brought you season 1 i m certain show will be as entertaining as ever in an interview with new york magazine faust stated her reasons for leaving were a combination of a hectic production schedules and a lack of creative control she had with series according to her husband mccracken faust s departure was due to fact that as a toy company driven show there were things she wanted to do with that series that she just wasn t able to do and that there is still some frustration with not being able to bring some of her ideas to screen music premise friendship is magic

its sheer and utter and lack of cynicism unlike many other shows that garnered a cult following of parents and adults she complimented characters stylized appearance stories relative complexity for children s television and solid jokes which make show enjoyable for parents as well as children she gave series a b show has been critically praised for its humor and moral outlook by brian truitt of usa today genevieve koski of a v club later commented that friendship is magic is an example of a show that while considered girly has been able to tap into nerd culture to allow it to gain wider acceptance than other comparable forms emily ashby of common sense media an organization focusing on parenting aspect of children s media gave show a rating of four out of five stars emphasizing its messages of friendship tolerance and respect but advised parents to be wary of influence characters might have on their kids desires since it s rooted in a well known product line of books toys and just about everything in between liz ohanesian for l a weekly said that show is absolutely genuine in its messages about friendship but never takes itself too seriously matt morgan writing for geekdad column praised show for having rebooted long time hasbro property while managing to lace it with geeky undertones and being one of few girl focused shows that a geeky dad can appreciate with his daughter los angeles times critic robert lloyd called show smarter and sassier and more aesthetically sophisticated than any of previous my little pony cartoons and praised its ability to appeal to both children and their parents in that it is smart and sprightly and well staged and never horribly cute tv guide listed friendship is magic as one of top sixty animated shows of all time in a september 2013 list other praise for show included its style stories characterisation and discussion of feminism kathleen richter of ms believed that friendship is magic did little to change nature of older animations for girls which she considered so sexist and racist and heteronormative for example she suggested that through character of rainbow dash show was promoting stereotype that all feminists are angry tomboyish lesbians she also considered that only darker colored ponies shown to date were in positions of servitude towards white pony overlord lauren faust responded to these claims by stating that while rainbow dash was a tomboy nowhere in show is her sexual orientation ever referenced and assuming tomboys are lesbians is extremely unfair to both straight and lesbian tomboys and further stating that color has never ever been depicted as a race indicator for ponies amid amidi writing for animation website cartoon brew was more critical of concept of show calling it a sign of end of creator driven era in tv animation amidi s essay expressed concern that assigning a talent like faust to a toy centric show was part of a trend towards a focus on profitable genres of animation such as toy tie ins to deal with a fragmented viewing audience and overall an admission of defeat for entire movement a white flag waving moment for tv animation industry ratings friendship is magic originally premiered with an average viewership of 1 4 million per month but expanded to 4 million per month by end of first season making it highest rated of any hasbro offering at time advertising age reports that viewership doubled between first and second season hub network reported that hearts and hooves day an episode on theme of valentine s day which aired on february 11 2012
