belfast to norman and aileen whiteside he grew up on shankill road and because of his aggressive physical playing style he was later nicknamed shankill skinhead by manchester united supporters family later moved to 10 danube street and family s poverty meant that whiteside had to share a bed with his two brothers he remained relatively unscathed by troubles as his protestant parents kept a firm watch on their children to ensure that they did not stray far from home and that none of them became involved with ulster loyalism at age of around seven he joined boys brigade and quickly showed his natural talent for football scoring ten goals in a game against boys almost twice his age he was educated at high school and became famous in shankill area as a footballing prodigy by age of 11 he was said to have been discovered by ipswich town scout jim rodgers his goals at schoolboy level meant that he was already well known to all football scouts in northern ireland who was told by manager bobby robson to wait until whiteside grew older instead it was manchester united s 80 year old ulster scout bob bishop who previously unearthed belfast born george best and sammy mcilroy for club who first offered him a trial at an english club whiteside s family were manchester united supporters though youngster himself held no particular allegiance he found that he had been offered schoolboy terms at club during a school trip to united states on trip he and his classmates met president jimmy carter at oval office a rare and extraordinary occasion for children from a disadvantaged background club career manchester united a few days before whiteside was old enough to sign schoolboy terms with manchester united he was offered a trial at liverpool causing united s chief scout joe brown to fly over to belfast to immediately offer him schoolboy contract to sign whiteside remained in belfast and flew over to manchester every weekend for training from age 14 he was constantly compared to now retired george best and did little to cease such comparisons when he told a journalist that only thing i have in common with george best is that we come from same place play for same club and were discovered by same man his injury problems started as early as 1980 when he was 15 years old and saw glentoran s physio bobby mcgregor to resolve a groin strain whiteside said that highly physical massage he was subjected to damaged his pelvis and robbed him of his natural pace his lack of pace was later seen as one weakness in his game six weeks into his apprenticeship in july 1981 and an innocuous looking challenge by a preston north end player in an a team game saw whiteside requiring an operation on his right knee had injury occurred a couple of years later he would have been able to have pioneering keyhole surgery which could potentially have saved his career after a seven month lay off and a further operation to remove cartilage he returned to fitness in january 1982 he had to adapt his playing style to compensate for his damaged knee and pelvis and developed well under youth team coach eric harrison whiteside became united s youngest first team player since

in fa youth cup final defeat to watford though it would be just another year before he appeared in final of senior competition he turned professional at old trafford on his 17th birthday signing a three year contract and he shared a room with steve coppell who was heading into retirement due to a knee injury of his own he also struck up a close friendship with paul mcgrath who would also face similar problems with his knee on final day of season eight days after his 17th birthday he became club s youngest goalscorer in a 2 0 home win over stoke city his performances at world cup convinced manager ron atkinson to start whiteside alongside frank stapleton at front of united s attack for 1982 83 season pair were similar players in that they held ball up and made frequent runs into box allowing midfielder bryan robson to join in attack whiteside scored four goals in first five games of campaign before entering a seventeen game drought he scored six goals in 16 games in domestic cup competitions that season helping manchester united to finals of both league cup and fa cup notably by scoring past arsenal in fa cup semi finals at age of 17 years and 323 days he beat liverpool centre half alan hansen to score in league cup final defeat at wembley making him youngest player to score in a league cup final his consistent performances against liverpool during 1980s earned him moniker of scourge of scousers from united supporters he gave an assist to stapleton in fa cup final which finished as a 2 2 draw with brighton hove albion at age of 18 years and 18 days he then scored a headed goal in replay which united won 4 0 to become youngest player score in an fa cup final he also became first player to score in both domestic cup finals in same season he played 57 times in all competitions that season and missed just three league games scoring a total of 14 goals manchester united later accepted a ps1 5 million offer for whiteside from a c milan and offered him ps100 000 in cash to accept transfer he refused move as he felt he still had a good future with manchester united and because he was given only a brief time to consider whether or not to relocate to a club and location he knew little about he continued to impress despite on loan striker garth crooks being tipped to take his first team place and sign a permanent contract which never happened united were trophyless however in 1983 84 exiting both domestic cup competitions to third division sides he did though play a part in 3 0 win over barcelona at old trafford in third round of european cup winners cup which overturned a 2 0 deficit from first leg he lost his starting place to mark hughes for semi final clash with juventus at stadio olimpico di torino which ended in a 2 1 defeat by february 1985 he had started just eight games in 1984 85 season having fallen behind in pecking order to stapleton hughes and new signing alan brazil however injury to midfielder remi moses left an opening at centre of field and whiteside proved to be a revelation in role with his intelligent play and positioning skills and stayed in midfield for rest of manager ron atkinson s time at club he formed a solid partnership with bryan robson despite two being similarly attacking players and united lost just one of their first 15 games with this new midfield partnership in operation whiteside scored only hat trick of his professional career in a 4 2 home win over west ham united on 9 march 1985 in fa cup quarter finals it was a perfect hat trick in that he scored once with each foot and once with his head he went on to score winning goal in 1985 fa cup final curling a shot in from right hand side in 20th minute of extra time to give ten man united victory over everton and whiteside his second fa cup winner s medal goal required vision timing and precise shooting and guardian praised his cool footballing brain and clever concealment of shot after this success he negotiated a new contract of ps60 000 a year united were unbeaten from their first 10 league games of 1985 86 campaign and unbeaten from their first 15 and seemed destined to win first division title however they dropped off in mid season and won just six of their final 18 games to end season in fourth place 12 points behind champions liverpool press blamed decline in form on club s drinking culture and ron atkinson s lax disciplinary attitude though in his autobiography whiteside denies that this was to blame and states that stories of player s drinking sessions were exaggerated that summer a 21 year old whiteside played in his second world cup then came a decline in his career at an early age which started to around time of arrival of new manager alex ferguson in november 1986 change of manager coming after a dismal start to season led to decision to sack ron atkinson whiteside still only 21 was facing trouble from his right knee which was now beginning to require serious medical procedures to prevent it from causing his retirement ferguson put whiteside back up front and in turn he scored three times in his first four games back from injury ferguson did though have to rebuke whiteside after some of his numerous drinking sessions he ended 1986 87 season with 10 goals in 37 appearances however united could only manage an 11th place finish at start of 1987 88 season whiteside represented football league in a game against rest of world to celebrate league s centenary he formed a solid partnership with new signing brian mcclair scoring 10 goals in 35 appearances though united finished second in league behind liverpool and he often found himself back in midfield or on bench when peter davenport was selected to play alongside mcclair however he felt that he was due a better contract and decided to call bluff of club by handing in a transfer request recovering from injury and abuse from some supporters for his transfer request he put what many united fans call best performance of his career at anfield on 4 april 1988 when he came off a substitute with his team 3 1 down to help united to salvage a point he ruptured his achilles midway through 1987 88 season and missed almost a year of first team action whiteside s goal in a 2 1 win over derby county in a league match at baseball ground on 10 february 1988 would prove to be his last for manchester united in summer of 1988 he was put on transfer list and came close to joining american club portland timbers before injury put negotiations on hold a ps1million price tag also deterred a great deal of potential interest in summer of 1988 ferguson brought striker mark hughes back to old trafford after two years away further limiting whiteside s opportunities for first team his continued fitness problems and growing competition for places in first team meant that whiteside played just six league games in 1988 89 season in view of whiteside s medical reports ferguson rejected bids of ps500 000 from osasuna of spain and from ron atkinson s new club sheffield wednesday before accepting a bid of ps600 000 with ps150 000 to follow if whiteside reached 50 games from everton in july 1989 this was to dismay of some of club s supporters who felt that there was still a way back for whiteside at old trafford net ferguson intended to build his own team having signed midfield duo neil webb and mike phelan and also in hunt for other players including paul ince gary pallister and danny wallace he had played a total of 274 games in all competitions for united scoring 67 goals and collected two winner s medals in fa cup despite only being 24 years old when he left everton whiteside signed a four year contract with everton and alex ferguson helped him to negotiate a pay deal that would see him earn more in two years at goodison park than he had done during his eight years in manchester he was also offered ps50 000 to put his name to a tabloid article criticising ferguson though he declined offer at time everton boasted more recent success than manchester united having won two league titles an fa cup and european cup winners cup manager colin harvey was planning to boost toffees chances of more silverware and also in 1989 signed mike newell martin keown stefan rehn and raymond whiteside became everton s playmaker in 1989 90 and formed an effective partnership with stuart mccall in midfield to score 13 goals in his 35 appearances everton finished season in sixth place some 20 points behind rivals liverpool however intense running sessions ran by coach mick lyons took their toll on his right knee and on 20 september 1990 he took a knock in a practice match which required him to have yet another operation on his right knee after return of howard kendall as manager in november 1990 whiteside managed to appear in a few reserve team games but this only delayed inevitable and he was forced to retire from game at age of 26 in june 1991 he had a testimonial game between manchester united and everton at old trafford in may 1992 but as united lost title previous week only 7 434 turned out for occasion international career whiteside broke pele s record as

nenad and game finished goalless five days later he helped his side to a 1 1 draw with honduras which was a disappointment and many believed had doomed northern ireland s chances of advancing in competition they needed a win against hosts spain in third and final group game at mestalla stadium in valencia they faced a partisan atmosphere with a mostly spanish crowd and a spanish speaking referee in hector ortiz who was unwilling to punish dirty play from spanish players however a mistake from goalkeeper luis gifted gerry armstrong only goal of game and despite having mal donaghy sent off on 60 minutes northern ireland went on to record a 1 0 win whiteside played at left midfielder for 2 2 draw with austria at vicente calderon stadium a win against france would take them into semi
