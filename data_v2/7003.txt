appears as one of men in black disparate ideas that would eventually coalesce into jose chung s from outer space had been developed by writer darin morgan long before script was actually written writer was inspired both by works he had read on hypnosis as well as theory that ufos are real ships that can manipulate space and time but they are piloted not by aliens but by u s military episode s unique narrative style was influenced by a casting session that morgan had attended in which an actor had mimicked vocal styling of truman capote morgan soon thereafter developed an idea about a writer jose chung covering an x files morgan wanted to cast rip taylor in role but he was unavailable so role ended up going to charles nelson reilly jesse ventura was cast as one of men in black while jeopardy host alex trebek played other morgan himself had wanted johnny cash for role lord kinbote was played by series stuntman tony episode contains a number of references and in jokes klass

brilliantly turns tables on itself two of many worthy moments mulder s squeal and smoking alien reviewer emily vanderwerff from a v club gave episode a rare a and wrote that episode is one of very finest episodes of television i ve ever seen but i m not sure it s a terrific episode of x files if x files were a lord of rings length novel then jose chung s would be its first appendix a source that is at once in love with main text and critical of it a place where real human concerns creep around edges of show s chilly implausibilities vanderwerff s colleague zack handlen wrote that episode was brilliant but he did not feel it was as satisfying as he anticipated because it did not contribute to series as a whole review website ign named it fourth best standalone x files episode of entire
