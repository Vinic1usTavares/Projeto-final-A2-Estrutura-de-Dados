military career of l ron hubbard saw future founder of scientology serving in united states armed forces as a member of marine corps reserve and between 1941 50 navy reserve he saw active service between 1941 45 during world war ii as a naval lieutenant junior grade and later as a lieutenant after war he was mustered out of active service and resigned his commission in 1950 as with many other aspects of l ron hubbard s life accounts of his military career are much disputed streeter pp 207 208 his account of his military service later formed a major element of his public persona as depicted by his scientologist followers atack p 70 church of scientology presents hubbard as a much decorated war hero who commanded a corvette and during hostilities was crippled and wounded lamont pp 19 20 according to scientology publications he served as a commodore of corvette squadrons in all five theaters of world war ii and was awarded twenty one medals and palms for his service rolph p 16 he was severely wounded and was taken crippled and blinded to a military hospital where he worked his way back to fitness strength and full perception in less than two years using only what he knew and could determine about man and his relationship to universe however his official navy service records indicate that his military performance was at times substandard that he was only awarded a handful of campaign medals and that he was never injured or wounded in combat and was never awarded a purple heart most of his military service was spent ashore in continental united states on administrative or training duties he briefly commanded two anti submarine vessels and in coastal waters off massachusetts oregon and california in 1942 and 1943 respectively he was removed from command of both vessels and rated by his superiors as being unsuitable for independent duties and lacking in essential qualities of judgment leadership and cooperation although hubbard asserted that he had attacked and crippled or sunk two japanese submarines off oregon while in command of uss pc 815 his claim was rejected by commander of northwest sea frontier after a subsequent investigation he was hospitalized for last seven months of his active service not with injuries but with an acute duodenal ulcer church of scientology rejects official record and insists that hubbard had a second set of records that u s navy has concealed according to church s chief spokesman if it was true that hubbard had not been injured injuries that he handled by use of dianetics procedures were never handled because they were injuries that never existed therefore dianetics is based on a lie therefore scientology is based on a lie montana army national guard and us marine corps reserve hubbard s first military service was with montana army national guard which he joined at age of 16 in october 1927 while still at school falsely stating that his age was 18 enlisting at state armory in his home town of helena montana he

university where he was a student from 1930 32 hubbard attributed his service in regiment to his need for a little recreation life was dull fellow came up to me and he says marine reserves are organizing a twentieth regiment why don t you come down he made dubious claim of being rapidly promoted to rank of first sergeant hubbard later explained his unusually rapid promotion as being due to his unit being newly formed and his superiors being unable to find anyone else who could drill hubbard l ron research and discovery series volume 7 pg 98 as cited in atack p 57 he stated that he was

paddling out to meet an australian destroyer another church of scientology account describes hubbard as senior officer present ashore in brisbane australia and asserts that his duties included counter intelligence and organization of relief for beleaguered american forces on bataan it was in this latter capacity that he eventually saw action on island of java and only eluded capture through a daring escape on a raft in a 1956 lecture to scientologists hubbard said in another lecture of same year hubbard provided an alternative version of his return to united states us navy s files do not

states in reflection of his chronic ulcer he was discharged from hospital and mustered out of active service on december 6 1945 atack p 84 he resigned his commission in october 1950 according to church of scientology he quit because us navy had attempted to monopolize all his researches and force him to work on a project to make man more suggestible and when he was unwilling tried to blackmail him by ordering him back to active duty to perform this function having many friends he was able to instantly resign from navy and escape this trap l r h biography flag information letter 67

there has never been a uss howland in history of united states navy in may 1974 church asked navy department to supply seventeen medals that he was said to have been awarded including purple heart and navy commendation medal many of them with bronze service stars denoting participation in military campaigns or multiple bestowals of same award navy sent only four medals noting records in this bureau fail to establish mr hubbard s entitlement to other medals and awards listed in your response hubbard responded by circulating to scientologists a photograph of 21 medals and palms that he said he had been awarded and explained that he had actually won 28 but that missing seven had been awarded to him in secret because naval high command was embarrassed that he had sunk two japanese submarines in united states back yard miller p 424 25 a 1994 biography published by church of scientology states that he was awarded 29 medals and awards in 1990 church of scientology released a document said to be

scientology biographical sketch circulated to british members of parliament in which hubbard s war service was summarized and in 1971 paulette cooper described as true claim that hubbard was severely injured in war and in fact was in a lifeboat for many days badly injuring his body and his eyes in hot pacific sun cooper p 160 others were more skeptical george malko attempted to verify hubbard s revealing anonymously authored and totally unsubstantiated biography in 1970 but reported that i was unable to confirm a single one of hubbard s critical claims that he had been crippled and blind nature of his discoveries and medical records stating he had twice been pronounced dead his inquiries were frustrated by navy s refusal to provide hubbard s service record without written consent of person whose records are concerned malko p 37 information later released by navy and veterans administration prompted some to express doubts christopher evans commented in 1974 that faced with this impressive if annoyingly record it is hard to assess nature or extent of hubbard s battle scars in service of his country but noted contradictions between claims of war wounds and official record in 1978 los angeles times described hubbard s war record as obscure and quoted navy spokesmen stating that hubbard had not received a purple heart and had not been treated for any injuries sustained during his military career contrary to statements of church of scientology by 1979 an amateur researcher michael shannon had gathered a mountain of material which included some files that no one else had bothered to get copies of for example log books of navy ships that hubbard had served on and his father s navy service file shannon michael lynn a biography of l ron hubbard 1979 quoted in atack p 46 although shannon was unable to find a publisher he sent a hundred page portfolio of materials including copies of some of hubbard s naval and college records to a number of concerned individuals

of his destroyer which had gone down with all hands save himself submarine battle of may 1943 was also described by moulton and was hailed by a church of scientology attorney as a new untold chapter to history of pacific conflict during world war ii and new perspectives on magnitude and proximity of japanese naval operations off u s coast during war moulton also testified that hubbard had told him that he had received combat injuries to his eyes and back in response documents contradicting moulton s and hubbard s account were read into record by armstrong s attorney michael flynn decision by judge paul breckenridge found that armstrong s fears of persecution by church were reasonable and thus his conduct in turning over documents in his possession to his attorneys was also reasonable judge issued a wide ranging verdict commenting of hubbard that evidence portrays a man who has been virtually a pathological liar when it comes to his history background and achievements a few weeks later a british judge ruled in a case heard at royal courts of justice that hubbard had made a number of false claims about his military career that he was a much decorated war hero he was not that he commanded a corvette squadron he did not that he was awarded purple heart a gallantry decoration for those wounded in action he was not wounded and was not decorated that he was crippled and blinded
