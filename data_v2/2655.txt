premier he handily won 1926 election signed an agreement with federal government transferring control over alberta s natural resources to its provincial government sold struggling government railways to canadian national and canadian pacific railway companies and ran a series of balanced budgets things became more difficult with advent of great depression brownlee was unable to restore province to prosperity in face of a global economic crisis and reluctantly ran budget deficits political radicalism increased and brownlee found his orthodox approach to political economy under attack in 1934 vivian macmillan a family friend sued brownlee for seduction brownlee denied any sexual relationship but jury found in macmillan s favour though judge disregarded jury s verdict trial s lurid testimony and stigma resulting from jury s finding forced brownlee s resignation as premier he ran for re election in ponoka in 1935 provincial election but was defeated as william aberhart s social

from different dairies with which his father dealt to produce a standardized blend by end of 1880s port ryerse was dying out advent of railways was making tiny lake ports obsolete and in port ryerse s case this obsolescence was hastened by town mill burning down in august 1890 foster 1981 4 5 against this backdrop family moved to bradshaw in lambton county foster 1981 5 there john began school and attended sunday school at village s methodist church he was only pupil at his tiny school not from a farm he later claimed that this exposure to farmers gave him an early understanding of their concerns foster 1981 6 he also became involved with his church s young people s club which put on speaking programs he was by nature shy serious and introverted which made these programs a challenge at first however he found that he was able to succeed at them through focus and discipline foster 1981 7 in september 1897 brownlee began high school closest high school was in sarnia too distant for a daily commute so at age of fourteen brownlee boarded away from his family seeing them only during holidays and occasional weekends he was a good student described by his instructors as diligent if not brilliant but was not a social success being too studious for many of his peers he wrote his departmental examinations in july 1900 and graduated shortly thereafter foster 1981 8 early professional career after graduating high school brownlee travelled with his father on a sales trip through northern ontario and otherwise assisted with operation of family business his family

as school management pedagogy school law reading instruction and hygiene foster 1981 9 he graduated december 12 1901 second in his twenty person class and within a month was one of two teachers at bradshaw s school foster 1981 9 10 he fast gained a reputation as a competent instructor his old work ethic served him well and his seriousness cool blue grey eyes and six foot four frame combined to give him an impressive presence his 400 per year salary did not satisfy his ambition and in spring of 1904 after two and a half years on job he decided that he wanted a university education his teaching salary was not sufficient to finance this so he spent summer of 1904 selling a one volume encyclopaedia in newly settled areas around rapid city manitoba foster 1981 10 besides providing him with income he required he was a patient effective salesman and later boasted that he was never thrown off of a farm job gave now 21 year old brownlee his first glimpse of western canada foster 1981

history and political science foster 1981 13 14 besides these chosen subjects he was required to study mathematics biology english literature composition latin and two additional languages despite having some knowledge of french he chose german and hebrew he continued his trend of diligent scholarship and earned as in all subjects his first year except for latin german and mathematics in which he received bs foster 1981 14 trend continued and in his third year he was among top five in his class in all subjects except economics in which he was eighth foster 1981 17 as he became more involved in extracurricular pursuits these grades fell after his fourth and final year he graduated with iii class honours leaving him out of top tier of students foster 1981 19 his professors included historian george wrong whom brownlee held in high esteem right thumb alt a large three storey building behind a wrought iron fence victoria college as it appeared in was involved in a wide array of extracurricular pursuits chief among these were union literary society dubbed lit acta victoriana college s literary journal and bob a satirical revue first of these allowed him to hone his skills at formal debate he earned a reputation as one of more effective although not most dramatic of speakers foster 1981 16 in his involvement with journal he developed his business skills in his second year he was named assistant business manager and he was promoted to business manager in his fourth year foster 1981 18 his financial management of acta victoriana along with that of college glee club for which he also served as business manager during his fourth year organizing a ten day tour of niagara region earned him accolades for bob brownlee temporarily abandoned his seriousness to write skits poking fun at college and his classmates these won good reviews with acta victoriana declaring 1908 edition which brownlee headed one of best ever foster 1981 15 summer following his third year he attended conference of college young men s associations at niagara on lake where he attended bible study classes and heard guest speakers encourage him to pursue a career in clergy brownlee s summers in university were spent selling stereoscopic viewers in england and magazine subscriptions in toronto foster 1981 14 15 17 he also derived a salary in his fourth year as business manager of acta victoriana these sources of income allowed him to rent a small room in a private home and to subscribe to a meal plan at a local eatery for c 2 50 per week foster 1981 13 family during brownlee s convocation in 1908 he sneaked off to go canoeing in humber river with a female classmate isabella upon their return they announced that they were engaged news stunned friends of both none of whom was aware of any romance between two moreover apparent spontaneity of engagement seemed at odds with brownlee s reputation for seriousness and caution foster 1981 20 engagement did not last and following winter brownlee met and began to court florence edy an arts student at mcmaster college in summer of 1909 edy moved with her family to calgary brownlee for a combination of personal and professional reasons soon followed foster 1981 21 pair was married december 23 1912 at toronto home of edy s sister blanche a honeymoon trip back to calgary via chicago followed foster 1981 27 left thumb alt a young woman with dark hair in fur rimmed graduation robes florence edy in and his wife had two sons john edy brownlee was born december 1915 and alan marshall brownlee was born september 1917 florence s pregnancy with alan combined with a bout of poor health before it made her a virtual invalid in subsequent years foster 1981 36 this was exacerbated by 1919 birth and death in infancy of a daughter also in 1919 brownlee visited his family in ontario he returned to alberta with his sister maude who assisted florence with care of her children soon after a full time maid was hired foster 1981 44 while john brownlee relished life in alberta florence missed her friends and family in ontario her own health was only made worse by worry about her sons john was perpetually nervous and alan was high strung and sickly it did not help that beginning in 1921 her husband spent work week in edmonton commuting home to calgary only for weekends foster 1981 65 this situation continued until 1923 when family moved to edmonton s region foster 1981 103 in 1926 on way home from a visit east florence brownlee and her sons were examined at mayo clinic where all three were given clean bills of health florence in particular was advised to resume a more active life foster 1983 129 although brownlee s public image was of a severe and humourless technocrat in private he allowed himself some levity christmas morning 1923 brownlee boys awoke to find footprints of coal dust leading from fireplace to stairs and a handwritten note from santa claus apologizing for mess and explaining that he had been searching for one of his reindeer it transpired that he had mistaken one of florence s feet emerging from covers at foot of her bed for an antler foster 1981 104 on another occasion brownlee reacted to his sons displeasure at leaving his parents cat in ontario by acquiring a large bloodhound which he himself came to enjoy foster 1981 112 legal career early career right thumb alt a man seated at a

college path of entry to his chosen profession law was through three years of articling instead of law school foster 1981 22 brownlee and victoria classmate fred albright resolved to go west after narrowing choice to either calgary or vancouver former was selected on basis that its legal community was less established and it offered better prospects to young lawyers without significant capital there brownlee was articled to lougheed bennett allison mclaws whose partners included sir james lougheed and r b bennett brownlee became quite close to bennett future prime minister often visited him after hours while brownlee was studying and used his honed memory and impressive oratorical skills to give younger man detailed lectures on whatever area of law he was reading about illustrated by precise and invariably accurate references to cases despite his relationship with bennett brownlee was dissatisfied with work he was being given and he moved to muir jephson and adams where he hoped to practice more commercial law there he benefited from tutelage of james muir who spent hours finding precise citations relevant to brownlee s studies and then left open to appropriate page for brownlee to find next morning foster 1981 22 23 on december 16 1912 brownlee was called to alberta bar foster 1981 23 he began work as an associate with muir jephson and adams in 1914 he was made partner foster 1981 30 he took advantage of his membership in victoria college s newly founded calgary alumni branch to build professional connections foster 1981 29 on outbreak of world war i brownlee did not enlist his biographer lakeland college historian franklin foster speculates that this may have been because of his eyesight but notes that he did not involve himself in patriotic fundraising or volunteer work and questions whether he completely shared values and ideals of his generation farmers lawyer one of muir jephson and adams major clients was a new agricultural lobby organization called united farmers of alberta ufa and it was with this group that brownlee began to work most closely among his first tasks for ufa was to assist with creation of a province wide farmer owned company to own and operate province s grain elevators early in 1913 he was part of a delegation to lobby provincial government of arthur sifton to grant a charter to such a company sifton was cognizant of political power of ufa and quickly incorporated alberta farmers cooperative elevator company afcec limited but refused farmers request to guarantee bank loans to new company foster 1981 28 these guarantees were instead received from grain growers grain company ggg a manitoba based equivalent of afcec thumb left alt a large group of white men in suits posing for a picture directors of united grain growers in october 1916 brownlee is standing in back row at left brownlee became afcec s lawyer and in that capacity dealt with lawsuits against company alleging incompetence on part of its general manager and fraud on part of a former auditor his most important work for afcec however was in merging it with ggg to form united grain growers ugg in 1916 new afcec president cecil rice jones began to advocate amalgamation of western canada s farmer controlled grain elevator companies saskatchewan co operative elevator company was uninterested leaving afcec and ggg as two potential partners foster 1981 31 after accompanying rice jones to a meeting with alberta public works minister charles stewart brownlee initially found himself in agreement with stewart s belief that companies shareholders would not accept amalgamation and that a holding company should instead be created to run both companies affairs foster 1981 31 32 after further study however he changed his mind and pursued amalgamation with his typical focus he reviewed two companies corporate charters and found that ggg s prevented it from either selling out to another company or acquiring sufficient capitalization to buy out afcec charter could only be amended by parliament of canada and ggg was concerned that any request for amendment would lead eastern canadian financial interests to successfully lobby for a weakening of farmers rights foster 1981 32 a meeting of both companies boards at ggg s winnipeg offices nevertheless reached reluctant conclusion that such a request was necessary for amalgamation foster 1981 32 33 though brownlee continued to fear resistance from shareholders both companies annual general meetings approved proposal foster 1981 34 35 brownlee was heavily involved at both meetings fielding questions from shareholders about legal ramifications and serving on ad hoc subcommittees to study aspects of proposal once proposal was approved he drew up necessary agreements bylaws stock certificates and other instruments ugg came into existence september 1 1917 foster 1981 35 as lawyer for ugg brownlee began to sympathize with prevailing farmers view that eastern canadian business establishment was hostile to their interests for example when ugg wanted to sell twine no manufacturer would supply it he recommended that ugg reduce farmers reliance on eastern establishment by expanding its operations into insurance investment and real estate foster 1981 41 result was united grain growers securities ltd foster 1981 37 he also helped ugg quietly sell stock it held in home bank of canada when ugg directors began to doubt bank s soundness this subtlety was considered essential as directors were concerned that airing their doubts publicly would make bank s failure a self fulfilling prophecy foster 1981 43 when ugg assistant general manager j r murray found an interested buyer brownlee advised murray against insisting on an intricate written sales contract for fear that buyer would sense directors concerns foster 1981 43 44 his advice was heeded and sale was concluded december 29 1919 foster 1981 44 bank failed less than four years later in july 1919 brownlee left muir jephson and adams to accept a full time position with ugg at 6 000 per year several months later this was increased to 7 500 in view of his increased responsibilities as general manager of ugg securities foster 1981 45 in 1922 he was made king s counsel craig perry 346 brownlee was doing well in both law and business and expected to continue doing so for foreseeable future ufa and politicization though most of his legal work was for afcec and then ugg brownlee also made contact with leaders of ufa proper including william irvine irene parlby herbert greenfield and most importantly henry wise wood foster 1981 47 charismatic wood was ufa s president and brownlee often accompanied him to speaking engagements at ufa locals across alberta in 1919 and 1920 foster 1981 48 wood held audiences enraptured with his sermons on cooperation and social justice brownlee at one point likened ufa to a religion while brownlee explained services offered by ufa s central office and answered members legal questions foster 1981 46 49 his trips with wood aroused brownlee s interest in political side of farmers movement which he began to study in greater detail foster 1981 49 right thumb alt a portrait of a balding white man in a suit henry wise wood s influence on brownlee s life would be profound another of brownlee s contacts was t a crerar who had recently become leader of progressive party of canada and it was to him that brownlee turned for his political education crerar introduced brownlee to ernest charles drury newly elected united farmers of ontario premier of ontario and arranged for a meeting between brownlee and charles stewart by now alberta premier during latter meeting brownlee told stewart that he felt that ufa s desires could be accommodated within stewart s liberal government but warned against a quick election foster suggests that this strategic advice from a political neophyte offended stewart foster 1981 50 whether this is true or not stewart did call a quick election for july 1921 foster 1981 53 ufa had decided in january 1919 against woods wishes that it would run candidates in next election before provincial election there was a federal by election scheduled for june 1921 in medicine hat foster 1981 51 crerar s progressives were running robert gardiner a local farmer and crerar asked wood and greenfield vice president of ufa to broker an alliance between farmers and labour in mixed rural urban riding before these efforts could come to fruition federal government of conservative arthur meighen disclosed allegations of irregularities in management of some of ugg s elevators at a hearing on june 4 former employees testified of storage bins with false bottoms and bribed railway employees these allegations involved events from 1912 until 1914 and their sudden prominence in 1921 made some in ufa suspect that hearings were politically motivated foster 1981 52 brownlee as ugg s attorney was successful in obtaining an injunction against further hearings until ugg had time to conduct its own investigation and as importantly until medicine hat by election was over foster 1981 52 53 gardiner won by a wide margin foster 1981 53 while most of ufa was preparing for 1921 provincial election brownlee went on vacation in victoria for a month despite his recent interest in politics he still viewed himself as a lawyer and businessman with little role to play in ufa s electoral activities before leaving calgary he was assured by wood that ufa would not win more than 20 of legislative assembly of alberta s 61 seats in fact it won 38 brownlee watched results come in at offices of victoria colonist foster 1981 54 ufa not a political party in conventional sense had contested election without a leader while its control of majority of seats in legislature entitled it under conventions of westminster parliamentary system to form government it was not clear who would become premier wood was natural choice but he declined job for several reasons to brownlee s surprise wood proposed that he should become premier instead brownlee declined surmising that many of newly elected farmer politicians would have seen an urban lawyer in premier s office as a repudiation of much of what they stood for ultimately greenfield was selected foster 1981 54 55 attorney general greenfield appointed brownlee his attorney general and soon after brownlee was acclaimed in a by election in ponoka foster 1981 68 his training in business and law unique in ufa caucus gave him a central role in most of government s initiatives foster 1981 64 he also led defense against attacks from liberal opposition and eventually became responsible for setting agenda for cabinet meetings foster 1981 74 82 brownlee quickly entrenched himself in conservative wing of ufa caucus he resisted measures that would take decision making out of government departments and transfer them to caucus or ufa locals foster 1981 62 and opposed efforts of some ufa backbenchers to transform application of westminster system in alberta foster 1981 76 77 when ufa s more radical elements called for creation of a government owned bank brownlee dismissed idea as neither financially nor constitutionally feasible foster 1981 89 90 93 105 his concern for government s finances extended to its budget deficit when he found greenfield s spending cuts wanting he cut staff from his own department to set an example foster 1981 80 81 111 in a further attempt to better government s financial position he unsuccessfully advocated sale of its four money losing railways to canadian national cpr or canadian pacific cpr foster 1981 81 115 116 a longstanding objective of alberta government had been winning control of alberta s lands and natural resources from federal government older provinces already had this control but when alberta saskatchewan and manitoba were admitted to confederation federal government retained resource rights and paid provincial governments an annual grant as compensation foster 1981 86 as attorney general brownlee was alberta s chief negotiator in these efforts and met frequently with representatives of liberal prime minister william lyon mackenzie king foster 1981 102 while negotiations occasionally seemed promising king was unwilling to fully commit to transfer possibly because charles stewart now king s alberta lieutenant and john r boyle leader of provincial liberals were sworn enemies of ufa foster 1981 114 115 as a farmers government ufa was committed to helping farmers in province s drought stricken south brownlee authored drought relief act which created a drought relief commissioner to provide farmers with financial counselling and help them reach settlements with banks when they were unable to pay their debts he also played a leading role in creation of alberta wheat pool brownlee s department was responsible for administration of prohibition though policy initially enjoyed support of most albertans disregard for it was sufficiently widespread that effective enforcement proved impossible 1922 murder of alberta provincial police constable steve lawson by bootleggers emil and florence for which they were hanged helped turn public opinion against it a referendum held on issue found most voters willing to replace prohibition with government owned liquor stores and rigidly regulated beer parlours and act was repealed lord s day act which prohibited most commerce on sundays was also brownlee s responsibility though he had little enthusiasm for it and prosecuted only most flagrant violations many ufa mlas came to see government s reliance on brownlee as embarrassing and greenfield s abilities as too limited to continue to lead in 1924 they pressured greenfield to resign so brownlee could replace him brownlee scuppered plot by warning that greenfield s resignation would be accompanied by his own a second attempt in 1925 was successful when wood intervened to convince brownlee to accept premiership and greenfield assured him that he would be pleased to be rid of it brownlee became premier of alberta november 23 1925 premier first term 1926 1930 brownlee s first challenges as premier were similar to those he had faced as attorney general winning control of alberta s natural resources selling money losing railways and balancing provincial budget before he could do any of these however he needed to win impending provincial election he accomplished this by winning 43 seats in 1926 election an increase from 38 that ufa had won in 1921 and enough for a majority in 60 seat legislature once returned to office brownlee turned his attention to his other priorities many of them required cooperation of king s liberal federal government provincial control of resources would require acquiescence of federal government and brownlee felt that deficit was in part result of federal government s failure to cover its rightful share of expenses king was himself reliant on ufa his minority government was survived thank to support of progressives and allied factions including 11 ufa mps though some ufa legislators preferred arthur meighen s conservatives brownlee personally supported king government and even appeared to consider an offer from prime minister to take brownlee into his cabinet thumb

minister of canada william lyon mackenzie king natural resources agreement between alberta and federal government was signed december 14 1929 brownlee attempted to leverage his relationship with king to win provincial control of natural resources he won such an agreement in 1926 but it was soon scuttled by federal addition of a clause requiring alberta to continue supporting separate roman catholic schools wrangling over this clause persisted until 1929 when a compromise was reached all that remained was question of compensation to alberta for land given away by federal government and by end of 1929 agreement on this too was reached brownlee returned from ottawa to alberta where he was greeted by 3 000 cheering supporters brownlee was similarly successful in divesting government of its railways when his initial attempts to sell them to cnr or cpr failed provincial government took over direct operation of lines in 1927 in 1928 they began to show a profit and one of lines was soon sold to cpr a joint offer from cpr and cnr for remaining lines was judged too low and they were sold to cpr near end of 1928 for 25 million control of natural resources and divestment of railways were two factors that permitted balanced provincial budgets first of which was registered in 1925 despite this success brownlee continued to advocate austerity and tried unsuccessfully to persuade federal government to assume a greater share of costs of new social programs such as old age pension his resulting reputation as a penny pincher came at a cost to his personal popularity brownlee s government also attempted to advance a progressive agenda one way this manifested itself was an attempt to consolidate alberta s thousands of school districts into a far smaller number of school divisions plan was supported by educational reformers who believed that decentralized status quo made province wide reform impossible but was scrapped when rural residents expressed fears that it would mean closure of local schools another progressive initiative was sexual sterilization act which allowed for sterilization of mental defectives while act repealed in 1972 is now viewed as barbaric at time it enjoyed support of moral reformers like nellie mcclung who believed it was for subjects own protection second term 1930 1934 brownlee campaigned vigorously during 1930 election and was re elected with a slightly diminished majority however great depression was making itself felt in alberta price of wheat alberta s major export declined from a high of 1 78 per bushel in summer of 1929 to 1 00 in following march to 0 45 by end of 1930 alberta wheat pool awp guaranteed its members a minimum price of 1 00 per bushel itself not enough for many farmers to earn a living and it found itself facing ruination banks denied credit to it and to individual farmers which in turn made it difficult for latter to afford seed for 1931 crop provincial government faced calls to provide loan guarantees brownlee was concerned that such guarantees would encourage lenders to make loans at higher interest rates with knowledge that provincial government would pay them if farmers defaulted he sought a federally guaranteed minimum price of 0 70 per bushel but was rebuffed by prime minister r b bennett who saw source of problem as a global oversupply thumb right 260px alt a large group of protesters some carrying signs hunger march in edmonton december farms failed many young people migrated from farms to alberta s cities where situation was scarcely better as unemployment rate rose so did labour militancy december 1932 saw a hunger march in which more than a thousand unemployed men and women attempted to hold a protest march to alberta legislature brownlee requested edmonton city government to prohibit such a display while he pronounced himself sympathetic to workers ordeal he said he felt such an event would create a volatile atmosphere that would breed radicalism and communism it was through this lens that he had viewed 1932 founding of co operative commonwealth federation ccf though many ufa members supported this new party which saw itself as a partnership between farmers and labourers brownlee considered it dangerously socialist when hunger march ers attempted to go ahead without government sanction and were brutally dispersed by mounties and edmonton city police brownlee took much of blame further weakening brownlee s control of situation ufa around this time took a sharp left ward turn as robert gardiner replaced retiring henry wise wood as president of provincial body weakened economy presented significant challenges to provincial government finances 1931 saw first deficit of brownlee s premiership of approximately 2 5 million and 1932 s was still larger during latter year province came within hours of defaulting on a 3 million bond which was avoided only by a loan from federal government brownlee cut spending aggressively he closed most of province s agricultural colleges reduced civil service by more than a third cut provincial employees salaries and disbanded alberta provincial police replacing it with rcmp his government also increased corporate taxes and implemented a new provincial income tax these measures proved insufficient and brownlee joined his colleagues in other western provinces in entreating bennett to help bennett said he was privately sympathetic to brownlee but refused to provide assistance in 1933 brownlee was appointed to royal commission on banking and currency as a representative of unorthodox economic views despite his conservative approach to alberta s finances outside of province he was viewed as a spokesperson of progressive movement brownlee argued that banks were treating eastern and western debtors unequally and that they were charging predatory interest rates to farmers he joined majority on commission in calling for creation of a central bank in canada but was alone in proposing that it be entirely publicly controlled during great depression s early years calgary schoolteacher and evangelist william aberhart began to preach a version of c h douglas s social credit economic theory brownlee believed that aberhart s proposals would be both unconstitutional if implemented by a provincial government which did not have control over monetary policy and ineffective since they would not create markets for alberta s agricultural products as aberhart gained popularity brownlee attacked his solutions as illusory but had little of his own to offer but critiques and orthodoxy sex scandal in 1934 brownlee was sued for seduction of vivian macmillan a brownlee family friend and clerk in provincial attorney general s office foster 1981 222 macmillan alleged that brownlee had seduced her in 1930 and that subsequent affair had lasted until 1933 brownlee denied her story completely and said that lawsuit was result of a conspiracy between macmillan her fiance and brownlee s opponents in liberal party foster 1981 222 225 after a sensational and well publicized trial jury found in macmillan s favour foster 1981 258 however justice william carlos ives who presided over trial disregarded its finding ruling that macmillan had failed to show that she had suffered any damage foster 1981 261 appeals eventually led to judicial committee of british privy council at time canada s highest court of appeal where macmillan emerged victorious foster 1981 272 273 once jury issued its finding brownlee realized that his time as premier was finished he announced that he would resign as soon as a successor could be found and on july 10 1934 was replaced by richard gavin reid foster 1981 261 262 later political career in months after his resignation brownlee kept a low profile though he was still mla for ponoka he returned to public eye with a speech to january 1935 ufa convention attacking aberhart s plans to implement social credit in alberta alone i would impress you that nothing but disillusionment loss of hope and additional despair can follow any attempt to inaugurate a system of that kind because province has no jurisdiction in these matters foster 1981 264 despite hearing directly from aberhart convention defeated by a wide margin a motion to endorse his version of social credit foster 1981 265 reid s government made brownlee its chief strategist against aberhart and social credit foster 1981 266 one tactic he adopted was c h douglas to serve as a consultant to alberta government on economic reconstruction in doing this brownlee hoped both to co opt promise of social credit for benefit of ufa and to discredit aberhart by demonstrating how widely his interpretation of social credit differed from douglas s foster 1981 267 this effort failed because albertans confronted by contrast between fiery charismatic aberhart and aloof technocratic douglas preferred former foster 1981 269 brownlee also invited aberhart to come to edmonton and prepare proposals on which government could act this was an attempt to force him to take specific positions that could be attacked rather than relying on vague assurances of economic salvation but was foiled by aberhart s continued evasiveness brownlee himself toured southern alberta attacking aberhart s policies as vague and unconstitutional in april 1935 he gave a series of radio speeches designed to counter aberhart s popular radio program back to bible hour when his customary appeals to logic did not work brownlee resorted to attacking aberhart personally comparing him to pied piper of hamelin aberhart did not resist comparison retorting that pied piper had rid capitol of all rats brownlee responded that after doing that he had led its children to their destruction in may 1935 after aberhart announced that his social credit movement would contest next provincial election brownlee ridiculed its candidate selection process in which aberhart personally interviewed and selected more candidates for each riding than could ultimately run as one in which candidates would be wrapped in cellophane and carefully hidden away so they will not dry out on aberhart until day he calls out fittest and discards rest foster 1981 268 1935 election took place august 22 brownlee spent most of campaign trying to retain his own riding of ponoka despite respect he commanded his constituents were in desperate economic straits and tired of ufa s orthodoxy which had failed to raise their condition as brownlee later recalled one man got up and said mr brownlee we have listened to you with a great deal of attention and answers you have given seem pretty hard to meet but i have one more question i m selling my wheat at 25 cents a bushel if i tried to sell a steer tomorrow i d probably hardly get enough to pay freight i get 3 cents a dozen for eggs i m lucky to get a dollar for a can of cream will you tell me what i ve got to lose and a cheer went over audience i knew then what result of election was going to be foster 1981 270 on election day every ufa candidate in province was defeated as aberhart s won 56 of 63 seats foster 1981 271 in ponoka social credit s edith rogers defeated brownlee 2 295 votes to 879 foster 1981 270 271 after this election brownlee never sought political office again life after politics shortly after his electoral defeat brownlee started a new law firm based in edmonton united grain growers soon re appointed him as their general counsel foster 1981 271 by 1940 brownlee had restored his career to it position before he entered politics his firm counted a number of major agricultural companies among its clients and ugg too brought him considerable work he was also hired to write a legal column for western review newspaper foster 1981 273 thumb right alt an aging unsmiling man with round rimmed glasses brownlee circa 1940 in his capacity as ugg general counsel brownlee was responsible for its restructuring its bylaws provided that only farmers could buy shares directly from company but placed no limitation on who could buy them from other shareholders this had effect of limiting capital inflow since few farmers could afford to buy shares during depression and transferring control of company to non farmers who were purchasing shares from impoverished farmers brownlee s solution was to create two classes of share an investment share with a par value of 20 and a voting share with a par value of 5 former could be held by any person to a maximum of 250 shares per person while latter could be held only by farmers to a maximum of 25 shares per person foster 1981 278 ugg director and vice president when he restructured ugg s capital brownlee included a rider that non farmers who held shares at time new structure came into effect could hold voting shares this clause allowed him to do so and in consequence to be elected to company s board of directors at 1942 annual shareholders meeting he was also appointed ugg s vice president foster 1981 279 thumb left alt a large group of white men in suits posing for a picture a 1946 ufa banquet in honour of hugh allen brownlee is seated in front row at left at time of brownlee s appointment ugg was embroiled in an income tax dispute though farmers movement had generally supported 1917 introduction of income tax as rates climbed ugg began to resent it especially given that pools were exempt while rationale for this exemption that pools were agents of their members and that any income should therefore be taxed as personal income once disbursed and not as corporate income pre disbursal was initially accepted ugg argued that pools 1931 reorganization eliminated differences between them and ugg and that exemption thus put ugg at a competitive disadvantage in 1941 brownlee travelled to ottawa to express ugg s case there he collaborated with o m biggar representing private grain companies in form of north west line elevators association who also objected to pools exemption on a joint brief to minister of national revenue foster 1981 280 government ruled that pools were taxable pools appealed to exchequer court which found in government s favour in 1943 by this time government had agreed not to tax pools for pre 1941 revenue and to grant generous exemptions on taxation thereafter foster 1981 281 after world war ii federal government appointed royal commission on taxation of cooperatives to examine question in greater detail brownlee prepared ugg s submission and was pleased with commission s eventual findings it recognized ugg as a cooperative and recommended that it be granted same exemptions as pools enjoyed however government still intended to collect taxes from 1940 and 1941 from ugg but not from pools foster 1981 286 in february 1947 brownlee returned to ottawa to present ugg s case to finance minister douglas abbott who eventually sided with ugg and extended pools exemption to it foster 1981 289 acrimony this dispute engendered between pools and ugg led former to suggest that latter was not a true cooperative but rather an old style grain company brownlee played a major role in disputing these allegations and was a major contributor to grain growers record 1906 1943 ugg s written response foster 1981 283 when he as ugg s delegate to canadian federation of agriculture opposed a resolution calling for continued tax exempt status of pools resolution s proponents suggested stating that it was endorsed by cooperatives brownlee objected that ugg was a cooperative and wording was withdrawn foster 1981 283 284 alberta wheat pool later published a pamphlet entitled a history of events leading to taxation of cooperatives which placed much of blame on ugg and brownlee accusing latter of working with hated private grain companies to enforce taxation of wheat pools foster 1981 287 seizing on an incorrect date in pamphlet brownlee dismissed charges which were substantially true in light of his 1941 joint brief with biggar as factually incorrect foster 1981 288 though ugg shareholders subjected him to vigorous questioning he held firm and controversy died down after he gave a series of radio addresses in alberta saskatchewan and manitoba foster 1981 288 289 ugg president in mid 1940s ugg president and general manager r s law fell ill and in february 1947 brownlee was named ugg s acting general manager on january 1 1948 he became full general manager in spring 1948 law stepped down completely and on may 1 brownlee succeeded him as president and general manager foster 1981 291 in this capacity he had offices in calgary and winnipeg foster 1981 295 he worked constantly often arriving at work on a monday with a briefcase full of dictation machine recordings for secretaries to transcribe foster says that brownlee was known by his staff as a man whose life was his work who lived in his briefcase and whose only recreation seemed to be changing from one job to another foster 1981 295 296 right thumb

printing division turned this work ethic to expanding company building new grain elevators and purchasing existing ones at same time he undertook a study of operating costs and volume of each of ugg s delivery points he found that roughly a dozen elevators were losing money with climbing costs threatening to increase this number foster 1981 297 298 brownlee tried to reach accommodations with ugg s competitors to divide among them centres too small to support more than one elevator and achieved some success especially with alberta wheat pool at same time brownlee increased ugg s presence in larger centres especially regina brandon and winnipeg foster 1981 298 brownlee remained intimately involved in grain industry even outside ugg in part through his position on canadian federation of agriculture executive in this capacity he found himself in middle of a controversy over british wheat agreement bwa bwa was an agreement to sell wheat to british clients at a fixed price over a four year period price was to be adjusted during following two years having regard to world wheat prices during first four years world wheat prices were continually above price stipulated in agreement breeding resentment towards british especially since they sold much of this fixed price wheat for a large profit in european markets this was exacerbated when british refused to adjust price upwards for last two years on grounds that there was nothing in agreement to compel them to do so result was considerable ill will and a loss by grain farmers of an estimated 350 million federal government which had negotiated agreement offered to supplement british payments by 65 million a sum large enough to raise ire of eastern canadians but too small to placate western farmers foster 1981 299 300 brownlee who had opposed agreement authorized a purchase of advertising across country pointing out that government fixed domestic price of wheat at 0 77 per bushel while world price reached as high as 2 18 in brownlee s view 65 million payment by government paled in comparison to benefit to consumers of federal policy foster 1981 300 301 subsequent international agreements for which brownlee acted as an advisor to canadian delegation resulted in more favourable terms for farmers foster 1981 301 302 brownlee s continued status as one of grain industry s leading figures was also exhibited by his involvement in government relations he appeared before canadian house of commons standing committee on agriculture to oppose a system of allocating box cars to each grain elevator by formula favouring instead a system whereby canadian wheat board retained flexibility to assign them as it saw fit foster 1981 308 in his september 1960 submission to royal commission on transportation in defense of crow s nest pass rates he rejected railways calls to deregulate rates they charged for shipment of grain foster 1981 311 brownlee s presidency coincided with fiftieth anniversary of grain growers grain company one of ugg s founding organizations in celebration of event brownlee travelled around country speaking to ugg outlets foster 1981 303 he also oversaw publication and wrote much of first fifty years a history of ugg to that point foster 1981 303 304 in this capacity he came into conflict with ugg vice president r c brown in charge of ugg department that published book and assistant general manager p c watt brownlee had an interventionist style as president which foster acknowledged sometimes verged on outright interference as years wore on his decision making became more autocratic with board of directors expected to serve as a rubber stamp foster 1981 307 on june 21 1961 ill health forced brownlee s resignation from ugg later political activities brownlee never sought political office after his 1935 defeat and commented publicly on political issues only rarely his distaste for aberhart s social credit government and in particular its contention which brownlee viewed as unfair that ufa had left government bankrupt did not prevent him from advising it behind scenes on a number of issues most notably alberta s submission to rowell sirois commission case for alberta in early 1940s he met m j coldwell new federal leader of ccf on a train according to coldwell in ensuing conversation brownlee indicated that he would be prepared to consider running federally as a ccf candidate coldwell excitedly reported this to some of ccf s alberta leaders one of them telephoned brownlee to question whether coldwell s report was true brownlee adhered to a conservative view of how politics should be conducted and was perhaps put off by audacious telephone call despite an apology from coldwell brownlee did not indicate any further interest in running for ccf foster 1981 284 thumb left alt an unsmiling man with round rimmed glasses and greying hair sitting before a microphone with a bound book open in front of him brownlee in s occasional public comments on political issues still attracted considerable attention he spoke to 1944 ufa convention on post war reconstruction and expressed pessimism about canada s economic prospects he advocated a policy of full employment and emphasized that jobs had to be meaningful rather than put ting men to work building roads like coolies in china when machines can do it better he criticized government imposed wartime ceiling on wheat prices of 1 25 per bushel as forcing farmers to shoulder an unfair burden of a national crisis as they had during depression foster 1981 285 personal life brownlee s father had died in january 1934 while macmillan suit was still pending foster 1981 288 in april 1941 his mother died intestate and left an estate of 1 507 brownlee relinquished any claim on estate in

to widen memorial drive where brownlees lived several residents expressed concern that plan would destroy street s trees they consulted brownlee who telephoned mayor and saved trees foster 1981 306 in his last years brownlee received a number of honours premier of manitoba duff inducted him into province s order of buffalo hunt in november 1960 in recognition of his contributions to prairie provinces ufa awarded him an honorary life membership and prime minister john diefenbaker appointed him to national productivity council though ill health prevented him from participating after its inaugural march 1961 meeting foster 1981 311 312 beginning in june 1957 brownlee underwent a series of major surgeries foster 1981 305 by this time his memory was failing and he often had to ask his wife for details that escaped him he died july 15 1961 two weeks after resigning from ugg board and barely three after resigning as president foster 1981 312 legacy as premier brownlee is most remembered for sex scandal that ended his career his accomplishments are largely forgotten still he is highly regarded by historians foster calls him alberta s greatest premier and cites in particular
