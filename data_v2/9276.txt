wanted to create and wanted to avoid mistakes of his earlier business simulation game entrepreneur he wanted to create a business simulation game and make it fun so that people would want to play it in an interview he explained that primary reason he created theme park was because he wanted players to create their dream theme park another reason is he wanted players to understand kind of work running one entails three difficulty settings enable players to choose desired depth simply having fun creating a theme park or making all business decisions too molyneux stated that most difficult part to program was visitors behaviour ultimate book p 140 story was originally to have player play role of a nephew who had inherited a fortune from his aunt to be spent only on world s largest and most profitable theme park graphics were drawn and modelled using 3d studio molyneux stated that each person takes about 200 bytes of memory enough for them to have their own personality team travelled world visiting theme parks and taking notes and sound effects were sampled from real parks molyneux explained that they were going for as much realism as possible there was to be a feature where a microphone is placed on a visitor and so player could hear what they were saying and multiplayer support was dropped two weeks prior to release because of a deadline multiplayer mode would have let players send thugs to other parks theme park took roughly a year and a half to develop much of code was used in theme hospital and an animation editor was improved by theme hospitals designer and producer mark webley who dubbed it complex engine artist gary carr did not think game was a good idea and disliked art style molyneux wanted him to create a colourful style to appeal to a japanese market but carr disagreed and left bullfrog carr later retracted his beliefs and in 2012 stated that he considered game a classic in 1994 molyneux was developing both theme park and magic carpet game

japanese playstation version sold 85 thousand copies within weeks as well as europe theme park did not sell well in united states molyneux hypothesised that this was because graphics are too childish

some liked graphics and gameplay four reviewers of electronic gaming monthly commented that game itself is great fun but that jaguar conversion had confusing menus and dithered text which is excessively difficult to read gamepro echoed these criticisms and further stated that jaguar version suffers from frustrating slowdown they summarised that ocean didn t work hard enough to make theme park look and sound good on jaguar a reviewer for next generation took reverse position saying that jaguar conversion is seamless and game itself was mediocre their elaboration was that slow gameplay and confusing layouts keep it from ever achieving addictiveness of other god games and most players will find themselves bored before they ve even run through all of options german magazine atari insides reviewer complimented addictiveness but lack of save opportunities was criticised and a reviewer from st computer believed game s complexity and colourful graphics assured it of being long and attractive mega main criticism of jaguar version was its inability to save in game saturn version was noted as being mostly faithful to pc original sam hickman of sega saturn magazine praised it for

entertainers as major improvements over that version a next generation critic lauded game s simple interface infectious gameplay and realistic business fundamentals but felt saturn s near perfect
