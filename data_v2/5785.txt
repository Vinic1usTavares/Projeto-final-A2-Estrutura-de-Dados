writers simply amplified this special effects crew undertook much preparation to simulate a chase sequence involving an exploding transformer leading guest actor ebon moss bachrach to note how scary

scott has been running his own pattern related investigations phillip broyles lance reddick hands olivia some of scott s personal effects among them she finds an engagement ring proving scott s claim to have loved her production power hungry was written by consulting producer jason cahill and playwright julia cho each of which would go on to write other first season episodes christopher misiano directed installment according to fringe co creator roberto orci series writers often approached episodes fringe cases by coming up with an idea and then asking science consultants to justify it scientifically for power hungry cho and others brainstormed concept of a computer virus being able to spread to humans she explained and through kneading that idea over and over again we came up with idea of a character joseph who would start waking up to this power of his to be able to actually control electronic or computer driven devices new media consultant and scientist glen whitman who later co wrote some fringe episodes noted that science depicted in episode was not totally impossible it is true that human beings as a result of electrical activity in our brains we do all have a very very weak magnetic field around our heads he said and that s in part what is sensed by an eeg so notion was how can you amplify that chase scene involving joseph and olivia required much preparation as crew had to simulate an exploding transformer special effects coordinator conrad brink used a mechanical trip to support an electrical cable which he then strung to other side of adjacent road using a pole crew filled fuse box with sparking devices meant to give appearance of an exploding transformer and power lines demonstrating this brink noted what happens is panel cover will blow off sparks will come out cable will go up sparking down to ground misiano said of sequence this young man runs by an electrical box and it blows up it really blew director added that guest actor ebon moss bachrach later told him that was actually really scary to film after he filmed his character hitting joseph with a crow bar actor joshua jackson joked finally i m going to get a little respect on this set mark valley returns as john scott actor stated that despite character s death in pilot i m going to be showing up in first season and for a guy who died in pilot i consider myself pretty fortunate actors who guest star in episode include ebon moss bachrach as joseph meegar max baker as jacob fischer and marylouise burke as flora meegar first season dvd contains a deleted scene of olivia and peter picking up homing pigeons from a friend of his named tony tony quietly mentions to peter that his sister could use peter s help but when asked peter refuses to tell olivia more of story

rated episode 6 8 10 stating that although it was perfectly serviceable professionally produced television it was much like last week with a little bit of been there done that conspiracy stuff thrown on top of it and that plot was almost boilerplate for this genre by this point in series reviewer believed that thing about fringe that is holding it back is that you re always ahead of it show needs to change things up bryant l griffin of airlock alpha opined though not show s best hour to date power hungry is still a solid entry good directing writing and outstanding production values are maintained as series norm in addition griffin enjoyed fischer s casual surrender as in past those associated with pattern exhibited a fevered desire to avoid capture going as far as committing suicide what s this guy s deal he obviously has a plan however reviewer was skeptical as to why astrid was comfortable working with walter again considering he subdued her in previous episode los angeles times reviewer patrick kevin day stated that at this point in series he initially fretted that fringe would never grow beyond a run of mill x files knock off but now saw creators intentions sarah stegall of sfscope called episode an homage to x files episode d p o whose featured character has a similar premise to meegar stegall admitted that this show is growing on me with same atmosphere as x files coupled with a slightly better grounding in actual science erin dougherty of cinema blend reacted positively towards episode commending it as it bounced back so quickly from that lame silver cylinder episode or they would ve lost me forever dougherty also felt that three protagonists olivia walter and peter are becoming much more believable characters noel murray of a v club rated episode a b opining that cold open was series best since pilot but added that despite added freak of week sympathy power hungry promptly peters out because level of oddity required for walter and pattern team to track freak down isn t especially high murray added that return of scott and his scenes with olivia serves to string along home viewer inviting us to question whether olivia s playing for right
