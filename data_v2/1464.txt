flight 19 was designation of a group of five grumman tbm avenger torpedo bombers that disappeared over bermuda triangle on december 5 1945 after losing contact during a united states navy overwater navigation training flight from naval air station fort lauderdale florida all 14 airmen on flight were lost as were all 13 crew members of a martin pbm mariner flying boat that subsequently launched from naval air station banana river to search for flight 19 pbm aircraft was known to accumulate flammable gasoline vapors in its bilges and professional investigators have assumed that pbm most likely exploded in mid air while searching for flight navy investigators could not determine exact cause of loss of flight 19 navigation training flight flight 19 undertook a routine navigation and combat training exercise in tbm type aircraft assignment was called navigation problem no 1 a combination of bombing and navigation which other flights had completed or were scheduled to undertake that day flight leader was united states navy lieutenant charles carroll taylor who had about 2 500 flying hours mostly in aircraft of this type while his trainee pilots each had 300 total and 60 flight hours in avenger taylor had completed a combat tour in pacific theatre as torpedo bomber pilot on aircraft carrier and had recently arrived from nas miami where he had also been a vtb instructor student pilots had recently completed other training missions in area where flight was to take place they were u s marine captains edward joseph powers and george william stivers u s marine second lieutenant forrest james gerber and usn ensign joseph tipton bossi their started with fox tare aircraft were four tbm buno ft3 buno buno buno and one tbm 3 buno each was fully fueled and during pre flight checks it was discovered they were all missing clocks navigation of route was intended to teach dead reckoning principles which involved calculating among other things elapsed time apparent lack of timekeeping equipment was not a cause for concern as it was assumed each man had his own watch takeoff was scheduled for 13 45 local time but late arrival of taylor delayed departure until 14 10 weather at nas fort lauderdale was described as favorable sea state moderate to rough taylor was supervising mission and a trainee pilot had role of leader out front called naval air station fort lauderdale florida navigation problem no 1 exercise involved three different legs but actual flight should have flown four after take off they flew on heading 091deg almost due east for until reaching hen and chickens shoals where low level bombing practice was carried out flight was to continue on that heading for another before turning onto a course of 346deg for in process over flying grand bahama island next scheduled turn was to a heading of 241deg to fly at end of which exercise was completed and avengers would turn left to then return to nas ft lauderdale right 300px thumb flight 19 s scheduled navigation exercise on december 5 1945 1 leave nas fort lauderdale 14 10 on heading 091deg drop bombs at hen and chickens shoals b until about 15 00 then continue on heading 091deg for 2 turn left to heading 346deg and fly 3 turn left to heading 241deg for to end exercise north of nas fort lauderdale 4 17 50 radio triangulation establishes flight s position to within of and their last reported course 270deg 5 pbm mariner leaves nas banana river 19 27 6 19 50 mariner explodes near radio conversations between pilots were overheard by base and other aircraft in area practice bombing operation is known to have been carried out because at about 15 00 a pilot requested and was given permission to drop his last bomb forty minutes later another flight instructor lieutenant robert f cox in ft 74 forming up with his group of students for same mission received an unidentified transmission an unidentified crew member asked powers one of students for his compass reading powers replied i don t know where we are we must have got lost after that last turn cox then transmitted this is ft 74 plane or boat calling powers please identify yourself so someone can help you response after a few moments was a request from others in flight for suggestions ft 74 tried again and a man identified as ft 28 taylor came on ft 28 this is ft 74 what is your trouble both of my compasses are out taylor replied and i am trying to find fort lauderdale florida i am over land but it s broken i am sure i m in keys but i don t know how far down and i don t know how to get to fort lauderdale ft 74 informed nas that aircraft were lost then advised taylor to put sun on his port wing and fly north up coast to fort lauderdale base operations then asked if flight leader s aircraft was equipped with a standard yg iff transmitter which could be used to triangulate flight s position but message was not acknowledged by ft 28 later he would indicate that his transmitter was activated instead at 16 45 ft 28 radioed we are heading 030 degrees for 45 minutes then we will fly north to make sure we are not over gulf of mexico during this time no bearings could be made on flight and iff could not be picked up taylor was told to broadcast on 4805 khz this order was not acknowledged so he was asked to switch to 3000 khz search and rescue frequency taylor replied i cannot switch frequencies i must keep my planes intact at 16 56 taylor was again asked to turn on his transmitter for yg if he had one he did not acknowledge but a few minutes later advised his flight change course to 090 degrees due east for 10 minutes about same time someone in flight said dammit if we could just fly west we would get home head west dammit this difference of opinion later led to questions about why students did not simply head west on their own it has been explained that this can be attributed to military discipline as weather deteriorated radio contact became intermittent and it was believed that five aircraft by this point were more than out to sea east of florida peninsula taylor radioed we ll fly 270 degrees west until landfall or running out of gas and requested a weather check at 17 24 by 17 50 several land based radio stations had triangulated flight 19 s position as being within a radius of flight 19 was north of bahamas and well off coast of central florida but nobody transmitted this information on an open repetitive basis at 18 04 taylor radioed to his flight holding 270 we didn t fly far enough east we may as well just turn around and fly east again by that time weather had deteriorated even more and sun had since set around 18 20 taylor s last message was received it has also been reported that taylor s last message was received at 19 04 he was heard saying all planes close up tight we ll have to ditch unless landfall when first plane drops below 10 gallons we all go down together pbm 5 bureau number 59225 as it became obvious flight was lost air bases aircraft and merchant ships were alerted a consolidated pby catalina departed after 18 00 to search for flight 19 and guide them back if they could be located after dark two martin pbm mariner flying boats originally scheduled for their own training flights were diverted to perform square pattern searches in area west of us navy squadron training no 49 pbm 5 buno 59225 took off at 19 27 from naval air station banana river now patrick air force base called in a routine radio message at 19 30 and was never heard from again at 21 15 tanker ss gaines mills reported it had observed flames from an apparent explosion leaping high and burning for 10 minutes at position captain stanley reported unsuccessfully searching for survivors through a pool of oil and aviation gasoline escort carrier also reported losing radar contact with an aircraft at same position and time investigation a 500 page navy board of investigation report published a few months later made several observations flight leader lt charles c taylor had mistakenly believed that small islands he passed over were florida keys that his flight was over gulf of mexico and that heading northeast would take them to florida it was determined that taylor had passed over bahamas as scheduled and he did in fact lead his flight to northeast over atlantic report noted that some subordinate officers did likely know their approximate position as indicated by radio transmissions stating that flying west would result in reaching mainland taylor was not at fault because compasses stopped working loss of pbm 5 buno 59225 was attributed to an explosion this report was subsequently amended cause unknown by navy after taylor s mother contended that navy was unfairly blaming her son for loss of five aircraft and 14 men when navy had neither bodies nor airplanes as evidence had flight 19 actually been where taylor believed it to be flight would have made landfall with florida coastline within 20 minutes depending on how far down they were however a later reconstruction of incident showed that islands visible to taylor were probably bahamas well northeast of keys and that flight 19 was exactly where it should have been board of investigation found that because of his belief that he was on a base course toward florida taylor actually guided flight farther northeast and out to sea further it was general knowledge at nas fort lauderdale that if a pilot ever became lost in area to fly a heading of 270deg west or in evening hours toward sunset if compass had failed by time flight actually turned west they were likely so far out to sea they had already passed their aircraft s fuel endurance this factor combined with bad weather and ditching characteristics of avenger meant that there was little hope of rescue even if they had managed to stay afloat it is possible that taylor overshot castaway cay and instead reached another land mass in southern abaco island he then proceeded northwest as planned he fully expected to find grand bahama island lying in front of him as expected instead he eventually saw a land mass to his right side northern part of abaco island believing that this landmass to his right was grand bahama island and his compass was malfunctioning he set a course to what he thought was southwest to head straight back to fort lauderdale however in reality this changed his course farther northwest toward open ocean to further add to his confusion he encountered a series of islands north of abaco island which looks very similar to key west islands control tower then suggested that taylor s team should fly west which would have taken them to landmass of florida eventually taylor headed for what he thought was west but in reality was northwest almost parallel to florida after trying that for a while and with no land in sight taylor decided that it was impossible for them to fly so far west and not reach florida he believed that he might have been near key west islands what followed was a series of serious conversations between taylor his team and control tower taylor was not sure whether he was near bahama or key west and he was not sure which direction was which due to compass malfunction control tower informed taylor that he could not be in key west since wind that day did not blow that way some of his teammates believed that their compass was working taylor then set a course northeast according to their compass which should take them to florida if they were in key west when that failed taylor set a course west according to their compass which should take them to florida if they were in bahama if taylor stayed this course he would have reached land before running out of fuel however at some point taylor decided that he had tried going west enough he then once again set a course northeast thinking they were near key west after all finally his flight ran out of fuel and may have crashed into ocean somewhere north of abaco island and east

retrieved by navy in mid 1960s near sebastian florida navy initially said it was from flight 19 but later recanted its statement despite freedom of information act requests for details in 2013 names
