neill s aphoristic and anecdotal account of his famous early progressive school experiment in england founded in 1920s summerhill school book s intent is to demonstrate origins and effects of

parents problems and questions and answers school is run as a democracy with students deciding affairs that range from curriculum to behavior code lessons are non compulsory neill emphasizes self regulation personal responsibility freedom from fear freedom in sex play and loving understanding over moral instruction or force in his philosophy all attempts to mold children are coercive in nature and therefore harmful caretakers are advised to trust in natural process and let children self regulate such that they live by their own rules and consequently treat with highest respect rights of others to live by their own rules neill s self regulation constitutes a child s right to live freely without outside authority in things psychic and somatic that children eat and come of age when they wants are never hit and are always loved and protected children can do as they please until their actions affect others in an example a student can skip french class to play music but cannot disruptively play music during french class against popular image of go as you please schools summerhill has many rules however they are decided at a schoolwide meeting where students and teachers each have one vote apiece this does not necessarily mean total cessation to children as neill thought adults were right to bemoan child destruction of property he considered this tension between adult and child living styles to be natural neill felt that most schoolwork and books kept children from their right to play and that learning should only follow play and not be mixed to make work palatable

eloquence of a biblical prophet with a belief in children and unyielding attack against pathological and phony values in education that one cannot help admiring willard w hartup contemporary

against teaching algebra to eventual repairmen was most shameful sentence ever written by an educational pioneer hartup contemporary psychology and harding new statesman saw no evidence towards whether summerhill students were successful by standards other than neill s particularly in academic distinction saturday review quoted from british inspectors report that school was unimpressive despite laudatory student will and interest their achievements are rather meager mead presaged that summerhill could create uncritical behavior among parents unfamiliar with pedagogical field and that book s essential positive contribution belief in child self regulation could be forgotten within book s radicalism john vaizey spectator spotlighted book s emphasis on innate goodness of children and how progressive school movement s emphasis on freedom had spread into public schools vaizey put neill s summerhill in a disappearing lineage of post world war i experimental schools that focused on freedom from directed games classics curriculum and prudery he wrote in 1962 that summerhill is clearly one of england s greatest schools and that decline of this experimental school tradition was a tragedy still deutsch journal of individual psychology wrote that summerhill had not been duplicated in four decades since its creation booklist noted neill s scant credit awarded to prior progressive
