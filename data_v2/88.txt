chachani is a volcanic complex in southern peru northwest of city of arequipa part of central volcanic zone of andes it is above sea level it consists of several lava domes and individual volcanoes such as nocarane along with lava shields such as airport domes underneath chachani lies a caldera during pliocene and early pleistocene volcanic complex produced large ignimbrites such as la joya arequipa airport and yura tuff ignimbrites afterwards volcanic complex proper grew in caldera until about 56 500 years ago there have not been any eruptions during historical time but volcano is considered to be only dormant and due to its closeness to city of arequipa is considered high risk name name means brave in aymara or mountain of man mountain of male alternative spellings and are also known geography and geomorphology volcano lies in andes of southern peru northwest of arequipa and north of arequipa airport city of arequipa is situated on foot of chachani and el misti volcanoes road from arequipa to chivay runs along southeastern foot of chachani and a dirt road reaches to an elevation of it is considered to be one of most easily climbed mountains between 6 000 7 000 m high although acclimatization and good physical health are required to ascend it volcanoes in southern part of peru include from north to south firura coropuna andagua volcanic field sabancaya ampato chachani el misti pichu pichu ubinas which has erupted intermittently since 1954 huaynaputina where a large eruption occurred in 1600 ticsani tutupaca yucamane and casiri some of these volcanoes are among highest in world and on average there is one eruption of a peruvian volcano every 13 years peruvian volcanoes are part of central volcanic zone of andes one of three separate volcanic belts in that mountain chain central volcanic zone contains 44 named stratovolcanoes chachani is an about high and wide complex of lava domes stratovolcanoes and volcanic cones highest summit is high making chachani 84th highest peak in andes chachani complex has an arcuate shape encompassing both main chachani volcano and high nocarane to north of chachani while high la horqueta together with el rodado to its west and chachani proper to its east forms an east west trending ridge la horqueta has a young appearance and resembles an ash cone with a crater additional peaks are northerly high los angeles and southeasterly high trigo right 400px colorado lava domes which are also known as cerro in turn are located northwest from nocarane to south of chachani lie airport domes a wide lava shield with two discernible vents and a pristine appearance lava shield consists of overlapping lava flows with a wavy and rugose texture and a steep front which reaches heights of evidently these were formed by viscous lava flows a volcanic caldera associated with widespread ignimbrites in arequipa area may be located underneath chachani to north its outline is marked by a wide amphitheatre while its southern part is continuous with arequipa depression and is generally poorly recognizable el misti volcano later arose on margin of chachani caldera where it intersects border of altiplano volcanic complex is formed mainly by aa and block lava flows that rarely reach lengths of about additionally pyroclastic flows and tephra occur volcanic complex covers an area of about and has a present day volume of about this makes chachani one of largest volcanoes of andes glacial erosion and landslides have affected volcanic complex forming cirques and u shaped valleys and removing much of original shape of individual volcanoes some moraines have been overrun by lava flows chachani drains into rio chili quebrada quebrada cabreria and quebrada drain south to eastward into river which flows around southeastern side of chachani and has cut a canyon between chachani and el misti rio one of its tributaries runs along eastern side of chachani rio yura flows southward along western side of chachani and upon reaching then westward flowing rio chili becomes rio vitor which eventually discharges into pacific ocean together with rio siguas glaciation volcano underwent five stages of glaciation in past during last glacial maximum extensive glaciers formed well developed moraines at elevation lateral moraines marking limit of glaciation are located at elevation on southern flank glaciers may have also formed during little ice age where there are moraines at elevation presently however mountain lacks glaciers and only has a snowfield in general glaciers in tropical andes have been shrinking after end of little ice age and especially after 1970s permafrost and rock glaciers however still exist at chachani especially close to nocarane and reach lengths of they are characterized by lobate appearances and their location at foot of tall cliffs some of them about six in total are still active and are located above elevation while lowest inactive ones end at elevation other periglacial phenomena such as needle ice are also encountered on volcanic complex geology subduction of nazca plate beneath south america plate occurs at a rate of subduction process is responsible for volcanism and earthquake activity of region in andes volcanism is distributed between three volcanic belts northern volcanic zone central volcanic zone and southern volcanic zone which coincide with segments where downgoing nazca plate falls steeply into mantle volcanic activity in chachani region appears to have begun during cretaceous paleocene in form of toquepala volcanics oldest volcanic rocks of western cordillera are known under name tacaza and underwent erosion and folding before next phase which is known as sillapaca finally during miocene quaternary sencca formation and barroso volcanics developed chachani is classified as part of barroso volcanics although oldest volcanism might belong to sillapaca unit terrain of volcano is formed by volcanic rocks of eocene to recent age which overlie a precambrian basement and include widespread neogene quaternary ignimbrites chachani straddles margin between higher elevation altiplano and arequipa basin at lower altitude younger el misti volcano lies southeast of chachani across rio chili other volcanoes in region are ampato and northwest and nevado north east and pichu pichu southeast from chachani of these misti pichu pichu and chachani are aligned on normal faults that trend northwest southeast and has been active during holocene chachani has erupted andesite and dacite which define a potassium rich calc alkaline suite with unusual adakite characteristics adakites are magmas that form when downgoing plate in a subduction setting melts phenocrysts include augite biotite hornblende and hypersthene rhyolites of arequipa ignimbrites additionally contain ilmenite magnetite plagioclase quartz and sanidine composition of volcanic rocks has varied over lifespan of chachani sometimes rocks of basaltic andesite composition were erupted as well while younger volcanoes are usually more homogeneous climate and vegetation under influence of cold humboldt current and subtropical ridge region features an arid climate with less than annual precipitation in arequipa zero degree elevation at chachani lies at about diurnal temperature range is large and can reach while ground temperatures are much more stable and higher than air temperatures from elevation cacti herbs peruvian feather grass yareta but also lichens and mosses grow on slopes of chachani and other regional volcanoes vegetation is scarce to absent above elevation and much of its lower slopes were stripped of their vegetation during colonial era dry soils are not suitable for agriculture part of volcano is in salinas y aguada blanca national reserve eruption history oldest volcanic formations linked to chachani are so called which are rhyolitic pyroclastic flows ignimbrites containing pumice beds these ignimbrites include la joya ignimbrite of pliocene age plio quaternary arequipa airport ignimbrite and quaternary yura tuff and capillune formation 4 8 million years old la joya 1 65 million years old arequipa airport and less certainly early pleistocene yura tuff as well as capillune formation ignimbrites appear to have been erupted by chachani or in case of yura tuff from a vent north of it together with lava flows these form pre chachani units and probably are largest eruptions experienced by chachani they occur in wider region of chachani and crop out in arequipa area and in river valleys their emplacement took place in form of fast moving hot streams of rock an additional ignimbrite is 13 million years old miocene rio chili ignimbrite vents of miocene units are unknown and rio chili ignimbrite appears to be related to huaylillas ignimbrite of southern peru later during quaternary chachani volcanic complex grew in caldera older activity formed older volcanoes northeast east and nocarane north of chachani as well as colorado lava domes north northwest from nocarane and volcanoes chachani base and el angel argon argon dating has yielded ages ranging between 1 000 000 500 000 years ago for these volcanoes later volcanoes el rodado la horqueta and chachani 130 000 131 000 years ago formed as an west east alignment along with lava field about 230 000 280 000 years ago far west from chachani airport domes south between 290 000 400 000 years ago cabreria lava domes south southeast and dome northeast from chachani youngest reported date of 56 500 31 600 years ago has been obtained on cabreria lava domes formerly airport domes los angeles pampa de palacio were considered to be youngest and of holocene age however a post glacial lava flow descends western slope of chachani between chachani and nocarane no historical eruptions are known at volcanic complex and date of last activity is likewise unclear existence of solfataras in summit region and of hot springs at socosani and yura has been reported and frequent seismic activity occurs on chachani s southwestern flank this activity may relate to either geothermal or tectonic phenomena currently volcano is considered to be dormant hazards 400px right city of arequipa with about one million inhabitants and infrastructure such as airport hydropower plants and reservoirs are within range of chachani western suburbs of arequipa are below and less than away from volcano and in case of renewed eruptions they would be threatened by pyroclastic flows in addition melting ice and snow on summit could generate mudflows and lava flows and tephra falls are additional hazards chachani is considered to be a high risk volcano and geophysical institute of peru in 2018 installed a monitoring station on chachani religious importance and archeology chachani is protector mountain spirit of people of arequipa sometimes refer to chachani as father of el misti pichu pichu is mother and ascribed to it ability to influence gender of newborn children making them daughters inca worshipped chachani and its neighbouring mountains and turned its summit into a mountain sanctuary that was later destroyed by sulfur mining and plundering to point that no trace of archeological sites can be found such as e g walls nevertheless evidence of inka human sacrifice known as was found during archeological expeditions mining chachani was reportedly mined for sulfur during colonial era and for white rocks that were used in construction of famous buildings of colonial era arequipa which is
