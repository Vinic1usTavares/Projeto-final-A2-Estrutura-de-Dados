she assisted survivors of great kanto earthquake yamashiro was modernized between 1930 and 1935 with improvements to her armor and machinery and a rebuilt superstructure in pagoda mast style nevertheless with only 14 inch guns she was outclassed by other japanese battleships at beginning of world war ii and played auxiliary roles for most of war by 1944 though she was forced into front line duty serving as flagship of vice admiral shoji nishimura s southern force at battle of surigao strait southernmost action of battle of leyte gulf during fierce night fighting in early hours of 25 october against a superior american force yamashiro was sunk by torpedoes and naval gunfire nishimura went down with his ship and only 10 crewmembers survived description ship had a length of between

superstructure was rebuilt to accommodate mounts for anti aircraft aa guns and additional fire control directors yamashiro was also given torpedo bulges to improve her underwater protection and to compensate for weight of additional armor in addition her stern was lengthened by these changes increased her overall length to her beam to and her draft to her displacement increased nearly to at deep load propulsion ship had two sets of brown curtis direct drive steam turbines each of which drove two propeller shafts turbines were designed to produce a total of using steam provided by 24 miyahara type water tube boilers each of which consumed a mixture of coal and oil yamashiro had a stowage capacity of of coal and of fuel oil skulski p 17 giving her a range of at a speed of ship exceeded her designed speed of during her sea trials reaching at jentschura jung and mickel pp 25 26 during her modernization miyahara boilers were replaced by six new kanpon oil fired boilers fitted in former aft boiler room and forward funnel was removed brown curtis turbines were replaced by four geared kanpon turbines with a designed output of on her trials yamashiros sister ship fuso reached a top speed of from fuel storage of ship was increased to a total of of fuel oil that gave her a range of at a speed of armament twelve 45 calibre 14 inch guns of yamashiro were mounted in six twin gun turrets numbered one through six from front to rear each with an elevation range of 5 to 30 degrees skulski p 18 turrets were arranged in an unorthodox 2 1 1 2 style with superfiring pairs of turrets fore and aft middle turrets were not superfiring and had a funnel between them main guns and their turrets were modernized during ship s 1930 reconstruction maximum elevation of main guns was increased to 43 degrees increasing their maximum range from initially guns could fire at a rate of 1 5 rounds per minute and this was also improved during her first modernization skulski p 18 originally yamashiro was fitted with a secondary armament of sixteen 50 caliber 6 inch guns mounted in casemates on upper sides of hull each gun could fire a high explosive projectile to a maximum range of skulski p 20 at up to six shots per minute campbell p 189 she was later fitted with six high angle 40 caliber three inch aa guns in single mounts on both sides of forward superstructure and

four twin gun mounts skulski p 21 when firing at surface targets guns had a range of they had a maximum ceiling of at their maximum elevation of 90 degrees their maximum rate of fire was 14 rounds a minute but their sustained rate of fire was around eight rounds per minute campbell pp 192 93 improvements made during reconstruction increased yamashiros draft by two foremost six inch guns were removed as same guns on her sister ship had gotten soaked in high seas after that ship s reconstruction ship s light aa armament was augmented by eight 25 mm type 96 light aa guns in twin gun mounts four of these mounts were fitted on forward superstructure one on each side of funnel and two on rear superstructure this was standard japanese light aa gun during world war ii but it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it a largely ineffective weapon according to historian mark stille twin and triple mounts lacked sufficient speed in train or elevation gun sights were unable to handle fast targets gun exhibited excessive vibration magazine was too small and finally gun produced excessive muzzle blast stille p 11 configuration of aa guns varied significantly over time in 1943 17 single and two twin mounts were added for a total of 37 stille p 23 in july 1944 ship was fitted with another 17 single 15 twin and eight triple mounts for a total of 92 anti aircraft guns in her final configuration gun had an effective range of and an effective ceiling of at an elevation of 85 degrees maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute because of frequent need to change fifteen round magazines campbell p 200 also in july 1944 ship was provided with three twin gun and 10 single mounts for license built 13 2 mm hotchkiss machine gun maximum range of these guns was but effective range against aircraft was only cyclic rate was adjustable between 425 and 475 rounds per minute but need to change 30 round magazines reduced effective rate to 250 rounds per minute skulski pp 21 22 armor ship s waterline armor belt was thick below it was a strake of armor deck armor ranged in thickness from turrets were protected with an armor thickness of
