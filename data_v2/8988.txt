decrypts by british intelligence while activities of police regiment south einsatzgruppen detachment and 1st ss brigade progressed reports by murder squads were being intercepted and decoded by mi6 british intelligence service as part of ultra a british signals intelligence program codebreaking facilities at bletchley park decoded and analysed messages head of mi6 stewart menzies communicated decrypts directly to british prime minister winston churchill first message decrypted was 18july report on mass murders by police regiment centre of over 1 100 jews at slonim in army group centre rear area in late july and early august similar reports were intercepted on a regular basis first messages mentioning murders by police regiment south were intercepted on with police battalion314 reporting executions of 367 jews south east of kiev apparently angered by scope of atrocities churchill delivered a speech over radio on where he stated whole districts are being exterminated scores of thousands of executions are perpetrated by german police troops upon soviet patriots defending their native soil since mongol invasion of europe there have never been methodical merciless butchery on such a scale or approaching such a scale we are in presence of a crime without a name starting on 27august bletchley park delivered specially prepared intelligence reports on activities of police troops by this point british intelligence had detailed information on activities of police troops in both army group south and army group centre rear areas on order police changed their cipher following day ss officials were instructed to stop transmitting their reports over radio aftermath order police as a whole had not been declared a criminal organisation by allies unlike ss its members were able to reintegrate into german society largely unmolested with many returning to police careers in austria and west germany members of police battalion 314 were investigated by austrian authorities with at least two former members providing testimony on mass killings of jews one former member testified that killing method changed from using sidearms and carbines to machine guns since former was deemed too tedious for reasons of national security ultra program remained classified after war and decrypts pertaining to activities of security and police troops during war were not shared with britain s allies consequently they were not used during nuremberg trials or subsequent investigations of german war crimes and crimes against humanity decrypts were finally released in
