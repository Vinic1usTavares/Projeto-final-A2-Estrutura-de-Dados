times andros served as governor of provinces of new york east and west jersey virginia and maryland before his service in north america he served as bailiff of guernsey his tenure in new england was authoritarian and turbulent as his views were decidedly pro anglican a negative quality in a region home to many puritans his actions in new england resulted in his overthrow during 1689 boston revolt he became governor of virginia three years later andros was considered to have been a more effective governor in new york and virginia although he became enemy of prominent figures in both colonies many of whom worked to remove him from office despite these enmities he managed to negotiate several treaties of covenant chain with iroquois establishing a long lived peace involving colonies and other tribes that interacted with that confederacy his actions and governance generally followed instructions he was given upon appointment to office and he received approbation from monarchs and governments that appointed him andros was recalled to england from virginia in 1698 and resumed title of bailiff of guernsey although he no longer resided entirely on guernsey he was appointed lieutenant governor of island and served in this position for four years andros died in 1714 early life andros was born in london on 6 december 1637 andros his father was bailiff of guernsey and a staunch supporter of charles i his mother was elizabeth stone whose sister was a courtier to king s sister queen elizabeth of bohemia whitmore p vi although it has been claimed that andros was present at surrender in 1651 of guernsey s castle cornet last royalist stronghold to surrender in english civil war ferguson p 117 there is no firm evidence to support this it is possible that he fled guernsey with his mother in 1645 lustig p 26 in 1656 he was apprenticed to his uncle sir robert stone captain of a cavalry company andros then served in two winter campaigns in denmark including relief of copenhagen in 1659 as a result of these experiences he gained fluency in french swedish and dutch lustig p 29 he remained a firm supporter of stuarts while they were in exile charles ii

1672 he was commissioned major governor of new york after his father died in 1674 andros acquired manor and was named to succeed him as bailiff of guernsey whitmore p xiii he was also appointed by duke of york to be first proprietary governor of province of new york province s territory included former territories of new netherland ceded to england by treaty of westminster including all of present day new jersey dutch holdings on hudson river from new amsterdam renamed new york city to albany as well as long island martha s vineyard and nantucket in 1664 charles ii had granted james all of this territory as well as all of land in present day maine between kennebec and st croix rivers but with intervening dutch retaking of territory charles issued a new patent to james brodhead pp 261 262 265 andros arrived in new york harbor in late october and negotiated handover of dutch territories with local representatives and dutch governor anthony which took place on 10 november 1674 andros agreed to confirm existing property holdings and to allow dutch inhabitants of territory to maintain their protestant religion brodhead pp 270 271 connecticut boundary dispute andros was also involved in boundary disputes with neighboring connecticut colony dutch claims had originally extended as far east as connecticut river but these claims had been ceded in 1650 treaty of hartford and reduced to a boundary line east of hudson in 1664 york s territorial claim did not acknowledge these and andros announced to connecticut authorities his intentions to reclaim that territory which included connecticut capital hartford in early 1675 connecticut leaders pointed out later revisions to connecticut s boundaries but andros pressed his claim arguing that those revisions had been superseded by york s grant brodhead p 280 andros used outbreak of king philip s war in july 1675 as an excuse to go by ship to connecticut with a small military force to establish duke s claim brodhead p 284 when he arrived at saybrook at mouth of river on 8 july he found fort there occupied by connecticut militia who were flying english flag fiske p 48 andros came ashore had a brief conversation with fort commander read his commission and returned to new york city fiske p 49 this was full extent of andros attempt to claim territory but it would be remembered in connecticut when later attempts were made to assert new york authority fiske p 218 king philip s war following his connecticut expedition andros traveled into iroquois country to establish relations there fiske pp 53 55 he was well received and agreed to continue dutch practice of supplying firearms to iroquois this action successfully blunted french diplomatic successes with iroquois it also led to charges in new england that andros provided arms to indians allied to king philip as wampanoag leader was known to english in fact andros provided gunpowder to rhode island that was used in great swamp fight against narragansetts in december 1675 and specifically outlawed sale of munitions to tribes known to be allied to philip fiske pp 57 58 charges poisoned atmosphere between andros and massachusetts leaders even though andros conduct met with approval in london brodhead p 291 125px thumb left upright a caricature of king philip was drawn by paul revere in meeting with iroquois andros was given name a name historically used by iroquois to refer to dutch governor in new netherland and continued when english took over colony and renamed it new york in same way french governor was dubbed fiske p 56 one other consequence was establishment at albany of a colonial department for indian affairs with robert livingston as its first head brodhead p 287 philip was known to be in berkshires in western massachusetts that winter and new englanders accused andros of sheltering him historian john fiske suggests that philip s purpose was not to draw iroquois into conflict but instead to draw mahicans into conflict with a view toward attacking albany an offer by andros to send new york troops into massachusetts to attack philip was rebuffed based on idea that it was covert ploy to again assert authority to connecticut river instead mohawks from albany area did battle with philip driving him eastward fiske pp 58 60 when connecticut authorities later appealed to andros for assistance andros replied that it was strange that they would do so considering their previous behavior and refused to help brodhead p 292 in july 1676 andros established a haven for mahicans and other indian war refugees at schaghticoke brodhead p 295 although conflict came to an end in southern new england in 1676 there continued to be friction between abenakis of northern new england and english settlers these prompted andros to send a force to duke s territory in maine where they established a fort at present day bristol andros annoyed massachusetts fishermen by restricting their use of duke s land for drying fish fiske pp 60 61 in november 1677 andros departed for england brodhead p 312 where he would spend next year during this visit he was knighted as a reward for his performance as governor fiske p 61 and he sat in on meetings of lords of trade in which agents for massachusetts bay defended its charter and gave detailed accounts of state of his colony brodhead p 316 southern border disputes southernmost territories of duke roughly encompassing northern delaware were desired by charles calvert baron baltimore who sought to extend reach of his proprietary province of maryland into area at same time calvert was seeking an end to a frontier war with iroquois to north having persuaded intervening susquehannocks to move to potomac river well within maryland territory furthermore lenape who dominated delaware bay were unhappy with seizures of their lands by virginia and maryland settlers and war between these groups had been imminent in 1673 when dutch retook new york when andros came to new york he moved to stabilize situation he befriended lenape sachems chiefs convincing them to act as mediators between english and other tribes jennings p 141 peace appeared to be imminent when bacon s rebellion broke out in virginia resulting in an attack on fort on potomac surviving susquehannocks sneaked out of fort one night some of them making their way east toward delaware bay in june 1676 andros offered in exchange for their moving into his jurisdiction to protect them from their enemies among virginian and maryland settlers he also extended an offer given by mohawk for susquehannocks to settle among them jennings p 149 these offers were well received but maryland authorities were unable to convince their indian allies to make peace offered by andros and organized them to march toward delaware which would also fulfil goal of strengthening maryland claim to area jennings pp 150 151 andros responded by urging susquehannocks to retreat into new york where they would be beyond maryland s reach and delivering a strongly worded threat to maryland that it would either have to acknowledge his sovereignty over susquehannocks or they would have to peaceably take them back he also offered his services as a mediator pointing out that absence of susquehannocks now left maryland settlements open to direct attack by iroquois jennings pp 152 153 in a council held at lenape village of site of present day philadelphia in february and march 1677 all of major parties met but no final agreements were reached and andros ordered susquehannocks remaining with lenape to disperse to other parts of new york in april jennings pp 155 156 maryland sent henry coursey to new york to engage andros and eventually iroquois in peace talks while at same time they sent surveyors to lay out plots on land also claimed by new york on delaware bay coursey was instructed to offer andros what was in essence a ps100 bribe that an indian peace might be reached in exchange for that land andros refused bribe and coursey ended up being compelled to negotiate further through andros and mohawk in albany jennings pp 157 158 peace agreed in negotiations that followed in albany in summer of 1677 is considered one of foundations of set of alliances and treaties called covenant chain jennings pp 158 162 although andros was unable to prevent baltimore from granting some land on delaware he did successfully blunt maryland leader s attempt to control an even greater portion of land lustig pp 93 97 duke eventually deeded those lands to william penn and they became part of state of delaware scarf pp 257 259 395 control of jerseys thumb left upright sir george carteret proprietor of east jersey governance of jerseys also created problems for andros james had awarded territory west of hudson river to proprietors john berkeley and george carteret and berkeley had then deeded western portion which became known as west jersey to a partnership of quakers brodhead p 266 berkeley had not transferred his proprietary rights to this group and exact nature of rights james had given both berkeley and carteret was disputed in part because james believed that second patent granted to him in 1674 overrode earlier grants he had made to berkeley and carteret brodhead pp 267 269 this resulted in conflict when andros attempted to extend his government over east jersey territory governed on behalf of carteret by latter s cousin philip fiske p 93 possibly based on orders given to him during his visit to england andros began to assert new york authority over east jersey after george carteret s death in 1680 lustig p 109 despite a friendly personal relationship between andros and governor carteret issue of governance eventually prompted andros to have carteret arrested in a dispute centering on collection of customs duties in ports on jersey side of hudson andros in 1680 sent a company of soldiers to philip carteret s home in elizabethtown according to carteret s account of incident he was beaten by troops who jailed him in new york fiske pp 94 95 in a trial over which andros presided carteret was acquitted by a jury on all charges brodhead p 334 carteret returned to new jersey but injuries he sustained in arrest affected his health and he died in 1682 fleming p 13 in aftermath of incident duke of york surrendered his claims to east jersey to fiske p 97 andros acquired in 1683 from widow of carteret for ps200 patent to lordship of alderney a less contentious standoff also occurred when settlers sent by william penn sought to establish what is now burlington new jersey andros insisted they had no right to settle there without duke s permission but agreed to allow their settlement after they agreed to receive commissions falling under authority of new york gubernatorial administration this situation was permanently resolved in 1680 when york renounced in favor of penn his remaining claims to west jersey fiske pp 142 147 recall and analysis political opponents of andros in colony brought a number of charges against him to duke of york among them were accusations of favoritism toward dutch businessmen and engaging in business for private gain rather than that of duke statements were also made to duke that claimed that his revenues were lower than they should have been this in addition to other complaints led duke to order andros back to england to explain situation andros left province in january 1681 charging anthony with administration of new york government expecting a short visit to england his wife remained in new york brodhead pp 343 345 during his time in new york he was thought to have demonstrated good administrative abilities but his manner was considered imperious by his opponents among colonists and he made numerous enemies during his tenure as governor lustig p 16 dominion of new england in 1686 he was appointed governor of dominion of new england he arrived in boston on 20 december 1686 and immediately assumed reins of power lustig p 141 his commission called for governance by himself with a council initial composition of council included representatives from each of colonies dominion absorbed but because of inconvenience of travel and fact that travel costs were not reimbursed council s quorums were dominated by representatives from massachusetts and plymouth sosin p 72 lords of trade had insisted that he govern without an assembly something he expressed concern over while his commission was being drafted sosin p 70 in a brief work sir edmund andros historian henry ferguson attested to fact that deliberation of certain policies by an assembly of legislators may have proven inefficient dominion initially consisted of territories of massachusetts bay colony including present day maine plymouth colony rhode island connecticut and new hampshire and was extended to include new york and east and west jersey in 1688 barnes pp 32 39 andros wife who had joined him in boston died there in 1688 not long after her arrival lustig p 160 church of england shortly after his arrival andros asked each of puritan churches in boston if its meetinghouse could be used for services of church of england when he was rebuffed he demanded and was given keys to samuel willard s third church in 1687 lustig p 164 services were held there under auspices of rev robert ratcliff until 1688 when king s chapel was built lustig p 165 these actions highlighted him as pro anglican in eyes of local puritans ferguson p 141 who would later accuse him of involvement in a horrid popish plot revenue laws his council engaged in a lengthy process to harmonize dominion and english laws this work consumed such a great amount of time that andros in march 1687 issued a proclamation stating that pre existing laws would remain in effect until they were revised since massachusetts had no pre existing tax laws a scheme of taxation was created that would apply to entire dominion developed by a committee of landowners first proposal derived its revenues from import duties principally alcohol after much debate a different proposal was abruptly proposed and adopted essentially reviving previous massachusetts tax laws these laws had been unpopular with farmers who felt taxes on livestock were too high to bring in immediate revenue andros also received approval to increase import duties on alcohol barnes pp 84 85 first attempts to enforce revenue laws were met with stiff resistance from a number of massachusetts communities several towns refused to choose commissioners to assess town population and estates and officials from a number of them were consequently arrested and brought to boston some were fined and released while others were imprisoned until they promised to perform their duties leaders of ipswich who had been most vocal in their opposition to law were tried and convicted of misdemeanor offenses lovejoy p 184 other provinces did not resist imposition of new law even though at least in rhode island rates were higher than they had been under previous colonial administration plymouth s relatively poor landowners were hard hit because of high rates on livestock and funds derived from whaling once sources of profit for individual towns were now directed to dominion government town meeting laws one consequence of tax protest was that andros sought to restrict town meetings since these were where that protest had begun he therefore introduced a law that limited meetings to a single annual meeting solely for purpose of electing officials and explicitly banning meetings at other times for any reason this loss of local power was widely hated many protests were made that town meeting and tax laws were violations of magna carta which guaranteed taxation by representatives of people it was noted that those who made these complaints had during colonial charter excluded large numbers of voters through requirement of church membership and then taxed them barnes p 97 land title reform andros had been instructed to bring colonial land title practices more in line with those in england and introduce quit rents as a means of raising colonial revenues barnes p 176 titles previously issued in massachusetts new hampshire and maine under colonial administration often suffered from defects of form for example lacking an imprint of colonial seal and most of them did not include a quit rent payment barnes p 182 land grants in colonial connecticut and rhode island had been made before either colony had a charter and there were conflicting claims in a number of areas barnes p 187 manner in which andros approached issue was necessarily divisive since it threatened any landowner whose title was in any way dubious some landowners went through confirmation process but many refused since they did not want to face possibility of losing their land and they viewed process as a thinly veiled land grab barnes p 189 puritans of plymouth and massachusetts some of whom had extensive landholdings were among latter barnes pp 189 193 since all of existing land titles in massachusetts had been granted under now vacated colonial charter andros essentially declared them to be void and required landowners to recertify their ownership paying fees to dominion and becoming subject to charging of a quit rent andros attempted to compel certification of ownership by issuing writs of intrusion a writ of intrusion could be issued to prevent unauthorized persons from entering land reverted from a deceased tenant for life to its owner but large landowners who owned many parcels contested these individually rather than all of their lands barnes pp 199 201 connecticut charter since andros commission included connecticut he asked connecticut governor robert treat to surrender colonial charter not long after his arrival in boston unlike rhode island whose officials readily acceded to dominion connecticut officials formally acknowledged andros authority but did little to assist him they continued to run their government according to charter holding quarterly meetings of legislature and electing colony wide officials while treat and andros negotiated over surrender of charter in october 1687 andros finally decided to travel to connecticut to personally see to matter accompanied by an honour guard he arrived in hartford on 31 october and met that evening with colonial leadership according to legend during this meeting charter was laid out on table for all to see lights in room unexpectedly went out and when relit charter had disappeared charter was said to have been hidden in a nearby oak tree referred to afterward as charter oak so that a search of nearby buildings would not locate document thumb right upright francis nicholson whatever truth of account connecticut records show that its government formally surrendered its seals and ceased operation that day andros then traveled throughout colony making judicial and other appointments before returning to boston palfrey pp 545 546 on 29 december 1687 dominion council formally extended its laws over connecticut completing assimilation of new england colonies palfrey p 548 inclusion of new york and jerseys on 7 may 1688 provinces of new york east jersey and west jersey were added to dominion because they were remote from boston where andros had his seat new york and jerseys were run by lieutenant governor francis nicholson from new york city nicholson an army captain and protege of colonial secretary william blathwayt came to boston in early 1687 as part of andros honor guard and had been promoted to his council dunn p 64 during summer of 1688 andros traveled first to new york and then to jerseys to establish his commission dominion governance of jerseys was complicated by fact that proprietors whose charters had been revoked had retained their property and petitioned andros for what were traditional manorial rights lovejoy p 211 dominion period in jerseys was relatively uneventful due to their distance from power centers and unexpected end of dominion in 1689 lovejoy pp 212 213 indian diplomacy in 1687 governor of new france marquis de denonville launched an attack against seneca villages in what is now western new york his objective was to disrupt trade between english at albany and iroquois confederation to which seneca belonged and to break covenant chain a peace andros had negotiated in 1677 while he was governor of new york lustig p 171 new york governor thomas dongan appealed for help and king james ordered andros to render assistance james also entered into negotiations with louis xiv of france which resulted in an easing of tensions on northwestern frontier lustig p 173 on new england s northeastern frontier however abenaki harbored grievances against english settlers and began an offensive in early 1688 andros made an expedition into maine early in year in which he raided a number of indian settlements he also raided trading outpost and home of jean vincent d de saint castin on penobscot bay his careful preservation of catholic castin s chapel would be a source of later accusations of popery against andros lustig p 174 thumb left andros a prisoner in boston as depicted in pioneers in settlement of america vol 1 by william a crafts 1876 when andros took over administration of new york in august 1688 he met with iroquois at albany to renew to covenant in this meeting he annoyed iroquois by referring to them as children implying subservience to english rather than brethren implying equality lustig p 176 he returned to boston amid further attacks on new england frontier by abenaki parties who admitted that they were doing so in part because of french encouragement during andros s presence in new york situation in maine had deteriorated again as well with english colonists raiding indian villages and taking prisoners these actions were taken in accordance with a directive issued by dominion councillors remaining in boston who ordered that frontier militia commanders were to take into custody any abenaki suspected of participating in raids this directive sparked a problem in maine when twenty abenaki including women and children were taken into custody by colonial militia local authorities were faced with dilemma of housing captives shipping them first to falmouth and then to boston angering other natives in area who seized english hostages to ensure safe return of captives andros castigated for their unwarranted acts and ordered indians released and returned to maine a brief skirmish during process of exchanging captives resulted in deaths of four english hostages and sparked discontent in maine faced with this discord andros returned to maine with a significant force and began construction of additional fortifications to protect settlers lustig pp 177 179 andros spent winter in maine and returned to boston in march upon hearing rumors of revolution in england and discontent in boston lovejoy pp 219 239 revolt on 18 april 1689 soon after news reached boston of overthrow of james ii of england colonists of boston rose up against his rule a well organized mob descended on city arresting dominion officials and anglicans andros had his quarters in fort mary a garrison house on south side of city where a number of officials took refuge lustig pp 191 192 old massachusetts colonial leadership restored due to rebellion and headed by ex governor simon bradstreet then summoned governor andros to surrender for his own safety because of mob which they claimed whereof we were wholly ignorant lustig p 193 he refused and instead tried to escape to rose sole element of royal navy present near boston at time of revolt however boat sent from rose was intercepted by militia and andros was forced back into fort mary webb p 191 negotiations ensued and andros agreed to leave fort to meet with rebel council promised safe conduct he was marched under guard to townhouse where council had assembled there he was told that they must would have government in their own hands and that he was under arrest webb p 192 he was taken to home of dominion treasurer john usher and held under close watch thumb right upright 0 5 former massachusetts governor simon bradstreet after fort mary fell into rebel hands on 19th andros was moved there from usher s house he was confined there with joseph dudley and other dominion officials until 7 june when he was transferred to castle island it is during this period of captivity that he is said to have attempted an escape dressed in women s clothing story although it circulated widely was disputed by anglican minister robert ratcliff who claimed that story and others had not least foundation of truth and that they were falsehoods and lies propagated to render governour odious to his people lustig pp 200 201 he did make a successful escape from castle island on 2 august after his servant plied sentries with drink he managed to flee to rhode island but was quickly recaptured and thereafter kept in virtual solitary confinement lustig p 201 he and others were held for 10 months before being sent to england for trial lustig p 202 massachusetts agents in london refused to sign charges made against him so court summarily dismissed them and freed him kimball pp 53 55 when andros was questioned about various accusations that had been levelled against him he pointed out that all of his actions had been taken to bring colonial laws into conformance with english law or they were specifically taken in pursuit of his commission and instructions lustig p 219 while andros was in captivity new york government of lieutenant governor francis nicholson was simultaneously deposed by a military faction led by jacob leisler in an event that came to be known as leisler s rebellion lovejoy pp 255 256 leisler would govern new york until 1691 when he was captured and executed by a force led by newly appointed provincial governor henry sloughter lovejoy pp 326 357 andros was eventually allowed to depart for england by that point dominion of new england had effectively ceased to exist with colonies in dominion having reverted to their previous forms of governance evans p 432 massachusetts and its surrounding territories were reorganized into province of massachusetts bay in 1691 evans pp 431 449 governor of virginia andros was well received at court upon his return to england king in particular recalled that andros had visited his court in netherlands and expressed approval of andros service lustig pp 214 218 in search of employment andros offered his services as a spy offering idea of going to paris ostensibly to meet with exiled james but to actually attempt to acquire french military plans this plan was rejected lustig p 225 while in england he married for second time to elizabeth crisp clapham in july 1691 lustig pp 225 226 she was widow of christopher clapham who was connected by that marriage to his first wife s family whitmore p xxxv andros next opportunity for employment came with resignation in february 1692 of lord effingham as governor of province of virginia although francis nicholson formerly dominion lieutenant governor was then serving as lieutenant governor or virginia and sought superior position william awarded governorship to andros lustig p 226 and awarded nicholson yet another lieutenant governorship this time that of maryland lustig p 242 this was destined to make andros tenure more difficult because his relationship with nicholson had deteriorated for other reasons exact reasons for this enmity are unclear one contemporary wrote that nicholson especially resented sir edmund andros against whom he has a particular pique on account of some earlier dealings andros arrived in virginia on 13 september 1692 and began his duties a week later nicholson graciously received him and not long after sailed for england lustig p 228 andros settled at middle plantation future site of williamsburg where he would live until 1695 he worked to organize provincial records maintenance of which had suffered since bacon s rebellion and promoted enforcement of laws designed to prevent slave rebellions he encouraged diversification of virginia s economy which was then almost entirely dependent on tobacco export oriented economy was also being badly hurt by ongoing nine years war because of which merchant ships were required to travel in convoys for several years virginia did not receive any military escorts so their products were not going to market in europe andros encouraged introduction of new crops like cotton and flax and manufacture of fabric virginia was first colonial posting in which andros had to work with a local assembly his relationship with house of burgesses was generally cordial but he encountered some resistance especially to measures related to war and colonial defenses he hired armed vessels to patrol colony s waters and contributed financially to new york s colonial defenses which formed a bulwark against possibility of french and indian incursions into virginia in 1696 andros was ordered by king to send troops to new york for which burgesses reluctantly appropriated ps1 000 andros management of colonial defense and indian relations were successful virginia unlike new york and new england was not attacked during war during his tenure andros made an enemy of james blair a prominent anglican minister blair was working to establish a new college for educating anglican ministers and he believed that andros was not supportive of idea however blair and nicholson worked closely together on this idea with nicholson often coming from maryland for meetings on subject two men were united in their dislike of andros and their activities helped to cause andros resignation college of william and mary was founded in 1693 lustig p 249 despite blair s claims that andros was unsupportive andros donated cost of bricks to construct college s chapel from his own funds and convinced house of burgesses to approve funding of ps100 per year for college lustig p 252 blair s complaints many of them vague and inaccurate made their way to london where proceedings into andros conduct began at board of trade and ecclesiastical courts of church of england in 1697 lustig pp 259 264 andros had lost most of his support on board of trade when a whig faction came to power and his advocates were unable to sway board in favor of him anglican bishops staunchly supported blair and nicholson in march 1698 andros complaining of fatigue and illness asked to be recalled lustig p 264 later years andros recall was announced in london in may 1698 he was replaced by nicholson he returned to england and resumed his post as bailiff of guernsey he divided his time between guernsey and london where he had a house in denmark hill lustig pp 267 268 his second wife died in 1703 and he married for third time in 1707 to elizabeth fitzherbert in 1704 queen anne named him lieutenant governor of guernsey a post he held until 1708 he died in london on 24 february 1714 and was buried at st anne s church soho his wife died in 1717 and was buried nearby whitmore p xxxvi church was destroyed during second world war and there is no longer any trace of their graves lustig p 268 he had no issue by any of his wives legacy historian michael kammen states that andros failed in all of his roles in colonies he did not succeed in part because he was neither ruthless enough to cow his provincial subjects into submission nor ingratiating enough to win himself a broad base of local support in part because he came to new england at a critical moment without prior experience in peculiar religious and political development of that area and in part finally because he was continually caught in a cross fire between imperious assumptions of crown and unfamiliar imperatives of colonial life michael kammen andros edmund in john a garraty ed encyclopedia of american biography 1974 pp 35 36 andros remains a notorious figure in new england especially in connecticut connecticut officially excludes him from its list of colonial governors but his portrait hangs in hall of governors in state museum across from state capitol in hartford although he was disliked in colonies he was recognized in england as an effective administrator implementing policies that he had been ordered to carry out and advancing crown s agenda biographer mary lou lustig notes that he was an accomplished statesman a brave soldier a polished courtier and a devoted servant but that his style was often autocratic arbitrary and dictatorial that he lacked tact and that he had difficulty reaching compromises similarly andros was featured as an antagonist in 1879 novel captain nelson described as a romance of colonial days andros appears in several episodes of witch of blackbird pond where his conflict with connecticut colonists forms background to protagonist s more personal problems it is believed that andros island in bahamas was named for him early proprietors of bahamas
