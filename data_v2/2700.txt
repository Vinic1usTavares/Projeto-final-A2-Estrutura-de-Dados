quenya tolkien wrote in his outline of phonology in parma eldalamberon 19 p 74 dedicated to phonology of quenya is a sound as in english new in quenya is a combination of consonants ibidem p 81 is one of fictional languages devised by j r r tolkien and used by elves in his legendarium tolkien began devising language around 1910 and restructured grammar several times until quenya reached its final state vocabulary remained relatively stable throughout creation process also name of language was repeatedly changed by tolkien from elfin and qenya to eventual quenya finnish language had been a major source of inspiration but tolkien was also familiar with latin greek and ancient germanic languages when he began constructing quenya another notable feature of tolkien s elvish languages was his development of a complex internal history of characters to speak those tongues in their own fictional universe he felt that his languages changed and developed over time as with historical languages which he studied professionally not in a vacuum but as a result of migrations and interactions of peoples who spoke them within tolkien s legendarium quenya is one of many elvish languages spoken by immortal elves called quendi speakers in quenya quenya translates as simply language or in contrast to other tongues that elves met later in their long history elf language after elves divided quenya originated as speech of two clans of high elves or eldar noldor and vanyar who left middle earth to live in eldamar elvenhome in valinor land of immortal and god like valar of these two groups of elves noldor returned to middle earth where they met sindarin speaking grey elves noldor eventually adopted sindarin and used quenya primarily as a ritual or poetic language whereas vanyar who stayed behind in eldamar retained use of quenya in this way quenya language was symbolic of high status of elves firstborn of races of middle earth because of their close connection to valinor and its decreasing use also became symbolic of slowly declining elven culture in middle earth in second age of middle earth s chronology men of numenor learnt quenya tongue in third age time of setting of lord of rings quenya was learnt as a second language by all elves of noldorin origin and it continued to be used in spoken and written form but their mother tongue was sindarin of grey elves as noldor remained in middle earth their noldorin dialect of quenya also gradually diverged from vanyarin dialect spoken in valinor undergoing both sound changes and grammatical changes language featured prominently in tolkien s lord of rings trilogy as well as in his posthumously published history of middle earth silmarillion longest text in quenya published by tolkien during his lifetime is poem namarie and other published texts are generally no longer than a few sentences at his death tolkien left behind a number of unpublished writings on quenya and later tolkien scholars have prepared his notes and unpublished manuscripts for publication in journals parma eldalamberon and vinyar tengwar also publishing scholarly and linguistic analyses of language tolkien never created enough vocabulary to make it possible to converse in quenya although fans have been writing poetry and prose in quenya since 1970s this has required conjecture and need to devise new words in effect developing a kind of neo quenya language external history j r r tolkien began to construct his first elven tongue c 1910 1911 while he was at king edward s school birmingham he later called it qenya c 1915 and later changed spelling to quenya he was then already familiar with latin greek spanish and several ancient germanic languages such as gothic old norse and old english letter number 163 letters of j r r tolkien he had invented several cryptographic codes and two or three constructed languages tolkien took an interest in finnish mythology of kalevala then became acquainted with finnish language which he found to provide an aesthetically pleasing inspiration for his high elven language many years later he wrote it was like discovering a complete wine cellar filled with bottles of an amazing wine of a kind and flavour never tasted before it quite intoxicated me regarding inspiration for quenya he wrote that tolkien never intended quenya or any of his constructed languages to be used in everyday life as an international auxiliary language although he was in favour of idea of esperanto as an auxiliary language within europe with his quenya tolkien pursued a double aesthetic goal classical and inflected this urge in fact was motivation for his creation of a mythology while language developed tolkien felt that it needed speakers including their own history and mythology which he thought would give a language its individual flavour tolkien j r r lord of rings foreword to second edition he wrote it was primarily linguistic in inspiration and was begun in order to provide necessary background of history for elvish tongues this process of first inventing a language and then creating a background setting for its fictional speakers has been described as unique dimitra fimi a tolkien scholar argues that tolkien s invention of qenya started as a quest for ideal language to match moral and aesthetic objectives that were part of his project of creating a mythology for england fimi argues that tolkien deliberately used sound symbolism to unify sound and meaning and make language appear as an ideal language fit to be spoken in utopian realm of elves and fairies of valinor tolkien considered quenya to be one language which has been designed to give play to my own most normal phonetic taste tolkien j r r 1997 monsters and critics and other essays p 212 from onset tolkien used comparative philology and tree model as his major tools in his constructed languages he usually started with phonological system of proto language and then proceeded by inventing for each daughter language necessary sequence of sound changes i find construction and of languages an aesthetic pleasure in itself quite apart from lord of rings of which it was is in fact independent j r r tolkien letter to a reader published in parma eldalamberon 17 p 61 development in his lifetime j r r tolkien never ceased to experiment on his constructed languages and they were subjected to many revisions therefore quenya had many grammars with substantial differences between different stages of its development during first conceptual stage of early quenya c 1910 to c 1920 language was called elfin in english and eldarissa in qenya proper while its development was a continuous process quenya underwent a number of major revisions in its grammar mostly in conjugation and pronominal system vocabulary however was not subject to sudden or extreme change tolkien sometimes changed meaning of a word but he almost never discarded it once invented and he kept on refining its meaning and forged new synonyms moreover elvish etymology was in constant flux tolkien delighted in inventing new for his quenya vocabulary but after publication of lord of rings finished c 1949 1950 published in 1954 1955 grammar rules of quenya went through very few changes and this version was then defined as late quenya c 1950 1973 spelling qenya is sometimes used to distinguish early quenya from later versions qenya differs from late quenya by having different internal history vocabulary and grammar rules as described in qenyaqetsa qenyaqetsa qenya phonology and lexicon by j r r tolkien published in parma eldalamberon no 12 examples include a different accusative or abolition of final consonant clusters in later quenya fimi suggests that qenya as it appears in qenyaqetsa was supposed to be a mystic language as lexicon contains a number of words with clear christian religious connotations such as crucifixion and gospel these words were not part of late quenya in early 1930s tolkien decided that proto language of elves was valarin tongue of gods or valar as he called them language of elves derived in beginning from valar but they changed it even in learning and moreover modified and enriched it constantly at all times by their own invention j r r tolkien lambion ontale descent of tongues tengwesta qenderinwa 1 parma eldalamberon 18 p 23 in comparative eldalamberon no 19 pp 18 28 mechanisms of sound change were described by tolkien for following daughter languages qenya lindarin a dialect of qenya telerin old noldorin or noldorin or especially of danian of east danian west lemberin north lemberin and east lemberin for this proto language of elves tolkien appears to have borrowed five part plosive system of proto indo european ancestor of latin greek sanskrit and others namely one labial one coronal and three velar plosives palatal plain and labial first table below provides some of primary initial combinations from comparative tables parma eldalamberon 19 p 20 1

m ungw m emb another characteristic of quenya reminiscent of ancient natural languages like old greek old english or sanskrit is dual grammatical number which is used in addition to singular and plural it has been suggested that tolkien used dual to give quenya an archaic feel in its role as an ancient language of elves about ten years later tolkien changed his mind about origin of elvish proto language instead of learning from valar elves had created an original language quenderin which had become proto language of elven language family j r r tolkien lambion ontale descent of tongues tengwesta qenderinwa 2 parma eldalamberon 18 p 71 elves began to make in beginning of their being a language and it is one with their being since it was of their nature and first of all their gift to devise names and words for this new language tolkien kept many roots he had invented for valarin in 1930s which then became quenderin roots eldarin family of languages comprises quenya telerin sindarin and evolution in quenya and telerin of initial groups of quenderin is described thus in tolkien s outline of phonology in contrast to early qenya grammar of quenya was influenced by finnish an agglutinative language but much more by latin a synthetic and fusional language and also greek tolkien wrote about quenya it might be said to be composed on a latin basis with two other main ingredients that happen to give me phonaesthetic pleasure finnish and greek letter no 144 letters of j r r tolkien from which he probably took idea of diglossia of quenya with its highly codified variety parmaquesta used only in certain situations such as literature also phonology of quenya was inspired by certain aspects of finnish but this is not easily recognised tolkien almost never borrowed words directly from real languages into quenya major exception is name earendel earendil which he found in an old english poem by cynewulf yet finnish influence extended sometimes also to vocabulary a few quenya words such as come and anta give clearly have a finnish origin other forms that appear to have been borrowed are actually coincidental such as finnish kirja book and quenya cirya ship tolkien invented valarin quenderin root kir from which sprang his quenya word cirya latin aure dawn and quenya aure moment of special meaning special day festival day are unrelated instead quenya aure comes from valarin quenderin root ur germanic influence can more be seen in grammar r nominative plural ending is reminiscent of scandinavian languages or phonology than in words arda quenya name for region just happened to resemble germanic erde earth while it actually comes from valarin quenderin root gar according to tom dubois and scott mellor name of quenya itself may have been influenced by name a language closely related to finnish but tolkien never mentioned this some linguists have argued that quenya can be understood as an example of a particular kind of artificial language that helps to create a fictional world other such languages would include robert jordan s old tongue and klingon language of star trek series invented by marc it was observed that they form a sociolinguistic context within which group and individual identities can be created publication of linguistic papers two journals vinyar tengwar from issue no 39 july 1998 and parma eldalamberon from issue no 11 1995 are today exclusively devoted to editing and publishing of j r r tolkien s mass of unpublished linguistic papers there are several journals devoted to study of tolkien s languages parma eldalamberon quettar vinyar tengwar important grammatical texts alluded to by christopher tolkien in his history of middle earth series and described as almost unreadable or quite incomprehensible have been published in these two journals early qenya grammar written by j r r tolkien c 1925 was successfully edited and published in parma eldalamberon no 14 editors have not published a comprehensive catalogue of linguistic papers they are working on and that were not published by christopher tolkien in history of middle earth new linguistic material continues to emerge although pace of publication is irregular use of quenya attempts by fans to write in quenya began in 1970s when total corpus of published elvish comprised only a few hundred words since then use of elvish has flourished in poems and texts phrases and names and even tattoos but tolkien himself never made his languages complete enough for conversation as a result newly invented elvish texts require conjecture and sometimes coinage of new words use of quenya has expanded over years as new words have been created forming a neo quenya language that is based on tolkien s original quenya but incorporates many new elements internal history of late quenya elvish languages are a language family of several related languages and dialects following is a brief overview of fictional internal history of late quenya as conceived by tolkien tolkien imagined a diglossic elven society with a vernacular language for every day use tarquesta and a more educated language for use in ceremonies and lore parmaquesta it has been observed that degree of proximity to light of valar affects development of both languages in terms of phonology morphology and semantics division between light elves and dark elves that took place during sundering of elves is reflected in their respective languages elves at first shared a common language primitive quendian called quenderin in quenya among eldar i e those elves who undertook great march to valinor and eldamar primitive quendian developed into common eldarin some of eldar remained in beleriand and became grey elves their language developed into sindarin most of other eldar continued to eldamar elvenhome and founded great city of where they developed quenya quenya s older form first recorded in sarati of rumil is called old or ancient quenya yara quenya in quenya in eldamar noldor and vanyar spoke two slightly different though mutually intelligible dialects of tarquesta noldorin quenya and vanyarin quenya j r r tolkien tengwesta qenderinwa 2 parma eldalamberon 18 p 75 later noldorin quenya became exilic quenya when most of noldor elves followed their leader feanor into exile from eldamar and back to middle earth where immortal elves first awoke quenya was also used by gods or valar elves even derived some loanwords from valar s language which was called valarin in quenya although these were more numerous in vanyarin dialect than in noldorin this was probably because of enduringly close relationship vanyarin elves had with valar quenya as used by vanyar also incorporated several words from valarin that were not found in noldorin dialect such as yellow from valarin n blue presumably from same root as valarin ul l u meaning water and nasar red original valarin not given according to quendi and eldar was usual vanyarin name given to quenya language since in vanyarin consonant groups ndy and ny remained quite distinct j r r tolkien war of jewels p 361 in noldorin ndy eventually became ny tolkien explained that word quenya itself has been cited as an e g by aelfwine but this is a mistake due to supposition that was properly and directly derived from name quendi elves this appears not to be case word is quenya in vanyarin and always so in parmaquesta j r r tolkien outline of phonology p 93 elves of third clan or teleri who reached eldamar later than noldor and vanyar spoke a different but closely related tongue usually called telerin it was seen by some elves to be just another dialect of quenya this was not case with teleri for whom their tongue was distinct from quenya after vanyar left city of tuna telerin and noldorin quenya grew closer rebellious noldor who followed their leader feanor to middle earth spoke only quenya but thingol king of sindar of beleriand forbade use of quenya in his realm when he learned of slaying of telerin elves by noldor silmarillion chapter 15 by doing so he both restricted possibility of sindar to enhance and brighten their language with influences from quenya and accelerated and spiritual impoverishment of noldorin culture noldor at this time had fully mastered sindarin while sindar were slow to learn quenya quenya in middle earth became known as exilic quenya when noldor eventually adopted sindarin language as their native speech after thingol s ruling it differed from quenya mostly in vocabulary having some loanwords from sindarin it differed also in pronunciation representing recognition of sound changes which had begun among noldor before exile and had caused noldorin quenya to diverge from vanyarin quenya change of z old s to r was latest in noldorin belonging to early exilic quenya grammatical changes were only small though since features of their old language were carefully taught parma eldalamberon 17 p 129 from second age on quenya was also used ceremonially by men of numenor and their descendants in gondor and arnor for official names of kings and queens this practice was resumed by aragorn when he took crown as elessar quenya in third age had almost same status as latin language had in medieval europe and was called elven latin by tolkien j r r tolkien lord of rings appendix f of elves registers quenya has a variety of language registers parmaquesta book language literary style in which elven scriptures ainulindale and other classical elvish works were written tarquesta high

contained in appendix e of lord of rings and outline of phonology a text written by j r r tolkien and published in parma no 19 tolkien based quenya pronunciation more on latin than on finnish thus quenya lacks vowel harmony and consonant gradation present in finnish and accent is not always on first syllable of a word typical finnish elements like front vowels o a and y are lacking in quenya but phonological similarities include absence of aspirated unvoiced stops or development of syllables ti si in both languages combination of a latin basis with finnish phonological rules resulted in a product that resembles italian in many respects which was tolkien s favourite modern romance language letters of j r r tolkien letter no 223 i remain in love with italian and feel quite lorn without a

vowels of finnish or polish but for vowels e o short vowels are pronounced slightly lower and closer to and respectively whereas long ones are pronounced as high mid vowels and this interpretation is based on a statement by tolkien saying that e and o when correctly pronounced by elves were just a little tenser and closer than their short counterparts neither very tense and close nor very slack and open j r r tolkien outline of phonology parma eldalamberon 19 p 106 this interpretation results in a vowel system with 7 different vowel qualities and a length distinction in high and low vowels

syllables and stress in quenya stressing of a syllable is predictable and non phonemic i e meaning of a word never changes depending on stress but it is partly determined by syllable weight words of

and mostly i e different word particles are joined by appending them it has basic word classes of verbs nouns and pronouns determiners adjectives and prepositions nouns are inflected for case and

agreement disappears basic word order is subject verb object unless otherwise noted samples in this section refer to late quenya as conceived by tolkien after 1951 nouns quenya nouns can have up to four numbers singular general plural plural 1 particular plural plural 2 and dual however not all quenya nouns can have all four numbers since some of them are plural only having no singular variant

shortened form and ablative and a possessive or adjectival case accusative was however only used for parmaquesta and had been replaced by nominative in late colloquial quenya adjectives in late quenya

adjectives may be freely used as nouns j r r tolkien early qenya grammar parma eldalamberon 14 p 77 in which case they are also inflected like a noun e g new may be used as vinyar news prepositions and adverbs in quenya there are many similarities in form between prepositions and adverbs since grammatical case already determines relation of verb and object many quenya prepositions have adverb like uses with no complement in common eldarin these prepositions were postpositions instead and later became inflectional endings case markings combine primarily with nouns whereas prepositions can combine with phrases of many different categories this is why most prepositions in quenya are used with a noun in nominative case an i i r upon many waves preposition an is related to nna case ending pronouns as with all parts of quenya grammar pronominal system was subject to many revisions throughout tolkien s life and available corpus was not systematic until a list of endings was published in

copula was not used when meaning was clear vinyar tengwar 49 p 9 otherwise copula is left out which may provide for ambiguous when there is no further context eldar can be translated in english either as elves are ambidexters or elves were ambidexters vinyar tengwar 49 p 7 a mara a is good or a was good possibly as in russian a copula could be inserted only if it is not present tense as a enge mara a was good and a mara a will be good but this was not explicitly explained syntax quenya allows for a very flexible word order because it is an inflectional language like latin nevertheless it has word order rules usual syntax structure is subject verb object adjective can be placed before or after noun that it modifies vocabulary because much of tolkien s writings on elvish languages remain

using latin script but he devised a number of original writing systems to match internal histories of his languages elvish writing systems thumb word quenya written in tengwar of feanor using classical mode tolkien imagined many writing systems for his elves most well known is tengwar of feanor but first one he created c 1919 was tengwar of rumil also called sarati he decided that prior to their exile noldorin elves first used sarati of rumil to record ancient quenya in middle earth quenya appears to have been rarely written using elvish runes or named in quenya latin script tolkien s spelling in latin letters of quenya was largely phonemic with each letter corresponding to a specific phoneme in language save for some exceptions in particular vowels varied in pronunciation depending upon their vowel length specific rules for consonants were provided in appendix e of lord of rings e g letter c is always pronounced k qu stands for kw j r r tolkien lord of rings appendix e part i is tolkien s standard orthography for quenya uses all letters of latin script except j k and z together with acute and diaeresis marks on vowels letters n th and z only appear in early quenya occasionally tolkien wrote quenya with a finnish style orthography rather than standard latin romance version in which c is replaced by k y with j and long vowels written double see version of his poem earendel published in parma eldalamberon 16 p 104 acute accent marks long vowels while diaeresis indicates that a vowel is not part of a diphthong for example in ea or eo while final e is marked with a diaeresis to remind english speakers that it is not silent since either use is superfluous diaeresis was frequently omitted by tolkien corpus poem namarie is longest piece of quenya found in lord of rings yet first sentence in quenya is uttered by a hobbit namely frodo s greeting to elves elen sila lumenn omentielvo other examples include elendil s words spoken upon reaching middle earth and repeated by aragorn at his coronation et ar hildinyar tenn ambar metta out of great sea to middle earth i am come in this place i will abide and my heirs unto ending of world treebeard s greeting
