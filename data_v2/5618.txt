yoga yajnavalkya yoga yajnavalkya is a classical hindu yoga text in sanskrit language text is written in form of a male female dialogue between sage yajnavalkya and gargi text consists of 12 chapters and contains 504 verses like patanjali s yogasutras yoga yajnavalkya describes eight components of yoga however it has different goals text contains additional material that is not found in yogasutras such as concept of kundalini yoga yajnavalkya contains one of most comprehensive discussion of yoga components such as pranayama pratyahara dhyana and dharana text was influential in development and practice of yoga traditions of india before 12th century author text is attributed to yajnavalkya a revered vedic sage in hinduism he is estimated to have lived in around 8th century bce and is associated with several other major ancient texts in sanskrit namely shukla yajurveda shatapatha brahmana brihadaranyaka upanishad named yajnavalkya yajnavalkya and yajnavalkya i fisher 1984 yajnavalkya in sruti traditions of veda acta orientalia volume 45 pages 55 87 he is also mentioned in mahabharata and puranas vishwanath narayan pages lvi xlviii lix as well as in ancient jainism texts such as hajime nakamura 1968 yajnavalkya and other upanishadic thinkers in a jain tradition adyar library bulletin volume 31 32 pages 214 228 these references to yajnavalkya in other texts in addition to eponymous yoga yajnavalkya may be to different sages with same name actual author of yoga yajnavalkya text was probably someone who lived many centuries after vedic sage yajnavalkya and is unknown ian whicher a professor of religion at university of manitoba writes that author of yoga yajnavalkya may be an ancient yajnavalkya but this yajnavalkya is not to be confused with vedic era yajnavalkya who is revered in hinduism for brihadaranyaka upanishad ian whicher 1999 integrity of yoga a reconsideration of classical yoga state university of new york press pages 27 315 316 with notes david white a professor of comparative religion at university of california suggests that author a 9th to 12th century south indian with name of yajnavalkya was author of two works that combined eight part practice with teachings on hatha yoga and vedanta philosophy yoga yajnavalkya and yogi yajnavalkya smriti this issue has since been clarified in a 2017 study of two works according to dominik wujastyk a scholar of sanskrit literature indology and history of yoga philosophy and practice yoga yajnavalkya is an early text on yoga many versions of its manuscripts have been discovered with two pre 10th century ce palm leaf manuscripts in sanskrit while many more versions have been found in other regional languages of indian subcontinent original text is likely many centuries older variations between manuscripts suggest that this text was compiled and revised by multiple authors chronology composition date of yoga yajnavalkya is unclear prahlad divanji an indologist and sanskrit scholar states that text was composed between second century bce and fourth century ce because yoga upanishads and hatha yoga texts contain verses from yoga yajnavalkya divanji cites tantra texts ayurveda tradition texts and literature of advaita vedanta from 4th century ce which mention yoga yajnavalkya thereafter concluding that text or some version of yoga yajnavalkya text must have been in existence by 4th century ce however adds divanji text is likely to have been composed after patanjali s yogasutra which itself is variously estimated to have composed sometime between 500 bce and 400 ce michele desmarais 2008 changing minds mind consciousness and identity in patanjali s yoga sutra motilal banarsidass pages 16 17 divanji premises his dating proposal from observation that yoga yajnavalkya expands on ideas in patanjali s text such as its list of yamas which includes patanjali s five plus five additional ones a g mohan an author and yoga teacher states that text was likely completed before 4th century ce david white in contrast suggests date of composition to be much later between 10th and 12th centuries white states that 13th century dattatreya yoga shastra acknowledges yajnavalkya and describes its teachings as supplementary to eight part practice as taught by yajnavalkya which means that text was already established and accepted by then other manuscripts with devotional non mental and mental yoga texts in hindu tradition also refer to teachings of text suggesting text originated before many other yoga texts ram shankar bhattacharya an indologist dates pune version of a manuscript of text to about 13th or 14th century ce and notes that this version of yoga yajnavalkya quotes verses from hatha yoga texts he also points out that gargi is mentioned as wife of yajnavalkya in manuscript however no other text affirms that gargi was wife of yajnavalkya rather and are listed as his two wives leading to theory that pune manuscript is a corrupted and more modern edition of original text karen pechilis 2004 graceful guru hindu female gurus in india and united states oxford university press pages 11 15 according to dominik wujastyk two of its manuscripts ms kathmandu nak 5 696 now preserved in nepal ms london bl or preserved in british library are amongst oldest surviving sanskrit manuscripts found on indian subcontinent first is dated to early 10th century or late 9th century while one discovered in nepal is dated to 1024 ce from its colophon original text is likely much older than these palm leaf manuscript copies manuscripts several versions of yoga yajnavalkya manuscripts are known earliest published manuscript of yoga yajnavalkya was discovered in bengal in 1893 since then other manuscripts have been discovered with differing numbers of verses text published by divanji in 1954 for example has over 500 verses while manuscript translated by krishnamacharya and desikachar writers and teachers of yoga books has 460 verses a study of manuscripts reveals that there are two quite different works that are often both called yogayajnavalkya work discussed in this wikipedia page is often called in

introduction for yajnavalkya and gargi and then gives its purpose to disclose nature of yoga in verses 10 to 19 gargi remarks that yoga has been called best karma and asks yajnavalkya to explain yoga to her yajnavalkya agrees but first attributes his knowledge to hindu god brahma who taught him this jnana knowledge and karma works knowledge and varnas yajnavalkya states that there are two paths to attain knowledge one path is pravritti karma wherein a person is driven by desire and a craving for rewards forms his will and then uses his knowledge to act out his free will second path is nivritti karma wherein a person is not driven by desire and does not crave for rewards but he uses his knowledge in his works in a detached way pravritti karma path is cause for suffering and rebirth while nivritti karma is liberating and practiced by those who want to end suffering and rebirth verses 1 27 40 are a non yoga commentary on duties of four social classes this section is missing in manuscripts of yoga yajnavalkya that contain 460 verses commentary presents two theories on duties of four varna in terms of ashrama of brahmacharya grihastha and sannyasa one theory allows only brahmins kshatriyas and to enter brahmacharya and study vedas and other states that shudras can also enter brahmacharya neither theory is recommended and according to bhattacharya s translation it adds that all four varnas are required to pay off debts owed to sages men and gods by practicing brahmacharya procreating offspring and performing karma all four social classes should strive for nivritti karma work without craving for rewards according to desikachar s translation yoga is open to all without restrictions to varna or gender verses 1 41 49 state that karma with knowledge is

prevent or correct internal imbalances and tone inner organs while meditative asanas are those postures either sitting or standing that one can maintain steadily and comfortably for extended periods of time in both a proper posture is achieved when one can combine relaxed steadiness with deep breathing exercises such comfortable and stable asanas are necessary for cleansing of nadi blood vessels through pranayama stage of yoga this view is shared by other yoga texts such as in verse 5 2 of gheranda samhita rsc vasu 1917 reprint 1996 gheranda samhita munshiram manoharlal page 38 padmasana

fire within one s body this inner fire resides in middle part of body and he calls it nabhi center and a chakra this is residence of jiva and vital air nourishes it from below while one is alive just above this nabhi is kundalini which normally is dormant yoga awakens her by bringing vital air and heat to her verses 4 26 35 state that human body has fourteen nadis blood vessels of which three are primary sushumna sanskrit is most important as it extends all along spinal cord and reaches into head sustaining whole body vishnu is deity whose power propels sushumna according to verse 4 31 on both sides of sushumna reside ida and pingala vessels former connected to moon and latter to sun these three drive three gunas forces behind innate character of a being with sushumna driving sattva goodness pingala driving rajas action and ida driving tamas destructiveness these primary vessels are connected to numerous channels inside human body which pervade whole body and nourish it when one inhales or exhales according to verses 4 47 65 nadis are loaded with vital airs there are ten types of vital airs corresponding to different stages of breathing and they are named prana apana samana udana vyana naga kurma and dhananjaya these affect nadis in different ways and how body functions and what balance of organs within body is depends on food one takes in and how well inhalation and exhalation are able to deliver vital airs to various body parts body interacts with nature and removes liquids and excretes waste through nine holes aim of pranayama breath control is to purify channels and nourish inner body with vital airs this benefits a yogi and yogini in preventing and curing diseases as well as preparing mind for meditation breath control and meditation for self purification thumb solitary and quiet locations are recommended for yoga by text in chapter 5 chapters 5 and 6 discuss means of cleansing body and mind first ten verses of chapter 5 summarize and

are best venues for yoga a matha hut in a forest is ideal but any private place that is free from distractions high winds or intense sunshine is a good location for yoga either a pad made of kusha grass or a solid ground with deer skin mat on it is desirable yoga can be learned with help of a teacher within three to four months if practiced six times a day if frequent practice is not possible yoga can be mastered over a period of three to four years mastering breath text dedicates largest number of verses to discussion of breath and breath exercises yajnavalkya dedicates significant amount of text to explain art of mastering each stage of breathing that is inhalation exhalation and stoppage between two each stage is discussed in terms of its nature speed duration depth on its own and relative to other stage of breathing regulating these at will during asanas meant for cleansing body or mind in order to keep time for each stage without distraction he recommends silently reciting time measured mantras or sound beats to help measure each stage and thus establish progress during yoga yogyaajnyvlky dhyaayh sanskrit text of yoga yajnavalkya sanskritdocuments archives 2009 mantras for internal time measurement mentioned include pranava om gayatri with or gayatri with text classifies three levels of breath regulation namely puraka satisfying kumbhaka prominent and rechaka reck purging puraka exercise is shortest and counts twelve moments matras music beats kumbhaka is medium and stretches over twenty four moments while rechaka is highest lasting thirty six moments text then

forms this stage is one where focus of mind shifts from external stimuli received by sensory organs to various levels of internal awareness yogyaajnyvlky dhyaayh sanskrit text of yoga yajnavalkya sanskritdocuments archives 2009 theory of joints is presented and 18 vital points inside one s body are listed that can be used as focal points to help initial stages of meditative exercises verses 1 10 of chapter 8 elaborate on practice of dharana or meditation to train mind in consciousness of self five elements in universe correspond to five body functional systems and that systems are gods residing within human body next level of meditation is to fix one s undistracted attention to these five while simultaneously performing breath exercises mastered in previous step yogyaajnyvlky dhyaayh sanskrit text of yoga yajnavalkya sanskritdocuments archives 2009 five deities are addressed by chanting five letters or syllables which are sounds of chakras which are lam vam ram yam and ham to become one with god verses 8 11 15 state that a yogin should practice meditating on these respective body systems as deities with help of om mantra as this leads to dissolution and realization of brahman purusha after mastery is achieved with aid of envisioning five deities within one s body text mentions that yogin overcomes three doss faults chapter ends by reminding yoga student to not forget daily duties and works virtuous self restraints yamas and virtuous observances niyamas as he gains mastery to this level of yoga chapter 9 discusses dhyana limb of yoga dhyana can lead to freedom or bondage depending on how and what one concentrates on freedom comes from realizing oneness of individual self with universal self nirguna non qualified attribute less form of meditation is best suited for those who have mastered vital airs as well as all asanas with inner awareness of vital points and nadis blood vessels these yogins and yoginis can abstract feel self within and should meditate on i am brahman who is all pervasive all embracing all perceiving and full of bliss saguna meditation that is qualified and with attributes is for those who need a concrete symbol such as a murti or a visualization aid they should think of identity of their lotus heart having eight petals with highest self visualized as vasudeva narayana or purushottama meditation should concentrate on one s own identity with this image of imperishable highest self this is path to state of or qualified dhyana text suggests variations to saguna meditation such as perceiving union of a golden disc with four faced golden purusha imagining a lustrous inner self inside oneself and then oneness with it and other variations verses 9 43 44 state that inner self whether meditated upon as nirguna or saguna is one and same yogyaajnyvlky dhyaayh sanskrit text of yoga yajnavalkya sanskritdocuments archives 2009 concentration chapter 10 states meditation practice perfects one s ability to concentrate wherein object one concentrates on becomes one of attachment of oneness and one feels one s identity with it yogyaajnyvlky dhyaayh sanskrit text of yoga yajnavalkya sanskritdocuments archives 2009 verses 10 6 15 suggest that one must concentrate on self as supreme self oneness with brahman in everything and this process of attachment of one s individual self to supreme self leads to oneness and liberation verses 10 19 23 advise that those who seek liberation in life or after death should do yoga and reach stage of samadhi wherein one fixes one s mind on supreme self this is recommended for those in their advanced years and seekers of inner liberation and peace yajnavalkya suggests to gargi that she should meditate on self in her through yoga and thus attain nirvana dharma of a yogin yoga gargi in chapter 11 asks yajnavalkya whether a yogin in state of samadhi needs to perform vedic duties he replies no any one in state of yoga need not do vedic duties because that state is goal however anyone who leaves state of samadhi must perform dharmic duties because no living being can survive without performing any actions all duties should be performed until end of one s life when self unites with supreme self gargi then asks yagnavalkya to summarize eight components of yoga theory of kundalini in first 47 verses of chapter 12 yajnavalkya siddha yoga and kundalini aim of these yogic exercises according to verses 12 1 4 is to reach internal fire with prana life force breath energy these should be performed three times daily for ten days with vital air under control through yoga yogin realizes signs of progress such as a relaxed state of body manifested divine sound or nada inside verses 12 10 14 state that this kundalini fire is situated in navel and should be meditated upon by breathing exercises this warms up kundalini awakening her and warmth glows through entire body and at this stage yogin must draw breath above navel yagnavalkya explains that warm air inhaled passes to via navel which helps in curing diseases when hot air is retained in heart it is stage when it makes entry into chakra thousand petaled lotus that then emerges in an inverted form when vital air is held in abode of brahman atman which is heart according to verses 12 15 22 fire located in region of which is between eyebrows glows these exercises which stimulates heart with vital air and fire lead to perception of light internally and externally at this stage one should behold with mind s eye fire like glowing moon in forehead and meditate on inner self in chitta mind verses 12 23 31 state that which is subtle body that is not visible glistens in central region of body or heart or forehead this shining shakti force energy power translates bhattacharya is realised by knower of brahman through his concentrated vision atman is perceived when mind located in space between eyebrows becomes free of all distractions and activities in this state yogin becomes aware of self within and in sages in siddhas and others if dissolution of mind in space between eye brows does not occur yogin should envision absolute bliss alternatively full moon inside mouth this helps mind dissolve away distractions and activity helping it reside in or akasha sky and brings yogin closer to moksha or liberation this is a stage where feeling of liberation and bliss begins to emerge goal of practice of yoga yogyaajnyvlky sanskrit text of yoga yajnavalkya sanskritdocuments archives 2009 brahman is origin of all it is all that exists and all that into which it will dissolve back and vedas teach that this brahman resides in heart of a person it is translates bhattacharya subtler than subtle greater than great and is perceived with cleansing of one s mind and intellect one achievable with breathing exercises sacred sound exercises and yoga epilogue following complete exposition of all principles of yoga yagnavalkya leaves for a secluded place to continue his meditative contemplation while gargi forsakes her world retires to a forest hermitage and seeks refuge in practice of yoga translations two english translations of complete text are known one by desikachar and other by mohan while bhattacharya has published a condensed summary of twelve chapters according to desikachar s translation in 1960s only two sanskrit versions of this valuable text were available bombay branch of royal asiatic society bbras and trivandrum editions and both were incomplete or inaccurate he krishnamacharya took pains of writing whole manuscript desikachar further states in his introduction however many verses of this twelve chapter text are missing in both versions he krishnamacharya even corrected those manuscripts that were incomplete in heart of yoga desikachar indicates there is one critical edition of yoga yajnavalkya written by sri sic c divanji bbras edition according to a g mohan s english translation however a comparative reading shows that desikachar edition is a faithful reproduction of 1938 trivandrum publication only edits made are to fill in a negligible number of missing words around 60 words out of 6000 in mostly obvious contexts there are no significant corrections to existing verses divanji publication is easily more complete and error free containing copious footnotes comparing different versions of text from sixteen manuscripts and five printed editions including trivandrum publication trivandrum publication offered by desikachar misses 39 1 2 verses that appear in divanji publication significance according to david white yoga yajnavalkya was more significant in practice than patanjali s yogasutras before 12th century among texts on asanas and meditation it dominated indian yoga scene along with texts such as yoga vasistha chapters embedded inside hindu epic mahabharata and literature related to traditions such as hatha yoga yoga and tantric yoga yoga yajnavalkya was historically influential in indian spiritual traditions secondary sanskrit language texts from 9th to 12th centuries incorporate ideas of yoga yajnavalkya into their own traditions these include bhasya commentary of and manuscripts of vedanta schools such as advaita vedanta that discuss and incorporate yoga philosophy and practices as essential for their traditions presence of gargi in yoga yajnavalkya is significant in a historical sense as encouraging yoga to women according to divanji text includes some yoga related verses exclusively addressed to women such as those in verses 1 21 40 2 8 9 and 6 11 20 text was influential on many later yoga texts like hatha yoga pradipika and yoga upanishads such as yoga kundalini upanishad and yogatattva upanishad because they make frequent references to it yoga yajnavalkya versus patanjali s yogasutra philosophical premises of yajnavalkya and patanjali are different according to richard rosen patanjali accepts dualism premise and defines yoga as cessation of mental activity associated with sensory interaction with nature leading to kaivalya aloneness of self and a state of self awareness richard rosen 2001 review of yogayajnavalkya samhita by tkv desikachar issue march april page 149 yajnavalkya accepts advaita vedanta premise of non dualism essential oneness of self and nature and defines yoga as path to intense interconnectedness between jiva and paramatman where union of self and supreme self is realized see also yoga philosophy yoga vasistha yogatattva upanishad notes references bibliography wujastyk dominik 2017 yoga texts attributed to yajnavalkya and their remarks
