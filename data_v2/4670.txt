johannes vermeer of delft and wrote of wonderful moment of being confronted with a hitherto unknown painting by a great master during world war ii wealthy dutchmen wanted to prevent a sellout of dutch art to adolf hitler and nazi party and they avidly bought van meegeren s forgeries thinking them work of masters nevertheless a false vermeer ended up in possession of goring who had traded 137 other paintings for it and it became one of his most prized possessions following war forgery was discovered in goring s possession and van meegeren was arrested on 29 may 1945 as a collaborator as officials believed that he had sold real dutch cultural property to nazis this would have been an act of treason carrying death penalty so van meegeren confessed to less serious charge of forgery he

addition he created his own badger hair paintbrushes similar to those that vermeer was known to have used he came up with a scheme of using phenol formaldehyde bakelite to cause paints to harden after application making paintings appear as if they were 300 years old after completing a painting van meegeren would bake it at to to harden paint and then roll it over a cylinder to increase cracks later he would wash painting in black india ink to fill in cracks godley 1951 43 56 86 90 thumb left supper at emmaus 1937 it took van meegeren six years to work out his techniques but ultimately he was

lady with a blue hat after vermeer which was sold to baron heinrich thyssen in 1930 its present whereabouts are unknown original artwork van meegeren was a prolific artist and produced thousands of original paintings in a number of diverse styles this wide range in painting and drawing styles often irritated art critics some of his typical works are classical still lifes in convincing 17th century manner impressionistic paintings of people frolicking on lakes or beaches jocular drawings where subject is drawn with rather odd features surrealistic paintings with combined fore and backgrounds van meegeren s portraits however are probably his finest works among his original works is his famous deer pictured above other works include his prize winning st laurens cathedral a portrait of actress jo oerlemans his second wife his night club from roaring twenties cheerful watercolor a summer day on beach and many others forger forged van meegeren s own work rose in price after he had become famous and it consequently became worthwhile to fake his paintings as well existing paintings obtained a signature h van meegeren or new pictures were made in his style and falsely signed when van meegeren saw a fake like that he ironically remarked that he would have adopted them if they had been good enough but regrettably he had not yet seen one later on however his son jacques van meegeren started to fake his father s work he made paintings in his father s style although of much lower quality and was able to place a perfect signature on these imitations many fakes both by jacques and by others are still on market they can be recognized by their low pictorial quality but are not always regarded as such notes and references further reading list of works kreuger
