richardson s previous novels novel follows story of harriet byron who is pursued by sir hargrave pollexfen after she rejects pollexfen he kidnaps her and she is only freed when sir charles grandison comes to her rescue after his appearance novel focuses on his history and life and he becomes its central figure novel incorporates an epistolary format similar to richardson s previous novels clarissa and pamela unlike those novels charles grandison leading male character is a morally good man and lacks villainous intent that is manifested by lovelace or mr b characters of clarissa and pamela respectively richardson was motivated to create such a male figure because of prompting of his many female friends who wanted a counterpart to virtues exhibited by richardson s female characters background exact relationship between fielding s history of tom jones a foundling and richardson s history of sir charles grandison cannot be known but character charles grandison was designed as a morally better hero than character tom jones in 1749 a friend asked richardson to give world his idea of a good man and fine gentleman combined richardson hesitated to begin such a project and he did not work on it until he was prompted next year june 1750 by mrs and miss sutton who were both very intimate with one clarissa and both extremely earnest with him to give them a good man near end of 1751 richardson sent a draft of novel to mrs donnellan and novel was being finalised in middle of 1752 while thomas a compositor and peter bishop a proofreader were working for richardson in his print shop during 1753 richardson discovered that printers in dublin had copies of history of sir charles grandison and began printing novel before english edition was to be published richardson suspected that they were involved with unauthorized distribution of novel and promptly fired them immediately following firing richardson wrote to lady bradshaigh 19 october 1753 want of same ornaments or initial letters in each vol will help to discover them if exported into england although they should put booksellers names that i have affixed i have got some friends to write down to scotland to endeavour to seize their edition if offered to be imported there were four dublin presses used to make unauthorized copies novel but none of them were able to add ornaments that could effectively mimic richardson s own however there were still worries about unlicensed copies and richardson relied on seven additional printers to speed up production of grandison in november 1753 richardson ran an ad in gentleman s magazine to announce history of sir charles grandison in a series of letters published from originals by editor of pamela and clarissa london printed for s richardson and sold by dodsley in pall mall and others first four volumes were published on 13 november 1753 and next two volumes appeared in december final volume was published in march to complete a seven volume series while a six volume set was simultaneously published richardson held sole copyright to grandison and after his death twenty fourth shares of grandison were sold for 20 pounds each posthumous editions were published in 1762 including revisions by richardson and 1810 plot summary as with his previous novels richardson prefaced novel by claiming to be merely editor saying how such remarkable collections of private letters fell into editor s hand he hopes reader will not think it very necessary to enquire however richardson did not keep his authorship secret and on prompting of his friends like samuel johnson dropped this framing device from second edition novel begins with character of harriet byron leaving house of her uncle george selby to visit mr and mrs reeves her cousins in london she is an orphan who was educated by her grandparents and though she lacks parents she is heir to a fortune of fifteen thousand pounds which causes many suitors to pursue her in london she is pursued by three suitors mr greville mr fenwick and mr orme this courtship is followed by more suitors mr fowler sir rowland meredith and sir hargrave pollexfen final one pollexfen pursues byron vigorously which causes her to criticise him over a lack of morals and decency of character however pollexfen does not end his pursuits of byron until she explains that she could never receive his visits again pollexfen unwilling to be without byron decides to kidnap her while she attended a masquerade at haymarket she is then imprisoned at grove with support of a widow and two daughters while he keeps her prisoner pollexfen makes it clear to her that she shall be his wife and that anyone who challenges that will die by his hand byron attempts to escape from house but this fails to prevent her from trying to escape again pollexfen transports byron to his home at windsor however he is stopped at hounslow heath where charles grandison hears byron s pleas for help and immediately attacks pollexfen after this rescue grandison takes byron to home of grandison s brother in law earl of l after pollexfen recovers from attack he sets out to duel grandison however grandison refuses on grounds that dueling is harmful to society after explaining why obedience to god and society are important grandison wins pollexfen over and obtains his apology to byron for his actions she accepts his apology and he follows with a proposal to marriage she declines because she as she admits is in love with grandison however a new suitor earl of d appears and it emerges that grandison promised himself to an italian woman signorina clementina della porretta as grandison explains he was in italy years before and rescued barone della porretta and a relationship developed between himself and clementina baron s only daughter however grandison could not marry her as she demanded that he an anglican protestant become a catholic and he was unwilling to do so after he left she grew ill out of despair and were willing to accept his religion if he would return and make clementina happy once more grandison feeling obligated to do what he can to restore clementina s happiness returns to italy however clementina determines she can never marry a heretic and so grandison returns to england and harriet who accepts him they are married and everyone is accorded their just deserts in a concluding note to grandison richardson writes it has been said in behalf of many modern fictitious pieces in which authors have given success and happiness as it is called to their heroes of vicious if not profligate characters that they have exhibited human nature as it is its corruption may indeed be exhibited in faulty character but need pictures of this be held out in books is not vice crowned with success triumphant and rewarded and perhaps set off with wit and spirit a dangerous representation in particular richardson is referring to novels of fielding his literary rival this note was published with final volume of grandison in march 1754 a few months before fielding left for lisbon before fielding died in lisbon he included a response to richardson in his preface to journal of a voyage to lisbon structure thumb right 220px samuel richardson reading aloud manuscript of sir charles grandison to a group of friends in 1751 coloured engraving by miss highmore national portrait gallery westminster england epistolary form unites history of sir charles grandison with richardson s pamela and clarissa but richardson uses form in a different way for his final work in clarissa letters emphasise plot s drama especially when lovelace alters clarissa s letters however dramatic mood is replaced in grandison with a celebration of grandison s moral character in addition to this lack of dramatic emphasis letters of grandison do not serve to develop character as moral core of each character is already complete at outset in richardson s previous novels letters operated as a way to express internal feelings and describe private lives of characters however letters of grandison serve a public function letters are not kept to individuals but forwarded to others to inform a larger community of novel s action in return letters share recipients responses to events detailed within letters this sharing of personal feelings transforms individual responders into a chorus that praises actions of grandison harriet and clementina furthermore this chorus of characters emphasises importance of written word over merely subjective even saying that love declared on paper means far more than love declared orally themes 20th century literary critic carol flynn characterises sir charles grandison as a man of feeling who truly cannot be said to feel flynn claims that grandison is filled with sexual passions that never come to light and he represents a perfect moral character in regards to respecting others unlike richardson s previous novel clarissa there is an emphasis on society and how moral characteristics are viewed by public as such grandison stresses characters acting in socially accepted ways instead of following their emotional impulses psychological realism of richardson s earlier work gives way to expression of exemplars in essence grandison promises spiritual health and happiness to all who follow good man s exemplary pattern this can be taken as a sort of political model of wise ruler especially with charles s somewhat pacifist methods of achieving his goals although flynn believes that grandison represents a moral character she finds grandison s goodness repellent richardson s other characters like clarissa also exhibit high moral characters but they are capable of changing over time however grandison is never challenged in way that clarissa is and he is a static passive character grandison in all situations obeys dictates of society and religion fulfilling obligations rather than expressing personality however a character like harriet is able to express herself fully and it is possible that grandison is prohibited from doing likewise because of his epistolary audience public in terms of religious responsibility grandison is unwilling to change his faith and clementina initially refuses to marry him over his religion grandison attempts to convince her to reconsider by claiming that her faith would not be at risk besides his dedication to his own religion and his unwillingness to prevent clementina from being dedicated to her own he says that he is bound to helping porretta family although potentially controversial to 18th century british public grandison and clementina compromise by agreeing that their sons would be raised as protestants and their daughters raised as catholics in addition to religious aspects work gives portrait of how a good marriage should be created and sustained to complement role of marriage grandison opposes sexual deviance in 18th century critical response samuel johnson was one of first to respond to novel but he focused primarily on preface if you were to require my opinion which part in preface should be changed i should be inclined to supression of that part which seems to disclaim composition what is modesty if it deserts from truth of what use is disguise by which nothing is concealed you must forgive this because it is meant well sarah fielding in her introduction to lives of cleopatra and octavia claims that people have an insatiable curiosity for novels or romances that tell of rural innocence of a joseph andrews or inimitable virtues of sir charles grandison andrew murphy in gray s inn journal emphasised history of production when he wrote sir walter scott who favoured bildungsroman and open plots wrote in his prefatory memoir to richardson to novels of samuel richardson 1824 although scott is antipathetic towards richardson s final novel not everyone was of same opinion jane austen was a devotee of novel which was part of her mental furniture to point where she could claim to describe all that was ever said or done in cedar parlour she would for example casually compare a flower in a new cap she got to white feather described by harriet byron as being in hers nevertheless throughout her life she also subjected grandison to much affectionate even satirical mockery adapting it into a dramatic lampoon not published until 1980 around 1800 her juvenilia also included a heroine who guyed harriet byron s frequent fainting through being in such a hurry to have a succession of fainting fits that she had scarcely patience enough to recover from one before she fell into another as late as 1813 she would respond to a long letter from her sister cassandra by exclaiming dear me like harriet byron i ask what am i to do with my gratitude later critics believed that it is possible that richardson s work failed because story deals with a good man instead of a rake which prompted richardson s biographers thomas eaves and ben kimpel to claim this might account for rather uneasy relationship between story of novel and character of its hero who is never credible in his double love or in any love flynn agrees that this possibility is an attractive one and conditions it to say that it is at least certain that deadly weighted character of sir charles stifles dramatic action of book john mullan suggests that problem stems from grandison s role as a hero when he says his hero is able to display his virtue in action as a consequence sir charles grandison presents its protagonist without minutely analyzed reflexes of emotion that brought his heroines to life some critics such as mark kinkead weekes and margaret doody like novel and emphasise importance of moral themes that richardson takes up in a 1987 article kinkead weekes admits that novel fails at moral crisis and it must be doubtful whether it could hope for much life in concluding volumes however critics such as jean howard believe that richardson s last novel is considerably better than can be easily imagined by those who have only heard about it but admittedly it represents a falling off
