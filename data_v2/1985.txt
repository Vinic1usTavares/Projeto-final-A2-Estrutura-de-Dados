bottle episode and reaching for emotional payoffs felt far too little too late he resumed nobody cares about any member of griffin family way we care about every last simpson i feel bad about meg becoming scapegoat not because she s a good character but because instead of tweaking and working to make her appreciated or comically valuable family guy spent years going down path of least resistance and simply joined fan chorus of hatred one episode of pointed forced justification for that shift doesn t change a thing mcfarland concluded his review by giving episode a grade of d similarly terron moore of ology felt that much of episode was wasted in his review moore stated that seahorse seashell party was an episode that spends a lot of time addressing something that didn t need to be addressed he gave episode a 4 5 out of ten points tv fanatic kate moon was less negative of episode stating that even though meg confronting her family in regards to her treatment was long overdue she concluded that it felt contrived and uninteresting critics were polarized with episode subplot while mcfarland expressed enjoyment of some of animation of episode he asserted that it fell flat moon exclaimed that subplot would have been more interesting had stewie ingested mushrooms alongside brian episode debuted in united kingdom on may 20 2012 and achieved 1 6 million viewers see
