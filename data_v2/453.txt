videoball received favorable reviews critics praised precision and craft of its game design as well as its welcoming aesthetics but remarked that its visual simplicity belied depth of its gameplay gameplay videoball plays as a two dimensional hybrid of air hockey and soccer on a single screen players form two teams of one to three players each player uses an analog stick to control a triangle shaped avatar and presses a single button to shoot triangle shaped projectiles object of game is to knock one or more circular balls into opposing team s goal players hold button to charge a shot which fires upon release projectile can propel ball block other projectiles and incapacitate opponents since shot is triangle shaped it can only drive ball for some distance before ball veers off course longer player charges their shot more powerful projectile becomes a tap of button shoots a small low impact projectile that disintegrates upon impact a medium tap about a second long creates a larger persistent triangle that dribbles ball as long as two continue to make contact third charge level shoots a large triangle that fires ball with explosive force this slam can be reversed by an opponent by firing any projectile into slammed ball if held for an additional second fourth level of a charged shot creates a defensive square barrier for player to place on playing field these square barriers will disintegrate upon absorbing player projectiles player triangles that collide with balls or projectiles are knocked back and briefly incapacitated many of game s common actions are named for instance players hit by projectiles are tackled and projectiles that hit projectiles are intercepted game supports up to six human or artificial intelligence players in local and online

announcers games last an average of four minutes though they can last several times more development videoball designer tim rogers describes game as an abstract minimalist electronic sport its development began as a dare from developer bennett rogers s friend to make a one button starcraft rogers founder of action button entertainment made what he estimated as 40 or 50 inconsequential prototypes before adding an analog stick to button videoball evolved from a slow paced strategy game to a fast paced sports game as it graduated from early prototypes rogers compared game s design process to austerity of gordon ramsay s kitchen nightmares wherein ramsay convinces failing restaurants to reduce their menu size and make those few dishes well rogers commented that this emphasis on fewer elements makes each element s nuances more prominent polygon tracey lien described development team s process as chasing a certain purity rogers conceived videoball as a sport without narrative or artifice and thus sought to avoid traditional video game metaphors such as knowing triangle avatars and projectiles as ships or bullets he wanted game to be accessible to newcomers but still fun and strategic for experts game designer applied his conception of super mario bros 3 sticky friction a sense through which player feels physics affecting their avatar to game s controls rogers emphasized importance of strategy in playing game and noted that players in prototype games played roles or zones like in competitive basketball e g center or forward positions rogers has livestreamed prerelease sessions of videoball via twitch he broadcast gameplay from twitch s booth at pax east 2014 with indie publisher midnight city in february 2014 pc gamer wes fenlon reported that game still had work left in its artwork soundtrack new arenas and online multiplayer mode videoball was selected for july 2014 evolution championship series fighting game tournament s indie showcase developers had plans to include cross platform multiplayer support for more than six simultaneous players and a campaign mode rogers has said that ranked matchmaking was highly requested by fans videoball was planned for release in 2014 and ultimately launched on july 12 2016 on playstation 4 xbox one and microsoft windows with iron galaxy as its publisher os x and linux releases are planned reception pre release reviewers all cited videoball minimalism both in aesthetics and gameplay and compared game with skill and strategy of football and basketball before its release pc gamer wes fenlon found himself thinking about videoball daily after last playing two weeks prior he credited its addictive sort of fun and his own excitement for local multiplayer on pc alongside titles such as and towerfall he felt that game s tagline of being appropriate for both a child s birthday party and prison was correct albeit silly fenlon praised game s minimalist visuals peppy music and chirpy sound effects he compared player s controls to that of asteroids and contrasted its simplicity with 100 hour process for league of legends having learned how to play videoball in just a couple minutes jason bohn hardcore gamer wrote that simple controls made game accessible for new teams to quickly strategize polygon tracey lien compared game s feel to basketball football and hockey citing strong role of strategy in playing game she compared array of projectiles fired to military strategy or a football play game informer kyle hilliard said his time with game left him wanting more graham smith rock paper shotgun found videoball difficult to spectate and had trouble distinguishing between players triangle avatars jason bohn hardcore gamer only became interested in game after testing it and credited quality of its game design with changing his opinion game received generally favorable reviews at launch reviewers noted precision and craft of its game design reviewers compared videoball to other games including south asian board game and a cross between asteroids 1979 and rocket league 2015 gamespot reviewer wrote that videoball was 2016 equivalent of rocket league in that both had idiosyncratic concepts and little prior anticipation but simple and fun gameplay samit sakar polygon felt that he was in control of all parts of his play even as he lost to computer controlled opponents joshua calixto kill screen found himself naming his preferred ball handling techniques as he played while nic rowen destructoid said that he would normally avoid game mechanics discussion in his reviews videoball is all about its mechanics he praised momentum and pleasing grip behind avatars and acceleration physics of changing direction or moving out of a full stop polygon sakar noted game s balance between competition and enjoyment despite game s simple controls destructoid found that sloppy play could easily backfire on player jason d aprile gamespot said that game depends on things knocking into each other for its entertainment such as bank shots and hitting opponents he disliked that only control style was tank style controls polygon initially wanted a tutorial mode but ultimately felt that single player arcade mode with set scenarios against two computer controlled opponents filled this need destructoid called arcade mode increasingly unfair in its addition of field disadvantages to player while polygon and destructoid praised artificial intelligence of computer controlled avatars gamespot wrote that they were simple and often ignored balls during single player matches critics praised game s welcoming aesthetics and some its visual design kill screen considered game s affect delightful and destructoid said its bright color scheme and rubber like surfaces were disarming and recalled feel of an inflatable castle polygon reviewer described title as having old school sensibilities in its arcade style visual design with simple geometry and flat 2d art he added that game succeeds in particular because of its goofy tone and delightful wrapper of music scrolling ticker and fanciful announcers which managed to charm him without appearing inauthentic gamespot reviewer wrote that videoball audiovisual replication of 1990s era sega aesthetics triggered instant warm and fuzzy nostalgia reviewers said that game s visuals deceptively betrayed depth of its gameplay calixto of kill screen concluded that videoball feels like it s trying to knock down barriers to entry in its bubbly and peaceful visual design with gradients and 90s japanese arcade style music he thought however that voiceovers were somewhat campy reviewers noted game s accessibility calixto of kill screen said that videoball countered a trend in games culture that relied on learning professional strategies online in order to play competitively he cited for experimentation in game s controls and saw videoball as being primarily concerned with awakening its own brand of diy hence reviewer s interest in naming his own techniques calixto further praised game for resisting standardization of one correct way to play with its variety of game fields while rowen destructoid doubted that videoball would be future of esports he concluded that game made for good local multiplayer fun and vastly preferred experience of local to online multiplayer he compared title to super bomberman in how quickly game escalates from a friendly match to cut throat competition references external links category 2016 video games category action button entertainment games category fantasy
