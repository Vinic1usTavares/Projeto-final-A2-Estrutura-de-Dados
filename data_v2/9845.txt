yakovlev yak 19 russian iak 19 usaf dod designation type 7 was a prototype soviet fighter built in late 1940s it was first soviet aircraft to be equipped with an afterburning turbojet klimov rd 10f that was derived from german jumo 004 engine only two examples were built as it was rejected for service by soviet air force development and description in april 1946 council of people s commissars ordered several design bureaux okb buro included that of alexander yakovlev to develop a single seat jet fighter to be equipped with a single lyulka tr 1 turbojet engine aircraft should have a maximum speed of at sea level and a speed of at an altitude of it should be able to climb to that altitude in 3 8 minutes or less and should have a maximum range of no less than yakovlev and his team were well aware that any derivative of their earlier yak 15 and yak 17 fighters then under development could not reach required speed because of their thick wings and chose to begin a clean slate design preliminary work used same pod and boom layout as had been used in earlier yakovlev designs although cockpit was located in front of engine tr 1 engine was plagued by delays and yakovlev devoted most of his efforts to designs that used rd 10 gordon kommissarov pp 212 18 by late june yakovlev had decided to use a more aerodynamically efficient tubular layout with engine buried in center of fuselage after it became clear that neither tr 1 nor imported british rolls royce nene or rolls royce derwent engines would be available to power prototypes yakovlev settled on newly available afterburning version of rd 10 first prototype was ordered to a very demanding schedule and was completed on 29 november 1946 gordon kommissarov pp 218 21 yak 19 had an flattened oval shaped metal semi monocoque fuselage with single seat cockpit and its teardrop shaped canopy positioned just forward of axial flow rd 10f turbojet engine its air intake was in nose and afterburner was positioned at rear of fuselage just below tail structure fitted with tricycle landing gear main landing gear retracted inwards into fuselage while nose gear retracted forwards laminar flow two spar straight wing was mounted in middle of fuselage it was equipped with modified fowler flaps and frise ailerons rudder was split into two sections by horizontal stabilizers upper portion was fabric covered while lower half was metal skinned pilot was protected by a bulletproof windscreen a forward armor plate and an armored seat back in addition he was provided with an ejection seat yak 19 was equipped with four fuel tanks in fuselage that had a total capacity of of fuel it was armed with two nudelman suranov ns 23 autocannon each with 70 rounds gordon kommissarov pp 221 23 testing day after first prototype was completed it was trucked to khodynka field to begin taxiing trials on 12 december it caught fire when a defective fuel gasket blew out repairs took a fortnight immediately before its maiden flight a pair of experimental 23 mm sh 3 autocannon replaced ns 23s it first flew on 8 january 1947 with lieutenant colonel mikhail ivanov at controls although he was not primary test pilot yak 19 was grounded from 2 march to 18 may as it awaited a new engine on 21 may afterburner was tested in flight for first time while fighter was first soviet aircraft to be equipped with an afterburner it was not first one to use one in flight as aircraft 156 had done so over a month earlier second prototype first flew on 6 june and was almost identical with first prototype changes included five degrees of dihedral to horizontal stabilizer a slightly revised vertical stabilizer and plumbing for a pair of drop tanks underneath wingtips this increased fighter s total fuel load to gordon kommissarov pp 223 25 during manufacturer s flight tests yak 19 became first soviet aircraft to exceed 900 km h major sergei anokhin was primary test pilot and reported that aircraft had pleasant and predictable flying characteristics and presented no difficulties for average pilot before testing was completed anokhin led jets participating in flypast at tushino airfield on 3 august gordon kommissarov p 225 state acceptance tests began on 17 october using second prototype and finished on 30 january 1948 group of military test pilots concluded that afterburner was unreliable and aircraft was difficult to control in roll other complaints were focused on cockpit it was deemed was too small and lacked sufficient armor and heating or ventilation they decided that yak 19 could not be recommended for service rather than modify aircraft to address these problems yakovlev chose to cancel it entirely in favor of designs using more powerful rolls royce derwent derived klimov rd 500 like his yak 23 and yak 25 fighters then under development gordon kommissarov pp 227 29 specifications yak 19 300px right see also notes bibliography gordon yefim kommissarov dmitry early soviet jet fighters manchester
