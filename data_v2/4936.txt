agustawestland apache is a licence built version of boeing ah 64d apache longbow attack helicopter for british army air corps first eight helicopters were built by boeing remaining 59 were assembled by westland helicopters now part of leonardo at yeovil somerset in england from boeing supplied kits changes from ah 64d include rolls royce turbomeca engines a new electronic defensive aids suite and a folding blade mechanism allowing british version to operate from ships helicopter was initially designated wah 64 by westland helicopters and was later given designation apache ah mk 1 also written as apache ah1 by ministry of defence apache was a valued form of close air support in conflict in afghanistan being deployed to region in 2006 apache has been an object of controversy over fitting of some weapons such as cluster munitions naval trials and temporary deployments at sea have proven aircraft as an able platform to operate from decks of ships which is a unique application of apache amongst its operators british apaches have also served in nato 2011 military intervention in libya operating from royal navy ships development requirement for a new attack helicopter was identified by british government in early 1990s in 1993 invitations to bid were issued bids received included eurocopter tiger a modernised bell ah 1 ah 64 apache boeing sikorsky rah 66 comanche and agusta mangusta both tiger and cobra variant were derided for requiring development and thus risk while apache was combat proven though its performance in first gulf war was criticised by competitors westland and apache was selected in july 1995 and a contract for 67 helicopters was signed in 1996 agustawestland 2011 p 2 in september 1998 westland produced first prototype wah 64 apache under licence from boeing mcgowen 2005 p 214 first nine apache ah1s were authorised for service by director of british army aviation on 16 january 2001 67th and final apache was handed over to british army in july 2004 helicopter fleet s cost was around ps3 1 billion with a total acquisition cost of ps4 1 billion national audit office 2002 p 8 reliability had been questioned by us apache operations entire fleet in balkans had been grounded due to serious tail rotor failures in 1999 in 1998 longbow radar s development ran into problems regarding its weight impact upon overall agility and data transfer abilities these problems with key aircraft components and fleet s high cost led to calls for its cancellation in 1999 when requirement for apache had been formalised in early 1990s military doctrine assumed that a large conventional armoured assault from eastern bloc was britain s main threat following collapse and break up of soviet union concepts of flexibility and rapid response took precedence national audit office 2002 p 6 uk s strategic defence review called for apaches to undertake amphibious attack missions operating from helicopter carrier hms ocean invincible class aircraft carriers and their successors queen elizabeth class aircraft carriers and possibly amphibious assault vessels hms bulwark and albion national audit office 2002 pp 9 22 23 each squadron equipped with apache should have eight operational aircraft heyman 2005 p 114 thumb left an apache s 30mm cannon alt soldier adjusting big gun hanging from helicopter westland apache experienced delays in entering service due to complications with modifications made for british service national audit office 2002 p 7 prior to apache entering service in 2004 several development problems were noted including a lack of ability to securely communicate with other helicopters and a risk of damage to tail rotor and airframe from firing its hellfire missiles problem with using hellfire was debris generated by firing of missiles both hellfire and crv7 rockets could strike body of aircraft and cause damage resolving this issue created a delay to training programmes these problems were corrected prior to entering service a secure communications suite was installed and hellfire missiles are routinely fired by apaches bishop and laurier 2005 p 47 in 2002 government sources stated that full operational capability was set to be achieved by 2010 national audit office 2002 p 22 in 2005 an out of service date for apache was forecast at 2030 but army is looking at a capability sustainment programme csp that will extend their life to 2040 it was thought that updates would be necessary by 2017 because us army is to withdraw support for ah 64d block i on which british apaches are based but us budget problems pushed this back to 2019 or 2020 britain was to select from block iii upgrades of ah 64e by 2014 options range from abandoning capability altogether to buying brand new block iii helicopters but boeing believe it is most likely that britain will remanufacture putting existing engines and avionics into new airframes in august 2015 uk requested through a us foreign military sale upgrade of 50 of its apaches to ah 64e standard in july 2016 uk announced a plan to order 50 ah 64es via a foreign military sale leonardo helicopters formerly agustawestland will continue to lead support existing apache ah1s until they are retired from service in 2023 24 a contract to re manufacture 38 ah 64s into ah 64es was announced in may 2017 https www com articles 2017 05 helicopters ah 64 rebuild html design thumb apache in training at lulworth bovington 2002 alt helicopter in flight above heathland several deviations were made to standard apache design used by us and those exported to other countries one major difference is use of a pair of rolls royce turbomeca rtm322 01 12 engines replacing original general electric t700 ge engines rolls royce engine produces vs for ge engine compared to many helicopters used by coalition forces in afghanistan apache required less modification to serve in region due to special filters incorporated into engine design another change is folding blade mechanism to stow helicopters in confined spaces rotor blades also have anti ice protection to allow operations in arctic environments there were changes made to sensor and avionics outfitting craft as well connectivity with bowman secure communications system to interact with other british military units being a significant one leonardo formerly selex es helicopter integrated defensive aids system hidas was also fitted hidas system was retrofitted onto aircraft in mid 2004 just prior to entering service along with several redesigned composite bodywork components hoyle 2004 p 59 an eye safe training laser to allow apache to function as a target designator was also installed instead of american hydra 70 rocket pods westland apache can carry up to 76 crv7 rockets crv7 uses a modular warhead a high explosive semi armour piercing warhead for attacks on unarmoured targets and a kinetic energy penetrator which contains no explosive for attacks on armoured targets raf history crv 7 there used to be a third type of warhead multi purpose sub munition which was a controversial weapon as it has been classified as a cluster bomb each rocket contained nine submunitions in may 2008 several senior officers such as general david spoke out against british plans to keep weapon in same month britain as one of 111 participating nations agreed to ban cluster bombs on humanitarian grounds britain destroyed last of its crv7 in july 2009 thumb left longbow radar screen alt pilot sitting in cockpit looking at controls like us ah 64d apache longbow apache ah1 carries a fire control radar fcr and radar frequency interferometer rfi providing an integrated surveillance and attack system longbow radar is bulbous unit over rotor hub assembly radar placement above rotors allows apache to hover behind cover scanning for targets with only radar unit exposed additionally longbow radar can monitor traffic in apache s airspace radar can also be used for surveillance and terrain profiling a modem is interfaced into longbow radar and other sensor systems to relay information to other aircraft this allows other apaches to fire on targets identified by only a single helicopter thumb longbow radar agustawestland have since made several upgrades to britain s apache fleet in may 2005 a 212 million contract was awarded to equip all 67 mk1 helicopters with apache arrowhead sensor system upgrade to be completed by 2010 united kingdom awards lockheed martin 212 million contract for arrowhead system production lockheed martin 2 may 2005 in 2009 it was announced that agustawestland was also integrating new external fuel tanks with ballistic protection some of internal fuel tanks can be removed apaches in afghanistan may have these removed to allow for extra ammunition for cannon to be fitted it has been suggested that advanced rotor blades and additional controls to improve agility of aircraft may be fitted in a mid life update of fleet finch 1996 p 2

apaches during 1991 gulf war unlike us versions westland apache has been partially navalised and now serves aboard royal navy ships in addition to its land based role it achieved maritime certification in december 2005 aboard hms ocean on 17 november 2006 hms ark royal became first aircraft carrier to land an apache ah1 they first appeared in combat as part of operation herrick in afghanistan in may 2006 in august 2006 intense usage of apaches in afghanistan led to british commanders admitting that weapons and spare parts were being used at a far greater rate and subsequently a greater cost than anticipated on 11 november 2007 it was reported that half of apache gunships in british service had been grounded as they had fallen below level considered fit for purpose along with several other british helicopters such as chinook and merlin hc3 by november 2008 situation had further declined out of 67 aircraft only 20 were available for combat operations in 2009 agustawestland was awarded a contract for support services for apache and many components such as longbow radar in following months senior officers noted that support change had resulted in higher availability in

afghanistan as an apache pilot in 2012 he subsequently deployed to afghanistan as part of 662 squadron in september 2012 three apaches were deployed to bardufoss air station in norway in january 2019 deployment known as exercise clockwork represented aircraft s first cold weather training within arctic circle afghanistan apache s first operational tour was as part of 16 air assault brigade in afghanistan there were eight apache ah1s deployed in afghanistan in february 2007 these were drawn from no 656 squadron and no 664 squadron of 9 regiment aac based at airfield unlike their american counterparts in afghanistan apache ah1 is deployed with its longbow fire control radar to enable pilot to better manage traffic in their airspace initially pilots had to often fly for 16 18 hours at a time due to low number of apaches in theatre typically each apache would be stationed in afghanistan for eight weeks before returning to britain for roughly eight weeks of maintenance on 22 may 2006 a

but instead hit members of a british patrol this was first time that a british aircraft had been involved in a blue on blue incident in afghanistan although apaches have become targets for insurgents no british apaches have been lost to enemy fire in september 2008 an apache was seriously damaged by a crash shortly after takeoff in helmand province no loss of life occurred but airframe was written off in early to mid 2009 several narcotics and bomb making facilities were raided by british forces supported by apaches in april 2009 it was reported that an apache had been used to intercept a suicide bombing attack in helmand province during summer of 2009 british apaches were an integral component of operation panther s claw which was aimed at pushing insurgents out of civilian areas in
