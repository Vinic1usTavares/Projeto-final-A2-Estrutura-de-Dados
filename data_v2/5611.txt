scribblenauts is an emergent puzzle action title developed by 5th cell and published by warner bros interactive entertainment for nintendo ds game was released in 2009 in all regions except japan and in 2011 in japan as by konami it is third nintendo ds video game made by 5th cell first two being drawn to life and lock s quest objective of scribblenauts as implied by its catchphrase write anything solve everything is to complete puzzles to collect starites helped by player s ability to summon any object from a database of tens of thousands by writing its name on touchscreen game is considered by its developers to help promote emergent gameplay by challenging player to solve its puzzles within certain limitations or through multiple solutions jeremiah slaczka creator and director of scribblenauts envisioned game as a combination of solving life situation puzzles alongside mad libs his vision was brought to realization through objectnaut engine created by 5th cell s technical director marius fahlbusch objectnaut allowed for a data driven approach and a significant portion of development time was spent researching nouns and their properties and categorizing them into objectnaut database this along with simple art designs of 5th cell s edison yan allowed for team to easily add new words to database without expending much effort to program new behavior scribblenauts was first shown in a playable form at 2009 electronic entertainment expo and became a sleeper hit winning several best of show awards being first portable console title to win such praise reviewers believed that 5th cell delivered on their promise to allow nearly any possible object to be created for use in scribblenauts but also lamented that choice of controls in game hampered their full enjoyment of title success of title has led to a number of sequels including super scribblenauts scribblenauts remix and scribblenauts unlimited series has sold over 13 million copies gameplay left

rope to rescue an injured woman during one of puzzle levels scribblenauts is an exclusively side scrolling game controlled almost entirely with nintendo ds stylus with d pad and face buttons controlling camera and left and right shoulder buttons rotating objects player controls a character named maxwell who must collect objects called starites to complete each level maxwell is guided by tapping touchscreen or if player taps an object maxwell will pick it up or be given other options for interacting with that object such as riding a horse or bicycle or shooting at an object if he holds a weapon a fundamental element of scribblenauts is ability of player to summon myriad objects into game this is achieved by writing name of an object on touchscreen for example player can write ladder summoning a ladder which player may use to climb to an out of reach starite player may turn ladder on its side and set it on fire player may also chain objects together such as chaining a piece of meat to a pole and holding it while riding on a raptor summoned objects range among animals weapons forces of nature famous people both fictional and real vehicles household objects easter eggs of development team and even internet memes however game does not include trademarked terms nor potential profanity summoning ass will spawn a donkey summoning cock will spawn a rooster game includes a homonym system to offer player possible choices between similar sounding objects such as distinguishing between a toy balloon and a hot air balloon there is also a spellchecker to provide close matches for misspelled words north american release includes support for other languages including brazilian portuguese french and spanish with french canadian and latin american variants available for words in french and spanish language sets respectively uk version also accounts for difference between american and british english such as differing meanings of word football 5th cell has stated that limit to what objects may be summoned is up to player s imagination players using special software claimed to have discovered that full list of words is greater than 22 800 unique entries but in response slaczka said there were many more than this number game is segmented into 220 levels over 10 themed areas and each given a 4 star ranking based on its difficulty with later areas featuring more high ranked levels puzzles are given a par for number of objects they can summon typically being between two and four though player is free to summon more so long as there is space in meter at top screen summoning same number of objects as par or less earns more points there are two types of levels puzzle and action levels puzzle levels are real life situations such as having to open a pinata where starite is awarded once puzzle is solved while action levels will appeal to gamers that prefer side scrolling platformers featuring switches spike traps and other similar elements players are awarded merits for completing levels while meeting certain requirements such as not summoning any weapon like object once player completes a level a silver star appears on level selection button and a free play mode is unlocked at that point player is given option to play through level three consecutive times without reusing objects successfully completing challenge grants player a gold star for that level scribblenauts presents a simplistic storyline as developers wished to focus on engaging gameplay game always rewards player with ollars its in game money to allow them to purchase new areas different avatars and other visual changes to game game includes a level editor allowing users to share these levels over nintendo wi fi system player can start with any level that they have already beaten from main game and add new objects with new game properties these new properties can vary significantly from normal behavior such as having a bear able to eat a plane development right thumb jeremiah slaczka creative director for 5th cell upon receiving game developers choice award for best handheld game for scribblenauts during 2010 game developers conference scribblenauts was first conceived in second quarter of 2007 near same time that they had envisioned lock s quest creative director for 5th cell jeremiah slaczka stated that they were seeking counterparts of nintendogs and brain age games that had attracted a much wider demographic than most other niche games that 5th cell could develop concept of scribblenauts came from a combination of a previous idea he had for ds that was similar to mad libs and a dream of his an example given for mad libs was that players could write a mad lib of a dog walking through a forest and a dog would appear in a forest and walk through it however he realized game would be tedious and that players would only be interested in using keywords dream was of being inside an aztec temple and having to solve puzzles one in particular involved three paintings with objective being straightening them and then moving on to next room through a portal while he thought it was a good idea for a game he also felt that it lacked both a hook and replayability he debated whether this would work best on wii or ds but later decided to combine writing element with a puzzle element to fix lack of replayability slaczka realized that concept of game might be considered impossible by other programmers but found that 5th cell s technical director marius fahlbusch felt confident they could create required elements developers considered that nature of flexible and sometimes unforeseen solutions made game strongly promote emergent gameplay during development slaczka and team tried to figure out what they could do with ds hardware trying to make scribblenauts appeal to everyone as lock s quest was thought of first they focused on releasing that game first while beginning development of scribblenauts game entered beta around may 2009 and had numerous play testers exploring game about half of 5th cell s staff worked on game it was developed alongside ds version of drawn to life next chapter scribblenauts was originally developed without having a publisher for game slaczka noted that unlike other games where developers could complete and polish a single level to garner interest while work on rest of game continued scribblenauts needed to show support for its large dictionary from start making it difficult to promote game company was in negotiations with a publisher in early part of 2009 letting that publisher decide when it would be best to announce game warner bros interactive entertainment officially announced itself as publisher for scribblenauts in may 2009 slaczka noted that of other publishers they talked to they felt warner bros was best one particularly due to their proximity to 5th cell and their interest in title scribblenauts was originally titled wordplay but team felt that this was generic title scribblenauts began as a temporary name that would be effective for pitching game but as development proceeded team couldn t think of a better one so name stuck and became final title of product konami published game in japan on january 27 2011 this localized version features konami characters such as old snake manaka takane and vic viper engine core engine of scribblenauts is a data driven engine called objectnaut created by fahlbusch within objectnaut each object is given a set of properties including physical characteristics artificial intelligence behavior and how player through maxwell can interact with it five people from team spent six months researching dictionaries and encyclopedias to create a large database of objects within objectnaut s framework and then mapped out a hierarchy of data from this information for example every mammal based object in game is given property of having organic flesh allowing it to be eaten or turned into meat without having to specify these functions for each type of mammal they used objectnaut approach allowed team to create two distinct objects for words that may have similar meanings simply by adjusting each word s properties in database lion tiger and leopard while similar will behave differently and have different art assets while only difference in game between croissant and danish is that danish may be able to roll like a wheel team made sure to balance abilities of various objects that could be summoned to avoid creating an uber character that would act as a skeleton key for solving all of levels and give players more courage to try different elements slaczka noted that he would be frequently asked if certain difficult words were in game when interviewed by press most of time being able to respond affirmatively to these questions in an example given by slaczka a hardcore journalist wanted twenty minutes with game to try to stump it during 2009 e3 convention but according to slaczka he had a real hard time stumping it and shook my hand after that period designing each item required developers to go word by word slaczka stated that certain kinds of words such as cheeses require little to no differences besides items such as which would scare people away from it he stated that developers used discretion when deciding what to make look different providing a cyborg robot and android which he felt were different enough to require their own individual designs he later stated that there was no way to test out each item and each way they interact with another item as it was virtually impossible for them to accomplish this using an example of an airplane being frozen brought back in time placing an old man on top of it bringing it back to present time and setting it on fire slaczka stated that while many games create a first level with enemies and platforms polishing level and moving on players can write any item available in level one that they can write in a later level he commented that if players wrote anvil and it was missing its heavy property they may be turned off of game they spent roughly 80 of development fine tuning various items and as such they could not provide a preview to demonstrate game each of words programmed into game has associated art with it led by 5th cell artist edison yan task of creating art was simplified through minimal design style of 5th cell s previous games each object is rendered as in 3d with objects acting as doll on a 2d plane this was chosen to avoiding having to create a large number of animations for 2d development team had to design each ai controlled object by hand according to slaczka describing how objects moves and what it likes and dislikes how much health it has and other possible characteristics level design focused on providing a large variety of situations including splitting levels between puzzle and action types to avoid having player develop a limited toolbox of common words and not exploring other possible solutions much of initial level development was done on paper and to explore situations not commonly found in video games due to their vocabulary system they ended up selecting more than a hundred levels out of over seven hundred they had generated internally for game both merits and ollars were added to reward player for completion with slaczka comparing these to xbox live achievements game primarily uses touchscreen to control maxwell and other objects developers considered using directional pad of ds but realized that they would still need to rely on touchscreen for certain actions and thus focused most of game s controls through that interface game includes 5th cell s own handwriting recognition system for writing down objects which slaczka considered to be better than nintendo s own system for brain age team included a virtual keyboard in addition to this system knowing that even human brain can t understand chicken scratch promotion thumb right alt

awards for e3 from any major gaming media outlet game was named best original game and best handheld game by game critics awards scribblenauts was named overall best of show by gamespot gamespy and ign in addition to other awards 1up com named scribblenauts their e3 s most innovative title x play gave game its e3 best original game and best handheld game awards ars technica considered game as show s most pleasant surprise joystiq performed a ten word test of game and found only one word was not yet present in game but were promised it would be in final version part of success at e3 was considered partially due to inclusion of then recent keyboard cat internet meme which led to a grassroots type excitement about game at convention adam sessler of g4 tv believed that scribblenauts e3 success was from being a small but successful game from a small company in contrast to numerous other premier titles from other major developers and publishers that have become standard for convention such that uniqueness of everything about game made it standout title of show scribblenauts was given a much more predominate display in warner bros interactive s booth at next major convention 2009 comic con international ign listed scribblenauts in a preview of nintendo ds games in 2009 labeling it as one of their top picks for year they described it as quite possibly one of system s most ambitious designs yet thumb right alt post 217 as drawn by 5th cell artist edison yan post 217 as drawn by 5th cell artist edison yan based on a neogaf post has been used as promotional material for game one example of possibilities of scribblenauts that led to further attention to game are given in esrb s attempt to describe cartoon violence and comic mischief within game as to grant it an e10 rating esrb s description includes possible examples of game s level of violence as a club can be used to hit an animal steak can be attached to a baby to attract lions rockets can be lobbed at a man in a post at neogaf within a thread dedicated to game user feep relayed experience of discovering during e3 that he was able to go back in time with a time machine to collect a dinosaur in order to defeat an army of robot zombies that could not be defeated with regular weapons story as memorialized as post 217 has led to 5th cell artist edison yan creating a desktop wallpaper image of story in appreciation of positive fan response to game and terms post two one seven feep and neogaf have been included as summonable objects in game slaczka credits word of mouth popularity of post 217 for part of game s success at e3 and noted that he had contacted feep to gain his permission to include feep appearing as a robot zombie within game neogaf forums proceeded to expand on their praise for game by creating a series of avatars of video game and other related characters which will not otherwise appear in game due to trademark issues for their forums inspired by yan s art design and even some of members that created avatars were contacted to work in second game super scribblenauts yan himself has drawn several more avatars in same style for other games such as street fighter ii and final fantasy vii release scribblenauts was found by reviewers to live up to premise that game was built on ability to bring about nearly any object imagined into game john walker of eurogamer considered game an incredible achievement with its word database so utterly complete in its collection of everything ever in universe and its on these terms craig harris of ign asserted that developers fully deliver on promise of allowing player to summon nearly any imagined object and core game alone is an incredibly versatile nintendo ds experience ben kuchera of ars technica praises game as undeniably new and impressive and urged players to support games that take risks with their innovation ray barnholt of 1up com noted that while game isn t exactly be all end all videogame that it received prior to release game remains unmissable due to its sheer novelty value game s feature of forcing player to consider different solutions when replaying levels was seen by anthony gallegos of gamespy as a really clever way to encourage replayability while subtly upping challenge however reviewers complained about game s poor controls to point that implementation almost kills a fantastic game according to ign s harris reviews specifically commented how touch screen is used both to manipulate objects placed in game and to move maxwell this would result in inadvertently having maxwell walk to his death or to disrupt a delicately prepared arrangement of objects prior to being ready to move him craig harris of ign notes that while one can direct maxwell indirectly character would often fail to avoid or overcome simple obstacles similar to troop movements in real time strategy games such that overcoming these issues requires a significant amount of precise controls by player it was suggested that while it was understood why 5th cell opted to use touchscreen in this manner to avoid too much flipping between stylus and face button controls they would have appreciated option for customizing controls decision to use touch screen controls was described by walker as possibly most wildly stupid design decision of all time and that if movement controls were mapped to face buttons game would have been a beautiful thing walker also questioned choice to have game s camera snap back to maxwell as soon as controls for it were released by player as it made it both difficult to set up objects that were off screen from maxwell and to watch results of certain interactions such as fights between computer controlled characters that occurred off screen when it is possible to connect objects to other objects reviewers found that finding connection points to be difficult and would often trigger maxwell to move barnholt described entire game as feeling like a prototype with its odd physics and not as polished as 5th cell s previous games though acknowledged overall game is still an impressive feat for small development team ign s ryan geddes criticized game s poor controls and physics demanding patience to overcome and raised concerns that title was rushed to market after its overwhelming positive response from e3 convention in a postmortem 5th cell s co founder joseph tringali stated that they were aware that controls would take a big hit from game reviewers and attempted to work in a face button control scheme but would have not been able to complete it within deadline set by their self funded schedule tringali further noted that they did not spend as much time on stylus controls earlier in development and would have considered sacrificing another feature like nintendo wi fi to improve them reviewers also identified some unexpected behavior from some objects or combinations of them such as attempting to direct a non player character in picking up an object leading to an inconsistency in difficulty of various puzzles ben kuchera of ars technica in calling scribblenauts a frustrating often maddening game described that he often encounters puzzles that after trying several solutions that should have worked by common sense he eventually happened upon a less logical solution that worked walker considered puzzles range between uninspired and simple and frustratingly obscure and fiddly many critics experienced that after getting stumped on a puzzle they would often resort to playing around in free play mode edge magazine identified that free play mode was more enjoyable as it masked problems with controls physics and general structure of puzzle game that followed it and considered what improvements in these modes could be made to create an experience closer to that of littlebigplanet in particular for action levels reviewers found that they would be less likely to explore alternate solutions and fall into pattern of using same set of objects making these levels repetitive towards end on other hand puzzle levels were well received andrew reiner of game informer stated time spent while solving puzzle levels was when his creative juices were joyously sapped presence of ollars currency system allows players to skip levels they found difficult also noted that with some puzzles game is often better played with others including young children as combination of imaginative ideas will likely eventually stumble upon a solution simon parkin of game set watch agreed believing game is best enjoyed when one thinks like a child as free of dry efficient logic of adulthood a child s imagination also opens game up in ways beyond most adults reach seth schiesel of new york times considers ultimate experience of game a let down after e3 hype due to controls and obfuscation of puzzles and though it was not a great game he considers concept a great idea that can be built upon for a possible sequel according to npd group scribblenauts sold 194 000 units in united states during september 2009 following mario luigi bowser s inside story and kingdom hearts 358 2 days in top nintendo ds sales game also showed strong sales during december 2009 becoming 16th best selling game of that month in north america by february 2010 game had sold more than one million units worldwide it was
