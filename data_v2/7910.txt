two danish resistance movement fighters nicknamed flammen and citronen during nazi occupation of denmark in world war ii attracted by story of pair since he was twelve madsen spent eight years along with co writer lars k andersen researching historical archives to produce it madsen s idea was to bring attention to story of flammen and citronen as he felt it had been neglected or misrepresented most expensive danish film produced to that date it was co produced by german companies because initially there was no interest in producing film in denmark portraying protagonists as morally ambiguous characters director tried to depict war as a complicated experience that goes beyond a good versus evil dichotomy with visual and narrative references borrowed from film noir and french film army of shadows flame citron also explores themes of love betrayal and emotional aspects of relationships film was released in denmark on 28 march 2009 to positive reviews most watched film in country

citronen stine stengade as ketty selmer peter mygind as aksel winther mille as bodil christian berkel as karl heinz hoffmann hanns zischler as horst gilbert flemming enevold as spex lars mikkelsen as frode jacobsen ravnen jesper christensen as flammen s father production director ole christian madsen had read book they saw it happen about nazi resistance when he was 12 he was especially attracted by story of pair because of their moral ambiguity madsen stated they both fascinated and scared me and i sensed there was something dark and untold in their story he wanted to make a film that would revive and reassess their reputation years later he met writer lars k andersen who had also read book during his childhood and this led them to envision a film project started in 1999 idea for film did not attract sponsors because it was viewed as past history or because it portrayed resistance outrageously this was precisely one of madsen s objectives to talk about their story because danish wartime archives listed many fatalities simply as casualties of war instead of counting them as murders thus suppress ing their real story he wanted to bring attention to a part of danish history nation has since neglected to talk about resulting in a collective misrepresentation by discussing it hoped not to talk about only past but present since he thinks that to understand what happens in world s focal points today goes through history and that story of two illegal rebels is an eternally useful story even if it is played out in 1944 even in wake of major companies refusal to support project madsen and andersen continued to research archives in england germany and sweden in 2005 however german films about world war ii started to become popular and several german companies became interested in idea for film it became a co production between denmark and germany with three companies nimbus film film and babelsberg studio producing it by october 2006 it had already got 75 of its then 45 million danish kroner or 7 6 million budget from danish film institute danish tv 2 and other financiers in norway sweden and germany filming started march 2007 and lasted until may 2007 large parts of film were shot at locations in copenhagen denmark and prague czech republic and it also took place at babelsberg locations in potsdam babelsberg germany it received a 000 460 000 grant from for its total budget of 8 6 million 6 3 million making it most expensive danish film produced to that date originally madsen planned to create a docudrama style film but when he discovered ketty was a russian spy and had a love affair with flammen he changed his mind this finding forced me to make film a much more stylish more noirish piece of work even so i tried to keep a soft touch style wise out of respect for film s subject said madsen he tried to make it feel real by eliminating distance to 1944 and directing film as if it were set in present thumb 150px mads mikkelsen pictured was chosen by director madsen because of his masculinity and his animal like attitude thure lindhardt a frequent collaborator in madsen s films with an ability to slip himself into any part according to director was cast as flammen mads mikkelsen was chosen to play citronen by director before his international career was launched because as madsen said he has this grand masculinity and he approaches his roles like an animal both lindhardt and mikkelsen were cast early in project in about 2005 and stine stengade was cast as ketty even earlier in 2001 casting process wasn t really difficult because i didn t feel that so many people could play these parts madsen stated style visual style was described by director as a mix of his own former films which varied from film noir in its essence very dark and very eclectic to hand held more visually relaxing guy lodge of incontention described it as owing much to film noir in intricacy of its narrative and lush shadow drenched stylization of its visuals wally hammond for time out london said its cinematography varies between atmospheric noir esque period evocation and modern widescreen stylings with excellent use of low key lighting silhouettes and location mark jenkins of npr said it had a classic look both in visuals and in storytelling visually with widescreen compositions overhead shots and dramatic contrasts of light and dark and in its narrative s ome sequences are quick and messy but others are grand and theatrical joe morgenstern critic for wall street journal said pace is deliberate and tone is pensive albeit punctuated by occasional violence madsen was influenced by jean pierre melville s army of shadows 1969 about french resistance especially way it told its story through only rituals and dialogue he watched it about half a year before filming flame citron and it also inspired mythologizing of characters in flame citron manohla dargis of new york times affirmed you can see melville touch in impenetrable shadows that spill across mr madsen s carefully composed mise en scene and in fedoras and trench coats worn by his two heroes erica abeel of hollywood reporter said in its tough mindedness flame citron owes much to jean pierre melville s army of shadows themes in film madsen tried to challenge idea of war as black and white and idea that resistance was a cohesive whole he says of war that it has many more nuances it is grayer less defined when an enemy may stop being one at any time and a friend can become an enemy overnight things become less clear ella taylor of village voice commented flame citron is less about battle between good and evil than about losing one s way in fog of war which makes it hard to tell friend from foe and harder yet to sort through rules of engagement and complicates heroic honor codes of movies about good war marshall fine of huffington post asserted that violence in film is double edged it takes its toll on perpetrator as well as victim similarly irish timess derek scally stated film analyses dehumanising effect of assassinations on assassin madsen tried to explore this moral dilemma drama behind story of illegals and human psychology in crisis situations madsen ultimately defined his film as an investigation of what happens psychologically to someone who sacrifices himself in war because of this he portrayed flammen and citronen as modern heroes with cracks in their souls and doubts and insecurities citronen even reflected upon killing people but as madsen said he did it he sold out his humanity for highest price kenneth turan of los angeles times described story as a psychologically complex look at what heroism does to heroes actions these men take tear at their lives their families their very essence morgenstern analysed it as a meditation on nature of heroism and quest for purity of purpose turan even said it is more nihilistic than idealistic while tirdad derakhshani of philadelphia inquirer asserted that it balances whizzing bullets and political intrigue with an elegiac tone and an existential edge just this side of nihilism its depiction of resistance in a non heroic way made it a one off film in danish cinema according to film historian lars martin sorensen another theme film deals with is bureaucracy in resistance according to ty burr of boston globe as main pair would prefer to work as freelancers writing for washington post michael o sullivan said film also has a surprisingly contemporary subtext as when hoffmann in an abortive showdown with flame calls his would be assassin a well intentioned but ultimately misguided terrorist don t you realize hoffmann asks you re just a tool for someone with less pure motives burr also commented that film repeatedly poses that question who s being set up here and pointedly refuses to answer by its silence it suggests that in wartime everyone can be both user and used kenneth turan affirmed that flame citron has several themes as it is chock full of plot and incident action and romance loyalty and betrayal derakhshani stated it virtually every element of classic genre piece violence sex and romance gunplay spies betrayals a femme fatale and a murderous gestapo officer cynthia fuchs of popmatters noted that though he has to deal mainly with moral questions flame confronts an emotional complication in conventional form of a woman abeel argued that for beneath his stony exterior it s flame s romantic soul that will prove his worst enemy this masterful film is at once a portrait of wartime heroism and a poignant journey into a boy s secret heart release flame citron debuted in danish theaters on 28 march 2008 and premiered on 28 august 2008 in germany film was seen by over 770 000 people in europe it had a public of 668 000 in denmark making it most watched film in country that year it grossed 9 210 518 in denmark for a total of 10 186 084 from screenings in twelve other countries

2009 and its home media release was on 23 february 2010 critical reception domestic reviews critical response to film was mixed but mostly positive in denmark including praise for madsen s direction performances of lindhardt mikkelsen stengade and mygind opinions were divided about portrayal of main characters film has shocked danish audiences for its portrayal of protagonists as non heroic and has been criticised by historians ebbe iversen commented that it can be both good and bad to have morally ambiguous characters as it can be seen as an artistic force to have authentic protagonists psychology but it can also be frustrating to have their motives portrayed as enigmatic critic stated it did not make it a bad film instead its subtle not uncritical portrayal of resistance seems sober and serious style is worked out to smallest detail and in its outer form film is type of work that you unkindly call conventional and more kindly describe as classic henrik of praised action sequences for its details even saying it is best danish war film ever and said it is also a booming interesting history and a multifaceted psychological portrait not only of flame and citron but also of many people they come across in their path kim of politiken said it had more gunfire than psychology and that it lacked a more detailed explanation of characters backgrounds that would justify their personalities writing for jyllands posten johs h christensen wrote that there never occurs any real connection no excitement no interaction no common destiny between flame and citron although they are inextricably linked most of time dr s per juul carlsen declared on that although film is visually beautiful he is not sure it should be this way had it not been better and more correct to tell story really ugly and blurry in rain instead of sunshine with realism instead of polished he also criticized it for sharing too much of american gangster and spy film cliches most critical review was done by of dagbladet information who criticized its historicity and thought characters were psychologically underdeveloped and uninteresting metz wrote nicest thing one can say about this film if it is nice is that it celebrates naive view of history and described it as a neo nationalistic of predominantly cardboard figures that will be suitable for evening entertainment for danish people s party and liberal party congresses quite apart from that about a third of dialogue is hard to understand because players do not articulate appropriately international reviews film was generally well received by western critics based on 70 reviews collected by rotten tomatoes it has an overall approval rating of 86 percent from critics and an average score of 6 77 out of 10 according to website s consensus film though lengthy and sprawling is gripping and competently made metacritic which assigns a normalised rating from 100 top reviews by mainstream critics calculated a score of 74 based on 20 reviews indicating generally favorable reviews walter stated t hough material might lend itself to heavy handedness director ole christian madsen is steady and he gets fine performances from two leads and stine stengade actors performances were also praised by fine who said lindhardt and mikkelsen make a fascinating team while stengade is appropriately slippery todd mccarthy from variety asserted that p are low key but resolute and brimming with nerves and intensity marc savlov of austin chronicle commented that mikkelsen and lindhardt are spectacularly invested in their roles beyond that is a drop dead gorgeous period noir rife with paranoia femmes fatales and good men inexorably sinking into bloody mire and opaque texture of life and death during wartime abeel praised how by a voiding docu style string of anecdotes of many fact based films it offers and irony of classic drama hammond commended madsen as film achieves a sense of psychological complexity and a pervasive atmosphere of fear and confusion without sacrificing rhythm and dramatic tension necessary to a war film owen gleiberman of entertainment weekly praised its combination of sharp scenes of moral inquiry with a few too many functional espionage twists fuchs applauded interpolation of emotional relations as they help to make flame citrons taut action even more effective beautifully choreographed and filmed in deep shadows that cut violence into shadowy brutal fragments flame and citron s jobs are at once thrilling and disconcerting kate taylor from globe and mail however said romantic relationship predictable in a james bond kind of way is weakest link in script nick de semlyen from empire considered it an average film saying it s familiar ground for anyone who s seen black book or sophie scholl but director ole christian madsen steers a skilful course keeping things grim but not to an off putting extent bringing a david lynch esque vibe to flame s hotel dalliances with a shady lady and pulling off an incredible death scene for one of leads noel murray of a v club criticized it for hammer ing too hard on shopworn theme of how war sickens souls far more interesting is flame citrons other theme idea that war turns notion of shades of gray into a luxury v a musetto for new york post commented that although it features well choreographed shootouts and assassinations its script is too melodramatic and complicated for its own good burr mostly praised it but said that madsen eventually loses his way stating that there was not enough information about citron and that film feels packed with events and frustratingly unfocused derakhshani argued that it has some rough tedious patches at 130 minutes it s simply too long and its reiteration of hollywood cliches isn t always successful regardless it is along with paul verhoeven s black book one of most accomplished films to come out of recent wave of and revisionist ww ii films comparisons to other films jenkins said best scenes in flame and citron are ones who share army of shadowss chaos and he criticised what he described as an aspiration to be a noble national epic rather than rougher more universal tale of two desperate men fighting for a cause to jenkins melville s film had a more cogent outlook because f nazis was just like any other gang war a mad scramble to survive on other hand dargis commented that army of shadowss lack of pity makes it so unbearably sad its almost repellent hardness of heart what flame citron has instead are decent men taking down nazis and some appealing actors slant magazines tom stempel affirmed i found army of shadows both admirable and chilling and in some ways flame citron is even better thumb 150px left flame citron was compared by several reviewers to black book a 2006 dutch film by paul verhoeven pictured although he praised beautifully choreographed and shot action sequences murray criticized flame citron for lean ing toward handsome and thoughtful when it could stand to be a lot dirtier and more visceral citing black book as a superb counter example stempel declared that it is not as exciting as black book but verhoeven was dealing with people having to make complex moral decisions instantaneously flame citron takes its time to turn screws on its characters and us ella taylor argued in favor of flame citron saying it is film that horribly overrated black book could have been had paul verhoeven not indulged in puerile reversals of sensitive nazis and treacherous partisans fuchs also compared moral dilemmas characters have to deal with to black book and steven spielberg s munich but said flame citron does not have splendid excess and weird conflation of maternal bodies and of two films respectively gleiberman could feel shadow of steven spielberg s munich hovering over flame citron another film it was compared to was inglourious basterds brad auerbach for entertainment today wrote that whereas inglourious basterds contains a bevy of cleverly humorous moments as it builds to its climax flame citron is a calculated and somber treatment of an intriguingly difficult topic o sullivan said that inglourious basterds style wish fulfillment this isn t and burr dubbed it anti inglourious basterds o sullivan said that it shared similarities to butch cassidy and sundance kid as it is story of handsome rogues with guns it s fast paced stylish and thrilling but it also raises one tough question kate taylor however commented that as opposed to cassidy and kid flammen and citronen remain an imperfectly matched duo st louis post dispatchs joe williams said that in contrast to lavish thrillers black book inglourious basterds and avatar of hollywood ish heroic defiance flame and citron is lean and psychological rooted in either or of wartime choices art house film status usually described as a drama or a thriller flame citron can also be classified as a historical drama a war film a war drama or a war thriller and a gangster drama as it has been screened in art house theaters in united states and europe it has also been described as an art house film lodge stated it has stately middle arthouse stylings and thriller overtones walter addiego of sfgate commented that it has look and sometimes pacing of a serious hollywood picture but it has an art house mood nick roddick of london evening standard commented that it could succumb to sod s law of foreign language cinema make movie too commercial and you risk losing both audiences abeel opined this icy portrait of two assassins shooting nazis point blank offers no hollywood style uplift to mollify mainstream viewers but flame citron should pull in a niche group of world war ii connoisseurs and will delight art house and fest audiences with its innovative mix of drama and history filtered through genre awards and nominations film was nominated for fourteen robert awards winning best costume design best make up best

committed by resistance movement had been a taboo subject since world war ii with scholarly literature on topic only being produced from 1980s and 1990s contemporary works on flammen and citronen have been scarce madsen opined i think they didn t fit into official storytelling on how denmark behaved during second world war many of members of resistance suffered from different traumas became alcoholics or committed suicide and a very few survived because of this in addition to conducting research for eight years in historical archives madsen and his crew interviewed surviving people related to them nonetheless film has sparked controversy among historians depiction of flammen s death was challenged by danish national archives s in film flammen commits suicide in basement of his house after gestapo find him presumably because of ketty s betrayal birkelund however says flammen was killed on a coastal road while gestapo was looking for another resistance member in contrast filming of citron s death which would require 250 soldiers was consciously altered by madsen for budgetary reasons ketty s depiction as a double agent and flammen s lover has also been contested by birkelund however madsen was sure about affair and found in a stockholm archive a receipt for 20 000 danish crowns given to her by gestapo two days after flammen s death her involvement with gestapo leader hoffmann and her refusal to talk about topic were main reasons for madsen s conclusion in film aksel winther who is based on vilhelm leifer is one who gives flammen and citronen orders to kill birkelund pointed out that he had already moved to sweden by time of their assassinations while madsen stated he was sure leifer gave orders before leaving country also they met frode jacobsen in a meeting in sweden and he is said to have given orders from there birkelund rejected idea of jacobsen giving orders but madsen said meetings were created by him to show that resistance movements of that time had approaches different from those of their present day counterparts citron s relationship with his wife was debated because historians doubt that she betrayed him since she gave birth to their child shortly after his death madsen was sure betrayal happened but he took liberty of affirming couple did not get back together madsen declared i do not think it is morally tarnished to show that people have affairs with people they are not married to it s a beautiful description of a relationship that falls apart in a time that had great personal cost ole ewe a former member of bopa another group in danish resistance movement disagreed with description of attempt to kill gestapo leader hoffman on road in film car had nazi flags and a soldier and his son are killed by resistance gunfire ewe said that on that day he and other bopa members were enlisted to kill a gestapo informer flammen who also received tips about informer s whereabouts appeared there and shot up car ewe said that man in car was in civilian clothes and there were no nazi flags on car according to irish times flame citron has sparked an emotive public debate in denmark that has drawn all sorts of pseudo experts out of woodwork to debate portrayal of period and two true life figures madsen defended himself saying it was an interpretation that though it may not correspond absolutely to reality is somehow more true mikkelsen stressed that they were first to do original research yet we suddenly had a lot of so called experts telling us how it really was and how we were wrong actor affirmed not too much is known about period and they hope it sparks debate so people will research and think some more about it in book historicizing uses of past edited by helle bjerg claudia lenz and erik authors compared criticism flame citron received for its historical representation to that received by max manus man of war a norwegian film about norwegian resistance movement while madsen s film has been highly criticized by historians max manus gained status of real past and received only a few criticisms that were dismissed by resistance veterans politicians and even king harald v bjerg et al argued that difference in reception may be attributed to films content saying in stark contrast to flame citron max manus doesn t challenge notions of right and wrong side and unambiguous good cause
