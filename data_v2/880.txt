rudolf wolters august 3 1903 january 7 1983 was a german architect and government official known for his longtime association with fellow architect and third reich official albert speer a friend and subordinate of speer wolters received many papers which were smuggled out of spandau prison for speer while he was imprisoned there and kept them for him until speer was released in 1966 after speer s release friendship slowly collapsed wolters objecting strongly to speer s blaming of hitler and other nazis for holocaust and world war ii and they saw nothing of each other in decade before speer s death in 1981 wolters who was born to a catholic middle class family in northern german town of coesfeld obtained his degree and doctorate in architecture from technical university of berlin forging a close friendship with speer while a student after receiving his doctorate he had difficulty finding employment prior to nazi rise to power from 1933 to 1937 he worked for reichsbahn in 1937 speer hired him as a department head and wolters soon took major responsibility for hitler s plan for large scale reconstruction of berlin when speer became minister of armaments and war production in 1942 wolters moved to his department remaining his close associate after speer s indictment and imprisonment for war crimes wolters stood by him in addition to receiving and organizing speer s clandestine notes from spandau which later served as basis of his best selling books of memoirs wolters quietly raised money for speer these funds were used to support speer s family and for other purposes according to directions which wolters received from his former superior following speer s release in 1966 their friendship gradually deteriorated until two men became so embittered that wolters allowed papers demonstrating speer s knowledge of persecution of jews to become public in 1980 wolters was involved in reconstruction of west germany following world war ii rebuilding his hometown of coesfeld among many other projects wolters wrote several architectural books during war as well as a biography of speer early life wolters was born into a catholic family in coesfeld germany on august 3 1903 son of an architect who had married daughter of a master carpenter in shipbuilding trade in his privately published memoirs segments of a life wolters described his father as a serious conscientious and diligent man always concerned about future wolters regarded his mother as a highly practical woman full of zest for life who in hard times thought nothing of serving a delicious roast without letting on it was horsemeat wolters passed a generally happy childhood punctuated by chaos of war years and by a childhood illness that resulted in his being taught at home for a year by two priests thumb left old northern front of technical university of berlin which was considerably damaged during second world war and replaced by a modern front in 1960s after passing his abitur or secondary school examination he began his architectural studies at technical university of munich in 1923 wolters noted politicized atmosphere of his student days stating my academic freedom began one might say to sound of drums hitler putsch and its consequences to us students most of whom were in agreement with it wolters by his own admission was in broad sympathy with nazi aims though he never saw a need to join party in 1924 wolters met albert speer who was a year behind him wolters transferred to technical university of berlin later that year followed by speer in 1925 wolters sought to study under professor hans but there was no room in course for transfer student instead wolters studied under heinrich tessenow as did speer wolters obtained his degree in 1927 and earned his doctorate at school two years later in class prize competition wolters generally finished second to speer wolters graduation coincided with start of great depression and he had great difficulty finding a job eventually settling for an unpaid position at reichsbahn headquarters in berlin in 1930 upon losing that position following year wolters accepted a position with trans siberian railway s urban planning division in novosibirsk nazi era in 1933 wolters returned to berlin where he briefly worked as an assistant in speer s office before returning to reichsbahn this time getting paid for his work speer had forged a close relationship with hitler and in late 1936 speer informed wolters that dictator would soon appoint speer as gbi or general building inspector for reich capital and suggested that wolters resign his post with railway and come work for him again wolters did so beginning work at gbi office in january 1937 as a head of department in planning bureau wolters was one of a number of young well paid assistants of speer at gbi who were collectively nicknamed speer s kindergarten most of were not nazi party members since speer found that party duties interfered with working time and kindergarten was expected to work long hours speer had hitler s permission to hire non nazis so gbi became something of a political sanctuary thumb a model of speer s plan for berlin centered on prachtstrasse wolters later wrote of his views at this time i had viewed hitler and his movement with some skepticism but when abolition of multi party mess removed obscenity of unemployment and first 1 000 kilometers of autobahns opened up a new era of mobility i too saw light this was time when churchill said he hoped great britain would have a man like hitler in time of peril and when high church dignitaries and distinguished academics paid fuhrer homage much of wolters work at gbi was connected to hitler s plan for large scale reconstruction of berlin dictator had placed speer in charge of this plan centerpiece of scheme was a grand boulevard long dubbed by speer as prachtstrasse street of magnificence or north south axis for which main design responsibility was delegated to wolters wolters was also responsible for transport rings in new berlin for museums and for gbi s press office in 1939 wolters became responsible for architecture portion of magazine die kunst im deutschen reich art in german reich wolters made several trips abroad in connection with his duties for gbi he visited united states to study advanced transport systems and paris for 1937 international exposition there in 1939 joseph goebbels appointed him exhibition commissioner wolters took charge of organizing german architectural exhibits presented in other countries until 1943 wolters traveled to other european capitals and in addition to his duties as commissioner gathered political intelligence on his return wolters passed along his insights to speer and some of these thoughts reached hitler s ears in 1940 wolters a longtime diarist suggested to speer that he begin keeping a chronik or chronicle of gbi s activities speer agreed and instructed department heads to send wolters raw material for chronik on a regular basis among other matters chronik detailed gbi s responsibility for administering a 1939 amendment to nuremberg laws which allowed aryan landlords to evict jewish tenants with virtually no notice for example entry for august 1941 included this information according to a speer directive a further action for clearing of some five thousand jewish flats is being started november entry noted that roughly 4 500 jews were evacuated dispossessed jews were sent to occupied territories with newspapers reporting as directed by goebbels over past few days many jews have hurriedly left germany leaving debts behind them wolters was given additional task in 1941 of setting up a special section of government publishing house which specialized in works of architecture wolters wrote several books on third reich s architectural works during war years he rejected notion that nazi architecture was an imitation of classical models those who speak of neo classicism have not understood spirit of our buildings thumb left wolters right at an exhibition in lisbon in 1942 with speer and president of portugal in february 1942 following death of fritz todt hitler appointed speer as minister of armaments and war production wolters followed speer to his new ministry becoming head of department of culture media and propaganda of organization todt wolters continued his chronik in new position in december 1943 speer put wolters in charge of planning for reconstruction of bombed german cities wolters organized a working group of about twenty architects and city planners mostly from northern germany work of this group known as arbeitsstab task force for reconstruction planning would form basis for actual postwar reconstruction of germany speer who authorized group saw an opportunity to make german cities more habitable in age of automobile group sought solutions which would use existing street system rather than grand ceremonial boulevards common in nazi city planning in addition arbeitsstab issued extensive guidelines ranging from width of avenues that carried streetcar lines to ratio of theatre seats to inhabitants wolters rarely met hitler and only in company of other members of speer s office he later recorded of course from these few experiences i cannot judge hitler s personality but having shared with speer his virtually daily contacts with him and being familiar with hitler s ideas for example on town planning i think that commentators are making it easy for themselves now when as they frequently do they resort in their descriptions to simplistic epitaphs such as buck private wall painter petit bourgeois philistine or history s greatest criminal wolters longtime secretary marion riesser was half jewish and wolters protected her throughout war in late 1944 word reached them that those with jewish ancestry who remained free would be called up and used for cannon fodder wolters met with riesser and three other half jews in speer organizations telling them if it became necessary which it did not four would be transferred to essential war factories where they would be safe wolters told them with albert speer s help one can do anything in february 1945 as nazi regime collapsed speer instructed wolters to take other high ranking officials in his department including heinrich lubke and set up architectural offices in north of germany to work on large scale prefabricated housing speer expected to join them but not then as he anticipated that allies would want to use his expertise towards reconstruction of germany this did not come to pass speer was arrested and charged with war crimes after war architectural work thumb hotel konigshof bonn as speer had instructed wolters set up a small office in north german town of with lubke who knew town s mayor new office was soon commissioned to rebuild a bridge which had been destroyed contrary to speer s instructions to preserve infrastructure later in 1945 office was dissolved and wolters returned to his hometown of coesfeld where he had been commissioned to rebuild ruined city lubke instead turned to politics rising quickly through political ranks of postwar germany in 1959 lubke became president of federal republic of germany a position in which he served almost ten years before he resigned over questions about what he may have known about forced labor while working in speer s department wolters was forced to rebuild in coesfeld almost from scratch with widespread destruction he had to lay out lots and rebuild streets all without delay he built a road through grounds of local castle and converted building into a hotel and conference center versatility he showed in rebuilding of coesfeld led to other commissions from german cities including and anholt in 1947 and 1949 wolters organized meetings of former arbeitsstab members many of whom were intensively involved in postwar reconstruction efforts in 1950 wolters won a competition to design new police headquarters in dortmund hotel konigshof in bonn rebuilt by wolters had previously been leading hotel in city it reopened by hosting president of italy in 1956 on his state visit and again became leading hotel in then capital of federal republic hosting heads of states including u s presidents kennedy nixon and reagan state dinners and events hosted by chancellor of germany wolters received so many commissions from government of north rhine westphalia that he opened an additional office in dusseldorf in 1955 wolters won a competition to design industrie kreditbank building in dusseldorf two years later he was again successful in that city in a competition to design conzen wolters was awarded a prize for his design to reconstruct dusseldorf s altstadt old city his son fritz wolters also an architect described him as a man who fought uncompromisingly for what he saw as whole in urban planning and once ended a discussion with a local committee with remark that they had rented his head not his pencil wolters also considered himself to be a functionalist designing a number of concrete flat roofed modern hospitals in 1960s wolters and his son shared an office until their architectural differences separated them fritz wolters being more interested in small details rather than in what he described as epoch making solutions however their personal relationship survived this professional separation in 1978 wolters published a book on town centre of berlin but despite suggestions from his son he declined to include his views about nazi architecture and never did set forth such views to his colleagues association with speer spandau years wolters did not attend nuremberg trial he later described it as a victor s court and as a show trial but wrote to speer in january 1946 during trial i stand by you in misfortune as in good days i believe as before in your lucky star on august 10 as trial approached its conclusion speer anticipating likelihood of a death sentence wrote to wolters asking him to collect my work together for later ages and to recount much of my life i think it will be honored one day despite his forebodings speer did not receive death sentence but on october 1 1946 was given a sentence of twenty years in prison and on july 18 1947 was transferred to spandau prison to serve it wolters and longtime speer secretary annemarie kempf while not permitted direct communication with speer in spandau did what they could to help his family and carry out requests speer put in letters to his wife only written communication officially allowed speer beginning in 1948 speer had services of a sympathetic dutch orderly to smuggle mail in 1949 wolters opened a special bank account for speer or school fund account and began fundraising among those architects and industrialists who had benefited from speer s activities during war at first funds were used only to support speer s family but as amounts grew and speer s family became increasingly able to support itself money was used for everything from vacations for speer s spandau conduit toni proost to bribes for those who might be able to secure speer s release once speer became aware of existence of fund he would often send detailed instructions about what to do with money wolters raised a total of dm158 000 for speer over final seventeen years of his sentence thumb left town of coesfeld reconstructed by wolters in 1951 with secret means of communications established wolters sent his first letter to speer in five years he suggested that speer move ahead with his memoirs in january 1953 speer began work on his draft memoirs and over next year lengthy missives sometimes written on tobacco wrappings or candy wrappers but most often on toilet paper made their way to wolters office in coesfeld marion riesser who had continued as wolters secretary as he began private architectural practice transcribed these notes into as many as forty closely typed pages per missive and draft totalled 1 100 pages wolters objected that speer called hitler a criminal in draft and speer presciently observed that he would likely lose a good many friends were memoirs ever to be published wolters had come to believe that reports of nazi genocide were exaggerated by a factor of at least ten that hitler had not been given credit for things he did right and that germany had been harshly treated by allies in mid 1950s wolters quarrelled with kempf who effectively dropped out of network for a number of years adding to burden on wolters and riesser while speer s pleas for his former associate and his former secretary to work together eventually brought about a healing of breach this was to some degree superficial as kempf was aware that wolters even then disagreed with speer s opinions wolters questioned speer s readiness to accept responsibility for nazi regime s excesses and did not believe speer had anything to apologise for though strength of his feelings on this point was kept from speer but not from kempf and riesser wolters was tireless in his efforts on behalf of speer and his family to such an extent that his son fritz later expressed feelings of neglect for speer s fiftieth birthday in march 1955 wolters gathered letters from many of speer s friends and wartime associates and saw to it that they made their way inside walls of spandau in time for speer s birthday wolters gave speer s son albert a summer job in his dusseldorf office and a place to stay in fact wolters hosted all six of speer children at one time or another by prior arrangement he and speer tried to get in touch with each other by telepathy one new year s eve but both men fell asleep before midnight struck wolters constantly sought speer s early release which required consent of four occupying powers he engaged dusseldorf attorney and later state minister werner schutz to lobby high german officials to get them to advocate speer s release schutz who refused to ask for his expenses was unsuccessful even though lubke west german president for last seven years of speer s incarceration had worked under speer wolters had more success fending off denazification proceedings against speer collecting many affidavits in speer s favor including one from tessenow whom speer had shielded during war those proceedings dragged on for years and were eventually ended by order of willy brandt a strong supporter of speer s as early as 1956 wolters feared effect that disclosure of gbi s eviction of jewish tenants might have on speer wolters wrote to kempf concerning denazification proceedings i am only anxious about matter of clearance of jew flats in berlin that could be a bullseye and this is point to which defense should direct itself in 1964 speer mentioned to wolters in a letter that he would need chronik as a reference in revising his memoirs upon his release wolter s response was to have riesser entire chronik leaving out any mention of gbi s involvement in persecution of jews without telling speer what he was doing wolters later wrote that he did this to correct mistakes to leave out extraneous matters and above all to delete certain parts on basis of which speer and one or another of his colleagues could still have been prosecuted ludwigsburg central office for war crimes was still at work and an end of persecution of national socialists was not in sight in april 1965 with only eighteen months left of speer s sentence wolters wrote to him of their prospective reunion i t will have been twenty years since i saw you last what will there be between us old aside of course from happy memories of skiing tours in long distant past will you come to me mainly to take receipt of promised gift i have held for you in our cellar that long cured westphalian ham and those patiently waiting bottles of your favorite nectar 1937 could these things of senses end up being all that there is between us i am so happy that moment approaches but my heart is heavy according to riesser she thought that wolters was frightened of reality of speer however kempf thought wolters wished speer ill speer was unaware of depth of wolters feelings and later told his biographer to be joachim fest that wolters was closest friend he had speer added that during spandau years wolters performed invaluable services for him and that he did not know how he would have survived spandau without wolters assistance throughout latter part of speer s imprisonment wolters was a faithful correspondent writing lengthy letters to speer at least once a month attempting to tell speer everything that might interest him but nothing that might hurt him when speer invented concept of his world wide walk imagining his daily exercise around prison yard to be segments in a long walk from europe through asia to north america wolters supplied speer with details of what he would see speer later stated in a manner of speaking rudi wolters accompanied me on these walks as midnight struck and october 1 1966 began speer was released from spandau prison his last use of clandestine message system was to have a telegram sent to wolters in which speer jokingly asked wolters to pick him up thirty five kilometres south of guadalajara mexico which he had reached after walking 31 936 kilometres deterioration of relationship thumb dusseldorf s industrie kreditbank building designed by wolters after spending two weeks with his family speer came to coesfeld to visit wolters in october 1966 shortly before speer s visit annemarie kempf had visited wolters in coesfeld to ask him not to allow his differences with speer to affect their first meeting wolters responded that he and speer were too far apart visit was quickly marred by speer s insistence on inviting industrialist ernst wolf mommsen to wolters home instead of allowing a one on one reunion according to wolters son fritz his father was furious and hurt by perceived slight while actual meeting was casual and cordial in addition to long promised ham and wine wolters turned over all of accumulated papers from speer censored copy of chronik and remaining balance of 000 in school fund account wolters later wrote i knew that day of that first still merry reunion that spandau friendship was over as he stood there in person i saw him suddenly quite differently than i had previously wolters was perturbed by an interview with speer published in der spiegel in november 1966 in which speer while again taking responsibility for crimes of nazi era blamed hitler rather than germany for starting world war ii wolters wrote to speer on november 30 describing speer s assignment of blame as a dangerous oversimplification made entirely from today s perspective you will surely remember that in 1939 we were all of opinion that hitler was germany although we were certainly depressed rather than enthusiastic about war in poland we surely considered that responsibility for it was to be found in provocative conduct by poles and it was british who made of it a world war wolters asked speer to concentrate wholly on what really happened leaving aside what world thinks of it now their relationship was further embittered by speer s failure to mention wolters by name in speer s first book based on spandau material inside third reich speer s initial draft of book written while in spandau does mention his old university friend dr rudolf wolters to whom was assigned most essential task prachtstrasse in connection with berlin project however wolters name appears nowhere in published version and no mention is made of wolters help essential to writing and preservation of draft memoir speer later told his future biographer gitta sereny that he did so to protect wolters since it might have been risky for wolters to have been known to have assisted an imprisoned war criminal sereny notes in her biography of speer that it would not have been in speer s interest to have publicized wolter s assistance given growing disagreement between them over speer s statements wolter s son fritz suggested that had speer mentioned wolters even once it would have made all difference since it would have shown that speer acknowledged debt he owed wolters for his efforts during his incarceration after german edition of inside third reich was published in late 1969 speer proposed a visit to embittered wolters in coesfeld wolters advised against it sarcastically suggesting that he was surprised that author did not walk through life in a hair shirt distributing his fortune among victims of national socialism forswear all vanities and pleasures of life and live on locusts and wild honey nevertheless wolters expressed a willingness to meet proposing rather pointedly a meeting at wolters house on november 19 buss und day of penance and prayer for german protestants speer duly visited and as two sat down to lunch enquired where are locusts with research concluded upon inside third reich speer had donated edited chronik to german federal archives in koblenz in july 1969 david irving compared donated chronik with a copy of chronik for 1943 in imperial war museum in london and discovered discrepancies irving asked archives and speer reason for differences which were minor compared with previous years speer requested an explanation from wolters and wolters admitted censorship by letter in january 1970 saying i wouldn t have put it past german war crimes prosecutors to launch an additional prosecution against you on pretext that this charge of evicting jews was not included in nuremberg indictment speer suggested that pages of chronik dealing with jews should not exist and informed archives that original of chronik from which copy given to archives had been made had disappeared wolters did not destroy original as speer had hinted wolters anger towards speer burst into open in 1971 after speer did a lengthy interview for playboy in which he again took responsibility for nazi crimes and blamed hitler and his associates for war what is matter with you that that even after unending admissions of guilt in inside third reich you cannot stop representing yourself ever more radically as a criminal for whom twenty years in prison was too little there appears to be a vast and incomprehensible discrepancy between your humble confessions and your present way of life for former would lead one to expect a speer in sackcloth and ashes i however know you as a merry fellow who undertakes one lovely journey after another and who happily his old chums with tales of his literary and financial successes y our accusations against your former colleagues goring goebbels bormann etc who being dead cannot defend themselves are agony to me i hope and think that day will come when you will no longer find it necessary to confess your guilt to all and sundry in order to persuade yourself of your virtue wolters concluded his letter with a suggestion that they avoid seeing each other in future a suggestion with which speer concurred in spite of this wolters wife erika remained close friends with margarete speer albert speer s wife two men had christmas presents delivered to each other every year wolters sent speer a ham while receiving a pot of honey speer admitted that because he had had few friends estrangement hurt in 1975 wolters attempted a reconciliation sending speer a letter for his seventieth birthday in march speer responded emotionally pledging to come visit wolters at slightest hint speer wrote again two months later telling wolters that despite all inherent contradictions i am very attached to you nevertheless two men never met again even in speer s second book of memoirs spandau secret diaries wolters name is not mentioned and his hometown is changed text refers to him as speer s coburg friend speer sent wolters a copy of book anyway though speer stated that he thought it likely that wolters would let it sit in his bookcase unread wolters responded sarcastically in a letter which he signed duke of coburg i forgive you for not localizing me in diaries after your modest restraint in inside third reich author of chronik temporary best friend and indefatigable contact for spandau remains nonexistent later life and death wolters bequeathed his papers to federal archives ensuring record would be corrected one day however in late 1979 speer was approached by matthias schmidt a doctoral student who sought answers to a number of questions for use in preparing his thesis after answering schmidt s questions speer referred schmidt to wolters for further information wolters took a liking to schmidt and showed him both original chronik and correspondence in which wolters had informed speer of censoring of record when confronted by schmidt with this information speer both denied knowledge of censorship and stated that correspondence was not genuine while speer pledged not to take legal action against schmidt for using disputed papers after obtaining his doctorate schmidt published his thesis as a book albert speer end of a myth he made no such promise regarding wolters speer published a formal revocation of a power of attorney he had given wolters while in spandau and disputed on legal grounds wolters right to chronik and other papers dispute was only ended by speer s sudden death in london in september 1981 wolters died in january 1983 after a long illness according to his son fritz his final word was albert he had donated many of his papers to archives in 1982 after wolters died riesser as his literary executor donated remainder notes books in german in berlin wendt verlag 1933 die neue albert
