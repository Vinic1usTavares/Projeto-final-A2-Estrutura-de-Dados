fireman ran ahead with a red flag to stop traffic he also manually operated points motive power joseph howe company used an 0 4 0 saddle tank locomotive to transport building materials during hospital s construction locomotive was purchased new in 1900 and sold in 1903 following completion of hospital and electrification of line in 1902 decision was taken to electrify railway using power generated from hospital s own power plant line was electrified at 500 v dc using a single overhead line hospital was also connected to local 11 kv electricity distribution system engineers robert w blackwell co provided a small 0 4 0 electric locomotive capable of pulling two loaded coal wagons it is not known where locomotive was manufactured as company has no record but design of controls suggests that it may have been imported from germany a small railcar with space for 12 passengers was also provided locomotive and railcar were each fitted with a single trolley pole to collect electricity from overhead wire passenger car was used for duration of passenger services on line and locomotive from electrification of line until closure in 1959 at that time it was oldest operational electric

there were only two minor accidents a car that collided with locomotive whilst driving through hospital grounds and a wagon whose brakes failed whilst stabled at farm siding which rolled down line to hellingly station on 22 november 1939 plans were put in place for restoration of passenger services to allow ambulance trains to reach hospital and authorisation was given for their operation however line was never used to transport patients as although park house was used as a hospital by canadian army during second world war patients left ambulance trains at hellingly station and were transferred to park house by road closure in late 1950s hospital under control of hailsham hospitals management committee since 1948 establishment of national health service decided to convert its boilers from coal to oil railway was therefore no longer needed to transport coal last load was delivered on 10 march 1959 and empty coal wagon returned to hellingly on 25 march 1959 under terms of agreement between hospital authorities lbscr and its successors hospital authorities were obliged to keep railway in good repair to allow its use by main line wagons with a greatly reduced need for goods traffic to hospital following conversion of boilers it was decided that railway was not worth expense of continued maintenance and necessary upgrading and line was officially closed on 25 march 1959 following departure of last coal wagon line was used for occasional excursions by railway enthusiasts for a short period after official closure using electric locomotive and a brake van borrowed from british railways exact date of last run is not recorded last recorded use of line was an excursion organised by norbury transport and model railway club on 4 april 1959 but it is known that later
