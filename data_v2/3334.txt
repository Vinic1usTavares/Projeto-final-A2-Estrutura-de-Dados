project leader and justin chin as lead writer developers wanted to adapt first person shooter format to include strategy and puzzles which at time had never been done dark forces thus features numerous logic puzzles and parts of game requires a strategic method to progress often involving manipulation of environment this style of gameplay has remained constant in all jedi knight games another aspect that has remained same since dark forces is use of john williams soundtrack from star wars films in dark forces music was implemented using imuse software that alters music depending on what is happening at any given moment in game lucasarts developed jedi game engine to power dark forces adding features to first person shooter genre that were uncommon at time such as multi level floors and free look as well as athletic abilities such as running jumping ducking and swimming original plans for game had luke skywalker as main character but due to limitations this would impose on story developers designed a new character kyle katarn even before release of dark forces justin chin had planned out katarn s role in dark forces ii indicating that katarn would face a big trial in a game that would be a rite of passage chin became project leader for dark forces ii in game digital audio from dark forces was replaced with cd audio dark forces ii adds two jedi aspects to series use of force and lightsaber force plays an integral role in how player plays game method of allocating credits to force powers was designed with an rpg style in mind allowing player choice of which powers to improve chin said in an early interview that progress through game is based upon abilities player develops a new game engine sith engine was developed for dark forces ii which uses both 3d graphics and sound it was one of first games to adopt use of 3d graphics hardware acceleration using microsoft direct3d another development was that dark forces ii moved on from static images between levels used in dark forces to full motion video cutscenes characters are represented by live actors while backgrounds are pre rendered cutscenes included first lightsaber footage filmed since return of jedi in 1983 dark forces ii also introduced multiplayer gaming to series allowing players to play online or via a lan nearly four years after release of dark forces ii lucasarts announced at e3 2001 that jedi knight ii jedi outcast would be released in 2002 unlike previous games in series jedi outcast was not developed in house by lucasarts but by raven software subsequent success of outcast led lucasarts to continue partnership with raven leading to development of jedi knight jedi academy a year later with overwhelming success and critical acclaim of star wars jedi outcast continuing an alliance with activision and raven software was a clear and very easy decision said then president of lucasarts simon jeffery jedi outcast and jedi academy are both powered by quake iii team arena game engine with modifications for use of a lightsaber and force jedi academy is only game in jedi knight series that does not give player control of katarn at any point instead focus is on jaden korr
