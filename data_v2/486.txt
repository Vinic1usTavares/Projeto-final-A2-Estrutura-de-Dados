1916 irondale earthquake struck in north central region of u s state of alabama on october 18 strongest earthquake in state history it registered an estimated richter scale magnitude of 5 1 and resulted in extensive but minor damage this damage limited to shelby and jefferson counties reached its maximum severity near epicenter in city of irondale including cracked windows fallen chimneys and dried up wells while there were no fatalities earthquake spawned widespread panic sending alarmed workers from tall buildings earthquake originated in eastern tennessee seismic zone a fault noted for earthquakes of moderate magnitude faulting in area is strike slip oriented probably because of alabama new york lineament which runs adjacent to seismic zone several scientists believe that small earthquakes from zone indicate reactivation of deep ancient faults alabama has seen roughly 20 earthquakes since beginning of 20th century earthquakes have been moderate never reaching above magnitude 5 1 and they tend to cause damage only near their epicenters while reaching areas much further away major events include those in 1916 1997 and 2003 despite lack of powerful seismic events in alabama earthquakes from nearby fault zones including new madrid seismic zone pose a serious threat to infrastructure even an earthquake similar in size to 1916 irondale event today could damage thousands of buildings and cause up to 1 billion in damage background regional seismicity in south central united states is moderately powerful energy from a mid continent earthquake extends over as much as ten times area of a similarly sized earthquake in western united states a magnitude 4 0 earthquake west of rocky mountains reaches up to from its epicenter while a magnitude 5 5 earthquake in eastern us can be felt from its epicenter science failed to explain phenomena until 1978 when geologists discovered a massive fault line running from middle of continent to its eastern coast more recent magnetic surveys show that structure is a 500 million year old strike slip fault which starts under eastern tennessee seismic zone and runs to eastern coast this corresponds to strike slip faulting exhibited in eastern tennessee zone and explains presence of mid continent earthquakes in united states still it is not clear if fault is definitely related to mid continental seismicity local earthquakes in alabama are sporadic and tend to cause little to no damage during a 91 year period there were 19 earthquakes varying from near imperceptible to damaging first known activity in alabama new madrid earthquakes of 1812 registered mercalli intensities of vii very strong throughout northern and central portions of state on february 4 1886 first recorded earthquake from alabama hit western part of state jolting people in sumter and marengo counties following minor events in 1917 1927 1931 and 1939 threatening activity resumed in late 1950s when in 1957 an earthquake near birmingham extended from northern alabama to georgia and tennessee cracking and displacing small objects a 1959 event in huntsville although smaller damaged chimneys wrecked plaster and threw objects from shelves and tables more recently events occurred in escambia county in 1997 and in 2003 in fort payne registering magnitudes of 4 9 and spawning shaking fort payne earthquake spread over 13 states and wrought structural cracks geology thumb map of seismic activity in new madrid seismic zone from 1974 to 2005 while earthquakes have taken place throughout alabama northern part of state is associated with greatest number of earthquakes because it lies near appalachian mountains three major fault zones lie near alabama new madrid eastern tennessee and south carolina seismic zones new madrid seismic zone nmsz lies particularly close and has produced large earthquakes such as those in 1811 and 1812 because fault zone lies in a densely populated area a major earthquake from zone could be catastrophic geological survey of alabama predicts a 90 percent chance of an earthquake of 6 0 or greater in area by 2040 shaking from such an earthquake would spread again into northern segment of alabama southern appalachian system which extends into alabama poses a moderate threat to eastern and central alabama and is responsible for most of state s earthquakes south carolina seismic zone has produced earthquakes as powerful as 7 3 on richter scale and a large earthquake originating from it could easily reach alabama 1886 charleston earthquake for example was felt as far as from its epicenter another more recently active zone in eastern tennessee has produced small earthquakes including one in alabama in 1997 earthquake originated in eastern tennessee seismic zone among most active seismic areas in southeastern united states and one capable of producing moderately strong earthquakes a few of which have caused damage frequency for non damaging earthquakes from this zone measures out to about one per year and it has produced many faint earthquakes recorded on seismographs such earthquakes have been helpful in highlighting activity of faults below paleozoic detachment fault plane solutions of multiple earthquakes throughout area confirmed strike slip faulting between two steeply declining planes both right and left lateral movement occurs in area most movement being associated with north to south planes right lateral and east to west planes left lateral all of these mechanisms indicate reactivation of basement faults below more recent faults these basement faults probably converge on one another and one being strong and other being weak produce earthquakes near its epicenter 1916 irondale earthquake produced intensities measuring vi strong and vii very strong on mercalli intensity scale further away its intensities ranged from iii weak to iv light damage earthquake originated near city of irondale north of birmingham striking just after 4 p m local time because earthquake took place before alabama had a seismograph network its richter scale magnitude of 5 1 is an estimate but it is still considered most powerful earthquake in state history affecting seven other states although there were no deaths structural damage including cracked windows occurred most serious damage was in irondale where chimneys were toppled in a two block area shaking wrecked fourteen chimneys including six chimneys at one brick store which collapsed throughout city oscillation collapsed many other chimneys or damaged them beyond repair in other cities chimneys lost bricks and light damage occurred in birmingham a few poorly built chimneys sustained damage other damage reports included extensive damage to wells five wells in irondale were cut off from their underground supplies lower water levels were common in both irondale and pell city where one well was lowered by as much as in birmingham shaking prompted evacuation of office buildings a news article at time reported that sensation on upper floors of buildings was similar to that of standing on deck of a vessel in a slight sea there was slight pitch with suggestion of a roll threat thumb damage from magnitude 7 3 1886 charleston earthquake an earthquake of similar size could today have a catastrophic impact united states geological survey at center for earthquake research and information ceri at university of memphis along with a seismic station in birmingham which is part of advanced national seismic system facilitate monitoring of inter state earthquakes which tend to be moderate and often originate in nmsz and other smaller fault zones andrew a professor of geological sciences at university of alabama believes state is at high risk from earthquakes he claims that if there is an earthquake in one of zone areas north alabama is certainly going to feel it there s going to be damage and some perhaps major if one occurred in zone close to memphis it would be devastating because buildings are not made to withstand earthquakes places like san francisco are aware of earthquake risks and structures are built to withstand them by his definition state s earthquakes are insignificant emergency planner bill feels skeptical about a major earthquake stating i don t believe there are any major faults interface of rocks here it depends on magnitude of earthquake and richter scale you could have a no 4 magnitude earthquake in california and not damage anything but same type in new york could be devastating because building codes don t factor in earthquakes impact of 1916 earthquake was minor but if a similarly sized earthquake were to occur damage could be extensive a 2007 united states geological survey study estimates that up to 1 billion in damage might result should a fairly powerful earthquake occur in a heavily populated area considering building codes soil types and population numbers from 2000 united states census it estimates 26 buildings destroyed 3 300 structures damaged and several deaths see also list of earthquakes in 1916 list of earthquakes in united states references category earthquakes in alabama irondale earthquake
