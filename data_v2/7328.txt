events of call of duty modern warfare 2 development call of duty 4 modern warfare was developed by a team of a hundred people over course of two years after call of duty 2 infinity ward team decided to move away from world war ii environment of previous games in series this resulted in three game concepts call of duty 4 modern warfare call of duty modern warfare 2 and call of duty modern warfare 3 while developing story for call of duty 4 infinity ward chose to avoid referencing current real life wars and keep series common theme of two opposing forces of similar strength to enhance realistic feel of game development team attended a live fire exercise at marine corps air ground combat center twentynine palms a training facility in california desert this helped developers to simulate effects of being near an abrams tank when it fires team also talked with u s marines who were recently in combat to get a feel for background emotions and attitude of marines in combat veterans were also recruited to supervise motion capture sessions and artificial intelligence design of game development team designed online multiplayer component to be balanced and rewarding for new players while still offering something for experienced players an early idea to implement air support air strikes and attack helicopters involved players fighting over special zones to access a trigger for air support against enemies this idea was discarded because it discouraged type of deathmatch gameplay they intended killstreak reward system was put in its place to encourage improvement of player skills players were allowed to select weapons before matches to get accustomed to weapons more easily and minimize weapon hunting maps were designed primarily for deathmatch games developers felt such designs suited other types of gameplay as well map layouts were designed to minimize locations players could hide from enemy gunfire most of music for call of duty 4 modern warfare was written by british composer stephen barton who had also contributed to film scores by harry gregson williams to whom composed main theme of game several music tracks from game are available on infinity ward s 7 days of modern warfare website and some are available at barton s own web site rap song played during end credits is performed by call of duty 4 s lead animator mark grigsby game engine thumb right a

physics engine not implemented in previous call of duty titles death animations are a combination of pre set animations and ragdoll physics console versions of call of duty 4 modern warfare run at a consistent 60 frames per second and wii version runs at 30 frames per second code was included to determine spawning points based on nearby weapons and relationship between enemy positions and line of sight to points various criteria are meant to minimize players dying immediately after rejoining a match or being spawn killed due to players simply waiting for others to respawn however enemies may still respawn infinitely a notable feature in call of duty game engines game engine has also been used for development of two other activision games an enhanced version of original engine was used in
