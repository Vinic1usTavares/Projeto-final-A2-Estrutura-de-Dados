london entombment is a glue size painting on known as or a technique in which pigments were bound in glue and painted on a cloth treated with glue it was a delicate and fragile technique see spronk 8 attributed to early netherlandish painter dieric bouts it shows a scene from biblical entombment of christ and was probably completed between 1440 and 509 as a wing panel for a large hinged polyptych altarpiece now lost altarpiece is thought to have contained a central crucifixion scene flanked by four wing panel works half its height two on either side depicting scenes from life of christ smaller panels would have been paired in a format similar to bouts s 1464 1468 altarpiece of holy sacrament larger work was probably commissioned for export to italy possibly to a venetian patron whose identity is lost campbell 44 entombment was first recorded in a mid 19th century milan inventory and has been in national gallery london since its purchase on gallery s behalf by charles lock eastlake in 1861 painting is an austere but affecting portrayal of sorrow and grief it shows four female and three male mourners grieving over body of christ they are from left to right nicodemus mary salome mary of clopas mary mother of jesus john evangelist mary magdalene and joseph of arimathea it is one of few surviving 15th century paintings created using glue size an extremely fragile medium lacking durability entombment is in relatively poor condition compared to panel paintings of similar age its colours are now far duller than when it was painted they would however always have appeared as less intense and brilliant than those of comparable oil or tempera paintings on panel bomford david art in making entombment audio national gallery london retrieved 18 june 2011 jones 10 painting is covered by accumulated layers of grey dirt and cannot be cleaned without damaging surface and removing large amounts of pigment as its glue size medium is water soluble leonard 517 a strip at top has been less affected than rest because it was protected by a frame campbell 38 41 painting description entombment shows christ s body wrapped in a white linen shroud and still wearing a crown of thorns as it is lowered into a deep stone tomb he is attended by seven mourners dressed in contemporary clothing among group of mourners standing at christ s side three female figures are shown with downcast eyes while two men look directly at christ these gazes are reversed with couple kneeling at his feet background contains a wide landscape with a winding pathway and a broad river before a more distant vista of trees and hills bouts is considered an innovative painter of landscapes even in his portrait work where they are included as distant views seen through open windows vista in entombment is regarded as one of his finest and is typically composed of distant brown and green hills against a blue sky potterton homan national gallery london london thames and hudson 1977 58 left thumb 240px

her face with fold of her white headdress mary of clopas is behind them holding a red cloth over her mouth while magdalen is in foreground at christ s feet dressed in a heavily folded cloak man in brown green tabard at feet of christ is probably joseph of arimathea who according to gospel brought christ s body to golgotha from pontius pilate thumb 300px detail showing heads of mary salome mary of clopas and virgin loss of paint in red cloth and film of dirt in top right corner are clearly visible entombment is painted on linen tightly woven with 20 to 22 vertical and between 19 and 22 horizontal threads per centimetre it is difficult to determine direction of weaving because edge is missing making weft from warp indistinguishable see campbell 40 cloth is z spun tightly spun and tabby woven with flax perhaps combined with cotton cloth support is lined unusually with similar but more finely woven linen mounted on a wooden stretcher before paint was applied linen was first mounted on a temporary stretcher and outlined with a brown border now visible on lower border which was used as a guide to cut picture down before framing guiding borders of this type are often found just under frames of works from period glue sizing consists of creating a distemper by mixing pigments in water and then using a glue base derived from boiled animal skin and other tissues as a binder dunkerton 187 pigments were applied to a linen cloth treated with same glue sizing fixed in turn to its frame by glue paint saturated cloth often leaving an image on reverse side which was lined with an additional cloth dunkerton 187 188 pigments bound in glue had an optical quality that rendered them opaque in appearance and unusually vivid unlike oil which makes chalk appear translucent chalk mixed in glue is rendered as stark white similarly more expensive pigments assume brilliant opacity in a glue medium whites are chalk in areas mixed with lead white especially in magdalen s mantle and veil christ s shroud and virgin s veil artist used four blue pigments an unusual number for paintings of period with indigo predominating as a plant derived pigment indigo it has a tendency to fade over time azurite and lead white line under paint while landscape contains indigo mixed with lead tin yellow sky and nicodemus collar are painted with lighter and less intense azurite while virgin s dress is azurite mixed with ultramarine and smalt a blue ground glass pigment entombment is one of earliest western pictorial works of art in which use of smalt could be ascertained and its presence proves that pigment was not invented during sixteenth century as had previously been believed b and j thyssen smalt in a roy ed artist s pigments a handbook of their characteristics volume 2 1993 p

black spot to right of second tree greens are mostly verdigris although those predominant in landscape are mostly blends of blue and yellow pigments and green of cloth worn by mary salome is malachite mixed with yellow lake browns are blends of reds and blacks john s red robe is composed from cinnabar and vermilion made from and insect dyes some of reds are mixed with earth colours not susceptible to effects of light and have thus survived close to their original appearance black pigments are generally bone blacks but in places from charcoal campbell 30 blacks are mixed with chalk in areas producing a red to brownish earthy appearance cloth support is visible in areas where paint was thinly applied rusty nail holes can be seen in lower border and across top of picture in an area of sky that was initially covered by frame they indicate that woodworking was positioned much lower than bouts had intended generally works painted on commission were placed by professional joiners who worked independently of painter campbell 29 low placing of frame however protected underlying colours over centuries from light they are preserved as first laid down panel was originally attached to its frame by pegs and nails nails would have been used to attach linen to underlying wooden frame leonard 520 condition painting on linen cloth using glue size as a binder was at time a relatively inexpensive alternative to oil and a large number of works were produced in 15th century jones 11 glue size does not saturate pigments as much as oil allowing them to show as matt and opaque giving especially with reds and blues an intense appearance when applied to cloth cloth is fragile and perishes easily and this work is one of best preserved of few surviving examples of technique from period majority extant today were executed on wood using oil or egg tempera curtains or glass were often used to protect glue sized works colours would have first appeared bright and crisp but over five and a half centuries painting has acquired layers of grey dirt which darken tone and render colours faint and pallid normally these layers of dirt would be removed by restorers but given delicate and fragile nature of a work painted in a water soluble medium it is impossible to do so without removing large amounts of pigment colours as they appear today have faded from their original hues virgin s mantle is now brown but would have been painted as blue joseph s tabard once blue now appears as green original of landscape are lost while azurite in nicodemus s collar has darkened it is possible to see degree to which technique allowed bouts in words of art historian susan jones to achieve such sophistication to create both fine linear detail and subtle tonal transitions jones notes that sky would have appeared with same clear and pale blue that is still intact in a narrow strip along top of work which has been protected from light and dirt by a frame in its current condition muted landscape appears to echo sorrow of mourning figures x ray analysis shows that there were a few preparatory drawings made with chalk before paint was applied this is left exposed in some areas most noticeably in virgin s veil and mantle and in christ s shroud campbell 40 infrared photography reveals little underdrawing but indicates that canvas underwent several changes before completion mary salome was repositioned slightly to left sizes of nicodemus arm and shoulder were reduced and magdalen s face was painted over virgin s mantle cloth on which work was painted had been lined with a more finely woven piece of linen and probably by same person who stretched and lined other works identified with larger altarpiece it was placed under glass probably in early 19th century and certainly before its acquisition by national gallery eastlake noted that it was under glass in 1858 campbell 38 piece was evidently sent rolled and unframed to its patron brown border painted along four sides indicates where frame should be positioned when it is added to its final support national gallery technical bulletin volume 18 1997 25 row of rust stained nail holes running along top of cloth is evidence that frame was eventually positioned within pictorial field at a point far lower than bouts had intended jones 62 this low framing protected a portion of canvas from deterioration and allows us to see some of colours as they would have originally appeared polyptych thumb 240px bouts s crucifixion before 1464 in 1988 robert koch proposed that this ruined panel now in brussels was center piece of lost scenes from life of christ polyptych charles eastlake saw work in 1858 and again in 1860 during visits to milan to purchase northern renaissance art on behalf of national gallery davies 27 he also viewed three companion pieces but was told they were not on sale his notes described each of these other works which he titled annunciation now in j paul getty museum adoration of kings now in a private collection in germany and presentation or resurrection now in norton simon museum pasadena california these works are same size as entombment have similar colouring and pigmentation and are painted using same glue size technique but are not as well preserved it is probable that all were re lined and stretched at same time by same restorer indicating that they were kept together until shortly before entombment was acquired by national gallery campbell 42 thumb left 200px pen and ink copy of adoration of magi or kings by an unknown artist uffizi florence art historian robert koch remarked in 1988 on similarity of provenance material technique tone and colour of four works described by eastlake he proposed that they were intended as wings of a five part polyptych altarpiece koch 513 based on format of bouts s 1464 1468 altarpiece of holy sacrament whose four wing panels are same length as entombment he believes altarpiece would have comprised a large central panel with four works half its length and width positioned two at either side his speculative reconstruction places entombment on upper right hand wing above adoration large centre canvas has not been positively identified however both koch and campbell believe that a damaged crucifixion now in royal museums of fine arts of belgium brussels was probably centrepiece its size 181 x 153 5 cm is exactly double that of four wing panels campbell believes that altarpiece was painted on commission for export most likely to venice altarpiece was probably broken up as large religious works had fallen out of fashion by 17th century and would have had more value as single panels campbell 405 provenance and attribution bouts did not inscribe any of his paintings which makes attribution and dating difficult his developing skill with perspective and unified vanishing points is used by art historians to date his works from period although its colourisation is among best of his work perspective is clumsy in areas thus painting can be assumed to date no later than 1460 bouts often quoted visual passages from artists and paintings that influenced his work so influences are well established and datable along with companion resurrection british art historian martin davies believes work shows influences from rogier van der weyden s descent c 1435 and miraflores altarpiece 1440s which places it after 1440 campbell sees influence of miraflores altarpiece in representation of christ s dead body while british art historian martin davies speculated that a relief in architecture of van der weyden s center panel may have informed positioning of bouts s mourners see campbell 44 robert koch dates it to between 1450 and 1455 thumb 200px entombment engraving by martin schongauer c 1480 museum of art rhode island school of design during a period of aggressive acquisition intended to establish international prestige of britain s collection it was acquired for national gallery in

1760 1960 london barrie and rockliff 1961 311 eastlake s notes mention that works were originally in possession of foscari family were a wealthy venetian family which included francesco foscari who was doge of venice at time work was painted dramatic story of him and his son is told in lord byron s play two foscari and verdi s opera i due foscari there is no documentary evidence to substantiate claim that painting came from foscari collection and some art historians believe that representatives of invented this provenance to impress eastlake lorne campbell considers provenance probable noting that a descendant ferigo foscari 1732 1811 an ambassador to saint petersburg squandered his fortune and may have been forced into selling pictures belonging to family campbell speculates that painting was produced on commission for export to venice noting that unrolled linen would have been easier to transport than canvas and that row of holes just below upper border could be explained if it had been stretched mounted and framed by someone other than bouts or a member of his workshop campbell 28 companion pieces in guicciardi collection annunciation adoration of kings and resurrection were similar works in glue size though of lesser quality eastlake s notebooks mention that they were not so good not so well preserved their style and size are similar to entombment suggesting that they were probably pieces that would have formed part of larger polyptych entombment was attributed to lucas van leyden at time haldane a history of painting renaissance in north and flemish genius part four whitefish montana kessinger publishing 1911 34 though eastlake thought that given its emotional power it might be a van der weyden van leyden and van der weyden were often mistaken for each other due to similarity of their surnames both of which have many different spellings in historical and art historical records borchert 203 bouts studied under van der weyden and was strongly influenced by his work davies proposed in 1953 that figuration and pose in entombment may have been informed by a small grisaille relief in arch of central panel of van der weyden s miraflores altarpiece koch 515 painting arrived in london from milan in 1861 but was not attributed to bouts until 1911 two known copies exist an unsophisticated panel sold in munich to a private collector in 1934 and an oak panel attributed to a follower which is in switzerland influence of netherlandish painting spread to central europe in late 15th century and many copies or designs based on work of netherlandish masters were produced influence of bouts s entombment can be seen in german artist martin schongauer s c 1480 engraving of same name it not only has compositional similarity but echoes
