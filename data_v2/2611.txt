australian marriage law postal survey was a national survey designed to gauge support for legalising same sex marriage in australia survey was held via postal service between 12 september and 7 november 2017 unlike voting in elections and referendums which is compulsory in australia responding to survey was voluntary a survey form instructions and a reply paid envelope were mailed out by australian bureau of statistics abs to every person on federal electoral roll asking question should law be changed to allow same sex couples to marry abs outlined processes to ensure eligible australians lacking access to post could participate survey returned 7 817 247 61 6 yes responses and 4 873 987 38 4 no responses an additional 36 686 0 3 responses were unclear and total turnout was 12 727 920 79 5 prior to survey liberal national coalition government had pledged to facilitate a private member s bill to legalise same sex marriage in parliament in event of a yes outcome this allowed parliamentary debate and a vote eventually leading to legalisation of same sex marriage both coalition and opposition labor party allowed their mps a conscience vote on relevant legislation had survey returned a majority no result government said it would not allow a parliamentary debate or vote on legalising same sex marriage many same sex marriage proponents were critical of postal survey viewing it as a costly delaying tactic and an unnecessary hurdle to a conscience vote on same sex marriage in parliament survey was subject to two legal challenges questioning authority of abs to conduct survey and government s right to fund cost of survey from funds designated by law for urgent and unforeseen circumstances both legal challenges failed high court of australia found that survey was lawful adults on electoral roll in australia as of 24 august 2017 were eligible to participate by this date 98 000 new voters had added themselves to roll which was a record high enrolment drive prior to a national vote survey forms were distributed from 12 september 2017 with abs encouraging returns promptly preferably to be received before 27 october to ensure sufficient processing time survey closed on 7 november 2017 and results were released on 15 november 2017 marriage amendment definition and religious freedoms act 2017 which legalised same sex marriage came into effect on 9 december 2017 background history marriage in australia constitutional province of federal parliament was legally defined as a union between a man and a woman in 2004 at time of survey same sex unions in australia were treated as de facto unions under federal law these unions provide couples with most though not all of legal rights of marriage although those rights may be difficult to assert and are not always recognised in practice aside from legal aspects de facto relationships do not have same symbolic significance as marriage before july 2016 federal election malcolm turnbull led coalition government promised to hold a national vote on same sex marriage in form of a compulsory attendance plebiscite opposition to this idea centred on its criticism as an expensive delaying tactic and that it was duty of parliament rather than a matter related to australian constitution while coalition won 76 of 150 seats in lower house in 2016 election and managed to form a majority government by one seat they failed to pass necessary legislation for a compulsory attendance referendum plebiscite legislation passed house of representatives on 20 october 2016 by a vote of 76 67 but was rejected by senate on 7 november 2016 by a vote of 33 29 idea of a postal plebiscite was originally proposed by liberal mp warren and later endorsed by government ministers peter dutton and mathias dutton pointed out that a postal vote would not need legislation to operate a staffer of attorney general george brandis came up with idea of a survey as an alternative way to fulfil government s commitment in mid july in august 2017 following an attempt by five liberal party mps to change party policy and have a free vote in parliament on same sex marriage legislation government announced it would move for a voluntary postal survey to be held later that year it stated that postal vote would only occur in event government s compulsory referendum plebiscite legislation was again rejected by senate that occurred on 9 august 2017 when a government initiated motion in senate to debate plebiscite same sex marriage bill 2016 was tied at 31 31 resulting in motion being defeated following result in senate government directed australian statistician head of australian bureau of statistics to begin process of surveying views on same sex marriage of all australians on electoral roll government asserted that this proposal did not require legislative approval from parliament arguing that provisions of appropriations act and law governing australian bureau of statistics abs enabled it to use abs for such a purpose this was argued by government to be similar to process by which god save queen was replaced by advance australia fair as australian national anthem government announced abs would be assisted by having staff seconded from australian electoral commission aec organisation responsible for elections in australia and managing electoral roll cost of survey to australian taxpayer was forecast to be 122 million however total amount spent ended up being 80 5 million this expense as well as notion that debate would activate ideological extremists and that normal electoral rules would not apply were criticised in parliament by 7 september date high court challenges against survey were heard a total of 14 1 million had already been spent by abs on postal survey 8 million on advertising for survey 5 3 million on printing costs and 600 000 for staff aec reported that about 68 000 enrolment transactions were completed on 10 august compared with an average of 4 000 per day in period 8 14 august over 16 000 people had enrolled and over 200 000 had updated their details by 20 august over 36 000 had enrolled and over 434 000 had updated their enrolment details by 22 august over 54 000 had enrolled by 25 august roll achieved a record high with over 16 million australians on roll an additional 90 000 people had joined with a further 165 000 transactions still to be processed 65 000 of these new voters are between ages of 18 and 24 with 933 592 enrolment transactions completed by aec at end of processing more than 98 000 people were added to roll and total number of australians eligible to participate in survey was 16 005 998 however after results of survey were released abs revealed that in fact 16 006 180 surveys were mailed out to eligible australians senate finance and public administration references committee opened a public inquiry into arrangements around postal survey on 14 august with a submission made and evidence given by abs at hearings on 17 august further hearings involving abs aec australia post department of finance and department of human services occurred on 7 september and 15 september 2017 committee handed down final report on 13 february 2018 report recommended that survey process should not be used again for matters of human rights encouraged government to further fund mental health and lgbtiq organisations to mitigate impact of postal survey and recommended that australian electoral commission increase its voter registration and education efforts in remote communities and work with indigenous peak bodies to achieve greater participation key dates key dates relating to survey were 24 august 2017 final day for citizens to update or add their name and details to electoral roll in order to receive a survey form 12 september 2017 survey forms began to be mailed out to all australian voters over a two week period 25 september 2017 date all survey forms were expected to have arrived and eligible australians could commence ordering replacement materials for those lost or spoilt paperless options online form and telephony survey option opened 20 october 2017 6pm local time requests for replacement material closed 27 october 2017 date all eligible australians were strongly encouraged to return their form by 7 november 2017 6pm local time responses received after this date were not processed 15 november 2017 10am statistics and quality and integrity report released to public results of survey including participation rates were released at a national level at a state and territory level and at an electorate level legal challenges two legal challenges were lodged contesting legality of survey with high court of australia both on grounds of unlawful funding from legally specified funds and unlawful operation by abs first was by same sex marriage advocates shelley argent national spokeswoman of parents and friends of lesbians and gays and felicity marlowe member of rainbow families along with independent mp andrew wilkie they announced they would challenge postal survey in high court on 9 august 2017 and seek a temporary injunction second challenge was by australian marriage equality and greens senator janet rice an additional complaint was lodged by a 17 year old boy with australian human rights commission in august 2017 on basis that rules did not allow provisionally enrolled 16 and 17 year old australians right to participate in survey complaint could have led to a federal court case to argue for right of about 50 000 australians aged 16 and 17 on electoral roll to vote however boy dropped his complaint on 22 september after a greens amendment to marriage law survey additional safeguards act 2017 was rejected by parliament earlier in month legal counsel to boy advised that rejected amendment would make age discrimination complaint much more difficult to argue because parliament had considered and rejected extending vote to enrolled 16 and 17 year olds high court ruling high court pronounced its orders in both cases on 7 september 2017 court determined that survey was lawful allowing it to proceed as scheduled challengers were ordered to pay costs high court handed down its unanimous reasons on 28 september 2017 finding that 295 million had been appropriated by parliament and that whether expenditure was unforeseen was a matter for minister s satisfaction and there was no error of law in either his reasoning or his conclusion information to be collected was statistical information of matters prescribed in census and statistics regulation 2016 cth as court had considered and rejected grounds of application there was no need to decide whether or not whether plaintiffs had standing survey process survey was conducted on a voluntary basis with no requirement on part of eligible australian to mail back survey form this led to concerns over a potentially low voter turnout response rate and prospect of indigenous australians in remote communities being unable to complete a survey concern had been expressed regarding electors whose addresses were not visible on electoral roll known as silent electors disenfranchisement in remote communities australians overseas prisoners non english speakers and young people early criticism was also levelled at issues of privacy with recent census problems of 2016 being cited abs advised that survey responses would be anonymous and protected under secrecy provisions of census and statistics act 1905 prior to survey commencing former privacy commissioner malcolm crompton independently reviewed abs s privacy approaches and and announced he was suitably satisfied abs also worked to address concerns with special strategies like paperless options telephony and online form and form drop off and pick up points in remote and capital city locations additionally bureau noted that australians could also authorise a trusted person to complete survey on their behalf while any person could be appointed a trusted person chief minister of act andrew barr offered to fulfil role for any citizen auditors and an external observer process were established to assure integrity of process though observers are subject to a lifetime confidentiality agreement a quality and integrity report was published by abs alongside release of survey results during survey period online sellers were contacted by abs asking them to remove ads by people offering to sell their postal survey or answer abs advised that such an action would likely constitute an offence under census and statistics act 1905 commonwealth criminal code and survey safeguards legislation passed by parliament digital transformation agency assisted abs with paperless options for survey though due to compressed timescale of survey concerns were anonymously raised by staff that normal processes were not completed such as sufficient user testing aws was brought in on a tender process to assist in security measures for online survey a telephone information hotline was established and received 206 828 calls between 14 august 2017 and 7 november 2017 unlike elections or referendums there were no automatic special regulations relating to advertising requirements or prohibited content for survey of kind found in electoral act consequently government and opposition engaged in negotiations to introduce legislation designed to replicate these types of regulations as well as create measures to prevent vilification intimidation or threats to cause harm on basis of sexual orientation gender identity intersex status or religious convictions of someone during survey period on 13 september government introduced marriage law survey additional safeguards bill 2017 for these purposes in senate bill passed senate after an amendment moved by greens leader richard di natale to allow 16 and 17 year olds right to participate in survey was defeated bill immediately proceeded to and was passed by house of representatives bill received royal assent on 13 september and went into effect following day act s provisions automatically expired on 15 november 2017 neither yes or no campaign received public funding in survey as was envisioned for a compulsory attendance plebiscite prime minister turnbull also ruled out a ban on foreign donations for survey all australians whose names are on electoral roll or had applied to be put on roll before 24 august 2017 were mailed a survey form and enrolled australians living overseas along with those in certain special categories were entitled to complete a survey using paperless methods aec made a statement that provisionally enrolled 16 and 17 year olds would not be posted a survey form and an amended direction was later issued by government to australian statistician making this clear this direction was subject to a human rights commission complaint by a 17 year old boy which was later withdrawn more than 16 million letters were sent from 12 september over almost two weeks with all delivered by 25 september and silent electors packages were sent by aec and delivered by end of september after several yes respondents posted images of their complete forms on social media abs cautioned participants to not photograph their form barcodes so as to prevent any fraudulent conduct additionally survey forms could be invalidated in event question was rephrased by participant or barcode was obscured or removed abs issued several examples of what constituted a valid and invalid response such as marking both boxes yes and no or crossing out one of words on form abs advised australians who received extra survey forms addressed to previous occupant who failed to update their electoral details to write on front of envelope return to sender and send it back in australia it is illegal to open mail addressed to another person in rare instance of multiple responses being received from an individual abs noted that only last valid response could expect to be counted on 25 september abs confirmed that all survey forms had been mailed to eligible voters and outlined process for additional forms to be sent to people who did not receive lost or spoilt their form abs also confirmed that a change of mind was not a valid reason for requesting a new form both yes and no campaigns provided 60 observers to abs counting process who examined 606 991 survey results fewer than 500 survey forms were reported as issues to abs during survey weekly estimate of responses on 28 september abs announced that it would release weekly national estimates of total number of survey responses received beginning from 3 october 2017 and ending 7 november primary input to first three weekly estimates issued at national level only was australia post s assessment of number of containers of sorted envelopes rather than counts of individual forms adjustments were made based on factors such as responses received through other channels and an allowance for forms that are damaged or invalid from fourth estimate released on 24 october 2017 abs changed estimation method to use counts of processed forms this led to an increase in estimated turnout to 74 5 of population up 7 0 on previous week despite only 300 000 new responses or 1 9 of total being received during that timeframe week estimated responses estimated rate of response 3 october 57 5 10 october 62 5 17 october 67 5 24 october 74 5 31 october 77 0 7 november 12 600 000 78 5 question thumb sample image of survey form survey form asked respondents should law be changed to allow same sex couples to marry survey offered two one word responses yes or no legislation proposed government did not release a draft bill legalising same sex marriage prior to survey which led to uncertainty over what form legislation would take in event of a yes verdict wording of an exposure draft of a same sex marriage bill from early 2017 released by attorney general s office proposed to amend definition of marriage and replace terms man and woman with gender neutral phrase two people proposed wording two people differed from wording of survey question which referred explicitly to same sex couples liberal senator dean smith who drafted a same sex marriage bill in august 2017 argued his bill struck a fair balance in protecting rights of same sex couples and religious freedoms of celebrants bill allows current civil celebrants to become religious celebrants and refuse to perform same sex marriages and incorporates parts of sex discrimination act to allow religious organisations to refuse their services for same sex marriages smith s bill was formally backed by labor party parliamentary caucus on 17 october 2017 however conservative mps in government responded by suggesting up to 100 amendments to bill may be needed if yes vote carried a rival bill was released on 13 november by liberal senator james paterson a conservative supporter of same sex marriage bill contained various protections allowing refusal of same sex weddings by anyone who holds a religious or conscientious belief against same sex marriage including private service providers such as florists and bakers prime minister turnbull reacted negatively to paterson s bill saying government would not countenance supporting a bill which discriminated against same sex weddings and that bill would have virtually no prospect of getting through parliament it was dropped by senator paterson within hours of yes vote being released support and opposition party positions in a parliamentary vote each of political parties represented in australian parliament held formalised positions on same sex marriage and on merits of survey australian labor party formally supported legalisation of same sex marriage though offered its mps a conscience vote on same sex marriage legislation until 2019 liberal party pledged to hold a national vote of some kind before any change to law though party had no official position on survey question hence mps including cabinet members were to free to campaign for either side all politicians were entitled to use their electoral printing and communications budgets in campaign position political parties s s to public nation lambie network conscience vote allowed for mps yes campaign thumb right a yes campaign rally in melbourne in august 2017 campaign for supporting voting in favour of same sex marriage in survey received support from labor liberals and nationals for yes campaign and four minor political parties represented in federal parliament and from prominent lobby groups including australian marriage equality and getup no campaign campaign advocating voting against changing marriage laws in survey was supported by nationals and three minor parties represented in federal parliament several groups opposed to same sex marriage including australian christian lobby and marriage alliance formed coalition for marriage to co ordinate no campaign neutral liberal party of australia did not hold a position either way in survey public opinion opinion polls in australia over several years in lead up to survey indicated a comfortable majority of australians supported same sex marriage a guardian essential poll conducted just prior to announcement of postal survey indicated that 43 approved of a postal vote and 38 disapproved whereas a week later 39 approved of postal survey and 47 disapproved of it a small boycott movement existed although most same sex marriage campaigners who

religion several figures and institutions supporting a no vote raised issue of religious freedom during survey period former prime minister john howard rejected assurances of prime minister malcolm turnbull and requested that government explicitly detail proposed religious freedom provisions to potentially be included in same sex marriage legislation likewise several leaders in catholic church raised freedom of religion concerns citing case of a tasmanian archbishop who was requested to appear at an anti discrimination commission after having disseminated material supporting a christian view of marriage veracity of concerns over religious freedom was disputed heavily in community some groups such as national catholic education commission said they were unsure if catholic schools could continue to teach catholic view of marriage in event same sex marriage was legalised however academics marion maddox and carol johnson challenged this by arguing that religious organisations would continue to be able to access exemptions from anti discrimination laws and consequently remain free to refuse same sex marriage if it is eventually introduced divisions extended to governing liberal party whose president rejected claims that religious freedom could be under threat in direct contradiction to party s vice president who said that same sex marriage would have consequences for freedom of speech religion and association both prime minister turnbull and bill shorten leader of opposition spoke in favour of religious freedom protections with turnbull stating he was an even stronger believer in freedom of religion than same sex marriage shorten said labor party would make sure that concerns about religious freedom are met with and dealt with and are treated with respect prospect of additional religious freedom exemptions being added to existing australian anti discrimination law troubled some yes advocates who feared such provisions could allow service providers to discriminate on any basis not just limited to couples sex tiernan brady described campaign for religious freedom exemptions as a blatant attempt to unravel existing anti discrimination laws which serve everyone in australia well not just people in response to a newspoll question on subject do you think parliament should provide guarantees in law for freedom of conscience belief and religion if it legislates for same sex marriage 62 responded yes 18 responded no and 20 said they were uncommitted a poll conducted by galaxy later in survey found 78 of respondents said yes in response to question if majority vote yes in postal survey should same sex couples be treated same under law compared with other couples an inquiry into religious freedoms headed by philip ruddock was announced in november 2017 this has been interpreted as a way to allow speedy passage of dean smith bill and postpone discussions of religious freedom it completed a report on 18 may 2018 which was not publicly released until 13 december 2018 although recommendations were leaked to fairfax media in october 2018 government responded by proposing a religious discrimination act advertising and media thumb a

study of lesbian gay and bisexual mental health found that increased exposure to negative anti lgbt media messages during postal survey was related to increased levels of depressions anxiety and

australian catholic bishops conference presbyterian church of australia and australian national imams council all advocated strongly for nuclear family structures during survey a fact check article published in conversation which was based on a review of literature on outcomes for children of same sex parents showed equal or better outcomes for children raised by parents of same gender likewise a review published late in survey period by medical journal of australia agreed with conversation s findings but noted that effects of being exposed to stigma and discrimination could lead to poorer public health outcomes for children in same sex families counselling for those impacted and mental health a number of counselling services and mental health strategies were made available to lgbtiq
