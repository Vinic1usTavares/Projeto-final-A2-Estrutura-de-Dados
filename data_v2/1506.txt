pelicans are a genus of large water birds that make up family pelecanidae they are characterised by a long beak and a large throat pouch used for catching prey and draining water from scooped up contents before swallowing they have predominantly pale plumage exceptions being brown and peruvian pelicans bills pouches and bare facial skin of all species become brightly coloured before breeding season eight living pelican species have a patchy global distribution ranging latitudinally from tropics to temperate zone though they are absent from interior south america and from polar regions and open ocean long thought to be related to frigatebirds cormorants tropicbirds and gannets and boobies pelicans instead are now known to be most closely related to shoebill and hamerkop and are placed in order pelecaniformes ibises spoonbills herons and bitterns have been classified in same order fossil evidence of pelicans dates back at least 30 million years to remains of a beak very similar to that of modern species recovered from oligocene strata in france they are thought to have evolved in old world and spread into americas this is reflected in relationships within genus as eight species divide into old world and new world lineages pelicans frequent inland and coastal waters where they feed principally on fish catching them at or near water surface they are gregarious birds travelling in flocks hunting cooperatively and breeding colonially four white plumaged species tend to nest on ground and four brown or grey plumaged species nest mainly in trees relationship between pelicans and people has often been contentious birds have been persecuted because of their perceived competition with commercial and recreational fishing their populations have fallen through habitat destruction disturbance and environmental pollution and three species are of conservation concern they also have a long history of cultural significance in mythology and in christian and heraldic iconography taxonomy and systematics etymology genus pelecanus was first formally described by linnaeus in 1758 in tenth edition of his systema naturae he described distinguishing characteristics as a straight bill hooked at tip linear nostrils a bare face and fully webbed feet this early definition included frigatebirds cormorants and as well as pelicans name comes from ancient greek word pelekan pelekan which is itself derived from word meaning axe in classical times word was applied to both pelican and woodpecker taxonomy family pelecanidae was introduced as by french polymath constantine samuel rafinesque in 1815 pelicans give their name to pelecaniformes an order which has a varied taxonomic history tropicbirds darters cormorants gannets boobies and frigatebirds all traditional members of order have since been reclassified tropicbirds into their own order and remainder into in their place herons ibises spoonbills hamerkop and shoebill have now been transferred into pelecaniformes molecular evidence suggests that shoebill and hamerkop form a sister group to pelicans though some doubt exists as to exact relationships among three lineages cladogram based on hackett et al 2008 living species eight living pelican species were traditionally divided into two groups one containing four ground nesters with mainly white adult plumage australian dalmatian great white and american white pelicans and one containing four grey or brown plumaged species which nest preferentially either in trees pink backed spot billed and brown pelicans or on sea rocks peruvian pelican largely marine brown and peruvian pelicans formerly considered conspecific are sometimes separated from others by placement in subgenus but in fact species with both sorts of appearance and nesting behavior are found in either dna sequencing of both mitochondrial and nuclear genes yielded quite different relationships three new world pelicans formed one lineage with american white pelican sister to two brown pelicans and five old world species other dalmatian pink backed and spot billed were all closely related to one another while australian white pelican was their next closest relative great white pelican also belonged to this lineage but was first to diverge from common ancestor of other four species this finding suggests that pelicans evolved in old world and spread into americas and that preference for tree or ground nesting is more related to size than genetics living species of and binomial names and white pelicanpelecanus 1789185px alt american white pelicanlength wingspan

with very long bills characterised by a downcurved hook at end of upper mandible and attachment of a huge gular pouch to lower slender rami of lower bill and flexible tongue muscles form pouch into a basket for catching fish and sometimes rainwater though not to hinder swallowing of large fish tongue itself is tiny they have a long neck and short stout legs with large fully webbed feet although they are among heaviest of flying birds elliott 1992 p 290 they are relatively light for their apparent bulk because of air pockets in skeleton and beneath skin enabling them to float high in water tail is short and square wings are long and broad suitably shaped for soaring and gliding flight and have unusually large number of 30 to 35 secondary flight feathers males are generally larger than females and have longer bills smallest species is brown pelican small individuals of which can be no more than and long with a wingspan of as little as largest is believed to be dalmatian at up to and

pelicans bills pouches and bare facial skin of all species become brighter before breeding season commences throat pouch of californian subspecies of brown pelican turns bright red and fades to yellow after eggs are laid while throat pouch of peruvian pelican turns blue american white pelican grows a prominent knob on its bill that is shed once females have laid eggs plumage of immature pelicans is darker than that of adults newly hatched chicks are naked and pink darkening to grey or black after 4 to 14 days then developing a covering of white or grey down air sacs anatomical dissections of two brown pelicans in 1939 showed that pelicans have a network of subcutaneous air sacs under their skin situated across ventral surface including throat breast and undersides of wings as well as having air sacs in their bones air sacs are connected to airways of respiratory system and pelican can keep its air sacs inflated by closing its glottis but how air sacs are inflated is not clear air sacs serve to keep pelican remarkably buoyant in water and may also cushion impact of pelican s body on water surface when they dive from flight into water to catch fish superficial air sacs may also help to round body contours especially over abdomen where surface protuberances may be caused by viscera changing size and position to enable overlying feathers to form more effective heat insulation and also to enable feathers to be held in position for good aerodynamics distribution and habitat modern pelicans are found on all continents except antarctica they primarily inhabit warm regions although breeding ranges extend to latitudes of 45deg south australian pelicans in tasmania and 60deg north american white pelicans in western canada birds of inland and coastal waters they are absent from polar regions deep ocean oceanic islands except galapagos and inland south america as well as from eastern coast of south america from mouth of amazon river southwards subfossil bones have been recovered from as far south as new zealand s south island although their scarcity and isolated occurrence suggests that these remains may have merely been vagrants from australia much as is case today behaviour and ecology thumb right upright alt australian pelican gliding an australian pelican gliding with its large wings extended pelicans swim well with their strong legs and their webbed feet they rub backs of their heads on their preen glands to pick up an oily secretion which they transfer to their plumage to waterproof it holding their wings only loosely against their bodies pelicans float with relatively little of their bodies below water surface they dissipate excess heat by gular flutter rippling skin of throat and pouch with bill open to promote evaporative cooling they roost and loaf communally on beaches sandbanks and in shallow water a fibrous layer deep in breast muscles can hold wings rigidly horizontal for gliding and soaring thus they use thermals for soaring to heights of 3000 m 10 000 ft or more combined both with gliding and with flapping flight in v formation to commute distances up to to feeding areas pelicans also fly low or skim over stretches of water using a phenomenon known as ground effect to reduce drag and increase lift as air flows between wings and water surface it is compressed to a higher density and exerts a stronger upward force against bird above hence substantial energy is saved while flying adult pelicans rely on visual displays and behaviour to communicate particularly using their wings and bills agonistic behaviour consists of thrusting and snapping at opponents with their bills or lifting and waving their wings in a threatening manner adult pelicans grunt when at colony but are generally silent elsewhere or outside breeding season conversely colonies are noisy as chicks vocalise extensively breeding and lifespan pelicans are gregarious and nest colonially pairs are monogamous for a single season but pair bond extends only to nesting area mates are independent away from nest ground nesting white species have a complex communal courtship involving a group of males chasing a single female in air on land or in water while pointing gaping and thrusting their bills at each other they can finish process in a day tree nesting species have a simpler process in which perched males advertise for females location of breeding colony is constrained by availability of an ample supply of fish to eat although pelicans can use thermals to soar and commute for hundreds of kilometres daily to fetch food australian pelican has two reproductive strategies depending on local degree of environmental predictability colonies of tens or hundreds rarely thousands of birds breed regularly on small coastal and islands where food is seasonally or permanently available in arid inland australia especially in endorheic lake eyre basin pelicans breed opportunistically in very large numbers of up to 50 000 pairs when irregular major floods which may be many years apart fill ephemeral salt lakes and provide large amounts of food for several months before drying out again in all species copulation takes place at nest site it begins shortly after pairing and continues for 3 10 days before egg laying male brings nesting material in ground nesting species which may not build a nest sometimes in pouch and in tree nesting species crosswise in bill female then heaps material up to form a simple structure eggs are oval white and coarsely textured all species normally lay at least two eggs usual clutch size is one to three rarely up to six both sexes incubate with eggs on top of or below feet they may display when changing shifts incubation takes 30 36 days hatching success for undisturbed pairs can be as high as 95 but because of sibling competition or siblicide in wild usually all but one nestling dies within first few weeks later in pink backed and spot billed species both parents feed their young small chicks are fed by regurgitation after about a week they are able to put their heads into their parents pouches and feed themselves sometimes before but especially after being fed pelican chick may seem to throw a tantrum by loudly vocalizing and dragging itself around in a circle by one wing and leg striking its head on ground or anything nearby and tantrums sometimes end in what looks like a seizure that results in chick falling briefly unconscious reason is not clearly known but a common belief is that it is to draw attention to itself and away from any siblings who are waiting to be fed parents of ground nesting species sometimes drag older young around roughly by head before feeding them from about 25 days old young of these species gather in pods or creches of up to 100 birds in which parents recognise and feed only their own offspring by 6 8 weeks they wander around occasionally swimming and may practise communal feeding young of all species fledge 10 12 weeks after hatching they may remain with their parents afterwards but are now seldom or never fed they are mature at three or four years old overall breeding success is highly variable pelicans live for 15 to 25 years in wild although one reached an age of 54 years in captivity feeding diet of pelicans usually consists of fish but occasionally amphibians turtles crustaceans insects birds and mammals are also eaten elliott 1992 p 295 298 309 311 size of preferred prey fish varies depending on pelican species and location for example in africa pink backed pelican generally takes fish ranging in size from fry up to and great white pelican prefers somewhat larger fish up to but in europe latter species has been recorded taking fish up to in deep water white pelicans often fish alone nearer shore several encircle schools of small fish or form a line to drive them into shallows beating their wings on water surface and then scooping up prey although all pelican species may feed in groups or alone dalmantian pink backed and spot billed pelicans are only ones to prefer solitary feeding when fishing in groups all pelican species have been known to work together to catch their prey and dalmantian pelicans may even cooperate with great cormorants they catch multiple small fish by expanding throat pouch which must be drained above water surface before swallowing this operation takes up to a minute during which time other seabirds may steal fish left thumb thumbtime 2 5 alt brown pelicans diving brown pelicans diving into sea to catch fish in jamaica large fish are caught with bill tip then tossed up in air to be caught and slid into gullet head first a gull will sometimes stand on pelican s head peck it to distraction and grab a fish from open bill pelicans in their turn sometimes snatch prey from other waterbirds brown pelican usually plunge dives head first for its prey from a height as great as especially for anchovies and menhaden only other pelican to feed using a similar technique is peruvian pelican but its dives are typically from a lower height than brown pelican australian and american white pelicans may feed by low plunge dives landing feet first and then scooping up prey with beak but they as well as remaining pelican species primarily feed while swimming on water aquatic prey is most commonly taken at or near water surface although principally a fish eater australian pelican is also an eclectic and opportunistic scavenger and carnivore that forages in landfill sites as well as taking carrion and anything from insects and small crustaceans to ducks and small dogs food is not stored in a pelican s throat pouch contrary to popular folklore great white pelicans have been observed swallowing city pigeons in st james s park in london spokeswoman for royal parks louise wood opined that feeding on other birds is more likely with captive pelicans that live in a environment and are in constant close contact with humans however in southern africa eggs and chicks of cape cormorant are an important food source for great white pelicans several other bird species have been recorded in diet of this pelican in south africa including cape gannet chicks on island as well as crowned cormorants kelp gulls greater crested terns and african penguins on dassen island and elsewhere australian pelican which is particularly willing to take a wide range of prey items has been recorded feeding on young australian white ibis and young and adult grey teals and silver gulls brown pelicans have been reported preying on young common murres in california and eggs and nestlings of cattle egrets and nestling great egrets in baja california mexico peruvian pelicans in chile have been recorded feeding on nestlings of imperial juvenile peruvian diving petrels and grey gulls cannibalism of chicks of their own species is known from australian brown and peruvian pelicans status and conservation populations globally pelican populations are adversely affected by these main factors declining supplies of fish through overfishing or water pollution destruction of habitat direct effects of human activity such as disturbance at nesting colonies hunting and culling entanglement in fishing lines and hooks and presence of pollutants such as ddt and endrin most species populations are more or less stable although three are classified by iucn as being at risk all species breed readily in zoos which is potentially useful for conservation management thumb pelecanus occidentalis tortuga bay island of santa cruz galapagos combined population of brown and peruvian pelicans is estimated at 650 000 birds with around 250 000 in united states and caribbean and 400 000 in peru national audubon society estimates global population of brown pelican at 300 000 numbers of brown pelican plummeted in 1950s and 1960s largely as a consequence of environmental ddt pollution and species was listed as endangered in us in 1970 with restrictions on ddt use in us from 1972 its population has recovered and it was delisted in 2009 peruvian pelican is listed as near threatened because although population is estimated by birdlife international to exceed 500 000 mature individuals and is possibly increasing it has been much higher in past it declined dramatically during 1998 el nino event and could experience similar declines in future conservation needs include regular monitoring throughout range to determine population trends particularly after el nino years restricting human access to important breeding colonies and assessing interactions with fisheries spot billed pelican has an estimated population between 13 000 and 18 000 and is considered to be near threatened in iucn red list of threatened species numbers declined substantially during 20th century one crucial factor being eradication of important valley breeding colony in burma through deforestation and loss of feeding sites chief threats it faces are from habitat loss and human disturbance but populations have mostly stabilised following increased protection in india and cambodia pink backed pelican has a large population ranging over much of sub saharan africa in absence of substantial threats or evidence of declines across its range its conservation status is assessed as being of least concern regional threats include drainage of wetlands and increasing disturbance in southern africa species is susceptible to bioaccumulation of toxins and destruction of nesting trees by logging american white pelican has increased in numbers with its population estimated at over 157 000 birds in 2005 becoming more numerous east of continental divide while declining in west however whether its numbers have been affected by exposure to pesticides is unclear as it has also lost habitat through wetland drainage and competition with recreational use of lakes and rivers right thumb great white pelicans loafing in kenya great white pelicans range over a large area of africa and southern asia overall trend in numbers is uncertain with a mix of regional populations that are increasing declining stable or unknown but no evidence has been found of rapid overall decline and status of species is assessed as being of least concern threats include drainage of wetlands persecution and sport hunting disturbance at breeding colonies and contamination by pesticides and heavy metals dalmatian pelican has a population estimated at between 10 000 and 20 000 following massive declines in 19th and 20th centuries main ongoing threats include hunting especially in eastern asia disturbance coastal development collision with overhead power lines and over exploitation of fish stocks it is listed as near threatened by iucn red list of threatened species as population trend is downwards especially in mongolia where it is nearly extinct however several european colonies are increasing in size and largest colony for species at small prespa lake in greece has reached about 1 400 breeding pairs following conservation measures widespread across australia australian pelican has a population generally estimated at between 300 000 and 500 000 individuals overall population numbers fluctuate widely and erratically depending on wetland conditions and breeding success across continent species is assessed as being of least concern culling and disturbance pelicans have been persecuted by humans for their perceived competition for fish despite fact that their diet overlaps little with fish caught by people starting in 1880s american white pelicans were clubbed and shot their eggs and young were deliberately destroyed and their feeding and nesting sites were degraded by water management schemes and wetland drainage even in 21st century an increase in population of american white pelicans in southeastern idaho in us was seen to threaten recreational cutthroat trout fishery there leading to official attempts to reduce pelican numbers through systematic harassment and culling great white pelicans on dyer island in western cape region of south africa were culled during 19th century because their predation of eggs and chicks of guano producing seabirds was seen to threaten livelihood of guano collectors more recently such predation at south african seabird colonies has impacted on conservation of threatened seabird populations especially crowned cormorants cape cormorants and bank cormorants this has led to suggestions that pelican numbers should be controlled at vulnerable colonies apart from habitat destruction and deliberate targeted persecution pelicans are vulnerable to disturbance at their breeding colonies by birdwatchers photographers and other curious visitors human presence alone can cause birds to accidentally displace or destroy their eggs leave hatchlings exposed to predators and adverse weather or even abandon their colonies completely poisoning and pollution ddt pollution in environment was a major cause of decline of brown pelican populations in north america in 1950s and 1960s it entered oceanic food web contaminating and accumulating in several species including one of pelican s primary food fish northern anchovy its metabolite dde is a reproductive toxicant in pelicans and many other birds causing eggshell thinning and weakening and consequent breeding failure through eggs being accidentally crushed by brooding birds since an effective ban on use of ddt was implemented in us in 1972 eggshells of breeding brown pelicans there have thickened and their populations have largely recovered in late 1960s following major decline in brown pelican numbers in louisiana from ddt poisoning 500 pelicans were imported from florida to augment and re establish population over 300 subsequently died in april and may 1975 from poisoning by pesticide endrin about 14 000 pelicans including 7500 american white pelicans perished from botulism after eating fish from salton sea in 1990 in 1991 abnormal numbers of brown pelicans and brandt s cormorants died at santa cruz california when their food fish anchovies were contaminated with neurotoxic domoic acid produced by diatom pseudo nitzschia as waterbirds that feed on fish pelicans are highly susceptible to oil spills both directly by being oiled and by impact on their food resources a 2007 report to california fish and game commission estimated that during previous 20 years some 500 1000 brown pelicans had been affected by oil spills in california a 2011 report by center for biological diversity a year after april 2010 deepwater horizon oil spill said that 932 brown pelicans had been collected after being affected by oiling and estimated that 10 times that number had been harmed as a result of spill where pelicans interact with fishers through either sharing same waters or scavenging for fishing refuse they are especially vulnerable to being hooked and entangled in both active and discarded fishing lines fish hooks are swallowed or catch in skin of pouch or webbed feet and strong monofilament fishing line can become wound around bill wings or legs resulting in crippling starvation and often death local rescue organisations have been established in north america and australia by volunteers to treat and rehabilitate injured pelicans and other wildlife parasites and disease as with other bird families pelicans are susceptible to a variety of parasites specialist feather lice of genus are found in pouches of all species of pelican but are otherwise only known from new world and antarctic cormorants avian malaria is carried by mosquito culex and high densities of these biting insects may force pelican colonies to be abandoned leeches may attach to vent or sometimes inside of pouch a study of parasites of american white pelican found 75 different species including tapeworms flukes flies fleas ticks and nematodes many of these do little harm but flies may be implicated in death of nestlings particularly if they are weak or unwell and soft tick capensis sometimes causes adults to desert nest many pelican parasites are found in other bird groups but several lice are very host specific healthy pelicans can usually cope with their lice but sick birds may carry hundreds of individuals which hastens their demise pouch louse which occurs in pouch so cannot be removed by preening is usually not a serious problem even when present in such numbers that it covers whole interior of pouch but sometimes inflammation and bleeding may harm host brown pelican has a similarly extensive range of parasites nematodes and c and trematode ribeiroia ondatrae have caused illness and mortality in puerto rican population possibly endangering pelican on this island in may 2012 hundreds of

that pelican was believed to possess ability to prophesy safe passage in underworld for someone who had died consumption of pelican as with other seabirds is considered not kosher as an unclean animal and thus forbidden in jewish dietary law an origin myth from murri people of queensland cited by andrew lang describes how australian pelican acquired its black and white plumage pelican formerly a black bird made a canoe during a flood to save drowning people he fell in love with a woman he thus saved but her friends and she tricked him and escaped pelican consequently prepared to go to war against them by himself with white clay as war paint however before he had finished another pelican on seeing such a strange piebald creature killed him with its beak and all such pelicans have been

read medieval bestiaries device of a pelican in her piety or a pelican vulning from latin to wound herself was used in heraldry an older version of myth is that pelican used to kill its young then resurrect them with its blood again analogous to sacrifice of jesus likewise a folktale from india says that a pelican killed her young by rough treatment but was then so contrite that she resurrected them with her own blood legends of self wounding and provision of blood may have arisen because of impression a pelican sometimes gives that it is stabbing itself with its bill in reality it often presses this onto its chest to fully empty pouch another possible derivation is tendency of bird to rest with its bill on its breast dalmatian pelican has a blood red pouch in early breeding season
