espoused its scientific basis over religious dogma strong vedic and hindu aligned aspects remained his lectures included stories and parables and comparisons between tm and western practices

once meditated for seven hours jenny boyd also meditated for long periods but suffered from dysentery misdiagnosed as tonsilitis she said lennon also felt unwell suffering from jet lag and insomnia

private meditation cave when maharishi tried to put his arms around her she also says that her sister prudence assured her that it was an honour and a tradition for a holy man to touch someone after

made a pass at any woman according to cynthia however mardas allegations gathered momentum without a single shred of evidence or justification in her autobiography pattie boyd also expresses doubt regarding truth behind mardas claims but in this atmosphere of suspicion she had a horrid dream about maharishi and next day told harrison that they should leave according to harrison lennon had wanted to leave anyway to see ono and speculation surrounding farrow and other female students stirred up a situation that lennon was able to exploit infringements of maharishi s ban on alcohol and

harrison felt that he and lennon were wrong in way they had treated maharishi in june harrison told reporters in los angeles that his dissatisfaction was centred on how spiritual regeneration movement
