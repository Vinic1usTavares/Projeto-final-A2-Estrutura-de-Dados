hms ark royal pennant number 91 was an aircraft carrier of royal navy that served during second world war designed in 1934 to fit restrictions of washington naval treaty ark royal was built by cammell laird at birkenhead england and completed in november 1938 her design differed from previous aircraft carriers ark royal was first ship on which hangars and flight deck were an integral part of hull instead of an add on or part of superstructure designed to carry a large number of aircraft she had two hangar deck levels she served during a period that first saw extensive use of naval air power several carrier tactics were developed and refined aboard ark royal ark royal served in some of most active naval theatres of second world war she was involved in first aerial and u boat kills of war operations off norway search for german battleship and malta convoys ark royal survived several near misses and gained a reputation as a lucky ship she was torpedoed on 13 november 1941 by and sank following day one of her 1 488 crew members was killed her sinking was subject of several inquiries investigators were keen to know how carrier was lost in spite of efforts to save ship and tow her to naval base at gibraltar they found that several design flaws contributed to loss which were rectified in new british carriers wreck was discovered in december 2002 by an american underwater survey company using sonar mounted on an autonomous underwater vehicle under contract from bbc for filming of a documentary about ship at a depth of about and approximately from gibraltar design in 1923 admiralty prepared a 10 year building programme which included an aircraft carrier and 300 aircraft for fleet air arm economic downturn following first world war caused it to be postponed in 1930 director of naval construction sir arthur johns began to update plans for carrier by incorporating recently developed technology his aim was to increase number of aircraft carried by shortening landing and take off distances of aircraft using arrestor gear and compressed steam catapults respectively which would make more deck space available for storage and aircraft preparation along with inclusion of two hangar decks this allowed ark royal to carry up to 72 aircraft although development of larger and heavier aircraft during carrier s construction meant that actual number carried was between 50 and 60 ark royal featured an enclosed hangar when flight deck becomes strength deck aircraft hangars are then enclosed within hull structure terms enclosed and open hangars do not strictly speaking refer to a hangar that is closed or open on sides but rather to whether hangar is respectively below or above strength deck where flight deck was strength deck friedman flight deck was designed with 75 in of ducol steel enclosed hangar design required a deck of approximately this thickness to ensure adequate hull integrity so limited armour protection was a by product of enclosed hangar design strength deck is designed to carry structural loading in combination with hull girder and side and bottom plating ship s structure above strength deck is termed superstructure ducol steel was an advanced type of high tensile steel which had great strength and was often used to provide armour for splinter protection and was strongly built with 19mm thick ducol steel plating 2 two hangar decks were thus enclosed within hull girder which also gave splinter protection to hangars machinery spaces were protected by belt armour three lifts moved aircraft between hangars and flight deck thumb left ark royals flight deck overhangs stern her unusual height above waterline is visible in comparison with tugboat another feature was length and height of flight deck at flight deck was longer than keel latter dictated by length of royal navy drydocks in gibraltar and malta due to twin hangar decks flight deck rose to above waterline washington and london naval treaties had restricted warship tonnage for a number of nations after end of great war and were both to expire by end of 1936 with a potential naval arms race developing between britain japan and italy british government sought a second treaty which included limiting maximum displacement of an aircraft carrier to ark royal would have to fit this anticipated limit to conserve weight armour plating was limited to belt engine rooms and magazines while welding instead of riveting 65 of hull saved installation of an armoured flight deck was not possible as weight would have placed ark royal above proposed limit while reducing her endurance and stability ship was designed with a three layer side protection system based upon a void liquid void scheme very similar to that used on king george v class battleships and was designed to protect against torpedoes with up to a warhead ship was fitted with six boilers which powered three parsons geared turbines turbines were connected via three to three propellers in diameter to produce a maximum theoretical speed of speed was important as with catapults and arrestor gear ark royal would have to turn into wind to launch and recover aircraft to avoid endangering other ships with frequent course changes associated with flight operations ark royal would have to break away from accompanying ships and catch up on completion additionally as carrier was not armed for ship to ship combat speed was her main protection against enemy warships construction deteriorating international situation by 1933 typified by germany s rearmament and expansion of japan and italy convinced british to announce funds for carrier s construction in 1934 budget proposals plans were finished by november 1934 and were tendered in february 1935 to cammell laird and company ltd which calculated cost of hull at ps1 496 250 and main machinery at approximately ps500 000 equivalent to ps31 850 000 in 2016 overall cost was estimated to be over ps3 million making ark royal most expensive ship ordered by royal navy construction began on job no 1012 when ark royals keel was laid down on 16 september 1935 thumb left ark royal immediately after launching lifts on flight deck and anti aircraft positions on hull are visible ark royal spent nearly two years in builder s yard before being launched on 13 april 1937 by lady maud hoare wife of sir samuel hoare then first lord of admiralty bottle of champagne thrown against ark royals bows did not smash until fourth attempt carrier spent a year fitting out was handed over to her first commander captain arthur power on 16 november 1938 and was commissioned on 16 december although intended for far east events in europe during carrier s construction including italian invasion of abyssinia in 1935 and spanish civil war in 1936 caused admiralty to mark her for deployment with home and mediterranean fleets after her crew joined at end of 1938 ark royal underwent sea trials to prepare for service during which carrier proved capable of sailing above her theoretical speed reaching over and in trials during may 1938 ark royal achieved with at a deep displacement of friedman p 123 armament and aircraft ark royals armament was designed with anti aircraft warfare in mind as aircraft were expected to be main threat ships and submarines could be outrun or dealt with by escorts her main armament was sixteen quick firing dual purpose guns in eight double turrets four on each side of hull controlled by four directors using high angle control system original design placed turrets low on hull but was later altered to locate them just below flight deck which increased each turret s field of fire british carrier aviation appendix a ark royal entered service with four 8 barrelled mountings but by october 1941 all six mountings were in place 8 barrelled 2 pounder pom pom guns were located on flight deck in front of and behind superstructure island while eight 4 barrelled machine guns were installed on small projecting platforms to front and rear of flight deck sixteen fleet air arm squadrons were posted aboard ark royal during her career an average of five squadrons at any time on entering service most of ark royals squadrons were equipped with either blackburn skuas used as fighters and dive bombers or fairey swordfish for reconnaissance and torpedo bombing from april 1940 squadrons equipped with skuas were upgraded to fairey fulmars like their predecessors these were used as fighters and bombers on occasion carrier operated blackburn roc fighter bombers from april 1939 october 1940 and fairey albacore torpedo bombers during october 1941 these were replacement aircraft used to boost squadron numbers in june 1940 ark royal was host to 701 naval air squadron a training

service history with hunter killer groups thumb right message sent to ship informing her of commencing of hostilities on 3 september 1939 outbreak of second world war on 3 september 1939 had been presaged by germany s u boat fleet taking up positions off british coast where they could intercept british shipping within hours of war starting passenger ship was torpedoed by first of over 65 000 tons of shipping sunk by u boats during first week of war ark royal was deployed with home fleet in north western approaches as part of a hunter killer group consisting of a flotilla of destroyers and other anti submarine vessels grouped around an aircraft carrier either or ark royal carrier borne aircraft could increase area searched for u boats but made carriers tempting targets on 14 september ark royal received a distress call from which was away under pursuit from surfaced u 30 ark royal launched aircraft to aid merchant ship but was spotted by which launched two torpedoes lookouts spotted torpedo tracks and ark royal turned towards attack reducing her cross section and causing torpedoes to miss and explode harmlessly astern three f class destroyers escorting carrier began to depth charge u 39 and forced her to surface german crew abandoned ship before u 39 sank first u boat lost during war ark royals aircraft reached fanad head which was in hands of a german boarding party skuas unsuccessfully attacked u 30 two crashed when caught by blast of their own bombs u boat escaped after rescuing boarding party and pilots of downed aircraft both observers had drowned and torpedoing fanad head ark royal returned to base in loch ewe where she and her crew were inspected by winston churchill sinking of u 39 was hailed as important to morale however failed attack on ark royal and successful attack on courageous on 17 september convinced admiralty it was too dangerous to risk aircraft carriers in this way and carrier centred hunter killer groups were abandoned another near miss thumb ark royal conducting flying operations in 1939 on 25 september ark royal helped rescue submarine which had been damaged by german warships off horn reefs in kattegat while returning to port with spearfish and battleships and on 26 september ships were located by three luftwaffe dornier do 18 seaplanes ark royal launched three blackburn skuas to disperse them one dornier was shot down in first british aerial kill of war air commander aboard ark royal aware that surviving dorniers would report location of british ships ordered aircraft to be secured and anti aircraft weapons readied four junkers ju 88 bombers of luftwaffe bomber wing kg 30 soon appeared three were driven away by anti aircraft fire but fourth launched a bomb at carrier ark royal turned hard to starboard heeling over and avoiding bomb which landed in ocean off her starboard bow and sent a spout of water over ship german pilots did not see if carrier had been hit and a reconnaissance flight later located two battleships but not ark royal based on this information germans incorrectly claimed that ark royal had sunk to prove german propaganda false before it had a negative effect on britain s allies winston churchill personally reassured united states president franklin delano roosevelt that carrier was undamaged and invited us naval attache to view ark royal in dock british naval attache in rome was instructed to assure italian prime minister benito mussolini that ship was still in service this was an embarrassment for goebbels and nazi propaganda hunting graf spee in october 1939 ark royal was redeployed to freetown to operate off african coast in hunt for german commerce raider carrier was assigned to force k and sailed with battlecruiser to south atlantic on 9 october aircraft from ark royal spotted german tanker altmark which supplied graf spee tanker was disguised as us vessel delmar which fooled british into passing her by on 5 november ark royal captured german merchant which was attempting to reach germany ship was later taken into british service as a cargo ship and renamed empire ability several neutral merchant ships were also spotted by carrier s aircraft twice causing crews to believe they were under attack and abandon ship a note explaining situation was dropped in a bag to a norwegian vessel s crew and they re boarded an attempt to repeat this exercise with a belgian crew failed when bag was dropped down ship s funnel by this time graf spee had put into montevideo to repair damage received during battle of river plate two royal navy cruisers followed raider and patrolled harbour entrance while reporting graf spees position to fleet ark royal and renown were dispatched to join british ships outside harbour but as they were 36 hours away british naval attache came up with a plan to make germans believe that two capital ships had already arrived an order for fuel for ark royal was placed at buenos aires west of montevideo this was leaked to press passed on to german embassy in montevideo and given to graf spees captain hans langsdorff this contributed to langsdorff s decision to scuttle his ship return to fleet with graf spee sunk ark royal remained in atlantic for a short time before escorting damaged heavy cruiser back to devonport dockyard where they arrived in february following this ark royal proceeded to portsmouth to take on supplies and personnel before sailing to scapa flow on arrival she transferred her blackburn skuas to naval air station to strengthen anchorage s defences ark royal was then assigned to mediterranean fleet for exercises departing scapa flow on 31 march 1940 and heading for alexandria with aircraft carrier carriers arrived in eastern mediterranean on 8 april but exercises were cancelled a day later ships sailed to gibraltar to await orders german forces had invaded norway as part of operation weserubung on 9 april and had secured sections of coast attempts by royal navy to operate in support of british troops were unsuccessful air attacks had overwhelmed ships sinking and nearly sinking realising that british ships required air cover but aware that norwegian coast was outside range of british land based aircraft admiralty recalled ark royal and glorious from mediterranean on 16 april norwegian campaign ark royal and glorious arrived at scapa flow on 23 april 1940 and were immediately redeployed as part of operation dx sailing to norway with cruisers and and screened by destroyers and this was first time royal navy had deployed carriers with primary purpose of providing fighter protection for other warships ships took up position on 25 april off coast ark royal positioned offshore to reduce chance of air attacks carrier s aircraft conducted anti submarine patrols provided fighter support for other ships and carried out strikes against shipping and shore targets ark royal returned to scapa flow on 27 april to refuel and replace lost and damaged aircraft before heading back on same day with battleship as escort during return ark royal came under air attack from german junkers ju 88 and heinkel he 111 bombers operating from norway carrier was undamaged and resumed position on 29 april thumb left a blackburn skua landing on ark royal skuas were mainstay of fleet air arm during early second world war also visible are arrestor wires strung across flight deck by this point british high command had realised that they could not hold germans in southern norway evacuation of allied troops from molde and andalsnes began with ark royal providing air cover from 30 april on 1 may germans tried to sink carrier with numerous air attacks through day ark royals fighters and a heavy anti aircraft barrage drove off enemy and although several bombs were dropped at carrier none impacted evacuation was completed on 3 may and carrier was recalled to scapa flow to refuel and rearm before returning to norway while in port captain arthur power left ship for a promotion to admiralty and was replaced by captain cedric holland on return to norway ark royal was told to provide air cover for operations around narvik including landing of french troops on 13 may she was joined on 18 may by carriers glorious and furious despite these efforts it was clear by end of may that french forces were on verge of collapse and norway was a sideshow compared to german advance to english channel operation alphabet was instigated to move allied troops from narvik to britain ark royal and glorious screened by destroyers and sailed from scapa flow on 1 june to cover evacuation which commenced next day ark royal carried out air patrols and bombing raids from 3 6 june before redeploying to narvik on 7 june disaster struck next day when glorious escorted by acasta and ardent were detached to return to britain three ships were attacked and sunk by german battlecruisers and a search by ark royals aircraft failed to locate german ships which had returned to trondheim last evacuation convoy left narvik on 9 june before british ships could withdraw a raid on trondheim located scharnhorst an attack by ark royals skuas took place at midnight on 13 june attack was a disaster escort destroyers and collided while ark royal was launching aircraft in fog and returned to england for repairs eight of fifteen attacking skuas were shot down while scharnhorst escaped damage ark royal returned to scapa flow following day and was reassigned to mediterranean fleet mediterranean deployment ark royal left scapa flow with battlecruiser and three destroyers arriving at gibraltar on 23 june 1940 here she joined force h under sir james somerville after capitulation of france there was concern that a french fleet at mers el kebir might fall under axis control and tip balance of power in mediterranean affecting whole war ark royals captain cedric holland had been british naval attache in paris and was sent to negotiate surrender or scuttling of french fleet force h was deployed outside harbour and when french admirals refused to agree to offered terms opened fire on french ships during attack on mers el kebir ark royals aircraft provided targeting information for british ships french battleship escaped despite attacks by swordfish from ark royal two days after attack aircraft from ark royal incapacitated french battleship which had been beached in initial attack thumb right a fairey swordfish aircraft lands on ark royals flight deck whilst a blackburn skua circles overhead photograph taken from after attacks on italian fleet off sardinia having reduced possibility of a french challenge in mediterranean force h prepared for attacks on italian targets and sailed from gibraltar on 8 july force was attacked by italian bombers within eight hours of departing and although force h escaped damage somerville cancelled raids and ordered fleet to gibraltar during july british colony of malta came under attack from italian air force with force h ordered to deliver hawker hurricanes to reinforce island s air defences force h was deployed from 31 july 4 august with carrier used to deliver aircraft while ark royal provided air cover for fleet on 2 august ark royal launched a successful air attack against italian air base at cagliari force h remained at gibraltar until 30 september when it escorted reinforcements for admiral andrew cunningham s fleet to alexandria en route diversionary attacks were planned on italian air bases at and cagliari to direct attention from both reinforcement operation and a supply convoy sailing to malta attacks were successfully carried out on 1 october and fleet reached alexandria without significant attention from italian air force from alexandria ark royal was detached and sent to west africa to support british attempts to encourage vichy french colonies to switch allegiance to free french during negotiations several free french aircraft flew from ark royal but their aircrews were arrested at dakar negotiations failed and bombers from ark royal were directed against military installations during unsuccessful british attempt to take dakar by force following this ark royal returned to britain for refit docking in liverpool on 8 october after being escorted by and refit which lasted until 3 november included repairs to her machinery and installation of a new flight deck barrier thumb left bombs falling astern of ark royal during an attack by italian aircraft during battle of cape spartivento photograph taken from cruiser following refit ark royal accompanied by and sailed for gibraltar arriving on 6 november they were deployed with rest of force h to escort convoys from gibraltar to alexandria and malta performing several runs before being assigned to operation collar one of 35 convoys to support malta between 1940 and 1942 on 25 november an italian fleet led by battleships and was dispatched to intercept convoy italian fleet was detected by a reconnaissance aircraft from ark royal and carrier launched swordfish torpedo bombers while capital ships of force h turned to meet enemy during engagement battle of cape spartivento italian destroyer was damaged although it is uncertain if torpedoes from bombers or british gunfire were responsible british mistook for a cruiser while italian commanders received incorrect reports that cruiser had been hit british attacks failed to damage any other italian ships or sink disabled destroyer and a retaliatory attack by italian air force saw ark royal as subject of multiple bombing runs none of which hit battle had no clear result although british convoy reached its destination unscathed on 14 december 1940 ark royal and force h were redeployed from gibraltar to atlantic to search azores for commerce raiders ark royal returned to mediterranean on 20 december and escorted battleship and merchant ships from malta until 27 december force h then became involved in operation excess a plan to move convoys through mediterranean to support western desert force which was trying to push italian land forces from egypt into libya over next month british control of mediterranean theatre was weakened particularly by entry of luftwaffe and near loss of aircraft carrier mediterranean fleet was under pressure from axis forces in eastern mediterranean while british port at gibraltar was likely to be lost if spanish chose to ally with germans instead of remaining out of war to relieve mediterranean fleet while demonstrating british strength to spanish admiralty and admiral cunningham planned to use ark royals swordfish bombers in raids against italian targets supported by bombardment from heavy fleet units first bombing on 2 january against tirso dam in sardinia was unsuccessful but ark royals swordfish bombers were more successful on 6 january when they bombed port city of genoa carrier s aircraft also covered battlecruiser renown and battleship malaya while they shelled port on 9 january ark royal launched aircraft to bomb an oil refinery at la spezia and to lay mines in harbour both operations were successful searching for scharnhorst and gneisenau in early february 1941 battleships and headed into atlantic on orders of grand admiral erich raeder commander of german navy they were to disrupt allied shipping and draw capital ships from other areas on 8 march force h and ark royal were ordered to canary islands to search for battleships and to cover convoys crossing from united states ark royal used her aircraft to search for captured ships returning to germany under control of prize crews three ships were located on 19 march two scuttled themselves while third ss polykarp was recaptured on evening of 21 march 1941 a fairey fulmar from ark royal stumbled across scharnhorst and gneisenau at sea because of a radio malfunction crew had to return to ark royal to report by which time german ships had escaped under fog next day ark royal re established air patrols in hope of re locating raiders during day a catapult malfunction destroyed a fairey swordfish flinging fuselage into sea ahead of carrier unable to stop ark royal ran over swordfish and was overhead when aircraft s depth charges detonated scharnhorst and gneisenau reached brest without british harassment while ark royal returned to gibraltar for repairs arriving on 24 march malta convoys

raiders by may 1941 erwin rommel s afrika korps were driving through north africa towards suez canal pushing western desert force before them with british forces close to collapse and strategic locations threatened british high command risked sending a reinforcement convoy across mediterranean to alexandria convoy consisted of five large transport ships escorted by ark royal battlecruiser renown battleship cruisers and and screened by destroyers of 5th destroyer flotilla prior to ark royals departure captain holland left to recuperate from stress and poor health and was replaced by captain loben maund convoy left gibraltar on 6 may and was detected by italian aircraft convoy limited to and escorted by so many capital ships was such a tempting target that italian and german aircraft were mobilised british convoy came under air attack on 8 may first by italian air force then german luftwaffe over day 12 of ark royals fairey fulmars maximum number available drove off over 50 aircraft with assistance of targeting information from radar and anti aircraft fire from escorts during initial waves one fulmar was lost killing flight lieutenant rupert and lieutenant mark somerville another was destroyed with aircrew recovered while several others were damaged consequently only seven were able to face main luftwaffe force of 34 aircraft while an attack just before dark was driven off by two aircraft and heavy fire from ships convoy survived without serious damage only casualties were to mines with empire song sunk and new zealand star damaged but able to reach port ark royal underwent another aerial attack on 12 may during her return to gibraltar later that month she and fellow aircraft carrier furious delivered hawker hurricanes to support malta hunting bismarck on 18 may 1941 german battleship and heavy cruiser began operation rheinubung by breaking into atlantic to raid shipping after sinking battlecruiser hood and damaging battleship during battle of denmark strait bismarck shook off her pursuers and headed for french atlantic coast ark royal renown and sheffield accompanied by and were dispatched to atlantic on 23 may to search for battleship on 26 may a swordfish from ark royal located bismarck and began to shadow her while home fleet was mobilised to pursue thumb left one of ark royals fairey swordfish returns at low level over sea after making a torpedo attack on bismarck at time of detection british ships were away and would not catch bismarck before she reached saint nazaire fifteen swordfish bombers were armed with torpedoes and sent to delay ship sheffield also shadowing bismarck was between ark royal and bismarck aircraft mistook british cruiser for their target and fired torpedoes torpedoes were fitted with unreliable magnetic detonators which caused most to explode on contact with water while sheffield evaded rest after realising his mistake one of pilots signalled sorry for kipper to sheffield on return to carrier swordfish were re armed with contact detonator warhead torpedoes and launched at 19 15 for a second attack locating and attacking bismarck just before sunset three torpedoes hit battleship two detonated forward of engine rooms while third struck starboard steering compartment and jammed her rudder in a 15deg port turn bismarck was forced to sail in circles until a combination of alternating propeller speeds was found which would keep her on a reasonably steady course which in prevailing force 8 wind and sea state forced her to sail towards british warships with almost no manoeuvring capability german battleship suffered heavy attack during night of 26 27 may and sank at 10 39 hours on 27 may escorting malta convoys thumb right six blackburn skuas of no 800 squadron fleet air arm lined up on deck before taking off ark royal and ships of force h returned to gibraltar on 29 may 1941 despite boost in allied morale from sinking of battleship bismarck war in mediterranean was going against allies greece and crete had fallen to axis powers and afrika korps was preparing to launch a final push into egypt malta remained an important stronghold in mediterranean but was coming under increased pressure from italian and german air attacks and could no longer be supplied from east since fall of crete ark royal was pressed into service delivering aircraft to malta during several supply runs throughout june and july and escorting convoys of operation substance in july and operation halberd in september despite some losses convoys succeeded in keeping malta supplied and fighting continued allied presence in malta was a considerable problem for rommel in africa who was losing as much as 1 3 of his supplies from italy to submarines and bombers based there adolf hitler decided to send a flotilla of u boats into mediterranean to attack allied shipping against advice of grossadmiral raeder final voyage and sinking on 10 november 1941 ark royal ferried more aircraft to malta before returning to gibraltar admiral somerville had been warned of u boats off spanish coast and reminded force h to be vigilant also at sea was friedrich s which had received a report that force h was returning to gibraltar on 13 november at 15 40 sonar operator aboard destroyer detected an unidentified sound but assumed it was propellers of a nearby destroyer one minute later ark royal was struck amidships by a torpedo between fuel bunkers and bomb store and directly below bridge island explosion caused ark royal to shake hurled loaded torpedo bombers into air and killed able seaman edward mitchell a hole was created on ship s bottom and on starboard side below water line by torpedo which was judged to have run deep striking bilge keel where it detonated inboard of side

power while communications were severed shipwide thumb left moving alongside damaged and listing ark royal to take off survivors immediately after torpedo strike captain maund ordered engines to full stop but discovered that communications were down and had to send a runner to engine room ship s continued motion enlarged hole in hull and by time ark royal stopped she had taken on a great deal of water and begun to list to starboard reaching 18deg from centre within 20 minutes considering list of carrier and fact that other carriers including courageous and glorious had sunk rapidly with heavy loss of life maund gave order to abandon ship crew were assembled on flight deck to determine who would remain on board to try to save ship while legion came alongside to take off rest as a result comprehensive damage control measures were not initiated until 49 minutes after attack flooding spread unchecked exacerbated by covers and hatches left open during evacuation of lower decks water spread to centreline boiler room which started to flood from below and power was lost shipwide when boiler uptakes became choked ark royal had no backup diesel generators about half an hour after explosion carrier appeared to stabilise admiral somerville determined to save ark royal ordered damage control parties back to carrier before taking battleship malaya to gibraltar to organise salvage efforts damage control parties re lit a boiler restoring power to bilge pumps destroyer came alongside to provide power and additional pumps while swordfish aircraft from gibraltar flew overhead to supplement anti submarine patrols tug thames arrived from gibraltar at 20 00 and attached a tow line to ark royal but flooding had caused ship to list more severely rising water reached boiler room fan flat an uninterrupted compartment running width of ship this forced shutdown of restored boiler thumb right another photograph showing degree of list list reached 20deg between 02 05 and 02 30 and when abandon ship was declared again at 04 00 had reached 27deg ark royals complement had been evacuated to legion by 04 30 with exception of mitchell there were no fatalities 1 487 officers and crew were transported to gibraltar list reached 45deg before ark royal capsized and sank at 06 19 on 14 november witnesses reported carrier rolling to 90deg where she remained for three minutes before inverting ark royal then broke in two aft sinking within a couple of minutes followed by bow investigation following sinking a board of inquiry was established to investigate loss based on its findings captain loben maund was court martialled in february 1942 for negligence he was found guilty on two counts of negligence one of failing to ensure that properly constituted damage control parties had remained on board after general evacuation and one of failing to ensure ship was in a sufficient state of readiness to deal with possible damage board tempered their judgement with an acknowledgement that a high standard was being expected of maund and that he was primarily concerned with welfare of his crew bucknill committee which had been set up to investigate loss of major warships also produced a report this report said that lack of backup power sources was a major design failure which contributed to loss ark royal depended on electricity for much of her operation and once boilers and steam driven dynamos were knocked out loss of power made damage control difficult committee recommended design of bulkheads and boiler intakes be improved to decrease risk of widespread flooding in boiler rooms and machine spaces while uninterrupted boiler room flat was criticised design flaws were rectified in illustrious and implacable class carriers under construction at time papers of admiral sir hugh binney reports of second bucknill committee relating to loss of hms prince of wales and hms ark royal 1941 1942 held at liddell hart centre for military archives king s college london board of inquiry closed its report with observation that ark royal had sunk east of europa point southernmost tip of gibraltar this was accepted as wreck location for 60 years rediscovery location of wreck was undetermined until mid december 2002 when wreck was discovered by an underwater survey company c c technologies inc using a sonar equipped autonomous underwater vehicle from gibraltar at about 1000 metres depth company had been contracted by bbc as part of a documentary on maritime archaeology related to major battles of royal navy ark royal wreck lies in two main pieces with stern section sitting upright and bow section upside down of bow is separated from rest of ship s hull a large debris field which includes funnel and bridge island parts of ship that came loose as carrier sank and aircraft from hangars lay between two hull sections analysis revealed that port side of ship hit seabed first wreck was found further east than expected researchers originally thought wreck had been carried by currents farther into mediterranean as she sank that ship had travelled eastwards underwater before reaching seabed presence near hull pieces of other debris including a swordfish bomber that was tipped off flight deck before ship rolled proved this false if current had pushed hull pieces any significant distance sideways as they sank debris would have been spread over a much wider area it seems though that eastward currents had affected her progress towards gibraltar during time she was under tow study of wreck also showed that restarting engines to provide power increased stresses placed on hull adding to flooding once power was then lost it was impossible to prevent ship from sinking her fate was more result of design flaws than of actions of her captain notes a washington naval treaty signed in february 1922 imposed a limit of 135 000 tons on total british aircraft carrier tonnage with no one ship allowed to exceed 33 000 tons and only two to exceed 27 000 tons london naval treaty signed in april 1930 prevented signatories from constructing new capital ships or converting existing capital ships into aircraft carriers until
