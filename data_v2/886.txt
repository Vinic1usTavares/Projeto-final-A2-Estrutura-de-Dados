being diagnosed with walking pneumonia was given a medical discharge and moved back home with his mother from there he commuted to a job as a shipping clerk with kemper insurance co in chicago shortly after his return a friend introduced him to avalon hill s new wargame gettysburg and gygax was soon obsessed with game often playing marathon sessions once a week or more it was also from avalon hill that he ordered first blank hex mapping sheets that were available which he then employed to design his own games at about same time that he discovered gettysburg his mother re introduced him to mary jo powell who had left lake geneva as a child and had just returned gygax was smitten with woman and after a short courtship persuaded her to marry him despite fact that he was only 19 this caused some friction with his best friend don kaye who had also been wooing mary jo to point where kaye refused to attend gygax s wedding kaye and gygax reconciled after wedding young couple moved to chicago

did not accept scholarship despite his commitments to his job raising a family school and his political volunteerism gygax continued to play wargames it reached point that mary jo pregnant with their second child believed he was having an affair and confronted him in a friend s basement only to discover him and his friends sitting around a map covered table in 1962 gygax got a job as an insurance

wargame hobby world and was writing many magazine articles on subject gygax learned about h g wells little wars book for play of military miniatures wargames and fletcher pratt s naval wargame book gygax later looked for innovative ways to generate random numbers and he used not only common six sided dice but dice of all five platonic solid shapes which he discovered in a school supply catalog gygax cited his influences as robert e howard l sprague de camp jack vance fletcher pratt fritz leiber poul anderson a merritt and h p lovecraft wargames in 1967 gygax co founded international federation of wargamers ifw with bill speer and scott duncan ifw grew rapidly especially by assimilating several pre existing wargaming clubs and aimed to promote interest in wargames of all periods it provided a forum for wargamers via its newsletters and societies which enabled them to form local groups and share rules in 1967 gygax organized a 20 person gaming meet in basement of his home this event would later be referred to as gen con 0 in 1968 gygax rented lake geneva s vine covered horticultural hall for to hold first lake geneva convention also known as gen con gaming convention for short gen con is now one of north america s largest annual hobby game gatherings gygax met dave arneson future co creator of d d at second gen con in august 1969 together with don kaye mike reese and leon tucker gygax created a military miniatures society called lake geneva tactical studies association in 1970 with its first headquarters in gygax s basement shortly thereafter in 1970 robert kuntz and gygax founded castle crusade society of ifw late in october 1970 gygax lost his job at insurance company after almost nine years unemployed and now with a family of five children ernest ernie luke heidi cindy and elise he tried to use his enthusiasm for games to make a living by designing board games for commercial sale this clearly proved to be unsustainable when he only grossed 882 in 1971 he began cobbling shoes in his basement which provided him with a steady income and gave him more time for pursuing his interest in game development in 1971 he began doing some editing work at guidon games a publisher of wargames for which he produced board games alexander great and dunkirk battle of france early that same year gygax published chainmail a miniatures wargame that simulated medieval era tactical combat which he had originally written with hobby shop owner jeff perren chainmail medieval miniatures rules were originally published in castle crusade society s fanzine domesday book guidon games hired gygax to produce a wargaming with miniatures series of games and a new edition of chainmail 1971 was first book in series first edition of chainmail included a fantasy supplement to rules these comprised a system for warriors wizards and various monsters of non human races drawn from works of j r r tolkien and other sources for a small publisher like guidon games chainmail was relatively successful selling 100 copies per month gygax also collaborated on with mike reese leon tucker his contribution being change to a 20 sided spinner or a coffee can with 20 numbered poker chips or eventually 20 sided dice to decide combat resolutions instead of standard 6 sided dice he also collaborated with dave arneson on napoleonic naval wargame don t give up ship dave arneson adopted chainmail rules for his fantasy blackmoor campaign while visiting lake geneva in november 1972 arneson ran his fantasy game using new rules and gygax immediately saw potential of role playing games gygax and arneson immediately started to collaborate on creating fantasy game role playing game which would evolve into dungeons dragons two weeks after arneson s blackmoor demonstration gygax had produced a 50 page set of rules and was ready to try it on his two oldest children ernie and elise in a setting he called greyhawk this group rapidly expanded to include don kaye rob kuntz and eventually a large circle of players gygax sent 50 pages of rules to his wargaming contacts and asked them to playtest new game gygax and arneson continued to trade notes about their respective campaigns calling amalgamation of blackmoor and greyhawk great kingdom this collaboration gradually petered out as gygax and arneson realized their visions for new game were diverging based on feedback he received gygax created a 150 page revision of rules by mid 1973 several aspects of system governing magic in game were inspired by dying earth stories of fantasy author jack vance notably fact that magic users in game forget spells that they have learned immediately upon casting them and must re study them in order to cast them again and system as a whole drew upon work of authors such as robert e howard l sprague de camp michael moorcock roger zelazny poul anderson tolkien bram stoker and others he asked guidon games to publish it but 3 volume rule set in a labeled box was beyond scope of small publisher gygax attempted to pitch game to avalon hill but largest company in wargaming did not understand new concept of role playing and turned down his offer by 1974 gygax s greyhawk group which had started off with himself ernie gygax don kaye rob kuntz and terry kuntz had grown to over 20 people with rob kuntz becoming co dungeon master so that each of them could referee groups of only a dozen players tsr gygax left guidon games in 1973 and in october with don kaye as a partner founded tactical studies rules later known as tsr inc two men each invested in venture kaye borrowed his share on his life insurance policy in order to finance start up of tsr this was still not enough to print their new role playing game so they tried to raise money by immediately publishing cavaliers and roundheads but sales were poor and they still did not have enough capital to publish dungeons dragons worried that other playtesters and wargamers now familiar with gygax s rules would bring a similar product to market first two accepted an offer in december 1973 by game playing acquaintance brian blume to invest 2 000 in tsr to become an equal one third partner gygax accepted blume s offer right away kaye was less enthusiastic and after a week to consider offer he questioned blume closely before acquiescing blume s investment finally brought financing that enabled them to publish d d gygax worked on rules for more miniatures and tabletop battle games including classic warfare ancient period 1500 bc to 500 ad and warriors of mars first commercial version of d d was released by tsr in january 1974 as a boxed set a hand assembled print run of 1 000 copies put together in gygax s home sold out in less than a year at end of 1974 with sales of d d skyrocketing future looked bright for gygax and kaye who were only 36 however in january 1975 kaye unexpectedly died of a heart attack he had not made any specific provision in his will regarding his one third share of company simply leaving his entire estate to his wife donna although she had worked briefly for tsr as an accountant she had not shared her husband s enthusiasm for gaming and made it clear that she would not be having anything to do with managing company gygax characterized her as less than personable after don died she dumped all tactical studies rules materials off on my front porch it would have been impossible to manage a business with her involved as a partner after kaye s death tsr was forced to relocate from kaye s dining room to gygax s basement in july 1975 gygax and blume reorganized their company from a partnership to a corporation called tsr hobbies gygax owned 150 shares blume owned other 100 shares and both had option to buy up to 700 shares at any time in future but tsr hobbies had nothing to publish d d was still owned by three way partnership of tsr and neither gygax nor blume had money to buy out shares owned by kaye s wife blume persuaded a reluctant gygax to allow his father melvin blume to buy donna s shares and those were converted to 200 shares in tsr hobbies in addition brian bought another 140 shares these purchases reduced gygax from majority shareholder in control of company to minority shareholder he effectively became blumes employee gygax wrote supplements greyhawk eldritch wizardry and swords spells for original d d game with brian blume gygax also designed wild west oriented role playing game boot hill in same year gygax created magazine strategic review with himself as editor but wanting a more industry wide periodical he hired tim kask as tsr s first employee to change this magazine to fantasy periodical dragon with gygax as writer columnist and publisher from 1978 to 1981 dragon debuted in june 1976 and gygax commented on its success years later when i decided that strategic review was not right vehicle hired tim kask as a magazine editor for tactical studies rules and named new publication he was to produce dragon i thought we would eventually have a great periodical to serve gaming enthusiasts worldwide at no time did i ever contemplate so great a success or so long a lifespan in 1976 tsr moved out of gygax s house into its first professional home known as dungeon hobby shop dave arneson was hired as part of creative staff but was let go after only ten months another sign that gygax and arneson still had creative differences over d d advanced dungeons dragons and hollywood dungeons dragons basic set released in 1977 was an introductory version of original d d geared towards new players and edited by j eric holmes in same year tsr hobbies released a completely new and complex version of d d advanced dungeons dragons ad d monster manual released later that year became first supplemental rule book of new system and many more followed ad d rules were not fully compatible with those of d d basic set and as a result d d and ad d became distinct product lines splitting game lines created a further rift between gygax and arneson although arneson received a 10 royalty on sales of all d d products gygax refused to pay him royalties on ad d books claiming it was a new and different property in 1979 arneson filed a lawsuit against tsr it was eventually settled in march 1981 with agreement that arneson would receive a 2 5 royalty on all ad d products giving him a very comfortable six figure annual income for next decade gygax wrote ad d hardcovers players handbook dungeon masters guide monster manual and monster manual ii gygax also wrote or co wrote numerous ad d and basic d d adventure modules including keep on borderlands tomb of horrors expedition to barrier peaks temple of elemental evil forgotten temple of mordenkainen s fantastic adventure isle of ape and all seven of modules later combined into queen of spiders in 1980 gygax s long time campaign setting of greyhawk was published in form of world of greyhawk fantasy world setting folio which was expanded in 1983 into world of greyhawk fantasy game setting boxed set sales of d d game reached in 1980 gygax also provided assistance on gamma world science fantasy role playing game in 1981 and co authored gamma world adventure legion of gold in 1979 a michigan state university student james dallas egbert iii allegedly disappeared into school s steam tunnels while playing a live action version of d d in fact egbert was discovered in louisiana several weeks later but negative mainstream media attention focused on d d as cause in 1982 patricia pulling s son killed himself blaming d d for her son s suicide pulling formed an organization named b a d d bothered about dungeons dragons to attack game and company that produced it gygax defended game on a segment of 60 minutes which aired in 1985 when death threats started arriving at tsr office gygax hired a bodyguard despite negative publicity or perhaps because of it tsr s annual d d sales increased in 1982 to and in january 1983 new york times speculated that d d might become great game of 1980s in same manner that monopoly was emblematic of great depression brian blume persuaded gygax to allow brian s brother kevin to purchase melvin blume s shares this gave blume brothers a controlling interest and by 1981 gygax and blumes were increasingly at loggerheads over management of company gygax s frustrations at work and increased prosperity from his generous royalty cheques brought a number of changes to his personal life he and mary jo had been active members of local jehovah s witnesses but others in congregation already felt uneasy about gygax s smoking and drinking his connection to satanic game of d d caused enough friction that finally disassociated themselves from jehovah s witnesses mary jo continuing to resent amount of time her husband spent playing games had begun to drink excessively and couple argued frequently gygax who had started smoking marijuana when he lost his insurance job in 1970 started to use cocaine and had a number of extramarital affairs finally in 1983 two had an acrimonious divorce at same time blumes wanting to get gygax out of lake geneva so they could manage company without his interference split tsr hobbies into tsr inc and tsr entertainment inc gygax became president of tsr entertainment inc and blumes sent him to hollywood to develop tv and movie opportunities he became co producer of licensed d d cartoon series for cbs which led its time slot for two years gygax newly single took advantage of his time on west coast renting an immense mansion increasing his cocaine use and spending time with several young starlets leaving tsr because he was occupied with getting a movie off ground in hollywood gygax had to leave day to day operations of tsr to kevin and brian blume in 1984 after months of negotiation he reached an agreement with orson welles to star in a d d movie and john boorman to act as producer and director but almost at same time he received word that back in lake geneva tsr had run into severe financial difficulties and kevin blume was shopping company for gygax immediately discarded his movie ambitions his d d movie would never be made and flew back to lake geneva there he discovered to his shock that although industry leader tsr was grossing it was barely breaking even it was in fact in debt and teetering on edge of insolvency after investigating reasons why gygax brought his findings to five other company directors since 1982 tsr inc had conformed to recommendations of american management association by adding three outside directors to board increasing its size to six gygax charged that financial crisis was due to mismanagement by kevin blume excess inventory overstaffing too many company cars and some questionable and expensive projects such as dredging up a 19th century shipwreck gygax demanded that kevin blume be removed as company president and three outside directors agreed with him however board still believed financial problems were terminal and company needed to be sold in an effort to stay in control in march 1985 gygax exercised his 700 share stock option giving him just over 50 control he appointed himself president and ceo and rather than selling company he took steps to produce new revenue generating products to that end he contacted dave arneson with a view to produce some blackmoor material he also bet heavily on a new ad d book unearthed arcana a compilation of material culled from dragon magazine articles and he quickly wrote a novel set in his greyhawk setting saga of old city featuring a protagonist called gord rogue in order to bring some financial stability to tsr he hired a company manager lorraine williams when unearthed arcana was released in july gygax s bet paid off as new book sold 90 000 copies in first month his novel also sold well and he immediately published a sequel artifact of evil financial crisis had been averted but gygax had paved way for his own downfall in october 1985 new manager lorraine williams revealed that she had purchased all of shares of kevin and brian blume after brian had triggered his own 700 share option williams was now majority shareholder and replaced gygax as president and ceo she also made it clear that gygax would be making no further creative contributions to tsr several of his projects were immediately shelved and never published gygax took tsr to court in a bid to block blumes sale of their shares to williams but he lost gygax gary 1987 from sorcerer s scroll dragon 122 40 jun 1987 sales of d d reached in 1985 but gygax seeing his future at tsr as untenable resigned all positions with tsr inc in october 1986 and settled his disputes with tsr in december 1986 by terms of his settlement with tsr gygax kept rights to gord rogue as well as all d d characters whose names were anagrams or plays on his own name for example and zagyg however he lost rights to all his other work including world of greyhawk and names of all characters he had ever used in tsr material such as mordenkainen and tenser after tsr 1985 1989 new infinities productions inc immediately after leaving tsr gygax was approached by a wargaming acquaintance forrest baker who had done some consulting work for tsr in 1983 and 1984 gygax who was tired of company management was simply looking for some way to market more of his gord rogue novels but baker had a vision for a new gaming company he promised that he would handle business end while gygax would handle creative projects baker also guaranteed that using gygax s name he would be able to bring in one to two million dollars of investment gygax decided this was a good opportunity and in october 1986 new infinities productions inc nipi registration required was publicly announced to help him with creative work gygax poached frank mentzer and dragon magazine editor kim mohan from tsr but before a single product was released forrest baker left nipi when his promised outside investment of one to two million dollars failed to materialize against his will gygax was back in charge again he immediately looked for a quick product to get nipi off ground he had retained rights to gord rogue as part of his severance agreement with tsr so he licensed greyhawk from tsr and started writing new novels beginning with sea of death 1987 sales were brisk and gygax s gord rogue novels ended up keeping new infinities in business gygax brought in don turnbull from games workshop to manage company then worked with mohan and mentzer on a science fiction themed rpg cyborg commando which was published in 1987 however sales of new game were not brisk game received overwhelmingly negative reception nipi was still dependent on gord rogue mentzer and mohan also wrote a series of generic rpg adventures called gary gygax presents fantasy master they also began working on a third line of products which began with an adventure written by mentzer called convert 1987 mentzer had written adventure as an rpga tournament for d d but tsr was not interested in publishing it mentzer got verbal permission to publish it with new infinities but since permission was not in writing tsr filed an injunction to prevent adventure s sale although injunction was later lifted legal costs further drained nipi of capital during all of this drama gygax became a father again over past year he had formed a romantic relationship with gail carpenter his former assistant at tsr in november 1986 she gave birth to gygax s sixth child alex biographer michael witwer believes birth of alex forced gygax to reconsider equation of work gaming and family that up until this time had been dominated by work and gaming gary keenly aware that he had made mistakes as a father and husband in past was determined not to make them again gary was also a realist and knew what good fatherhood would demand especially at his age on august 15 1987 on what would have been his parents 50th wedding anniversary gygax married gail carpenter during 1987 and 1988 gygax worked with flint on barbarian books as well as role playing mastery and its sequel master of game he also wrote two more gord rogue novels city of hawks 1987 and come endless darkness 1988 however by 1988 tsr had rewritten setting for world of greyhawk and gygax was not happy with new direction in which tsr was taking his creation in a literary declaration that his old world was dead and wanting to make a clean break with all things greyhawk gygax destroyed his version of oerth in final gord rogue novel dance of demons q after you left tsr you finished gord rogue books at end of cycle oerth bites bullet was this your way of saying that greyhawk is dead and that fans should turn away from tsr s version with disdain gygax more my way of saying that since t r had killed setting with trash releases it was time to wipe out shame by obliterating setting with gord rogue novels finished nipi s main source of steady income dried up company needed a new product gygax announced in 1988 in a company newsletter that he and rob kuntz his co dungeon master during early days of greyhawk campaign were working as a team again this time they would create a new multi genre fantasy rpg called infinite adventures which would be supported by different for different genres this line would detail castle and city of greyhawk as gygax and kuntz had originally envisioned them now called castle however before work on this project could commence nipi ran out of money was forced into bankruptcy and was dissolved in 1989 1990 1994 dangerous journeys after nipi folded gygax decided to create an entirely new rpg called carpenter project one considerably more complex and rule heavy than his original and relatively simple d d system which had been encompassed by a mere 150 typewritten pages he also wanted to create a horror setting for new rpg called unhallowed he began working on rpg and setting with help of games designer mike mcculley game designers workshop became interested in publishing new system and it also drew attention of jvc and nec who were looking for a new rpg system and setting to turn into a series of computer games nec and jvc were not interested in horror though and work on unhallowed setting was shelved in favour of a fantasy setting called mythus jvc also wanted a name change for rpg favoring dangerous dimensions over carpenter project work progressed favourably until march 1992 when tsr filed an injunction against dangerous dimensions claiming name and initials were too similar to dungeons dragons gygax with approval of nec and jvc quickly changed name to dangerous journeys and work on new game continued marketing strategy for dangerous journeys mythus was multi pronged in addition to rpg and setting to be published by games designers workshop and mythus computer game being prepared by nec and jvc there would also be a series of books based on mythus setting written by gygax so in addition to his work on rpg and mythus setting gygax wrote three novels released under publisher penguin roc and later reprinted by publishing anubis murders samarkand solution and death in delhi in late 1992 dangerous journeys rpg was released by games designer workshop registration required but tsr immediately applied for an injunction against entire dangerous journeys rpg and mythus setting arguing that dangerous journeys was based on d d and ad d although injunction failed tsr moved forward with litigation gygax believed legal action was without merit and fuelled by lorraine williams personal enmity but nec and jvc both withdrew from project killing mythus computer game by 1994 legal costs associated with many months of pretrial discovery had drained all of gygax s resources believing that tsr was also suffering gygax offered to settle in end tsr paid gygax for complete rights to dangerous journeys and mythus gygax when new fantasy roleplaying game was introduced at gts a lawsuit was filed by tsr they claiming it violated copyright of ad d quite a stretch that but only a judge intimately familiar with rpgs would know that and dismiss it so what followed was a long period of discovery and depositions that ran up a huge lawyers bill far more on tsr end than on ours four to one is likely eventually suit was settled tsr paid us a very large sum and they got all rights to dj system and mythus i suggested to tsr lorraine williams that next time i wrote a new rpg they just offer me for rights to it thus saving at least that much money although gygax was well compensated for his years of work on dangerous journeys and mythus tsr immediately and permanently shelved them both 1995 2000 lejendary adventures thumb left gary gygax at game fair in 1999 modena italy his t shirt advertises third edition of d d which was to be released following year in 1995 gygax began work on a new computer role playing game called lejendary adventures in contrast to rules heavy dangerous journeys this new system was a return to simple and basic rules although he was not able to successfully release a lejendary adventures computer game gygax decided to instead publish it as a tabletop game meanwhile in 1996 games industry was rocked by news that tsr had run into insoluble financial problems and had been bought by wizards of coast while wotc was busy tsr s products christopher clark of inner city games designs approached gygax in 1997 to suggest that they produce some adventures to sell in game stores while tsr was otherwise occupied result was a pair of fantasy adventures published by inner city games a challenge of arms 1998 and ritual of golden eyes 1999 gygax introduced some investors to clark s publication setup and although investors were not willing to fund publication of legendary adventures clark and gygax formed a partnership called hekaforge productions gygax was thus able to return to publish lejendary adventures in 1999 game was published as a three volume set lejendary rules for all players 1999 lejend master s lore 2000 and beasts of lejend 2000 new owner of tsr wotc s peter adkison clearly did not harbor any of lorraine williams ill will toward gygax adkison purchased all of gygax s residual rights to d d and ad d for a six figure sum although gygax did not write any new supplements or books for tsr or wotc he did agree to write preface to 1998 adventure return to tomb of horrors a paean to gygax s original ad d adventure tomb of horrors he also returned to pages of dragon magazine writing up on a soapbox column from issue 268 january 2000 to issue 320 june 2004 2000 2008 later works and death gygax continued to work on lejendary adventures which he believed was his best work however sales were below expectation on june 11 2001 stephen chenault and davis chenault of troll lord games announced that gygax would be writing books for their company gygax s early work for troll lord included a series of hardcover books that eventually came to be called fantasy worlds first was canting crew 2002 a look at roguish underworld he also wrote world builder 2003 and living fantasy 2003 generic game design books usable in many different settings after first four books in series gygax stepped down from writing and took on an advisory role though series logo still carried his name troll lord also published a few adventures as a result of their partnership with gygax including hermit 2002 an adventure intended for d20 and also for lejendary adventures by 2002 gygax had given christopher clark of hekaforge an encyclopaedic 72 000 word text describing lejendary earth clark split manuscript up into five books and expanded it with each of final books coming to about 128 000 words giving hekaforge a third lejendary adventures line to supplement core rules and adventures hekaforge managed to publish first two of those lejendary earth sourcebooks gazetteer 2002 and noble kings and great lands 2003 but by 2003 small company was having financial difficulties clark to ask troll lord games to become an angel investor by publishing three remaining lejendary adventures books on october 9 2001 necromancer games announced that they would be publishing a d20 version of necropolis an adventure originally planned by gygax for new infinities productions and later printed in 1992 as a mythus adventure by gary gygax s necropolis was published a year later gygax also performed voiceover narration for cartoons and video games in 2000 he voiced his own cartoon self for an episode of futurama anthology of interest i that also included voices of al gore stephen hawking and nichelle nichols gygax also performed as a guest dungeon master in s tomb quest series of massively multiplayer online role playing game dungeons dragons online stormreach thumb right gary gygax at gen con in 2003 he is sitting in troll lord games booth with stephen chenault during his time with tsr gygax had often mentioned mysterious castle greyhawk which formed centre of his own home campaign but despite all of his written output over previous 30 years gygax had never published details of castle in 2003 gygax announced that he was again partnering with rob kuntz to publish original and previously unpublished details of castle greyhawk and city of greyhawk in 6 volumes although project would use rules for castles and crusades rather than d d as gygax wrote in an on line forum i have laid out a new schematic of castle and dungeon levels based on both my original design of 13 levels plus side adjuncts and new greyhawk castle that resulted when rob and i combined our efforts and added a lot of new levels too from that rob will draft level plans for newest version of work meantime i am collecting all most salient feature encounters tricks traps etc for inclusion on various levels so end result will be what is essentially best of our old work in a coherent presentation usable by all dms material having all known and yet to be discussed features of original work that are outstanding i hope since wizards of coast which had bought tsr in 1997 still owned rights to name greyhawk gygax changed name of castle greyhawk to castle zagyg a reverse homophone of his own name and also changed name of nearby city to yggsburgh a play on his initials e g g scale of project was enormous by time gygax and kuntz had stopped working on their original home campaign castle dungeons had encompassed 50 levels of cunningly complex passages with thousands of rooms and traps this plus plans for city of yggsburgh and encounter areas outside castle and city would clearly be too much to fit into proposed 6 volumes gygax decided he would compress castle dungeons into 13 levels size of his original castle greyhawk in whole of combined material rob and i put together would be far too large for publication 50 levels or so what i have done is gone back to my original design of more modest scope because i doubt work will need to accommodate groups of 20 pcs delving on a daily basis by amalgamating best of what could be gleaned from binders and boxes of old notes gygax original upper and lower parts of castle greyhawk changed many times over years they were in active use what we will do is to take best of lot and put that into a detailed format usable by anyone however neither gygax nor kuntz had kept careful or comprehensive plans because they had often made up details of play sessions on spot gygax i did indeed create details for pc party on spot adding whatever seemed appropriate and as rob played and learned from me he did same and when we were actively co we could often create some really exciting material on spot if you will they usually just scribbled a quick map as they played with cursory notes about monsters treasures and traps gygax as rob learned from me he too by proverbial seat of pants method a single line of notes for an encounter was sufficient for either of us to detail a lengthy description action dialog tricks or traps and all rest these sketchy maps had contained just enough detail that two could ensure their independent work would dovetail all of these old notes now had to be deciphered 25 year old memories dredged up as to what had happened in each room and a decision made whether to keep or discard each new piece gygax what our challenge is going to be is to cull extraneous take best and re create details we made up on spot of course most famous things will be there along with most of best parts that are not well known through story and word of mouth recreating city too would be a challenge although gygax still had his old maps of original city all of his previously published work on city was owned by wotc so he would have to create most of city from scratch while still maintaining look and feel of his original gygax yggsburgh was a pain in rump to write because i wanted to include as much detail as possible for gm interested in using it as a campaign base so there are sections on history costume monetary system and economy of area and complete descriptions of town its main locations and outstanding geographical areas all with encounters or suggestions for same due to creative differences kuntz backed out of project but created an adventure module that would be published at same time as gygax s first book gygax rob has finished his add on module but i have not been up to doing work needed to create upper works of castle proper let alone dungeon levels below them gygax continued to painstakingly put castle zagyg together on his own but even this slow and laborious process came to a complete halt when gygax suffered a serious stroke in april 2004 and then another one a few weeks later although he returned to his keyboard after a seven month convalescence his output was reduced from 14 hour work days to only one or two hours per day gygax problem is that i tire out after about an hour finally in 2005 castle zagyg part i yggsburgh first book in six book series appeared later that year troll lord games also published castle zagyg dark chateau 2005 adventure module written for yggsburgh setting by rob kuntz jeff helped with creation of dungeon eventually resulting in publication of limited edition east marks gazetteer 2007 that same year gygax was diagnosed with a potentially deadly abdominal aortic aneurysm doctors concurred that surgery was needed but their estimates of success varied from 50 to 90 with no firm medical consensus gygax came to believe that he would likely die on operating table he refused to consider surgery although he realized that a rupture of aneurysm likely inevitable would be fatal in one concession to his condition he switched from cigarettes which he had smoked since high school to cigars it wasn t until 2008 that gygax was able to finish second volume of six volumes castle zagyg upper works which described details of castle above ground next two volumes were supposed to detail dungeons beneath castle zagyg however before they could be written gygax died in march 2008 three months after his death gygax games a new company formed by gary s widow gail withdrew all of gygax licenses from troll lord and also from hekaforge personal life from an early age gygax hunted and was a target shooter with both bow and gun gygax i got my first bb pistol when i was about 10 a daisy bb gun when i was 11 and my first 22 rifle a single shot bolt action winchester for my 12th birthday thanks to my grandfather for mother was not keen on that i loved plinking and hunting and how badly i wanted a 25 lever action carbine i used to gaze at in local gamble s store is difficult to express in words never did get it i did get a fine bow made by bear archery though it had only a 38 pound pull so my range was only about 120 yards with a hunting arrow he was also an avid gun collector and at various times owned a variety of rifles shotguns and handguns gygax yes i own a number of handguns and shoulder weapons over next few years i did add several more 22 rifles a bolt action three shot mossberg 16 gauge shotgun a old single barreled 12 gauge and a 32 pistol rifles were used for squirrel rabbit and hunting shotguns for pheasants ducks and geese and revolver for target shooting in later years i got rid of old weapons added a 7 62 argentine mauser a 30 30 carbine and various other rifles shotguns and quite a few handguns years later when i used to get death threats because of d d i always had a 357 9 mm or 45 caliber pistol handy if those were too conspicuous a little 32 25 or 22 derringer from defender arms was around sure glad i didn t need to use them awards and honors thumb a
