hugh bradner november 5 1915 may 5 2008 was an american physicist at university of california who is credited with inventing neoprene wetsuit which helped to revolutionize scuba diving a graduate of ohio s miami university he received his doctorate from california institute of technology in pasadena california in 1941 he worked at us naval ordnance laboratory during world war ii where he researched naval mines in 1943 he was recruited by robert oppenheimer to join manhattan project at los alamos laboratory there he worked with scientists including luis alvarez john von neumann and george kistiakowsky on development of high explosives and exploding bridgewire detonators required by atomic bombs after war bradner took a position studying high energy physics at university of california berkeley under luis alvarez bradner investigated problems encountered by frogmen staying in cold water for long periods of time he developed a neoprene suit which could trap water between body and neoprene and thereby keep them warm he became known as father of wetsuit bradner worked on 1951 operation greenhouse nuclear test series on enewetak atoll in marshall islands he joined scripps institute of geophysics and planetary physics as a geophysicist in 1961 he remained there for rest of his career becoming a full professor in 1963 and retiring in 1980 in retirement continued to work both on oceanographic research as well as on dumand deep ocean neutrino astronomy project early life hugh bradner was born in tonopah nevada on november 5 1915 but he was raised in findlay ohio his father donald bradner was briefly director of chemical warfare service at maryland s edgewood arsenal his mother was agnes claire bradner nee mead he had an older brother mead bradner bradner graduated from ohio s miami university in 1936 and later received his doctorate from california institute of technology in pasadena california in 1941 writing his thesis on electron optical studies of photoelectric effect under supervision of william vermillion houston manhattan project thumb right marjorie bradner s identification badge photo from los alamos after receiving his doctorate from caltech bradner worked at us naval ordnance laboratory where he researched naval mines until 1943 he was recruited by robert oppenheimer to join manhattan project in 1943 at los alamos laboratory in new mexico which helped to develop first atomic bomb bradner helped to develop a wide range of technology needed for bomb including research on high explosives and exploding bridgewire detonators needed to implode atomic bomb developed bomb s triggering mechanism and even helped design new town around laboratory he worked closely with some of most prominent scientists including luis alvarez john von neumann and george kistiakowsky he witnessed trinity test first nuclear weapons test at alamogordo on july 16 1945 bradner met his future wife marjorie hall bradner who was also working as a secretary on manhattan project at los alamos laboratory couple were married in los alamos in 1943 security at top secret facility was so tight that neither bradner s nor hall s parents were allowed to attend ceremony though oppenheimer was among wedding guests couple remained together for over 65 years until she died on april 10 2008 at age of 89 wetsuit after war bradner took a position studying high energy physics at university of california berkeley under luis alvarez whom he had worked with at manhattan project he remained at university until 1961 he worked on 1951 atomic bombing test on enewetak atoll in marshall islands which was part of operation greenhouse nuclear test series thumb left 240px a man wearing a modern wetsuit bradner s job at berkeley required him to do a number of underwater dives he had previously talked to united states navy frogmen during world war ii concerning problems of staying in cold water for long periods of time which causes diver to lose large amounts of body heat quickly he worked on developing a new suit that would counter this in basement of his family s home on scenic avenue in berkeley california and researched new wetsuit at a conference in coronado california in december 1951 according to san francisco chronicle wetsuit was invented in 1952 bradner and other engineers founded engineering development company edco in order to develop it he and his colleagues tested several versions and prototypes of wetsuit at scripps institution of oceanography in la jolla california scripps scientist and engineer willard bascom advised bradner to use neoprene for suit material which proved successful he found that it would trap water between body and neoprene and water would heat up to body temperature and keep you warm a 1951 letter showed that bradner clearly understood that insulation in such a suit was not provided by water between suit and skin but rather that this layer of water next to skin if trapped would quickly heat to skin temperature if material in suit were thus suit only needed to limit purging by fresh cold water and it did not need to be dry to work he applied for a u s patent for wetsuit but his patent application was turned down due to its similar design with flight suit united states navy also did not adopt new wetsuits because of worries that neoprene in wetsuits might make its swimmers easier to spot by underwater sonar and thus could not exclusively profit from his invention bradner and his company edco tried to sell his wetsuits in consumer market however he failed to successfully penetrate wetsuit market way others have done including bob meistrell and bill meistrell founders of body glove and jack o neill various claims have been made over years that it was o neill or meistrell brothers who actually invented wetsuit instead of bradner but recent researchers have concluded that it was bradner who created original wetsuit and not his competitors in 2005 los angeles times concluded that bradner was father of wetsuit and a research paper published by carolyn rainey at scripps institution of oceanography in 1998 provided corroborating evidence later career and life bradner joined scripps institute of geophysics and planetary physics as a geophysicist in 1961 he became a full professor in 1963 and retired in 1980 he remained interested in oceanography scuba diving seashell collecting and outdoors throughout his later years and continued to work both on oceanographic research as well as on dumand deep ocean neutrino astronomy project which combined his two careers in physics and oceanography hugh bradner died at age of 92 at his home in san diego california on may 5 2008 from complications of pneumonia references external links scripps institute
