george washington bridge is a double decked suspension bridge spanning hudson river connecting washington heights neighborhood of manhattan in new york city with borough of fort lee in new jersey bridge is named after george washington first president of united states george washington bridge is world s busiest motor vehicle bridge carrying over vehicles per year it is owned by port authority of new york and new jersey a bi state government agency that operates infrastructure in port of new york and new jersey george washington bridge is also informally known as gw bridge gwb gw or george and was known as fort lee bridge or hudson river bridge during construction idea of a bridge across hudson river was first proposed in 1906 but it was not until 1925 that state legislatures of new york and new jersey voted to allow for planning and construction of such a bridge construction on george washington bridge started in october 1927 bridge was ceremonially dedicated on october 24 1931 and opened to traffic next day opening of george washington bridge contributed to development of bergen county new jersey in which fort lee is located upper deck was widened from six to eight lanes in 1946 six lane lower deck was constructed beneath existing span from 1958 to 1962 because of increasing traffic flow george washington bridge is an important travel corridor within new york metropolitan area it has an upper level that carries four lanes in each direction and a lower level with three lanes in each direction for a total of 14 lanes of travel speed limit on bridge is bridge s upper level also carries pedestrian and bicycle traffic interstate 95 i 95 and u s route 1 9 us 1 9 composed of us 1 and us 9 cross river via bridge us 46 which lies entirely within new jersey terminates halfway across bridge at state border with new york at its eastern terminus in new york city bridge continues onto trans manhattan expressway part of i 95 connecting to cross bronx expressway george washington bridge measures long and has a main span of it had longest main bridge span in world at time of its opening and held that distinction until opening of golden gate bridge in 1937 description thumb left upright 1 1 bridge looking south at sunset from new york side of hudson river george washington bridge was designed by chief civil engineer othmar ammann design engineer allston dana and assistant chief engineer edward w stearns with cass gilbert as consulting architect it connects fort lee new jersey with washington heights manhattan new york decks bridge carries 14 lanes of traffic seven in each direction as such george washington bridge contains more vehicular lanes than any other suspension bridge and is world s busiest vehicular bridge fourteen lanes of bridge are split unevenly across two levels upper level contains eight lanes while lower level contains six lanes upper level opened in 1931 and is wide upper level originally had six lanes though two more lanes were added in 1946 although lower level was part of original plans for bridge it did not open until 1962 upper level has a vertical clearance of and all trucks and other oversize vehicles must use upper level trucks are banned from lower level which has a clearance of all lanes on both levels are wide vehicles carrying hazardous materials are prohibited on lower level due to its enclosed nature hazmat carrying vehicles may use upper level provided that they conform to strict guidelines as outlined in port authority s red book for red book itself see there are two sidewalks on upper span of bridge one on each side however cyclists and pedestrians can usually only utilize southern sidewalk since northern sidewalk is normally closed northern sidewalk was temporarily reopened in 2017 while a temporary suicide prevention fence was installed on southern sidewalk in preparation for installation of permanent fences on both sidewalks george washington bridge measures long and has a main span of accounting for height of lower deck bridge stretches above mean high water at its center and above mean high water under new york anchorage bridge s main span was longest main bridge span in world at time of its opening in 1931 and was nearly double of previous record holder ambassador bridge in detroit it held this title until opening of golden gate bridge in 1937 george washington bridge s total width is when upper deck was built it was only thick without any stiffening trusses on sides and it had a length to thickness ratio of about 350 to 1 at time of george washington bridge s opening most long suspension spans had stiffening trusses on their sides and spans generally had a length to thickness ratio of 60 to 1 during planning process ammann designed deck around deflection theory an as yet unconfirmed assumption that longer suspension decks did not need to be as stiff in proportion to its length because weight of longer deck itself would provide a counterweight against deck s movement this had been tested by leon in 1909 when he designed manhattan bridge in 1909 though it was less than half length of george washington bridge stiffening trusses were ultimately excluded from george washington bridge s design to save money instead a system of plate girders was installed on underside of upper deck this provided stiffening that was necessary for bridge deck and it was replicated on lower deck during its construction plate girders underneath each deck combined with an open truss design on bridge s side that connected decks with each other resulted in an even stiffer span that was able to resist torsional forces cables thumb left detail of main cables in new jersey anchorage george washington bridge is supported by a total of 105 986 wires there are four main cables which suspend upper deck and are held up by suspension towers each main cable contained 61 strands with each strand made of 434 individual wires for a total of 26 474 wires per main cable cables were then covered by a sheath of weather resistant steel bridge uses a wire cable design of suspension wherein vertical suspender wires are attached directly to main cables and deck directly each side of bridge contains an anchorage for main cables anchorage on new york side is a concrete structure while anchorage on new jersey side is bored directly into cliff of palisades originally ends of main cables were supposed to contain one of several ornamented designs such as a wing fin tire or even a statue at end of each main cable this was later eliminated in order to save costs after start of great depression in 1929 suspension towers thumb upright 1 1 view of suspension towers from upper deck suspension towers on each side of river are each tall they are composed of sections weighing between and contain a combined 475 000 rivets original design for george washington bridge s suspension towers called for them to be encased in concrete and granite in a revival style similar to brooklyn bridge granite was supposed to help support steel structure of towers though after further scrutiny of proposed bridge s engineering it was found that steel alone could support towers it was ultimately decided that supporting structure of towers should be made entirely of steel with granite serving only as a facade towers would have also contained elevators to carry sightseers to top of each tower however facades were postponed in 1929 during great depression entire weight of bridge was supported by steel structure and purely decorative masonry could be added at a later date even though steel towers had been left that way for cost reasons aesthetic critiques of bare steel towers were favorable several groups such as american institute of steel construction believed that covering steel framework with masonry would be both misleading and fundamentally ugly masonry facades were ultimately never built exposed steel towers with their distinctive criss crossed bracing became one of george washington bridge s most identifiable characteristics swiss french architect le corbusier wrote of towers structure is so pure so resolute so regular that here finally steel architecture seems to laugh after george washington bridge was successfully constructed without masonry towers ammann did not incorporate any masonry towers in his bridge plans american flag since 1947 or 1948 bridge has flown world s largest free flying american flag measuring at long wide and until 1976 flag was taken out of a garage in new jersey and manually erected on national holidays during united states bicentennial a mechanical hoisting system was installed and flag was stored along bridge s girders when not in use it is hoisted on special occasions when weather allows and appears on martin luther king jr day presidents day memorial day flag day independence day labor day columbus day and veterans day since 2006 flag is also flown on september 11 of each year honoring those lost in september 11 attacks on events where flag is flown tower lights are lit from dusk until 11 59 p m history bridge sits near sites of fort washington in new york and fort lee in new jersey which were fortified positions used by general george washington and his american forces as they attempted to deter occupation of new york city in 1776 during american revolutionary war unsuccessful washington evacuated manhattan by crossing between two forts planning until first decade of 20th century passage across lower hudson river was possible only by ferry hudson and manhattan railroad and pennsylvania railroad built a total of six tunnels under lower hudson in 1900s first vehicular crossing across lower hudson river holland tunnel was opened in 1927 connecting lower manhattan with jersey city plans for a vehicular bridge across hudson river were considered as early as 1906 during planning for holland tunnel three possible locations for a hudson river bridge were considered in vicinity of 57th 110th and 179th streets in manhattan these three locations were considered to be only suitable locations for suspension bridges other sites were rejected on grounds of aesthetics geography or traffic flows in january 1924 new york state chamber of commerce voted against 57th street location in favor of another location upstream despite this engineer gustav lindenthal proposed that hudson river bridge be built at 57th street and carry 16 railroad tracks and 12 lanes of automotive traffic in may 1924 colonel frederick stuart greene new york superintendent of public works announced a plan to construct a suspension bridge between fort lee in new jersey and 179th street at fort washington in new york at that location both sides were surrounded by steep cliffs palisades on new jersey side and washington heights on new york side thus it was possible to build bridge without either impeding maritime traffic or requiring lengthy approach ramps from ground level a new jersey state assemblyman introduced a bill for hudson river bridge that december this bill was passed in new jersey assembly in february 1925 after an initial rejection by new jersey governor george sebastian silzer assembly made modifications before passing bill again in march after which silzer signed bill around same time new york state legislature was also considering a similar bill a dispute developed between new york civic groups who supported construction of hudson river bridge and parks conservation association who believed that bridge towers would degrade quality of fort washington park directly underneath proposed bridge s deck in late march 1925 chairman of parks conservation association noted that proposed new york state legislation would provide for actual construction of bridge rather than just planning ultimately hudson river bridge bill was passed in new york state legislature and new york governor al smith approved bill that april left thumb aerial view of bridge surrounded by cliffs on either side in march 1925 new jersey governor silzer asked othmar ammann to devise preliminary plans for hudson river bridge ammann found that width of hudson river decreased by more than when it passed between fort lee and fort washington ledges of fort lee and fort washington were respectively and above mean water level at this point which was not only ideal geography for a suspension bridge but also allowed bridge to be high enough to give sufficient clearance for maritime traffic however differing heights meant that a large cut had to be made through fort lee ledge so that bridge approach could be built there same month new jersey legislature asked for funds for test bores to determine if geological strata would support bridge in response to continuing concerns from park preservationists ammann stated that placing new york suspension tower anywhere else would make bridge look asymmetrical which he believed was a worse outcome than placing tower within park after funding was secured surveyors began examining feasible sites for future bridge s approaches in august 1925 by law new york end of hudson river bridge could only be constructed between 178th and 185th streets and new jersey end had to be built directly across river geologists made test bores on new jersey side to determine if site was feasible for laying foundations for bridge staff january 1930 giant of world s bridges rising in new york popular mechanics p 464 othmar ammann was hired as bridge s chief engineer richman steven m bridges of new jersey portraits of garden state crossings p 118 rutgers university press 2005 engineer othmar ammann and his architect cass gilbert had originally designed statuesque anchors which were abandoned for cost reasons in ammann s original plans for bridge which had been published in march 1925 he had envisioned that bridge would contain two sidewalks a roadway that could carry up to 8 000 vehicles per hour and space for four railroad tracks in case two north river railroad tunnels downstream exceeded their train capacity cass gilbert was hired in january 1926 to design architectural elements for hudson river bridge including suspension towers bridge design had yet to be finalized and its cost could not even be estimated at that point due to complexity of factors gilbert released preliminary sketches of hudson river bridge that march by then architect had decided that span would be a suspension bridge sketch accompanied a feasibility report that ammann and other engineers presented to port of new york authority now port authority of new york and new jersey agency that was to operate bridge central span was to be long longer than any other suspension bridge in existence at time and 200 feet above mean high water span would initially carry 4 lanes of vehicular traffic and sidewalk lanes with space to expand bridge deck to 8 lanes there would also be space to build a second deck in future below main deck ammann s team also found that most feasible location for bridge was at 179th street in manhattan as opposed to 181st or 175th streets this was both because 179th street location was more aesthetically appealing than other two locations and because a 179th street bridge would be cheaper and shorter in length than a bridge at either of other streets at this point in planning process hudson river bridge s estimated cost was 40million or 50million because of proposed bridge s length engineers also had to test strength of materials including suspension cables that were to be used in span by fall 1926 one engineer predicted that construction on hudson river bridge would start following summer in december 1926 final plans for bridge were approved by public and by war department port authority planned to sell off 50million worth of bonds to pay for bridge and initial 20million bond issue was sold that december further issues arose when new jersey assembly passed a bill in march 1927 which increased new jersey governor s power to veto port authority contracts smith new york governor and silzer now former new jersey governor who had been appointed port authority chairman both objected to bill since port authority had been intended as a bi state venture afterward then current new jersey governor a harry moore worked with legislators to revise legislation revised law was ultimately not a significant deviation from port authority s practice at time wherein port authority was already submitting its contracts to new jersey government for review construction first contracts in april 1927 port authority opened first bids for construction of hudson river bridge it was specifically seeking bids for construction of new jersey suspension tower s foundation manhattan suspension anchorage s location was still undecided at this time a bid for new jersey tower was awarded later that month in may port authority opened more bids for construction of bridge s approaches and anchorage on new jersey side dredging operations on hudson river which would allow large ships to pass underneath bridge also started that may by late august port authority had started condemning plots of land for bridge s approaches montgomery b case chief construction engineer began construction on hudson river bridge began on september 21 1927 with groundbreaking ceremonies held at sites of both future suspension towers each tower was to have a base with a perimeter measuring and descending 80 feet into riverbed riverbed around towers sites was dredged first and then steel pilings were placed in riverbed to create a watertight cofferdam cofferdams for bridge were largest ever built at time in early october of that year port authority received bids for construction of bridge deck there were two main methods being considered for span s construction cheaper wire cable method and more expensive eyebar method wire cable method where vertical suspender wires are attached directly to main cables and deck directly would require a stiffening truss to support deck eyebar method where suspender wires are attached to a chain of eyebars metal bars with holes in them would be self supporting ultimately port authority chose wire cable design because of costs and it awarded contract for constructing deck to john a roebling sons company corresponding contract for manufacturing steel was awarded to first serious accident during bridge s construction occurred in december 1927 when three men drowned while working in a caisson on new jersey side towers and anchorages thumb upright 1 1 manhattan suspension tower seen from below bids for manhattan suspension tower were advertised in march 1928 at this point 64 of total projected worth of construction contracts had been awarded piers that provided foundation for new jersey suspension tower and approaches were being constructed cliffs on both sides of river were high enough that they could be used as anchorages for hudson river bridge towers foundations could reach at most below mean low water where foundations would hit a layer of solid rock in may 1928 builders started drilling a cut through palisades on new jersey side so that hudson river bridge approach could be built by june 1928 half of money earned during previous year s 20million bond sale had been spent on construction by that october nearly all blasting operations had been completed suspension tower on new jersey side had been constructed to a height of and tower on new york side was progressing as well suspension towers consisted of 13 segments each of which were almost 50 feet high by march 1929 concrete structure of new york anchorage had been completed three months ahead of schedule anchorage on new jersey side which had been fully bored consisted of two holes that had been bored 250 feet into face of palisades on new jersey side of rock had to be blasted out to make way for new jersey approach suspension towers were nearly complete at time of report only 100 feet of each tower s height remained to be built anchors were being placed in two holes that were being drilled for new jersey anchorage and this task was also nearing completion in april port authority acquired last of properties that were in path of bridge s manhattan approach plans for manhattan approach were approved by new york city board of estimate around same time approach was to consist of scenic meandering ramps leading to both riverside drive and henry hudson parkway which run along eastern bank of hudson river at bottom of cliff in washington heights bridge would also connect to 178th and 179th streets at top of washington heights a third connection would be made to an underground highway running between and parallel to 178th and 179th streets this connection would become 178th 179th street tunnels and would later be replaced by trans manhattan expressway original plan for approach to underground highway stated that approach would be made using a monumental stone viaduct descending from span at a 2 2 gradient port authority started evicting residents in approach s path in october 1929 same month port authority sold final 30million in bonds to pay for bridge plans for hudson river bridge s fort lee approach were also changed in january 1930 originally bridge would have terminated in a traffic circle a type of intersection design that was being built around new jersey during 1920s and 1930s however revised plans called for a grade separated highway approach that would connect to a traffic distributing basin with ramps to nearby highways total cost of land acquisition for bridge approaches on both sides of hudson river exceeded 10million cable spinning left thumb a close up view of a vertical suspender cable which is connected to larger main cable with what is called a saddle after towers were completed two temporary catwalks were built between two suspension towers then workers began laying bridge s four main cables a series of thick cables that stretch between tops of two towers and carry what would later become upper deck first strand of first main cable was hoisted between both towers in july 1929 in a ceremony attended by governors of both states and mayors of new york city and fort lee two temporary catwalks allowed workers to spin wires for main cables on site wires for cables were spun by dozens of reels at a dock near base of new york anchorage each reel contained 30 miles of wire at any given time a total of 105 986 wires were used in bridge when it was completed by february 1930 bridge was halfway complete since construction was two months ahead of schedule bridge was scheduled to open in early 1932 a team of 350 men was spinning wires for each of main cables which were 22 complete in addition builders had started ordering steel for deck by april spinning of main cables was half complete first main cable was completed in late july 1930 and other three main cables were completed that august with laying of last wire being marked by a ceremony spinning of main cables had taken ten months in total after main cables were laid workers spun suspender wires that connected main cables with deck when it was finished system of cables would support of deck s weight though cables would be strong enough to carry four times as much weight construction of a lower deck for rail usage was postponed since start of depression meant that there would not be enough railroad traffic to justify construction of such a deck in near future nearing completion thumb view of bridge looking north from edgewater new jersey early 1931 in july 1930 port authority opened bidding process for contracts to build hudson river bridge s approaches on new york side these included contracts for 178th 179th street tunnels and riverside drive connection tunnel contracts were awarded later that month in august bidding process for fort lee approaches was opened bids for riverside drive connection were received following month prior to and during construction bridge was unofficially known as hudson river bridge or fort lee bridge hudson river bridge association started seeking suggestions for bridge s official name in october 1930 residents of new york and new jersey were encouraged to send naming choices to association which would then forward suggestions to port authority according to ballot voting submitted to port authority hudson river bridge name was most popular choice selected by residents of new york and new jersey hudson river bridge name beat out a host of other proposed names including port authority s preference for name george washington bridge port authority formally adopted george washington name on january 13 1931 honoring general and future president s evacuation of manhattan at bridge s location during revolutionary war this was described as potentially confusing since there was already a washington bridge connecting 181st street with bronx directly across manhattan from george washington bridge across hudson river shortly afterward port authority board of commissioners voted to reconsider renaming of hudson river bridge stating that it was open to alternate names hundreds of naming choices had been submitted by this time most popular naming choices were those of washington christopher columbus and hudson river namesake henry hudson span was again officially named for george washington in april 1931 system of girders to support deck were installed throughout 1930 and last girder was installed in late december 1930 in march 1931 port authority announced that hudson river bridge was set to open later that year rather than in 1932 as originally planned at that time port authority had opened bids for paving road surface later that month agency published a report which stated that bridge s early opening date was attributable to how quickly and efficiently various materials had been transported in june 1931 forty bankers became first people to cross bridge work was progressing quickly on bridge approaches in new jersey and new york city government was considering building another bridge between manhattan and bronx alexander hamilton bridge to connect with george washington bridge bids for constructing tollbooths and floodlight towers were opened in july 1931 opening and early years left thumb eastbound view george washington bridge was dedicated on october 24 1931 with a ceremony attended by 30 000 guests opening ceremony was accompanied by a show from military airplanes as well as speeches from politicians including new jersey governor morgan foster larson and new york governor franklin d roosevelt first people to cross george washington bridge were reportedly two elementary school students who roller skated across bridge from new york side pedestrians were allowed to walk length of george washington bridge between 6 p m and 11 p m bridge was formally opened to traffic next day port authority collected tolls for drivers who used bridge in either direction as with holland tunnel toll was set at 50 cents for passenger cars with different toll rates for other vehicle types pedestrians paid a toll of 10 cents each which was lowered to 5 cents in 1934 within first 24 hours of george washington bridge s official opening 56 312 cars used span as well as 100 000 pedestrians including those who had walked across after ceremony port authority reported that 33 540 pedestrians crossed bridge on first day of which 20 000 paid a toll to cross during george washington bridge s construction cost of bridge was estimated at 75million and bridge was expected to carry eight million vehicles and 1 5million pedestrians in its first year of operation when george washington bridge opened it was estimated that eight million vehicles would use bridge in its first year and that bridge could ultimately carry 60million vehicles annually after a second deck was added bridge s final cost was estimated at 60million real estate speculators believed that bridge s construction would raise real estate values in fort lee since borough s residents would be able to more easily access new york city during construction of george washington bridge speculators spent millions of dollars to buy land around bridge s new jersey approach bridge was later credited with helping raise land prices and encouraging residential development in formerly agricultural parts of bergen county it also spurred rise of trucking industry along united states east coast supplanting much of freight railroads that used to carry cargo in george washington bridge s first week of operation bridge carried 116 265 vehicles compared to holland tunnel s 173 010 vehicles despite fact that tunnel had fewer lanes than bridge did during that time span 56 000 pedestrians used bridge a week after bridge opened 10 lane tollbooth was expanded to 14 lanes because of heavy weekend traffic volumes in its first year of operation george washington bridge saw 5 5million vehicular crossings and nearly 500 000 pedestrian crossings new jersey route 4 which connected directly to bridge s western end opened in july 1932 178th 179th street tunnels which connected amsterdam avenue on eastern side of manhattan to bridge s eastern end on west side of manhattan were supposed to be completed in fall 1932 tunnels as well as direct approaches to riverside drive and hudson river parkway were not completed until 1938 1939 a ramp eastward from bridge and southward to harlem river drive was also completed around this time on new jersey side state highways were also being modernized to handle bridge traffic bridge s westbound entrance ramp from fort washington avenue at top of cliff on manhattan side opened in april 1939 corresponding eastbound exit ramp as well as 178th 179th street tunnels opened that july expansion and late 20th century right thumb uss nautilus passes under bridge in 1956 when bridge had only a single deck traffic counts on george washington bridge grew year after year by time of bridge s tenth anniversary in 1941 span had been used by vehicles total including a record 9 1million vehicles in 1940 originally george washington bridge s single deck consisted of six lanes with an unpaved center median in 1946 median was paved over and two more lanes were created on upper level widening it from six lanes to eight lanes two center lanes on upper level served as reversible lanes which could handle traffic in either direction depending on traffic flows however a fixed median was not added until 1970s bridge was initially lit by 200 lights to provide warning to pilots flying at night port authority enacted a photography ban during world war ii in 1940s additionally from may 1942 to may 1945 lights on bridge were shut off at night as a precautionary measure after war ended lights were turned back on but photography ban was upheld completion of george washington bridge s lower deck as well as construction of a new bus terminal and other highway connections near bridge were recommended in a 1955 study that suggested improvements to new york city area s highway system lower deck was approved by u s army corps of engineers a bergen county leader voted against construction of lower level in 1956 temporarily delaying construction plans new york city planning commission approved george washington bridge improvement in june 1957 and port authority allocated funds to improvement that july project included construction of lower deck george washington bridge expressway a 12 lane expressway connecting to alexander hamilton bridge and cross bronx expressway later i 95 and us 9 george washington bridge bus station above expressway and a series of new ramps to and from henry hudson parkway on new jersey side two depressed toll plazas one in each direction were to be constructed for lower level traffic highway connections were also being built on new jersey side including a direct approach from i 95 construction of approaches started in september 1958 work on lower level itself started on june 2 1959 but work was briefly halted later that year because of a lack of steel by february 1960 construction was underway on lower level supporting steelwork for future deck had been completed and sections for lower deck were being installed george washington bridge s lower deck would comprise 75 steel slabs each slab weighed 220 tons and measured wide by feet long with a thickness of construction of slabs proceeded from either side of bridge right of way for george washington bridge expressway had been almost entirely cleared except for ventilation buildings for 178th 179th street tunnels segments of lower deck had been laid completely by september 1960 at which point workers started pouring concrete for deck s roadway a process that took five weeks layer of concrete measured thick finally deck was paved over with a layer of asphalt new ramps to george washington bridge in new jersey including from newly completed i 95 opened in summer 1962 lower deck was opened to public on august 29 1962 lower level nicknamed martha after george s wife martha washington increased capacity of bridge by 75 percent and simultaneously made george washington bridge world s only 14 lane suspension bridge scott marvin happy birthday george washington bridge see rare 1981 interview with man who crossed it on horse on first day wpix october 25 2013 accessed june 18 2016 and with a total of 14 lanes it s only one of its kind in addition to providing extra capacity lower level served to stiffen bridge in high winds before lower deck was constructed george washington bridge was known to swing up to george washington bridge bus station and alexander hamilton bridge both opened on january 18 1963 thus allowing more traffic to use george washington bridge in first year after lower level s opening expanded bridge had carried vehicles by comparison 35 vehicles had crossed bridge in an 11 month period between september 1 1961 and july 31 1962 in addition traffic congestion at george washington bridge had been reduced since lower level opened and port authority was able to make repairs to upper level for first time in bridge s history in 1980 bridge carried 82 8million vehicles george washington bridge was designated a national historic civil engineering landmark by american society of civil engineers on october 24 1981 50th anniversary of bridge s dedication ceremony 50th anniversary was also marked with a parade of automobiles at that point 1 vehicles had used bridge throughout its lifetime in 1990 port authority announced a minor rehabilitation for george washington bridge as part of project supporting structural steel for upper deck would be replaced and some ramps would be rebuilt ramps on new york side connecting with riverside drive and henry hudson parkway were to be reconstructed for 27 6million after studies in late 1980s showed deterioration on these ramps although port authority had announced repairs in advance start of roadwork in september 1990 caused extensive traffic jams 2000s and 2010s thumb left upright 1 1 lower level deck starting on july 4 2000 and for subsequent special occasions each of george washington bridge s suspension towers is illuminated by 380 light fixtures that highlight exposed steel structure on each tower there are a mix of 150 and 1000 watt metal halide lamp fixtures architectural lighting design was completed by domingo gonzalez associates in 2000 port authority proposed building a ramp from lower level to palisades interstate parkway on new jersey side originally ramp would have cost 86 5million and would have been completed in 2003 or 2004 however connection was ultimately not built from september 9 to 13 2013 dedicated toll lanes for one of local fort lee entrances to bridge s upper level were reduced from three to one with two other lanes diverted to highway traffic without notification to local government officials and emergency responders closures were performed on orders from aides and appointees of new jersey governor chris christie causing a political controversy called bridgegate local toll lane reductions caused massive traffic congestion with major delays for school transportation and police and emergency service responses within fort lee repercussions and controversy surrounding these actions have been investigated by port authority federal prosecutors and a new jersey legislature committee 2010s repairs in december 2011 port authority announced plans to repair bridge for first time vertical suspender cables would be replaced at an expected cost of more than 1billion paid for by toll revenue on august 5 2013 repair crews began an 82 million effort to fix cracks in upper deck structural steel caused by traffic particularly heavy trucks plan called for replacing 632 road deck panels which would add at least 20 years of service life to roadway work proceeded at night and was slated to be complete by year s end however delays prevented completion and ultimately work was halted for winter work restarted in june 2014 and was expected to last another 12 weeks port authority also started work on some other projects to renovate or replace bridge components lower level was repaved in 2016 and repainting work and maintenance platform replacement on lower deck was completed in 2017 bridge s 592 suspender ropes which run vertically between main suspension cables and deck were to be replaced between 2017 and 2023 to fix damage caused by excessive heat and humidity staircases leading to sidewalks on both northern and southern sides of upper deck were also being replaced with ramps that were compliant with americans with disabilities act of 1990 trans manhattan expressway was being renovated in conjunction with this project on new jersey side palisades interstate parkway cloverleaf ramp onto eastbound george washington bridge would be replaced at a cost of 112 6million by 2019 two overpasses near bridge would also be refurbished by 2022 road connections new jersey george washington bridge carries i 95 and us 1 9 between new jersey and new york coming from new jersey us 46 terminates at state border in middle of bridge further west i 80 us 9w new jersey route 4 and new jersey turnpike also feed into bridge via either i 95 u s 1 9 or u s 46 but end before reaching it palisades interstate parkway connects directly to bridge s upper level though not to lower level however a ramp to link interstate parkway to lower level was proposed in 2000 marginal roads and local streets above highways are known as gwb plaza bridge s toll plaza which collects tolls from eastbound traffic only is located on new jersey side new york thumb upright 1 1 ramps on new york side seen in 1973 on new york side 12 lane trans manhattan expressway heads east across narrow neck of upper manhattan from bridge to harlem river it provides access from both decks to 178th and 179th streets which cross manhattan horizontally henry hudson parkway and riverside drive on hudson river s eastern bank along west side of manhattan and to amsterdam avenue and harlem river drive on harlem river s western bank on east side expressway connects directly with alexander hamilton bridge which spans harlem river as part of cross bronx expressway i 95 providing access to major deegan expressway i 87 heading towards new jersey local access to bridge is available from 179th street there are also ramps connecting bridge to george washington bridge bus terminal a commuter bus terminal with direct access to new york city subway at 175th street station on ind eighth avenue line served by originally approach to george washington bridge from new york side to george washington bridge consisted of a roundabout encircling a fountain which was designed by
