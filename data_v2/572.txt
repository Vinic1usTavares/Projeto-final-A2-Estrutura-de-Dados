chrono resurrection also known as chrono trigger resurrection is an unreleased fangame developed by north american team resurrection games under nathan lazur s direction it is based on critically acclaimed super nes role playing game chrono trigger by japanese company square project was initially called ct64 and was meant to be a complete remake of original game for nintendo 64 with both 2d and 3d playing modes after a first interruption in development project was redefined as a short interactive demo for windows based personal computers new team members including professional artists and designers were recruited for demo which would feature ten scenes from chrono trigger and most of its playable characters in 2004 project was publicly closed after square enix issued a cease and desist letter to resurrection games for trademark and copyright infringement despite its closure project has received critical and popular praise nintendo 64 version nathan lazur initially planned to create a chrono trigger remake for nintendo 64 called ct64 using gnu based homebrew tools lazur s motivation for project came in 1999 when playing chrono trigger and super mario 64 remake developed by a team of four people was lazur s first attempt at creating a complete title game was intended to have two playing modes and same battle system as original first mode would feature 2d and pre rendered graphics enhanced with 3d spell and battle effects some of effects created by lazur would rely on software programming rather than nintendo 64 hardware as latter would not be capable of rendering them directly second mode would be a full 3d mode played in either regular or high display resolution and would feature different level of detail textures depending on camera distances to maximize clarity and performance both modes would be in a top down perspective although more cinematic camera angles similar to those from legend of zelda ocarina of time were also considered for 3d mode a gallery feature was also planned and would allow players to unlock bonus material depending on their progression in game fan artwork and music would be unlockable through this feature as well as minigames including a card game similar to triple triad from final fantasy viii remake was expected to be released on internet for free and played on console emulators since there would be no cartridge version due to financial constraints only a semi working 3d test was actually completed and project was discontinued in mid 2000 due to a number of factors including accidental loss of lazur s data and his desire to improve his programming skills second version thumb alt a sketch of a man with pointed ears wearing a cape concept art by luis martins depicting his take on character magus originally

game developers website gamasutra and worked in a small studio in lazur s apartment in montreal quebec canada team included up to nine members most of which had about two and a half years of experiences in industry lazur has admitted that he began to seriously focus on quality of demo only after art director luis martins joined project other professional designers in team included moise breton a 3d artist who had worked on character models for commercially successful movie matrix reloaded and michel an animator who had worked for game company microids difficulties were encountered in game engine development as lazur was unique programmer and worked from scratch score for demo was composed by mathew valente who had been with project since its nintendo 64 version score was to consist in arrangements of official chrono trigger soundtrack written by yasunori mitsuda nobuo uematsu and noriko matsueda valente s goal was to retain feeling of original music while enhancing it for a modern platform most of arrangements were created in impulse tracker format then converted to midi and enhanced with a number of tools thumb left alt horizontal rectangular video game screenshot

capture feel of original game with updated graphics and sounds in demo it was to feature ten short interactive scenes from chrono trigger despite receiving requests from fans development team did not intend to create a complete remake of original game since they would not have necessary resources and because they thought result would not have been on par with square enix developed titles story of game was altered slightly to allow for ten scenes to better flow from one to other demo was meant to be played using a default party of characters with other party members unlockable for additional replay value due to time constraints development team expected that two of seven characters of original game robo and would have 50 chances of not being featured while team tried to capture feel of original game with updated graphics and sounds artists and animators faced difficulty in reproducing characters due to differences of style between sprites artwork and playstation version anime
