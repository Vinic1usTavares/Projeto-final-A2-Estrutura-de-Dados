and strong viewership in march 2018 canadian tv remade series as detail but show was cancelled after one season production scott bailey was commissioned after concept was introduced to executive producer nicola shindler who brought it to writer sally wainwright series is produced by manchester based red production company and is largely filmed in greater manchester area concept scott bailey is based on an original idea by suranne jones and sally lindsay with jones commenting that there needed to be more roles for women that weren t wife of sidekick to mother of mistress to etc jones remarked we were just chatting away over a bottle of wine in a pub when idea came to fruition lindsay a fan of television programmes such as cagney lacey was interested in concept of a programme detailing lives of two professional women jones later spoke of programme saying it is cagney lacey of manchester though she acknowledged that scott bailey as a drama was more gritty and real upon taking idea to nicola shindler of red productions shindler contacted sally wainwright who wrote a script for an episode and according to jones they loved it despite positive reaction project kind of got a bit lost until itv discovered it and requested that wainwright rewrite script subsequently wainwright paired up with diane taylor a former detective inspector from greater manchester police to create programme and production expanded from jones and lindsay s original concept from taylor s perspective police were often filled with not only technical inaccuracies but what she felt were inaccuracies of how officers behaved saying that s what really irritates me in other dramas detectives crying over dead bodies and getting drunk senseless you d last about two weeks she said of her time as a police officer in comparison to portrayals on television that reality is much more interesting i could pull a thousand cases out of my head people would say would never happen people need drama because they would not believe reality production team scott bailey is produced by manchester based red production company which itself is majority owned by studiocanal following an acquisition estimated at ps30 million in december 2013 nicola shindler who founded company in 1998 is programme s executive producer alongside writer sally wainwright and tom sherry when speaking of shindler wainwright said nicola is just a genius she makes you raise your game so if you re good she ll make you better role of producer was undertaken by yvonne francas for series 1 and from series 2 3 tom sherry sherry who has worked for red productions for over 15 years described his job as opportunity to meddle in all departments it s about being able to have a passable stab at everyone s job and to be able to empathise with what they re trying to achieve for production of series 4 sherry undertook role of executive producer alongside wainwright and shindler while position of producer is staffed by juliet charlesworth for fifth series filmed in 2015 suranne jones became an executive producer alongside schindler involvement of diane taylor as a consultant producer is credited with maintaining scott baileys rigorous authenticity according to calkin of telegraph attention to detail is more extreme on this series say many of crew than others they have worked on during filming of unforgiven in 2008 written by wainwright and also starring suranne jones wainwright was told to meet taylor by grant montgomery show s designer after meeting production was given green light by itv and script was largely re written with wainwright commenting i wasn t writing a single line of dialogue that diane hadn t influenced wainwright is responsible for writing majority of episodes amelia bullmore who plays gill murray wrote three episodes wainwright had wanted to get other writers involved in process for her first episode as writer bullmore was given a brief that everything must be from scott and bailey s point of view and she was given a murder though she had been a professional writer for almost two decades scott and bailey marked first instance of bullmore writing and starring in same production due to wainwright s increased workload on her other drama series last tango in halifax and happy valley bullmore was chosen to be head writer for scott and baileys fourth series in 2014 she was joined on writing team by lee warburton who wrote two episodes of fourth series and returned to write scott bailey s fifth series in 2015 directing of scott bailey is undertaken in a method whereby each director directs a block of two or three episodes dictated by schedule when each episode has finished shooting director goes into edit and a new director takes over for next block according to calkin most prolific director of scott bailey is morag fullerton who directed seven episodes casting jones who had always envisaged herself playing rachel bailey when idea of project came in to mind was given role though at programme s pre production stages character had a different first name cathy it was originally intended that lindsay would star with jones in scott bailey but she became pregnant with twins so role of janet was given to lesley sharp instead lindsay received smaller role of rachel s sister alison lindsay approved of sharp playing role jones also felt pleased at prospect of working with sharp saying i was really excited on day of read through sharp s husband nicholas gleaves was awarded role of scott s lover ds andy roper despite actors relationship sharp stated that it was not a contributing factor in his casting stating nick s an actor and i m an actress we don t have same agent there s a script with a role in it that was right for him and it so happened that there was a role that was right for me and we both got cast but it wasn t a conversation that we had that it would be a good idea if we did a television series together because that s not way life works both rachel and janet are detective constables in major incident team of manchester metropolitan police service with team headed by dci gill murray amelia bullmore who is loosely based on diane taylor producers were undecided on what age dci murray would be but had originally pictured an actress older than bullmore after auditioning bullmore returned a month later intent on playing murray tough however when meeting casting director beverley keogh in toilets beforehand bullmore recounted that keogh said to her that s not what we ve got you back for we were interested in seeing a warmer side danny miller joined cast as series regular rob waddington in series 3 and tracie bennett also appeared in third series as dc bailey s estranged mother sharon in a continuing story

part fifth series scott bailey has received generally good reviews thus far tom sutcliffe of independent remarked that although it was a less than courageous decision for itv to commission a detective drama for sunday nights scott bailey had genuine signs of life in thing sam wollaston of guardian however questioned plausibility of idea that character of rachel would not realise her partner of two years was already married considering she was a detective and described series as lewis with skirts on however grace dent also of guardian described it as of great televisual comfort alexandra another writer for guardian described it as a genuinely gripping crime series and added what about a second series euan ferguson of observer stated that it was actually rather gripping horatia harrod reviewing third series for daily telegraph praised programme s script and its likeness to reality in portraying professional conduct of modern policing stating this is a beautifully engineered programme it s both pleasingly sudsy and deliciously grisly but manages to transcend both soap and detective genres somehow sally wainwright show s creator and writer has made traditionally dull quality of professional competence seem positively thrilling john preston of daily telegraph gave a mixed review though he commended acting of sharp and jones he stated that it badly needs some shape and tension metro took a decidedly critical stance with its reviews getting progressively worse with each new episode first describing it as comforting but could have been so much better then later quipping that scott bailey will never be compelling tv and that programme was a mediocre crime drama amidst a saturated market of mediocre crime dramas one of more persistent criticisms of show especially its first two series has been its indifferent or decidedly negative depiction of male characters tim oglethorpe reviewing first series in daily mail wrote that men often appear to be feckless devious or dangerous and stated that ds andy roper gleaves was only man to emerge with any credit dianne butler who reviewed programme upon its airing in australia made a similar point questioning relevance of show s male characters there are some men in this but they re fairly incidental guardians john crace expressed his belief that most of programme s male characters are deficient in some way writing surely it must be possible to make a show with women lead characters without having to make every male a complete dork from janet s useless husband and rachel s idiot brother who can t boil an egg without burning down kitchen performances of amelia bullmore and nicola walker in series 3 finale were highly praised julia raeside of guardian commented that both give an incredible acting masterclass that will take your breath away truly gripping and jewel in itv s increasingly impressive drama crown splendid stuff series was nominated for bafta tv award for best
