tanum tunnel is double track railway tunnel on asker line between jong in baerum and astad in asker norway it was built as part of first stage of asker line between asker and sandvika construction started in february 2002 and tunnel opened on 27 august 2005 tunnel was built by af gruppen for norwegian national rail administration most of tunneling was conducted using drilling and blasting method although easternmost were built using cut and cover method after tunnel opened there have been problems with leaks damaging superstructure tunnel has double track is electrified and allows for a maximum speed of cost to build tunnel excluding superstructure was 370 million norwegian krone nok tunnel will accelerate intercity and regional traffic west of oslo and free up capacity for oslo commuter rail on drammen line specifications tanum tunnel is long and has a cross section varying between tunnel consists of a blasted section and a cut and cover section latter easternmost part of tunnel it carries double tracked asker line between jong and astad tunnel runs mostly through cambrian silurian sedimentary slate nodular limestone and shale with local occurrences of permian igneous rock there is also a section of less stable sedimentary rock in asker group tunnel had a cover most of way of between however at there was a much lower margin laying for most at and at least at at astad line runs in open before entering skaugum tunnel line is electrified at and allows a maximum speed of tunnel has frost insulation into tunnel form each end tunnel has frost fans which ensure that air stays put in middle of tunnel thus hindering cold air from flowing past frost isolation history thumb left map of railways west of oslo with asker line in red and drammen line in black tanum tunnel is dotted red line between sandvika and hvalstad asker line runs from lysaker station via sandvika station to asker station in municipalities of baerum and asker line was built to allow increased railway traffic though main corridor west of oslo previously only railway west of oslo was drammen line which has limited capacity and is used by a mix of local regional intercity and freight trains this caused many delays and poor utilization of tracks as some trains make many stops and others only a few asker line allows regional and intercity trains to by pass local stations east of asker while local and freight trains remain on drammen line asker line was built in two stages first from asker to sandvika was constructed between 2001 and 2005 second stage from sandvika to lysaker was constructed between 2007 and 2011 other two tunnels on asker line are tunnel and baerum tunnel norwegian national rail administration awarded contract to build tanum tunnel to af part of af gruppen tunneling cost nok 370 million including open section between solstad and astad but excluding superstructure main part of tunnel was built using drilling and blasting method using two points of entry work on tunneling started in 2002 and was concluded in february 2004 construction included removal of of earthwork and laying of of ballast laying of tracks signaling power supply and other superstructures were done by baneservice cost of superstructures for entire section from asker to sandvika was nok 70 million work was completed by november 2004 opening of tunnel and rest of section from asker to sandvika took place on 27 august 2005 a concern from people living along tunnel was that they would be subject to low frequency noise originally municipalities of asker and baerum had demanded that residents be subject to a maximum of 27 decibel a weighting dba but national rail administration appealed requirements and was permitted to allow up to 32 dba in march 2004 a test was done in tunnel to insure that requirements would be met as low frequency sound is difficult to predict measurements after opening of tunnel showed background noise of 30 dba that no one was subject to 32 dba or higher and that it was nearly impossible to measure passing of trains among major concerns was leaks during construction on romerike tunnel there was a one year delay and severe cost overruns due to improper leak handling methods therefore one of main focuses in skaugum tunnel project was to avoid similar leaks contract specified a maximum leakage of per minute per contractor attempted to achieve this by extending time used for pre injection of concrete however there was still water dripping into tunnel which caused several types of damage some places water dripped onto track causing rust other places water dripped onto electrical equipment there was also issues with water running down walls and collecting in cable conduit and water with limestone dripping on ballast and mixing ballast with limestone by 2011 emergency lighting system had to be replaced because of high humidity national rail administration has stated that savings made to specifications in water and frost methods have caused higher maintenance costs because small leaks which are present do a lot of harm in addition areas with leaks suffer from icing this has been part of a national trend where older tunnels are nearly maintenance free while newer tunnels have incurred high maintenance costs references category railway tunnels in akershus category asker category tunnels in baerum category
