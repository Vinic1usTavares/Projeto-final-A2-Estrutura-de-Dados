russian battleship potemkin prince potemkin of taurida was a pre dreadnought battleship built for imperial russian navy s black sea fleet she became famous when crew rebelled against officers in june 1905 during that year s revolution which is now viewed as a first step towards russian revolution of 1917 mutiny later formed basis of sergei eisenstein s 1925 silent film battleship potemkin after mutineers sought asylum in constanta romania and after russians recovered ship her name was changed to panteleimon she accidentally sank a russian submarine in 1909 and was badly damaged when she ran aground in 1911 during world war i panteleimon participated in battle of cape sarych in late 1914 she covered several bombardments of bosphorus fortifications in early 1915 including one where ship was attacked by turkish battlecruiser yavuz sultan selim panteleimon and other russian pre dreadnoughts present drove her off before she could inflict any serious damage ship was relegated to secondary roles after russia s first dreadnought battleship entered service in late 1915 she was by then obsolete and was reduced to reserve in 1918 in sevastopol panteleimon was captured when germans took sevastopol in may 1918 and was handed over to allies after armistice in november 1918 her engines were destroyed by british in 1919 when they withdrew from sevastopol to prevent advancing bolsheviks from using them against white russians she was abandoned when whites evacuated crimea in 1920 and was finally scrapped by soviets in 1923 design and construction planning planning began in 1895 for a new battleship that would utilise a slipway slated to become available at nikolayev admiralty shipyard in 1896 naval staff and commander of black sea fleet vice admiral k p agreed on a copy of design but they were over ruled by general admiral grand duke alexei alexandrovich general admiral decided that long range and less powerful guns of peresvet class were inappropriate for narrow confines of black sea and ordered design of an improved version of battleship instead improvements included a higher forecastle to improve ship s seakeeping qualities krupp cemented armour and belleville boilers design process was complicated by numerous changes demanded by various departments of naval technical committee ship s design was finally approved on 12 june 1897 although design changes continued to be made that slowed ship s construction mclaughlin 2003 pp 117 18 construction and sea trials construction of potemkin began on 27 december 1897 and she was laid down at nikolayev admiralty shipyard on 10 october 1898 she was named in honour of prince grigory potemkin a russian soldier and statesman silverstone p 378 ship was launched on 9 october 1900 and transferred to

kambala sank in a collision with battleship rostislav not with panteleimon killing 16 crewmen aboard submarine polmar noot p 230 while returning from a port visit to constanta in 1911 panteleimon ran aground on 2 october it took several days to refloat her and make temporary repairs and full extent of damage to its bottom was not fully realised for several more months ship participated in training and gunnery exercises for rest of year a special watch was kept to ensure that no damaged seams were opened while firing permanent repairs which involved replacing its boiler foundations plating and a large number of its hull frames lasted from 10 january to 25 april 1912 navy took advantage of these repairs to overhaul its engines and boilers mclaughlin 2003 pp 120 21 172 295 world war i panteleimon flagship of 1st battleship brigade accompanied by pre dreadnoughts and tri sviatitelia covered pre dreadnought rostislav while it bombarded trebizond on morning of 17 november 1914 they were intercepted following day by ottoman battlecruiser yavuz sultan selim ex german sms goeben and light cruiser midilli ex german sms breslau on their return voyage to sevastopol in what came to be known as battle of cape sarych despite noon hour conditions were foggy capital ships initially did not spot each other although several other ships opened fire hitting goeben once panteleimon held fire because its turrets could not see german ships before they disengaged mclaughlin 2001 pp 123 127 tri sviatitelia and rostislav bombarded ottoman fortifications at mouth of bosphorus on 18 march 1915 first of several attacks intended to divert troops and attention from ongoing gallipoli campaign but fired only 105 rounds before sailing north to rejoin panteleimon ioann zlatoust and evstafi

consorts and latter scored two hits on yavuz sultan selim before it broke off action russian ships pursued it for six hours before giving up chase on 1 august all of black sea pre dreadnoughts were

british wrecked her engines on 19 april 1919 when they left crimea to prevent advancing bolsheviks from using it against white russians thoroughly obsolete by this time ship was captured by both sides during russian civil war but was abandoned by white russians when they evacuated crimea in november 1920 borets za svobodu was scrapped beginning in 1923 although she was not stricken from navy list until 21 november 1925 legacy thumb upright poster for sergei eisenstein s 1925 film dramatising mutiny immediate effects of mutiny are difficult to assess it may have influenced tsar nicholas ii s decisions to end russo japanese war and accept october manifesto as mutiny demonstrated that his regime no longer had unquestioning loyalty of military mutiny s failure did not stop other revolutionaries from inciting insurrections later that year including sevastopol uprising vladimir lenin leader of bolshevik party called 1905 revolution including potemkin mutiny a dress rehearsal for his successful revolution in 1917 bascomb p 185 communists seized upon it as a propaganda symbol for their party and unduly emphasised their role in mutiny in fact matushenko explicitly rejected bolsheviks because he and other leaders of mutiny were socialists of one type or another and cared nothing for communism bascomb pp 183 84 mutiny was memorialised most famously by sergei eisenstein in his 1925 silent film battleship potemkin although french silent film la revolution en russe mutiny on a man of war in odessa or revolution in odessa 1905 directed by ferdinand zecca or lucien or both was first film to depict mutiny higgins pp 320 21 preceding eisenstein s far more famous film by 20 years filmed shortly after bolshevik victory in russian civil war of 1917 22 with derelict battleship dvenadsat apostolov standing in for broken up potemkin mclaughlin 2003 p 52 eisenstein recast mutiny into a predecessor of october revolution of 1917 that swept bolsheviks to power he emphasised their role and implied that mutiny failed because matushenko and other leaders were not better bolsheviks eisenstein made other changes to dramatise story ignoring major fire that swept through odessa s dock area while potemkin was anchored there combining many different incidents of rioters and soldiers fighting into a famous sequence on steps today known as potemkin stairs and showing a tarpaulin thrown over sailors to be executed in accordance with marxist doctrine that history is made by collective action not individuals eisenstein to single out any person in his film but rather focused on mass protagonist bordwell pp 43 267 soviet film critics hailed this approach including dramaturge and critic adrian piotrovsky writing for leningrad newspaper gazeta hero is sailors battleship odessa crowd but characteristic figures are snatched here and there from crowd for a moment like a conjuring trick they attract all sympathies of audience like sailor vakulinchuk like young woman and child on odessa steps but they emerge only to dissolve once more into mass this signifies no film stars but a film of real life types quoted in taylor p 76 similarly theatre critic alexei wrote in journal artistic life zhizn taylor p 76 in potemkin there is no individual hero as there was in old theatre it is mass that acts battleship and its sailors and city and its population in revolutionary mood quoted in taylor p 78 last survivor of mutiny was ivan who died on 24 october 1987 at age of 102 in dublin see also ru na potemkin mutiny notes references sources external links
