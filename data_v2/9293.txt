thumb right sam max was created by steve purcell who would have a significant role in developing later video games idea of sam max originated with steve purcell s younger brother dave who invented concept of a comic about a detective team consisting of a dog and a rabbit in his youth dave would often leave comics around house so steve in a case of sibling rivalry often finished incomplete stories in parodies of their original form deliberately making characters mix up each other s names over explain things shoot at each other and mock way in which they had been drawn as kind of a parody of way a kid talks when he s writing comics over time this developed from steve merely mocking his brother s work to him creating his own full stories with characters ultimately in late 1970s dave purcell gave steve rights to characters signing them over in a contract on steve s birthday and allowing him to develop characters in his own way in 1980 purcell began to produce sam max comic strips for weekly newsletter of california college of arts and crafts while visual appearance of characters had not yet been fully developed stories were similar in style to those that would follow
