izak catshark or simply izak holohalaelurus regani is a species of catshark belonging to family scyliorhinidae common off coasts of south africa and southern namibia it typically inhabits outer continental shelf at depths of with males found deeper than females and juveniles izak catshark has a short wide flattened head and a robust body tapering to a long slender tail it can be identified by its ornate color pattern of dark brown spots in juveniles or reticulations and blotches in adults on a light yellowish background as well as by enlarged dermal denticles over its pectoral fins and along its dorsal midline from snout to second dorsal fin this species reaches in length with males larger than females bottom dwelling and perhaps relatively active in nature izak catshark feeds mainly on a diverse array of bony fishes crustaceans and cephalopods a significant portion of its diet may be scavenged from offal discarded by fisheries this species is oviparous with females producing encapsulated eggs two at a time year round izak catshark is regularly caught incidentally by a south african bottom trawl commercial fishery but is discarded rather than utilized despite fishing pressure its population has been increasing and thus international union for conservation of nature iucn has assessed it as least concern taxonomy izak catshark was originally described by south african ichthyologist john gilchrist in a 1922 fisheries survey report he assigned new species to genus and gave it specific epithet regani in honor of fellow ichthyologist charles tate regan in 1934 henry weed fowler assigned this species to his newly created holohalaelurus a subgenus of halaelurus holohalaelurus has since been elevated to rank of full genus as there do not appear to be any existing type specimens referable to gilchrist s account in 2006 brett human designated a long male caught in bay as species neotype historically there has been much confusion in scientific literature between h regani h punctatus and h last of which at various times had been considered a junior synonym of h regani and was itself confounded with h furthermore two forms of h regani were once recognized cape or typical form and natal or northeastern form latter northeastern form was described as a separate species h in 2006 description thumb upright 1 2 left izak catshark has a very long caudal peduncle and distinctively ornate dorsal markings body of izak catshark is firm and stout tapering dramatically towards tail head is very short wide and flattened with a blunt snout horizontally oval eyes are placed high on head and have thick ridges beneath each has a rudimentary nictitating membrane and is followed by a spiracle nostrils are preceded by triangular flaps of skin that almost reach long angular mouth mouth contains prominent papillae on both roof and floor and lacks furrows at corners upper and lower jaws contain on average 65 and 60 tooth rows respectively each tooth is relatively large with a narrow central cusp flanked by 1 2 smaller cusplets there are five pairs of gill slits pectoral fins are rather long and broad first dorsal fin originates over rear of pelvic fin bases second dorsal fin is slightly larger and originates over rear of anal fin base pelvic and anal fins are long and low and larger than dorsal fins free rear tips of pelvic fins may be fused together to some degree but never completely males have slender pointed claspers caudal peduncle is long and thin particularly in younger sharks caudal fin makes up one fourth to one fifth of total length and has a weak lower lobe and a ventral notch near tip of upper lobe thick skin is covered by well calcified dermal denticles except around gill slits enlarged spike like denticles are found on upper surface of pectoral fins and along dorsal midline from snout to second dorsal fin origin juvenile izak catsharks are boldly patterned with many irregularly shaped dark brown spots on a light yellow to yellowish brown background spots enlarge and fuse with age to form an intricate pattern of reticulations and u shaped markings in adults underside is plain white with obvious black sensory pores beneath head body and paired fins like other holohalaelurus species but contrary to pattern in most cartilaginous fishes males attain a much greater maximum length than females versus distribution and habitat endemic to southern tip of africa range of izak catshark extends from luderitz namibia in west to durban south africa in east older records further north along east african coast e g somalia most likely refer to other holohalaelurus species this abundant bottom dwelling species inhabits outer continental shelf and upper continental slope from to at least deep off south africa it is most common in areas with a wider continental shelf and at depths of off south coast and off west coast females and juveniles tend to be found in shallower water than males for most part number of sharks in a given area remains largely constant throughout year however sharks at southernmost point of agulhas bank may perform a small autumn migration towards shore biology and ecology thumb squid such as are preyed upon by izak catshark compared to other deep sea sharks izak catshark has a large heart suggestive of a relatively active lifestyle it is a generalist that feeds on a wide variety of bony fishes crustaceans and cephalopods larger sharks consume proportionately more crustaceans and fewer fishes at least some part of its recorded diet probably represents scavenging from fishery discards given presence of fast moving pelagic species that shark is unlikely to have captured live polychaete worms hydrozoans gastropods and hagfish eggs may also be occasionally ingested this species often has nematode and flatworm parasites in its stomach izak catshark is oviparous and reproduction proceeds throughout year without seasonal patterns mature females have a single functional ovary and two functional oviducts a single egg matures within each oviduct at a time each egg is contained within a purse shaped capsule long and across capsule is light brown with long tendrils at four corners that likely serve to anchor it to rocks its surface has a velvet like texture and bears lengthwise striations rate of egg laying is unknown but thought to be high based on this shark s resilience to fishing pressure preponderance of females and juveniles at shallower depths may indicate that such waters serve as nursery areas young hatch at under long males and females mature sexually at and long respectively human interactions izak catshark is harmless and of no commercial value it is regularly caught incidentally and discarded by a bottom trawl fishery targeting hake south of cape town in contrast to most cartilaginous fishes its numbers have been increasing in presence of commercial fishing reasons for this may include its high reproductive rate its breeding in less fished shallower waters its hardiness allowing for high post capture survival and its opportunistic diet international union for conservation of nature iucn has consequently listed izak catshark under least concern while still noting that it merits continued population monitoring because of its highly restricted range references izak catshark category marine
