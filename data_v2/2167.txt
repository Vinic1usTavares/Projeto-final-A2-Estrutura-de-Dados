right thumb 400px westerlies blue and trade winds yellow and brown westerlies anti trades or prevailing westerlies are prevailing winds from west toward east in middle latitudes between 30 and 60 degrees latitude they originate from high pressure areas in horse latitudes and trend towards poles and steer extratropical cyclones in this general manner tropical cyclones which cross subtropical ridge axis into westerlies recurve due to increased westerly flow winds are predominantly from southwest in northern hemisphere and from northwest in southern hemisphere westerlies are strongest in winter hemisphere and times when pressure is lower over poles while they are weakest in summer hemisphere and when pressures are higher over poles westerlies are particularly strong especially in southern hemisphere in areas where land is absent because land amplifies flow pattern making current more north south oriented slowing westerlies strongest westerly winds in middle latitudes can come in roaring forties between 40 and 50 degrees latitude westerlies play an important role in carrying warm equatorial waters and winds to western coasts of continents especially in southern hemisphere because of its vast oceanic expanse behavior if earth were tidally locked to sun solar heating would cause winds across mid latitudes to blow in a poleward direction away from subtropical ridge however coriolis effect caused by rotation of earth causes winds to steer to right of what would otherwise be expected across northern hemisphere and left of what would be expected in southern hemisphere nathan gasser 2000 08 10 solar heating and coriolis forces university of tennessee at knoxville retrieved on 2009 05 31 this is why winds across northern hemisphere tend to blow from southwest but they tend to be from northwest in southern hemisphere ralph stockman tarr and frank morton mcmurry 1909 advanced geography w w shannon state printing pp 246 retrieved on 2009 04 15 when pressures are lower over poles strength of westerlies increases which has effect of warming mid latitudes this occurs when arctic oscillation is positive and during winter low pressure near poles is stronger than it would be during summer when it is negative and pressures are higher over poles flow is more meridional blowing from direction of pole towards equator which brings cold air into mid latitudes national snow and ice data center 2009 arctic oscillation arctic climatology and meteorology retrieved on 2009 04 11 throughout year westerlies vary in strength with polar cyclone as cyclone reaches its maximum intensity in winter westerlies increase in strength as cyclone reaches its weakest intensity in summer westerlies weaken halldor 2005 global circulation islands retrieved on 2008 06 15 an example of impact of westerlies is when dust plumes originating in gobi desert combine with pollutants and spread large distances downwind or eastward into north america westerlies can be particularly strong especially in southern hemisphere where there is less land in middle latitudes to cause progression of west to east winds to slow down in southern hemisphere because of stormy and cloudy conditions it is usual to refer to westerlies as roaring forties furious fifties or shrieking sixties according to varying degrees of latitude impact on ocean currents thumb right 250 px benjamin franklin s map of gulf stream due to persistent winds from west to east on poleward sides of subtropical ridges located in atlantic and pacific oceans ocean currents are driven in a similar manner in both hemispheres currents in northern hemisphere are weaker than those in southern hemisphere due to differences in strength between westerlies of each hemisphere see also process of western

chart of an extratropical cyclone affecting uk and ireland blue arrows between isobars indicate direction of wind while l symbol denotes centre of low note occluded cold and warm frontal boundaries an extratropical cyclone is a synoptic scale low pressure weather system that has neither tropical nor polar characteristics being connected with fronts and horizontal gradients in temperature and dew point otherwise known as baroclinic zones descriptor extratropical refers to fact that this type of cyclone generally occurs outside of tropics in middle latitudes of planet where westerlies steer system generally from west to east these systems may also be described as mid latitude cyclones due to their area of formation or post tropical cyclones where extratropical transition has occurred and are often described as depressions or lows by weather forecasters and general public these are everyday phenomena which along with anti cyclones drive weather over much of earth although extratropical cyclones are almost always classified as baroclinic since they form along zones of temperature and dewpoint gradient they can sometimes become barotropic late in their life cycle when temperature distribution around cyclone becomes fairly uniform along radius from center of low pressure ryan n 2009 chapter 3 cyclone paradigms and extratropical transition conceptualizations florida state university retrieved on 2008 06 15 an extratropical cyclone can transform into a subtropical storm and from there into a tropical cyclone if it dwells over warm waters and develops central convection which warms its core and causes temperature and dewpoint gradients near their centers to fade interaction with tropical cyclones thumb right 250 px storm track of hurricane bill 2009 showing a classic recurvature off american coast in 2009 when a tropical cyclone crosses subtropical ridge axis normally through a break in high pressure area caused by a system traversing westerlies its general track

or siberia many tropical cyclones are eventually forced toward northeast by extratropical cyclones in this manner which move from west to east to north of subtropical ridge an example of a tropical
