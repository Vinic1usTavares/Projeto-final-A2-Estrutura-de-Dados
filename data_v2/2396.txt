audiences beyond his demographic mikael wood of entertainment weekly gave album a b rating stating that album doesn t change bieber s beloved kiddie soul vocals calling it perfunctory but said that acoustic renditions such as baby one time and new song pray deliver their saccharine payload thomas of chicago sun times said that calming down several of pop tunes with slower tempos and patient singing was not bad and that slowing everything down made listeners hear how singer s voice had matured calling it acoustic album in history allison stewart of washington post said its arrangements and melodies best parts of any bieber record are stripped down but otherwise little changed demonstrating just how great most of these songs were to begin with stewart also said that urban numbers such as baby survive their makeovers without a hitch andy kellman of allmusic gave album 2 and a half out of 5 stars saying that album was an enticement dan savoie of rockstar weekly gave album 4 out of 5 stars saying that it is perfect showcase for a talented young artist who s on his way to grammy awards this year although she commented that acoustic labeling was a bit misleading monica hererra
