schools in taoism however it denotes principle that is source pattern and substance of everything that exists taoism differs from confucianism by not emphasising rigid rituals and social order but is similar in sense that it is a teaching about various disciplines for achieving perfection by becoming one with unplanned rhythms of universe called way or dao taoist ethics vary depending on particular school but in general tend to emphasise wu wei action without intention naturalness simplicity spontaneity and three treasures compassion frugality and humility roots of taoism go back at least to 4th century bce early taoism drew its cosmological notions from school of yinyang naturalists and was deeply influenced by one of oldest texts of chinese culture i ching which expounds a philosophical system about how to keep human behaviour in accordance with alternating cycles of nature legalist shen c 400 c 337 bce may also have been a major influence expounding a realpolitik of wu

between their ritual tradition and practices of chinese folk religion and non taoist vernacular ritual orders which are often mistakenly identified as pertaining to taoism chinese alchemy especially neidan chinese astrology chan zen buddhism several martial arts traditional chinese medicine feng shui and many styles of qigong have been intertwined with taoism throughout history beyond china taoism also had influence on surrounding societies in asia today taoist tradition is one of five religious doctrines officially recognised in people s republic of china prc as well as republic of

mystical aspect philosophical doctrines based on texts of i ching tao te ching or daodejing and zhuangzi these texts were linked together as taoist philosophy during early han dynasty but notably not before it is unlikely that zhuangzi was familiar with text of daodejing and zhuangzi would not have identified himself as a taoist as this classification did not arise until well after his death however discussed distinction is rejected by majority of western and japanese scholars it is contested by hermeneutic interpretive difficulties in categorisation of different taoist schools sects and movements mair 2001 p 174 taoism does not fall under an umbrella or a definition of a single organised religion like abrahamic traditions nor can it be studied as a mere variant of chinese folk religion as although two share some similar concepts much of chinese folk religion is separate from tenets and core teachings of taoism sinologists isabelle robinet and livia kohn agree that taoism has never been a unified religion and has constantly consisted of a combination of teachings based on a variety of original revelations philosopher chung ying cheng views taoism as a religion that has been embedded into chinese history and tradition whether confucianism daoism or later chinese buddhism they all fall into this pattern of thinking and organizing and in this sense remain religious even though individually and intellectually they also assume forms of philosophy and practical wisdom chung ying cheng also noted that daoist view of heaven flows mainly from observation and meditation though teaching of way dao can also include way of heaven independently of human nature in chinese history three religions of buddhism daoism and confucianism stand on their own independent views and yet are involved in a process of attempting to find harmonization and convergence among themselves so that we can speak of a unity of three religious teaching term taoist and taoism as a liturgical framework traditionally chinese language does not have terms defining lay people adhering to doctrines or practices of taoism who fall instead within field of folk religion taoist in western is traditionally used to translate daoshi master of tao thus strictly defining priests of taoism ordained clergymen of a taoist institution who represent taoist culture on a professional basis are experts of taoist liturgy and therefore can employ this knowledge and ritual skills for benefit of a community this role of taoist priests reflects definition of taoism as a liturgical framework

called within chinese religion term with meaning of taoist as lay member or believer of taoism is a modern invention that goes back to introduction of western category of organized religion in china

zhang lu laozi is traditionally regarded as one of founders of taoism and is closely associated in this context with original or primordial taoism whether he actually existed is disputed however work attributed to him tao te ching is dated to late 4th century bce taoism draws its cosmological foundations from school of naturalists in form of its main elements yin and yang and five phases which

paradoxical expression wei wu wei action without action in ancient taoist texts wu wei is associated with water through its yielding nature 2007 p109 taoist philosophy in accordance with i ching proposes that universe works harmoniously according to its own ways when someone exerts their will against world in a manner that is out of rhythm with cycles of change they may disrupt that harmony and unintended consequences may more likely result rather than willed outcome taoism does not identify one s will as root problem rather it asserts that one must place their will in harmony with

xing in form of zang fu organs as a consequence it is believed that deeper understanding of universe can be achieved by understanding oneself 2004 p 171 theology taoism can be defined as pantheistic given its philosophical emphasis on formlessness of tao and primacy of way rather than anthropomorphic concepts of god this is one of core beliefs that nearly all sects share taoist orders usually present three pure ones at top of pantheon of deities visualising hierarchy emanating from tao laozi laojun lord lao is considered incarnation of one of three purities and worshipped as ancestor of philosophical doctrine different branches of taoism often have differing pantheons of lesser deities where these deities reflect different notions of cosmology lesser deities also may be promoted or demoted for their activity some varieties of popular chinese religion incorporate jade emperor derived from main of three purities as a representation of most high god persons from history of taoism and people who are considered to have become immortals xian are venerated as well by both clergy and laypeople despite these hierarchies of deities traditional conceptions of tao should not be
