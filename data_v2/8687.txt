sackville see palmer pp 368 91 news of clark s victory reached general george washington and his success was celebrated and was used to encourage alliance with france general washington recognized that clark s achievement had been gained without support from regular army either in men or funds palmer pp 391 94 virginia also capitalized on clark s success laying claim to old northwest by calling it illinois county virginia palmer pp 400 and 421 thumb right 325px clark s march to vincennes was most celebrated event of his career it has been often depicted as in this illustration by f c yohn final years of war clark s ultimate goal during revolutionary war was to seize british held fort at detroit but he could never recruit enough men and acquire sufficient munitions to make attempt fischer p 110 kentucky militiamen generally preferred to defend their own territory and stay closer to home rather than make long and potentially perilous expedition to detroit english 2 682 clark returned to falls of ohio and louisville kentucky where he continued to defend ohio river valley until end of war gugin and st clair eds p 61 in june 1780 a mixed force of british and indians from

defeated kentucky militia at battle of blue licks clark was militia s senior military officer but he had not been present at battle and was severely criticized in virginia council for disaster

centennial history of piqua troy and miami county reports indians had five killed and clark s forces had two 1 killed and 1 mortally wounded this was last major expedition of war english 2 758 60 importance of clark s activities during revolutionary war has been subject of much debate among historians as early as 1779 george mason called clark conqueror of northwest palmer p 79 because british ceded entire old northwest territory to united states in treaty of paris 1783 some historians including william hayden english credit clark with nearly doubling size of original thirteen colonies when he seized control of illinois country during war clark s illinois campaign particularly surprise march to vincennes was greatly celebrated and romanticized more recent scholarship from historians such as lowell harrison has downplayed importance of campaign in peace negotiations and outcome of war arguing that clark s conquest was little more than a temporary occupation of territory harrison p iix although illinois campaign is frequently described in terms of a harsh winter ordeal for americans james fischer points out that capture of kaskaskia and vincennes may not have been as difficult as previously suggested kaskaskia proved to be an easy target clark had sent two spies there in june 1777 who reported an absence of soldiers in town fischer p 123 clark s men also easily captured vincennes and fort sackville prior to their arrival in 1778 clark had sent captain leonard helm to vincennes to gather intelligence in addition father pierre gibault a local priest helped persuade town s inhabitants to side with americans before clark and his men set out to recapture vincennes in 1779 francis vigo provided clark with additional information on town its surrounding area and fort clark was already aware of fort s military strength poor location surrounded by houses that could provide cover to attackers and dilapidated condition clark s strategy of a surprise attack and strong intelligence were critical in catching hamilton and his men unaware and vulnerable fischer p 123 24 after killing five captive indians by hatchet within view of fort clark forced its surrender sheehan p 20 thumb right virginia land office warrant to clark for 560 acres for having raised battalion to fight in revolutionary war january 1780 later years clark was just thirty years old when revolutionary war ended but his greatest military achievements were already behind him after clark s victories in illinois country settlers continued to pour into kentucky and spread into and develop land north of ohio river from 1784 to 1788 clark served as superintendent surveyor for virginia s war veterans surveying lands granted to them for their service in war position brought clark a small income but he devoted very little time to enterprise harrison p 101 in 1785 clark helped to negotiate treaty of fort 2 790 91 and treaty of fort finney in 1786 but violence between native americans and european american settlers continued to escalate according to a 1790 u s government report 1 500 kentucky settlers had been killed in indian raids since end of revolutionary war james p 325 in an attempt to end raids clark led an expedition of 1 200 drafted men against native american villages along wabash river in 1786 campaign one of first actions of northwest indian war harrison p 102 ended without a victory after approximately three hundred militiamen mutinied due to a lack of supplies clark had to withdraw but not before concluding a ceasefire with native tribes it was rumored most notably by james wilkinson that clark had often been drunk on duty harrison p 104 when clark learned of accusations he demanded an official inquiry but virginia governor declined his request and virginia council condemned clark s actions with clark s reputation tarnished he never again led men in battle clark left kentucky and moved across ohio river to indiana frontier near present day clarksville indiana english 2 800 03 life in indiana following his military service and especially after 1787 clark spent much of remainder of his life dealing with financial difficulties clark had financed majority of his military campaigns with borrowed funds when creditors began pressuring him to repay his debts clark was unable to obtain reimbursement from virginia or united states congress due to haphazard record keeping on frontier during war virginia refused payment claiming that clark s receipts for his purchases were fraudulent fischer p 110 128 as compensation for his wartime service virginia gave clark a gift of of land that became known as clark s grant in present day southern indiana while soldiers who fought with clark also received smaller tracts of land clark s grant and his other holdings gave clark ownership of land that encompassed present day clark county indiana and portions of adjoining floyd and scott counties madison hoosiers p 27 although clark had claims to tens of thousands of acres of land result of his military service and land speculation he was land poor meaning that he owned much land but lacked resources to develop it clark wrote his memoirs around 1791 but they were not published during his lifetime although autobiography contains factual inaccuracies work includes clark s perspective on events of his life some historians believe clark wrote his memoirs in attempt to salvage his damaged reputation and to document his contributions during revolutionary war in service of french on february 2 1793 with his career seemingly over and his prospects for prosperity doubtful clark offered his services to edmond charles genet controversial ambassador of revolutionary france hoping to earn money to maintain his estate harrison p 105 western americans were outraged that spanish who controlled louisiana denied americans free access to mississippi river their only easy outlet for long distance commerce washington administration was also unresponsive to western matters genet appointed clark major general in armies of france and commander in chief of french revolutionary legion on mississippi river english 2 818 clark began to organize a campaign to seize new madrid st louis natchez and new orleans getting assistance from old comrades such as benjamin logan and john montgomery and winning tacit support of kentucky governor isaac shelby english 2 821 22 clark spent 4 680 in 2009 chained dollars of his own money for supplies james p 425 in early 1794 however president washington issued a proclamation forbidding americans from violating u s neutrality and threatened to dispatch general anthony wayne to fort massac to stop expedition french government recalled genet and revoked commissions he granted to americans for war against spain clark s planned campaign gradually collapsed and he was unable to convince french to reimburse him for his expenses harrison p 106 clark s reputation already damaged by earlier accusations at end of revolutionary war was further maligned as a result of his involvement in these foreign intrigues fisher p 130 mounting debts in his later years clark s mounting debts made it impossible for him to retain ownership of his land since it became subject to seizure due to his debts clark deeded much of his land to friends or transferred ownership to family members so his creditors could not seize it harrison p 100 lenders and their eventually deprived veteran of nearly all of property that remained in his name clark who was at one time largest landholder in northwest territory was left with only a small plot of land in clarksville english 2 862 in 1803 clark built a cabin overlooking falls of ohio where he lived until his health failed in 1809 he also operated a small gristmill which he worked with two african american slaves clark s knowledge of region helped him to become an expert on west s natural history over years he welcomed travelers including those interested in natural history to his home overlooking ohio river clark supplied details on area s plant and animal life to john pope and john james audubon and hosted his brother william and meriweather lewis prior to their expedition to pacific northwest clark also provided information on ohio valley s native tribes to allan bowie magruder and archaeological evidence related to mound builders to john p campbell fischer p 131 in later life clark continued to struggle with alcohol abuse a problem which had plagued him on and off for many years he also remained bitter about his treatment and neglect by virginia and blamed it for his financial misfortune when indiana territory chartered indiana canal company in 1805 to build a canal around falls of ohio near clarksville clark

louisville and became a member of household of his sister lucy and brother in law major william croghan a planter english 2 882 in 1812 virginia general assembly granted clark a pension of four
