raised in a dysfunctional family that consisted of a timid father and a philandering mother she hurtles from one disastrous affair to another leading to her degenerating into a cynical woman into her life enter two radically different men one of them is her boss thyagu rajinikanth who owns advertising agency she works for he is a stereotype of successful man money minded opinionated arrogant and a male chauvinist in sharp contrast is arun kamal haasan who has come to chennai from coimbatore to make a documentary on women sensitive and sincere he believes his job has a purpose and is both shocked and amused at cynical attitudes of manju and thyagu manju has been drafted by thyagu to assist arun in his documentary as arun and manju start working together arun begins to understand manju s complex personality she tells arun about her unfortunate past relationships how she was molested by her uncle ending of her first relationship in college when her lover left her by marrying another woman for sake of employment and how her second love mano sivachandran a christian priest s son used her to satisfy his needs and lust calling her sister in front of her parents these incidents have led to her present attitude towards men arun later shares these conversations with thyagu who warns him to steer clear of such women inevitably arun falls for manju however manju incurs thyagu s wrath when he overhears her reprimanding her office staff for commenting on her character when thyagu also comments about her she resigns from her job when he learns of this arun requests thyagu to re employ her thyagu simply laughs and says that she is already back after which manju seems to have a change of heart and starts courting thyagu arun is devastated to see that she has turned out to be just sort of woman that thyagu earlier said she was opportunistic money minded and fickle when he asks her about her contradicting stands in life she responds by saying that is way she is and will be truth finally emerges that manju was merely baiting thyagu to teach him a lesson when thyagu starts believing that manju has fallen for him he attempts to take advantage of her at a party banquet but she rebukes and slaps him after which thyagu runs away in fright however this revelation comes too late for her as arun who is disillusioned with her behaviour has already married a small town girl saritha when manju tells her aunt about attempt to humiliate thyagu and its ramifications her aunt tells manju that she deserved it for leaving behind a golden opportunity to start a new life in a final discussion in thyagu s car manju asks arun s wife what do you think of women s liberation arun s wife replies i don t know manju replies with a cynical that is why you are happy film ends with manju standing on road as car carrying thyagu and married couple pulls away from her a voice over says she died today she will be reborn tomorrow she will die again she will be reborn again that is how she is cast sripriya as manju kamal haasan as arun rajinikanth as thyagu sivachandran as mano saritha as arun s wife production development c rudhraiya whose former name was was introduced to kamal haasan by writer and director ananthu three shared an interest in works of robert bresson jean luc godard roman polanski and roberto rossellini godard and bresson were part of french new wave which focused on films based on social ideas some of which were iconoclastic in nature rudhraiya haasan and ananthu wanted to experiment with their ideas in tamil this was rudhraiya s first film as director quite radical in his approach he wanted to change conventions of tamil cinema at that time k rajeshwar was writing a script dealing with women s liberation at that time and it was decided that his script would be used for film result was aval appadithan it was first film made by a graduate of m g r government film and television training institute initial script by rajeshwar consisted of two pages aval appadithan was debut film for both nallusamy and m n who jointly handled film s cinematography vanna co wrote screenplay with somasundareshwar and rudhraiya film was co produced by ragamanjari in association with students of m g r government film and television training institute sripriya who played manju was initially unsure about acting in film due to her busy schedule at that time and only agreed to do it on haasan s insistence according to rajeshwar characterisation of manju was inspired from a woman he met and who had similar radical beliefs in rajinikanth definitive biography 2012 rajinikanth recalled if kamal had said don t cast rajini nobody would have taken me in aval sivachandran was cast as manju s former lover mano filming throughout film cinematography made extensive use of shadows and close up shots to emphasise moods of characters jump cuts were frequently used as well overall 8 230 metres of film negative was used to make film and team incurred a cost of 20 000 for exterior shooting equipment scenes where arun interviewed women for his documentary were real scenes improvised with women they would meet at colleges and bus stops and shot using live recording method film uses a sharp contrast of black and white colours to lend a surreal atmosphere to it and none of actors used make up filming proceeded smoothly as almost all of dialogues were ready by time team went for filming scenes camera angles were pre planned as well haasan shot film in his spare time as he was involved in over 20 other films as an actor during production of aval appadithan before a shot haasan discussed scene with ananthu and rudhraiya on how godard would have done it film was shot in two hour sessions over a period of four five months opening scene where haasan looks into camera and says konjam left la english sit a little to left please was meant as a sign to audience to support gender equality according to tamil newspaper dinamalar aval appadithan was shot in 20 days themes and influences aval appadithan explores a number of themes such as women s liberation sex and chauvinistic attitude of males its central theme is on women and their plight in society as exemplified by manju and her relationships born to a timid father and a mother with loose moral values she is also subsequently affected by two people she becomes romantically involved with one her college mate left her to marry someone else for sake of a job and second is mano son of a christian priest who used her to satisfy his lust and then trivialised their relationship by calling her sister in front of her parents these relationships result in her becoming wary of men and developing an aggressive nature towards them conversations related to matters like status of women in contemporary 1978 times and nature of humankind are frequently seen in film sociologist selvaraj velayutham says in his book tamil cinema cultural politics of india s other film industry that manju s characterisation was brought out entirely verbally by her velayutham believes film to be constantly resorting to existing myths about women and relationships that a wayward mother destroys her children that a woman who speaks truth is always alone that men are scared of her that woman who is different is confused not sure of herself and is only seeking love from a man but does not know it herself velayutham further asserts that film s only positive aspect is it does not expose body of women in way it is customary and that manju could have avoided her unfortunate set of circumstances if only she had a proper mother artist v compared aval appadithan to other films whose central theme was women such as charulata 1964 aval oru kathai 1974 and 1986 while also labelling them as classics that put spotlight on women ashish rajadhyaksha and paul willemen in their book encyclopedia of indian cinema say film was also inspired by 1972 film which starred r muthuraman and bai they also note that aval appadithan uses a fluid narrative style and music to mix flashbacks with vox pop and glossy pictorialism film is an exception on stereotypes of women as shown by paralleling an independent woman manju and a pious traditional woman manju gets into problems while arun s wife is happy last lines of film where manju asks what do you think of women s liberation arun s wife answers i don t know to which manju says that is why you are happy send message that one will inevitably get into trouble if one exhibits assertive behaviour kamal haasan s character arun is an early version of a metrosexual male sensitive and sincere rajinikanth s character thyagu is exact opposite of arun money minded arrogant and a womaniser this is evident when thyagu says to arun women should be enjoyed not analysed according to rajinikanth thyagu was very much similar to him in real life he too smokes and drinks but applies sacred ash on his forehead this implies that thyagu was also an atheist according to film critic naman ramachandran thyagu was by far rajinikanth s most entertaining character up to that point in his career his character was a self confessed chauvinist who believed that men and women can never be equal and that women are merely objects to be used for men s pleasure when arun calls thyagu a prejudiced ass thyagu responds by saying i am a male ass with dialogue being in english his opinion of sripriya s character manju is seen when he says also in english she is a self pitying sex starved bitch music aval appadithan soundtrack and score were composed by ilaiyaraaja soundtrack was released under label of emi records although ilaiyaraaja was busy he agreed to compose for aval appadithan at insistence of rudhraiya and haasan after recording session of oru from sigappu rojakkal 1978 ilaiyaraaja asked haasan to record panneer pushpangale that same afternoon during recording session ilaiyaraaja suggested that haasan tone down opening notes when haasan sang perfectly as per his suggestion ilaiyaraaja accepted haasan s next rendition of song ilaiyaraaja wanted vannanilavan to write lyrics for but since vannanilavan had difficulties in writing lyrics he opted out he was subsequently replaced with gangai amaran song was reused in film megha 2014 it poignantly captures vulnerable moments in life of a woman while panneer pushpangale and have a philosophical touch according to swarnavel eswaran pillai author of article 1970s tamil cinema and post classical turn songs were used to punctuate interiority of characters rather than as a spectacle or as a device to move plot forward in june 2013 a of honey bee music enhanced songs from their original version on film s soundtrack album to 5 1

critical response film received generally positive reviews from critics on 19 november 1978 magazine ananda vikatan criticised gaps in film particularly abundance of english dialogue excessive focus on naturalism and lower standard of technical work especially cinematography despite these perceived flaws magazine still appreciated film stating that actors immersed themselves into their characters leading to them not really acting before camera but living characters retrospective response to film has also been positive k balamurugan of rediff said it was what we would call parallel cinema these days writing for hindu baradwaj rangan commented and remarked on how different film was by saying aval appadithan was different shadowy black and white cinematography was different dialogues which

painfully sensitive feminist hero was different was different d karthikeyan of hindu wrote in december 2009 that aval appadithan would remain etched in every film lover s memory by showing best of rajnikanth s acting skills director mrinal sen remarked film was far ahead of its times critics also appreciated live recording method of shooting sequences where haasan s character arun interviewed women for his documentary box office film did not initially receive a big response from public and was not a box office success upon its release however after directors p bharathiraja and mrinal sen wrote positive comments on it people began to watch film and appreciate it leading aval appadithan to develop a cult following in november 2014 haasan defended financial failure of film aval appadithan was a guerilla attack on industry by insiders like me it slipped through their fingers so to speak with all attention that films get these days i doubt we can get away with such a film any
