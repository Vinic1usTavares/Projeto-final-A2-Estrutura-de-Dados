it s all coming back to me now is a power ballad written by jim steinman according to meat loaf as indicated in it was written for first album in bat out of hell trilogy recorded by meat loaf according to steinman song was inspired by wuthering heights and was an attempt to write most passionate romantic song he could ever create sunday times posits that steinman protects his songs as if they were his children meat loaf had wanted to record song for years but steinman saw it as a woman s song steinman won a court movement preventing meat loaf from recording it girl group pandora s box went on to record it and it was subsequently made famous through a cover by celine dion which upset meat loaf because he was going to use it for a planned album with working title bat out of hell iii alternately meat loaf has said song was intended for bat out of hell ii and given to singer in 1986 but that they both decided to use i d do anything for love but i won t do that for bat ii and save this song for bat iii song has had three major releases first version appeared on concept album original sin recorded by pandora s box it was then recorded by celine dion for her album falling into you and her version was a commercial hit reaching no 2 in u s billboard hot 100 behind los del rio s macarena and blackstreet s no diggity and no 3 in uk singles chart meat loaf eventually recorded it as a duet with norwegian singer marion raven for bat iii and released it as a single in 2006 this version reached no 1 in norway and no 2 in scotland a music video was produced for each of three versions death is a recurring theme in all of these videos fitting in with suggestion in virgin s press release for original sin that in steinman s songs dead come to life and living are doomed to die this is particularly evident when dead characters seem to be resurrected in memories of main vocalist although in case of celine dion s video theme is less about living being doomed and more about a lost love inspiration influenced by emily bronte s novel wuthering heights steinman compared song to heathcliff digging up cathy s corpse and dancing with it in cold moonlight in jim steinman opens pandora s box promotional video he says that novel is always made much too polite it always has been in movies this isn t wuthering heights of kate bush that little fanciful wuthering heights scene they always cut out is scene when heathcliff digs up catherine s body and dances in moonlight and on beach with it i think you can t get much more operatic or passionate than that i was trying to write a song about dead things coming to life i was trying to write a song about being enslaved and obsessed by love not just enchanted and happy with it it was about dark side of love about ability to be resurrected by it i just tried to put everything i could into it and i m real proud of it in another interview steinman expands on his comments about song being about dark side of love it s about obsession and that can be scary because you re not in control and you don t know where it s going to stop it says that at any point in somebody s life when they loved somebody strongly enough and that person returns a certain touch a certain physical gesture can turn them from being defiant and disgusted with this person to being subservient again and it s not just a pleasurable feeling that comes back it s complete terror and loss of control that comes back and i think that s ultimately a great weapon website allmusic called song a tormented ballad about romantic loss and regret built on a spooky yet heart wrenching piano melody torment is present in song s opening there were nights when wind was so cold from which singer recovers i finished crying in instant that you left and i banished every memory you and i had ever made however defiance in verses are replaced by return of subservient feelings in chorus when you touch me like this and you hold me like that this juxtaposition continues throughout song there were those empty threats and hollow lies and whenever you tried to hurt me i just hurt you even worse and so much deeper eroticism is implied in lines there were nights of endless pleasure and flesh and fantasies all coming back to me song ends with a passionate quiet reprise of chorus critics have also identified wagner of whom steinman is an admirer as an inspiration specifying this song sunday times said theme of wagner s opera tristan and isolde with its extreme passions and obsessive love informs all his best work a 2007 article in toronto star claims that song was written as steinman s tryout as lyricist for andrew lloyd webber s sunset boulevard pandora s box in 1989 steinman produced a concept album original sin with an all female group called pandora s box album featured many tracks that would later be recorded by other artists particularly meat loaf elaine caswell was lead vocalist for it s all coming back to me now who apparently collapsed five times during its recording caswell has since performed song as part of dream engine at joe s pub in new york city for track roy bittan performed on grand piano with

song was always meant to be a duet it was recorded as a duet by meat loaf and marion raven for album bat out of hell iii monster is loose produced by desmond child raven had been working on her solo album with child and was chosen because timbre of her voice starkly contrasts to meat loaf s in promotional interviews meat loaf said that i believe that version that marion raven and myself did on this album is definitive version meat loaf cried when he first heard song which is only time that s happened he has also said that song could refer to steinman and himself with an array of emotions coming back every time they work together referring to lines like when i kiss you like that he said that although i love jim steinman he wouldn t french kiss him to me it wasn t a song about romance it was about me and jim steinman we d had a load of problems with managers in early 80s and all of a sudden after five years we started to communicate after i d been to his house he sent me song and it was it s all coming back to me now not line when you kiss me like that but emotional connection it doesn t have to be literal p r brown directed this video which premiered on vh1 classic on 8 august 2006 there are similarities between video for meat loaf s version of song and that video for that of celine dion with meat loaf being haunted by memory of his lover it is structured differently however with story being told through flashback shots when raven s character is alive have a distinct yellow tint with a darker blue tint for those after her death whereas motorcyclist dies before first verse in dion version raven s crash and resulting death is not shown until final chorus meat loaf becomes angry with raven because ghost of raven s former lover appears at a masquerade ball they are attending some reviewers have compared this to stanley kubrick film eyes wide shut left thumb 300px meat loaf s character mourning that of marion raven in 2006 video directed by p r brown this version of song replaces word nights with lights in line there were nights of endless pleasure ending of single version is different concluding with an additional we forgive and forget and it s all
