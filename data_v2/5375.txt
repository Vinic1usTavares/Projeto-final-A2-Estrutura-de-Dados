calamity development thumb upright director amir rao at march 2012 game developers conference alt a man wearing a teal hoodie looking to left he is seated at a table behind a microphone and water bottles bastion was created by a team of seven people who composed studio supergiant games it was company s first game game was directed by amir rao and greg kasavin wrote game s narration which was spoken by logan cunningham jen zee was artist gavin simon developed gameplay andrew wang helped develop game and darren korb handled sound effects and music co founders of supergiant games rao and simon previously worked for electronic arts where they helped develop command conquer 3 and red alert 3 they left to form studio because they wanted development speed and ability to try new ideas that would be possible with a smaller team development began on game in september 2009 team created game over almost two years and funded development themselves most of team built game in a house in san jose though music and voice acting were recorded in new york city some of san jose designers including writer did not meet rucks voice actor in person until near release of game team spent first nine months of development prototyping various ideas before settling on game s design thumb upright left composer darren korb at march 2012 game developers conference alt a man wearing a blue shirt and grey sweater looking to left he is standing behind a podium original idea was based around premise of creating a town like those found in a role playing game team chose design elements of a fractured floating world due to their wish to portray a sky in game which is usually not possible with an isometric camera as it always points down they also wanted to forgo a map system and felt that having ground come up to kid allowed player to easily see without a map where they had already been in a level story of calamity was created as a way to explain this game mechanic jen zee developed art style of game to express beauty in a post apocalyptic landscape hand painted style was intended to soften sharpness she saw as typical in isometric games and colorless harsh depictions of most devastated landscapes zee was inspired by pixel art landscapes of earlier japanese isometric games narrator was added early in game s development as a way to provide background details and depth to world without requiring player to read long strings of text or wait through cutscenes to avoid slowing pace of action oriented gameplay team had narrator mainly speak in short evocative phrases with long pauses between speaking parts narrator is intended to feel like an old acquaintance to player a connection built by his commentary on player s actions as they happen both major and minor kasavin sought to make game feel as if it were player s story rather than just a story being watched development of bastion was chronicled in monthly building bastion video series from october 2010 to may 2011 in which supergiant games collaborated with kasavin s former gamespot co workers at giant bomb videos showed early game concepts in addition to process of building final game as well as interviews with team supergiant games showed an early unplayable version of game at march 2010 game developers conference to little acclaim they debuted a playable version of game at september 2010 penny arcade expo where

game that korb had scored prior to it he had worked on a few smaller television shows and movies he was brought onto team in beginning stages of project and several of pieces he developed were created prior to final design of levels with which they were associated musical style of soundtrack has been described by korb as acoustic frontier trip hop it was intended to evoke both american frontier and an exotic fantasy world songs combine heavily sampled beats in layers along with acoustic elements and he determined that he wanted to create soundtrack in that style as it was different from video game soundtracks that he had heard before music was recorded in korb s closet at his new york city apartment as were sound effects and more than three thousand lines of narration by cunningham in addition to composing music korb wrote all lyrics for soundtrack soundtrack features four vocal themes build that wall what s left undone mother i m here and setting sail coming home build that wall
