director and scriptwriter he made his debut as a director during world war ii with popular action film sanshiro sugata a k a judo saga after war critically acclaimed drunken angel 1948 in which kurosawa cast then unknown actor toshiro mifune in a starring role cemented director s reputation as one of most important young filmmakers in japan two men would go on to collaborate on another 15 films rashomon which premiered in tokyo became surprise winner of golden lion at 1951 venice film festival commercial and critical success of that film opened up western film markets for first time to products of japanese film industry which in turn led to international recognition for other japanese filmmakers kurosawa directed approximately one film per year throughout 1950s and early 1960s including a number of highly regarded and often adapted films such as ikiru 1952 seven samurai 1954 and yojimbo 1961 after 1960s he became much less prolific even so his later work including his final

century in arts literature and culture category by asianweek magazine and cnn cited there as being among five people who most prominently contributed to improvement of asia in 20th century his career has been honored by many retrospectives critical studies and biographies in both print and video and by releases in many consumer media formats biography childhood to war years 1910 45 childhood and youth 1910 35 kurosawa was born on march 23 1910 in in omori district of tokyo his father isamu 1864 1948 a member of a samurai family from akita prefecture worked as director of army s physical education institute s lower secondary school while his mother shima 1870 1952 came from a merchant s family living in osaka akira was eighth and youngest child of moderately wealthy family with two of his siblings already grown up at time of his birth and one deceased leaving kurosawa to grow up with three sisters and a brother in addition to promoting physical exercise isamu kurosawa was open to western traditions and considered theater and motion pictures to have educational merit he encouraged his children to watch films young akira viewed his first movies at age of six an important formative influence was his elementary school teacher mr tachikawa whose progressive educational practices ignited in his young pupil first a love of drawing and then an interest in education in general during this time boy also studied calligraphy and kendo swordsmanship another major childhood influence was heigo kurosawa akira s older brother by four years in aftermath of great kanto earthquake of 1923 which devastated tokyo heigo took 13 year old akira to view devastation when younger brother wanted to look away from human corpses and animal carcasses scattered everywhere heigo forbade him to do so encouraging akira instead to face his fears by confronting them directly some commentators have suggested that this incident would influence kurosawa s later artistic career as director was seldom hesitant to confront unpleasant truths in his work heigo was academically gifted but soon after failing to secure a place in tokyo s foremost high school he began to detach himself from rest of family preferring to concentrate on his interest in foreign literature in late 1920s heigo became a silent film narrator for tokyo theaters showing foreign films and quickly made a name for himself akira who at this point planned to become a painter moved in with him and two brothers became inseparable with heigo s guidance akira devoured not only films but also theater and circus performances while exhibiting his paintings and working for left wing proletarian artists league however he was never able to make a living with his art and as he began to perceive most of proletarian movement as putting unfulfilled political ideals directly onto canvas he lost his enthusiasm for painting with increasing production of talking pictures in early 1930s film narrators like heigo began to lose work and akira moved back in with his parents in july 1933 heigo committed suicide kurosawa has commented on lasting sense of loss he felt at his brother s death and chapter of his autobiography something like an autobiography that describes it written nearly half a century after event is titled a story i don t want to tell only four months later kurosawa s eldest brother also died leaving akira at age 23 only one of kurosawa brothers still living together with his three surviving sisters director in training 1935 41 thumb kajiro yamamoto was kurosawa s mentor kurosawa was assistant director for over a dozen of yamamoto s films in 1935 new film studio photo chemical laboratories known as p c l which later became major studio toho advertised for assistant directors although he had demonstrated no previous interest in film as a profession kurosawa submitted required essay which asked applicants to discuss fundamental deficiencies of japanese films and find ways to overcome them his half mocking view was that if deficiencies were fundamental there was no way to correct them kurosawa s essay earned him a call to take follow up exams and director kajiro yamamoto who was among examiners took a liking to kurosawa and insisted that studio hire him 25 year old kurosawa joined p c l in february 1936 during his five years as an assistant director kurosawa worked under numerous directors but by far most important figure in his development was yamamoto of his 24 films as a d he worked on 17 under yamamoto many of them comedies featuring popular actor ken ichi enomoto known as enoken yamamoto nurtured kurosawa s talent promoting him directly from third assistant director to chief assistant director after a year kurosawa s responsibilities increased and he worked at tasks ranging from stage construction and film development to location scouting script polishing rehearsals lighting dubbing editing and second unit directing in last of kurosawa s films as an assistant director for yamamoto horse uma 1941 kurosawa took over most of production as his mentor was occupied with shooting of another film one important piece of advice yamamoto gave kurosawa was that a good director needed to master screenwriting kurosawa soon realized that potential earnings from his scripts were much higher than what he was paid as an assistant director kurosawa would later write or co write all of his own films he also frequently wrote screenplays for other directors such as for film director yamamoto s film a triumph of wings tsubasa no 1942 this outside scriptwriting would serve kurosawa as a lucrative sideline lasting well into 1960s long after he became world famous wartime films and marriage 1942 45 in two years following release of horse in 1941 kurosawa searched for a story he could use to launch his directing career towards end of 1942 about a year after japanese attack on pearl harbor novelist tsuneo tomita published his musashi miyamoto inspired judo novel sanshiro sugata advertisements for which intrigued kurosawa he bought book on its publication day devoured it in one sitting and immediately asked toho to secure film rights kurosawa s initial instinct proved correct as within a few days three other major japanese studios also offered to buy rights toho prevailed and kurosawa began pre production on his debut work as director left thumb yukiko played female lead in sanshiro sugata who would win heart of sanshiro in kurosawa s early film contemporaneous photograph from 1937 shooting of sanshiro sugata began on location in yokohama in december 1942 production proceeded smoothly but getting completed film past censors was an entirely different matter censorship office considered work to be british american by standards of wartime japan and it was only through intervention of director yasujiro ozu who championed film that sanshiro sugata was finally accepted for release on march 25 1943 kurosawa had just turned 33 movie became both a critical and commercial success nevertheless censorship office would later decide to cut out some 18 minutes of footage much of which is now considered lost he next turned to subject of wartime female factory workers in most beautiful a propaganda film which he shot in a semi documentary style in early 1944 in order to coax realistic performances from his actresses director had them live in a real factory during shoot eat factory food and call each other by their character names he would use similar methods with his performers throughout his career during production actress playing leader of factory workers yoko yaguchi was chosen by her colleagues to present their demands to director she and kurosawa were constantly at loggerheads and it was through these arguments that two paradoxically became close they married on may 21 1945 with yaguchi two months pregnant she never resumed her acting career and couple would remain together until her death in 1985 they had two children both surviving kurosawa a son hisao born december 20 1945 who served as producer on some of his father s last projects and kazuko a daughter born april 29 1954 who became a costume designer shortly before his marriage kurosawa was pressured by studio against his will to direct a sequel to his debut film often blatantly propagandistic sanshiro sugata part ii which premiered in may 1945 is generally considered one of his weakest pictures kurosawa decided to write script for a film that would be both censor friendly and less expensive to produce men who tread on tiger s tail based on kabuki play and starring comedian enoken with whom kurosawa had often worked during his assistant director days was completed in september 1945 by this time japan had surrendered and occupation of japan had begun new american censors interpreted values allegedly promoted in picture as overly feudal and banned work it was not released until 1952 year another kurosawa film ikiru was also released ironically while in production film had already been savaged by japanese wartime censors as too western and democratic they particularly disliked comic porter played by enoken so movie most probably would not have seen light of day even if war had continued beyond its completion early postwar years to red beard 1946 65 first postwar works 1946 50 after war kurosawa influenced by democratic ideals of occupation sought to make films that would establish a new respect towards individual and self first such film no regrets for our youth 1946 inspired by both 1933 incident and ozaki wartime spy case criticized japan s prewar regime for its political oppression atypically for director heroic central character is a woman yukie setsuko hara who born into upper middle class privilege comes to question her values in a time of political crisis original script had to be extensively rewritten and because of its controversial theme and because protagonist was a woman completed work divided critics but it nevertheless managed to win approval of audiences who turned variations on film s title into a postwar catchphrase his next film one wonderful sunday premiered in july 1947 to mixed reviews it is a relatively uncomplicated and sentimental love story dealing with an impoverished postwar couple trying to enjoy within devastation of postwar tokyo their one weekly day off movie bears influence of frank capra d w griffith and f w murnau each of whom was among kurosawa s favorite directors another film released in 1947 with kurosawa s involvement was action adventure thriller snow trail directed by senkichi taniguchi from kurosawa s screenplay it marked debut of intense young actor toshiro mifune it was kurosawa who with his mentor yamamoto had intervened to persuade toho to sign mifune during an audition in which young man greatly impressed kurosawa but managed to alienate most of other judges thumb takashi shimura played dedicated doctor helping ailing mifune who portrayed critically ill gangster in drunken angel shimura was also to star in kurosawa s films seven samurai ikiru and rashomon alt publicity still of shimura cleanly shaven drunken angel is often considered director s first major work although script like all of kurosawa s occupation era works had to go through forced rewrites due to american censorship kurosawa felt that this was first film in which he was able to express himself freely a realistic story of a doctor who tries to save a gangster yakuza with tuberculosis it was also director s first film with toshiro mifune who would proceed to play either main or a major character in all but one ikiru of director s next 16 films while mifune was not cast as protagonist in drunken angel his explosive performance as gangster so dominates drama that he shifted focus from title character alcoholic doctor played by takashi shimura who had already appeared in several kurosawa movies however kurosawa did not want to smother young actor s immense vitality and mifune s rebellious character electrified audiences in much way that marlon brando s defiant stance would startle american film audiences a few years later film premiered in tokyo in april 1948 to rave reviews and was chosen by prestigious kinema junpo critics poll as best film of its year first of three kurosawa movies to be so honored kurosawa with producer sojiro motoki and fellow directors and friends kajiro yamamoto mikio naruse and senkichi taniguchi formed a new independent production unit called film art association kyokai for this organization s debut work and first film for daiei studios kurosawa turned to a contemporary play by kazuo kikuta and together with taniguchi adapted it for screen quiet duel starred toshiro mifune as an idealistic young doctor struggling with syphilis a deliberate attempt by kurosawa to break actor away from being typecast as gangsters released in march 1949 it was a box office success but is generally considered one of director s lesser achievements his second film of 1949 also produced by film art association and released by shintoho was stray dog it is a detective movie perhaps first important japanese film in that genre that explores mood of japan during its painful postwar recovery through story of a young detective played by mifune and his fixation on recovery of his handgun which was stolen by a penniless war veteran who proceeds to use it to rob and murder adapted from an unpublished novel by kurosawa in style of a favorite writer of his georges simenon it was director s first collaboration with screenwriter ryuzo kikushima who would later help to script eight other kurosawa films a famous virtually wordless sequence lasting over eight minutes shows detective disguised as an impoverished veteran wandering streets in search of gun thief it employed actual documentary footage of war ravaged tokyo neighborhoods shot by kurosawa s friend ishiro honda future director of godzilla film is considered a precursor to contemporary police procedural and buddy cop film genres scandal released by shochiku in april 1950 was inspired by director s personal experiences with and anger towards japanese yellow journalism work is an ambitious mixture of courtroom drama and social problem film about free speech and personal responsibility but even kurosawa regarded finished product as dramatically unfocused and unsatisfactory and almost all critics agree however it would be kurosawa s second film of 1950 rashomon that would ultimately win him and japanese cinema a whole new international audience international recognition 1950 58 after finishing scandal kurosawa was approached by daiei studios which asked director to make another film for them kurosawa picked a script by an aspiring young screenwriter shinobu hashimoto who would eventually work on nine of his films their first joint effort was based on ryunosuke akutagawa s experimental short story in a grove which recounts murder of a samurai and rape of his wife from various different and conflicting points of view kurosawa saw potential in script and with hashimoto s help polished and expanded it and then pitched it to daiei who were happy to accept project due to its low budget shooting of rashomon began on july 7 1950 and after extensive location work in primeval forest of nara wrapped on august 17 just one week was spent in hurried post production hampered by a studio fire and finished film premiered at tokyo s imperial theatre on august 25 expanding nationwide following day movie was met by lukewarm reviews with many critics puzzled by its unique theme and treatment but it was nevertheless a moderate financial success for daiei thumb upright left kurosawa s favorite author was dostoyevsky who wrote idiot which kurosawa adapted into a japanese film version in 1951 vasily portrait from 19th century kurosawa s next film for shochiku was idiot an adaptation of novel by director s favorite writer fyodor dostoyevsky filmmaker relocated story from russia to hokkaido but it is otherwise very faithful to original a fact seen by many critics as detrimental to work a studio mandated edit shortened it from kurosawa s original cut of 265 minutes nearly four and a half hours to just 166 minutes making resulting narrative exceedingly difficult to follow severely edited film version is widely considered today to be one of director s least successful works and original full length version no longer exists contemporary reviews of much shortened edited version were very negative but film was a moderate success at box office largely because of popularity of one of its stars setsuko hara meanwhile unbeknownst to kurosawa rashomon had been entered in prestigious venice film festival due to efforts of giuliana a japan based representative of an italian film company who had seen and admired movie and convinced daiei to submit it on september 10 1951 rashomon was awarded festival s highest prize golden lion shocking not only daiei but international film world which at time was largely unaware of japan s decades old cinematic tradition after daiei very briefly exhibited a subtitled print of film in los angeles rko purchased distribution rights to rashomon in united states company was taking a considerable gamble it had put out only one prior subtitled film in american market and only previous japanese talkie commercially released in new york had been mikio naruse s comedy wife be like a rose in 1937 a critical and box office flop however commercial run greatly helped by strong reviews from critics and even columnist ed sullivan was very successful it earned 35 000 in its first three weeks at a single new york theater an almost unheard of sum at time this success in turn led to a vogue in america and west for japanese movies throughout 1950s replacing enthusiasm for italian neorealist cinema for example by end of 1952 rashomon was released in japan united states and most of europe among japanese filmmakers whose work as a result began to win festival prizes and commercial release in west were kenji mizoguchi life of sansho bailiff and somewhat later yasujiro ozu tokyo story an autumn afternoon artists highly respected in japan but prior to this period almost totally unknown in west kurosawa s growing reputation among western audiences in 1950s would make western audiences more sympathetic to reception of later generations of japanese filmmakers ranging from kon ichikawa masaki kobayashi nagisa oshima and shohei imamura to juzo itami takeshi kitano and takashi miike his career boosted by his sudden international fame kurosawa now reunited with his original film studio toho which would go on to produce his next 11 films set to work on his next project ikiru movie stars takashi shimura as a cancer ridden tokyo bureaucrat watanabe on a final quest for meaning before his death for screenplay kurosawa brought in hashimoto as well as writer hideo oguni who would go on to co write 12 kurosawa films despite work s grim subject matter screenwriters took a satirical approach which some have compared to work of brecht to both bureaucratic world of its hero and u s cultural colonization of japan american pop songs figure prominently in film because of this strategy filmmakers are usually credited with saving picture from kind of sentimentality common to dramas about characters with terminal illnesses ikiru opened in october 1952 to rave reviews it won kurosawa his second kinema junpo best film award and enormous box office success it remains most acclaimed of all artist s films set in modern era in december 1952 kurosawa took his ikiru screenwriters shinobu hashimoto and hideo oguni for a forty five day secluded residence at an inn to create screenplay for his next movie seven samurai ensemble work was kurosawa s first proper samurai film genre for which he would become most famous simple story about a poor farming village in sengoku period japan that hires a group of samurai to defend it against an impending attack by bandits was given a full epic treatment with a huge cast largely consisting of veterans of previous kurosawa productions and meticulously detailed action stretching out to almost three and a half hours of screen time three months were spent in pre production and a month in rehearsals shooting took up 148 days spread over almost a year interrupted by production and financing troubles and kurosawa s health problems film finally opened in april 1954 half a year behind its original release date and about three times over budget making it at time most expensive japanese film ever made however by hollywood standards it was a quite modestly budgeted production even for that time film received positive critical reaction and became a big hit quickly making back money invested in it and providing studio with a product that they could and did market internationally though with extensive edits over time and with theatrical and home video releases of uncut version its reputation has steadily grown it is now regarded by some commentators as greatest japanese film ever made and in 1979 a poll of japanese film critics also voted it best japanese film ever made in most recent 2012 version of widely respected british film institute bfi sight sound greatest films of all time poll seven samurai placed 17th among all films from all countries in both critics and directors polls receiving a place in top ten lists of 48 critics and 22 directors in 1954 nuclear tests in pacific were causing radioactive rainstorms in japan and one particular incident in march had exposed a japanese fishing boat to nuclear fallout with disastrous results it is in this anxious atmosphere that kurosawa s next film record of a living being was conceived story concerned an elderly factory owner toshiro mifune so terrified of prospect of a nuclear attack that he becomes determined to move his entire extended family both legal and extra marital to what he imagines is safety of a farm in brazil production went much more smoothly than director s previous film but a few days before shooting ended kurosawa s composer collaborator and close friend fumio hayasaka died of tuberculosis at age of 41 film s score was finished by hayasaka s student masaru sato who would go on to score all of kurosawa s next eight films record of a living being opened in november 1955 to mixed reviews and muted audience reaction becoming first kurosawa film to lose money during its original theatrical run today it is considered by many to be among finest films dealing with psychological effects of global nuclear stalemate kurosawa s next project throne of blood an adaptation of william shakespeare s macbeth set like seven samurai in sengoku era represented an ambitious transposition of english work into a japanese context kurosawa instructed his leading actress isuzu yamada to regard work as if it were a cinematic version of a japanese rather than a european literary classic given kurosawa s appreciation of traditional japanese stage acting acting of players particularly yamada draws heavily on stylized techniques of noh theater it was filmed in 1956 and released in january 1957 to a slightly less negative domestic response than had been case with director s previous film abroad throne of blood regardless of liberties it takes with its source material quickly earned a place among most celebrated shakespeare adaptations another adaptation of a classic european theatrical work followed almost immediately with production of lower depths based on a play by maxim gorky taking place in may and june 1957 in contrast to shakespearean sweep of throne of blood lower depths was shot on only two confined sets in order to emphasize restricted nature of characters lives though faithful to play this adaptation of russian material to a completely japanese setting in this case late edo period unlike his earlier idiot was regarded as artistically successful film premiered in september 1957 receiving a mixed response similar to that of throne of blood however some critics rank it among director s most underrated works kurosawa s three consecutive movies after seven samurai had not managed to capture japanese audiences in way that that film had mood of director s work had been growing increasingly pessimistic and dark with possibility of redemption through personal responsibility now very much questioned particularly in throne of blood and lower depths he recognized this and deliberately aimed for a more light hearted and entertaining film for his next production while switching to new widescreen format that had been gaining popularity in japan resulting film hidden fortress is an action adventure comedy drama about a medieval princess her loyal general and two peasants who all need to travel through enemy lines in order to reach their home region released in december 1958 hidden fortress became an enormous box office success in japan and was warmly received by critics both in japan and abroad today film is considered one of kurosawa s most lightweight efforts though it remains popular not least because it is one of several major influences on george lucas s 1977 space opera star wars birth of a company and red beard 1959 65 starting with rashomon kurosawa s productions had become increasingly large in scope and so had director s budgets toho concerned about this development suggested that he might help finance his own works therefore making studio s potential losses smaller while in turn allowing himself more artistic freedom as co producer kurosawa agreed and kurosawa production company was established in april 1959 with toho as majority shareholder despite risking his own money kurosawa chose a story that was more directly critical of japanese business and political elites than any previous work bad sleep well based on a script by kurosawa s nephew mike inoue is a revenge drama about a young man who is able to infiltrate hierarchy of a corrupt japanese company with intention of exposing men responsible for his father s death its theme proved topical while film was in production mass demonstrations were held against new u s japan security treaty which was seen by many japanese particularly young as threatening country s democracy by giving too much power to corporations and politicians film opened in september 1960 to positive critical reaction and modest box office success 25 minute opening sequence depicting a corporate wedding reception is widely regarded as one of kurosawa s most skillfully executed set pieces but remainder of film is often perceived as disappointing by comparison movie has also been criticized for employing conventional hero to combat a social evil that cannot be resolved through actions of individuals however courageous or cunning yojimbo bodyguard kurosawa production s second film centers on a masterless samurai sanjuro who strolls into a 19th century town ruled by two opposing violent factions and provokes them into destroying each other director used this work to play with many genre conventions particularly western while at same time offering an unprecedentedly for japanese screen graphic portrayal of violence some commentators have seen sanjuro character in this film as a fantasy figure who magically reverses historical triumph of corrupt merchant class over samurai class featuring tatsuya nakadai in his first major role in a kurosawa movie and with innovative photography by kazuo miyagawa who shot rashomon and takao saito film premiered in april 1961 and was a critically and commercially successful venture earning more than any previous kurosawa film movie and its blackly comic tone were also widely imitated abroad sergio leone s a fistful of dollars was a virtual unauthorized scene by scene remake with toho filing a lawsuit on kurosawa s behalf and prevailing thumb upright right kurosawa based his 1963 crime film high and low on american author ed mcbain s novel king s ransom image of ed mcbain c 2001 following success of yojimbo kurosawa found himself under pressure from toho to create a sequel kurosawa turned to a script he had written before yojimbo reworking it to include hero of his previous film sanjuro was first of three kurosawa films to be adapted from work of writer shugoro yamamoto others would be red beard and dodeskaden it is lighter in tone and closer to a conventional period film than yojimbo though its story of a power struggle within a samurai clan is portrayed with strongly comic undertones film opened on january 1 1962 quickly surpassing box office success and garnering positive reviews kurosawa had meanwhile instructed toho to purchase film rights to king s ransom a novel about a kidnapping written by american author and screenwriter evan hunter under his pseudonym of ed mcbain as one of his 87th precinct series of crime books director intended to create a work condemning kidnapping which he considered one of very worst crimes suspense film titled high and low was shot during latter half of 1962 and released in march 1963 it broke kurosawa s box office record third film in a row to do so became highest grossing japanese film of year and won glowing reviews however his triumph was somewhat tarnished when ironically film was blamed for a wave of kidnappings which occurred in japan about this time he himself received kidnapping threats directed at his young daughter kazuko high and low is considered by many commentators to be among director s strongest works kurosawa quickly moved on to his next project red beard based on a short story collection by shugoro yamamoto and incorporating elements from dostoyevsky s novel insulted and injured it is a period film set in a mid nineteenth century clinic for poor in which kurosawa s humanist themes receive perhaps their fullest statement a conceited and materialistic foreign trained young doctor yasumoto is forced to become an intern at clinic under stern tutelage of doctor known as red beard played by mifune although he resists red beard initially yasumoto comes to admire his wisdom and courage and to perceive patients at clinic whom he at first despised as worthy of compassion and dignity yuzo who plays yasumoto was an extremely popular film and music star at time particularly for his young guy series of musical comedies so signing him to appear in film virtually guaranteed kurosawa strong box office shoot filmmaker s longest ever lasted well over a year after five months of pre production and wrapped in spring 1965 leaving director his crew and his actors exhausted red beard premiered in april 1965 becoming year s highest grossing japanese production and third and last kurosawa film to top prestigious kinema yearly critics poll it remains one of kurosawa s best known and most loved works in his native country outside japan critics have been much more divided most commentators concede its technical merits and some praise it as among kurosawa s best while others insist that it lacks complexity and genuine narrative power with still others claiming that it represents a retreat from artist s previous commitment to social and political change film marked something of an end of an era for its creator director himself recognized this at time of its release telling critic donald richie that a cycle of some kind had just come to an end and that his future films and production methods would be different his prediction proved quite accurate beginning in late 1950s television began increasingly to dominate leisure time of formerly large and loyal japanese cinema audience and as film company revenues dropped so did their appetite for risk particularly risk represented by kurosawa s costly production methods red beard also marked midway point chronologically in artist s career during his previous twenty nine years in film industry which includes his five years as assistant director he had directed twenty three films while during remaining twenty eight years for many and complex reasons he would complete only seven more also for reasons never adequately explained red beard would be his final film starring toshiro mifune yu an actor who worked on lower depths observed regarding closeness of two men on set mr kurosawa s heart was in mr mifune s body donald richie has described rapport between them as a unique symbiosis hollywood ambitions to last films 1966 98 hollywood detour 1966 68 when kurosawa s exclusive contract with toho came to an end in 1966 56 year old director was seriously contemplating change observing troubled state of domestic film industry and having already received dozens of offers from abroad idea of working outside japan appealed to him as never before for his first foreign project kurosawa chose a story based on a life magazine article embassy pictures action thriller to be filmed in english and called simply runaway train would have been his first in color but language barrier proved a major problem and english version of screenplay was not even finished by time filming was to begin in autumn 1966 shoot which required snow was moved to autumn 1967 then canceled in 1968 almost two decades later another foreign director working in hollywood andrei konchalovsky finally made runaway train 1985 though from a new script loosely based on kurosawa s director meanwhile had become involved in a much more ambitious hollywood project tora tora tora produced by 20th century fox and kurosawa production would be a portrayal of japanese attack on pearl harbor from both american and japanese points of view with kurosawa helming japanese half and an english speaking filmmaker directing american half he spent several months working on script with ryuzo kikushima and hideo oguni but very soon project began to unravel director of american sequences turned out not to be david lean as originally planned but american richard fleischer budget was also cut and screen time allocated for japanese segment would now be no longer than 90 minutes a major problem considering that kurosawa s script ran over four hours after numerous revisions with direct involvement of darryl zanuck a more or less finalized cut screenplay was agreed upon in may 1968 shooting began in early december but kurosawa would last only a little over three weeks as director he struggled to work with an unfamiliar crew and requirements of a hollywood production while his working methods puzzled his american producers who ultimately concluded that director must be mentally ill kurosawa was examined at kyoto university hospital by a dr murakami whose diagnosis was forwarded to darryl zanuck and richard zanuck at fox studios indicating a diagnosis of neurasthenia stating that he is suffering from disturbance of sleep agitated with feelings of anxiety and in manic excitement caused by above mentioned illness it is necessary for him to have rest and medical treatment for more than two months hiroshi all emperor s men hardcover 337 pp publisher applause 1 edition 2012 p 255 on christmas eve 1968 americans announced that kurosawa had left production due to fatigue effectively firing him he was ultimately replaced for film s japanese sequences with two directors and toshio masuda tora tora tora finally released to unenthusiastic reviews in september 1970 was as donald richie put it an almost unmitigated tragedy in kurosawa s career he had spent years of his life on a logistically nightmarish project to which he ultimately did not contribute a foot of film shot by himself he had his name removed from credits though script used for japanese half was still his and his co writers he became estranged from his longtime collaborator writer ryuzo kikushima and never worked with him again project had inadvertently exposed corruption in his own production company a situation reminiscent of his own movie bad sleep well his very sanity had been called into question worst of all japanese film industry and perhaps man himself began to suspect that he would never make another film a difficult decade 1969 77 knowing that his reputation was at stake following much publicised tora tora tora debacle kurosawa moved quickly to a new project to prove he was still viable to his aid came friends and famed directors keisuke kinoshita masaki kobayashi and kon ichikawa who together with kurosawa established in july 1969 a production company called club of four knights yonki no kai although plan was for four directors to create a film each it has been suggested that real motivation for other three directors was to make it easier for kurosawa to successfully complete a film and therefore find his way back into business first project proposed and worked on was a period film to be called dora heita but when this was deemed too expensive attention shifted to dodesukaden an adaptation of yet another shugoro yamamoto work again about poor and destitute film was shot quickly by kurosawa s standards in about nine weeks with kurosawa determined to show he was still capable of working quickly and efficiently within a limited budget for his first work in color dynamic editing and complex compositions of his earlier pictures were set aside with artist focusing on creation of a bold almost surreal palette of primary colors in order to reveal toxic environment in which characters live it was released in japan in october 1970 but though a minor critical success it was greeted with audience indifference picture lost money and caused club of four knights to dissolve initial reception abroad was somewhat more favorable but dodesukaden has since been typically considered an interesting experiment not comparable to director s best work unable to secure funding for further work and allegedly suffering from health problems kurosawa apparently reached breaking point on december 22 1971 he slit his wrists and throat multiple times suicide attempt proved unsuccessful and director s health recovered fairly quickly with kurosawa now taking refuge in domestic life uncertain if he would ever direct another film in early 1973 soviet studio approached filmmaker to ask if he would be interested in working with them kurosawa proposed an adaptation of russian explorer vladimir s autobiographical work dersu uzala book about a hunter who lives in harmony with nature until destroyed by encroaching civilization was one that he had wanted to make since 1930s in december 1973 63 year old kurosawa set off for soviet union with four of his closest aides beginning a year and a half stay in country shooting began in may 1974 in siberia with filming in exceedingly harsh natural conditions proving very difficult and demanding picture wrapped in april 1975 with a thoroughly exhausted and homesick kurosawa returning to japan and his family in june dersu uzala had its world premiere in japan on august 2 1975 and did well at box office while critical reception in japan was muted film was better reviewed abroad winning golden prize at 9th moscow international film festival as well as an academy award for best foreign language film today critics remain divided over film some see it as an example of kurosawa s alleged artistic decline while others count it among his finest works although proposals for television projects were submitted to him he had no interest in working outside film world nevertheless hard drinking director did agree to appear in a series of television ads for suntory whiskey which aired in 1976 while fearing that he might never be able to make another film director nevertheless continued working on various projects writing scripts and creating detailed illustrations intending to leave behind a visual record of his plans in case he would never be able to film his stories two epics 1978 86 in 1977 american director george lucas released star wars a wildly successful science fiction film influenced by kurosawa s hidden fortress among other works lucas like many other new hollywood directors revered kurosawa and considered him a role model and was shocked to discover that japanese filmmaker was unable to secure financing for any new work two met in san francisco in july 1978 to discuss project kurosawa considered most financially viable kagemusha epic story of a thief hired as double of a medieval japanese lord of a great clan lucas enthralled by screenplay and kurosawa s illustrations leveraged his influence over 20th century fox to coerce studio that had fired kurosawa just ten years earlier to produce kagemusha then recruited fellow fan francis ford coppola as co producer production began following april with kurosawa in high spirits shooting lasted from june 1979 through march 1980 and was plagued with problems not least of which was firing of original lead actor shintaro katsu creator of very popular character due to an incident in which actor insisted against director s wishes on videotaping his own performance he was replaced by tatsuya nakadai in his first of two consecutive leading roles in a kurosawa movie film was completed only a few weeks behind schedule and opened in tokyo in april 1980 it quickly became a massive hit in japan film was also a critical and box office success abroad winning coveted palme d or at 1980 cannes film festival in may though some critics then and now have faulted film for its alleged coldness kurosawa spent much of rest of year in europe and america promoting kagemusha collecting awards and accolades and exhibiting as art drawings he had made to serve as storyboards for film thumb left sidney lumet successfully effected a nomination for kurosawa as best director for his film ran at 58th academy awards which was ultimately won by sidney pollack for out of africa international success of kagemusha allowed kurosawa to proceed with his next project ran another epic in a similar vein script partly based on william shakespeare s king lear depicted a ruthless bloodthirsty daimyo warlord played by tatsuya nakadai who after foolishly banishing his one loyal son surrenders his kingdom to his other two sons who then betray him thus plunging entire kingdom into war as japanese studios still felt wary about producing another film that would rank among most expensive ever made in country international help was again needed this time it came from french producer serge silberman who had produced luis bunuel s final movies filming did not begin until december 1983 and lasted more than a year in january 1985 production of ran was halted as kurosawa s 64 year old wife yoko fell ill she died on february 1 kurosawa returned to finish his film and ran premiered at tokyo film festival on 31 may with a wide release next day film was a moderate financial success in japan but a larger one abroad and as he had done with kagemusha kurosawa embarked on a trip to europe and america where he attended film s premieres in september and october ran won several awards in japan but was not quite as honored there as many of director s best films of 1950s and 1960s had been film world was surprised however when japan passed over selection of ran in favor of another film as its official entry to compete for an oscar nomination in best foreign film category which was ultimately rejected for competition at 58th academy awards both producer and kurosawa himself attributed failure to even submit ran for competition to a misunderstanding because of academy s arcane rules no one was sure whether ran qualified as a japanese film a french film due to its financing or both so it was not submitted at all in response to what at least appeared to be a blatant snub by his own countrymen director sidney lumet led a successful campaign to have kurosawa receive an oscar nomination for best director that year sydney pollack ultimately won award for directing out of africa rans costume designer emi wada won movie s only oscar kagemusha and ran particularly latter are often considered to be among kurosawa s finest works after rans release kurosawa would point to it as his best film a major change of attitude for director who when asked which of his works was his best had always previously answered my next one final works and last years 1987 98 for his next movie kurosawa chose a subject very different from any that he had ever filmed before while some of his previous pictures for example drunken angel and kagemusha had included brief dream sequences dreams was to be entirely based upon director s own dreams significantly for first time in over forty years kurosawa for this deeply personal project wrote screenplay alone although its estimated budget was lower than films immediately preceding it japanese studios were still unwilling to back one of his productions so kurosawa turned to another famous american fan steven spielberg who convinced warner bros to buy international rights to completed film this made it easier for kurosawa s son hisao as co producer and soon to be head of kurosawa production to negotiate a loan in japan that would cover film s production costs shooting took more than eight months to complete and dreams premiered at cannes in may 1990 to a polite but muted reception similar to reaction picture would generate elsewhere in world in 1990 he accepted academy award for lifetime achievement thumb right steven spielberg was instrumental in financing and production of several of kurosawa s final films spielberg at his masterclass at cinematheque francaise in 2012 kurosawa now turned to a more conventional story with rhapsody in august director s first film fully produced in japan since dodeskaden over twenty years before which explored scars of nuclear bombing which destroyed nagasaki at very end of world war ii it was adapted from a murata novel but film s references to nagasaki bombing came from director rather than from book this was his only movie to include a role for an american movie star richard gere who plays a small role as nephew of elderly heroine shooting took place in early 1991 with film opening on 25 may that year to a largely negative critical reaction especially in united states where director was accused of promulgating naively anti american sentiments though kurosawa rejected these accusations kurosawa wasted no time moving onto his next project or not yet based on autobiographical essays by uchida film follows life of a japanese professor of german through second world war and beyond narrative centers on yearly birthday celebrations with his former students during which protagonist declares his unwillingness to die just yet a theme that was becoming increasingly relevant for film s 81 year old creator filming began in february 1992 and wrapped by end of september its release on april 17 1993 was greeted by an even more disappointed reaction than had been case with his two preceding works kurosawa nevertheless continued to work he wrote original screenplays sea is watching in 1993 and after rain in 1995 while putting finishing touches on latter work in 1995 kurosawa slipped and broke base of his spine following accident he would use a wheelchair for rest of his life putting an end to any hopes of him directing another film his longtime wish to die on set while shooting a movie was never to be fulfilled after his accident kurosawa s health began to deteriorate while his mind remained sharp and lively his body was giving up and for last half year of his life director was largely confined to bed listening to music and watching television at home on september 6 1998 kurosawa died of a stroke in setagaya tokyo at age of 88 at time of his death kurosawa had two children his son hisao kurosawa who married hiroko hayashi and his daughter kazuko kurosawa who married kato along with several grandchildren one of his grandchildren actor takayuki kato and grandson by kazuko became a supporting actor in two films posthumously developed from screenplays written by kurosawa which remained unproduced during his own lifetime takashi koizumi s after rain 1999 and kei kumai s sea is watching 2002 style and main themes from beginning kurosawa displayed a bold dynamic style strongly influenced by western cinema yet quite distinct from it kurosawa was extensively involved with every aspect of film production he was also a gifted screenwriter and would usually work in close collaboration with his co writers from beginning of development of a film to ensure a high quality script which he insisted was absolute foundation of a good film he frequently served as editor of his own films and was regarded by his production team as greatest editor in world though it was common in japanese film industry of that time for established directors to assemble around them a team or gumi with people drawn from same pool of creative technicians crew members and actors working from film to film for example director hiroshi inagaki who worked at toho during same period as kurosawa had such a team kurosawa s team known as kurosawa gumi kurosawa group including for example cinematographer nakai production assistant teruyo nogami and actor takashi shimura was remarkable for its loyalty to director and consistent quality of its work kurosawa s style is marked by a number of devices and techniques which kurosawa introduced in his films over decades in his films of 1940s and 1950s kurosawa frequently employs axial cut in which camera moves closer to or further away from subject not through use of tracking shots or dissolves but through a series of matched jump cuts another stylistic trait which scholars have pointed out is kurosawa s tendency to cut on motion that is to edit a sequence of a character or characters in motion so that an action is depicted in two or more separate shots rather than one uninterrupted shot a form of cinematic punctuation very strongly identified with kurosawa is wipe this is an effect created through an optical printer in which when a scene ends a line or bar appears to move across screen wiping away image while simultaneously revealing first image of subsequent scene as a transitional device it is used as a substitute for straight cut or dissolve though kurosawa often used both of those devices as well in his mature work kurosawa employed wipe so frequently that it became a kind of signature for example one blogger has counted no fewer than 12 instances of wipe in drunken angel kurosawa by all accounts always gave great attention to soundtracks of his films especially with an emphasis on sound image counterpoint in which music or sound effects would ironically comment upon image rather than merely reinforcing it teruyo nogami s memoir gives several such examples from drunken angel and stray dog he was also involved with several of japan s outstanding contemporary composers including fumio hayasaka who died in 1955 and internationally famous toru takemitsu kurosawa employed a number of recurring major themes in his films these include a master disciple relationship between a usually older mentor and one or more novices which often involves spiritual as well as technical mastery and self mastery b heroic champion exceptional individual who emerges from mass of people to produce something or right some injustice c depiction of extremes of weather as both dramatic devices and symbols of human passion and d recurrence of cycles of inexorable savage violence within history according to stephen prince latter theme began with throne of blood 1957 and recurred in kurosawa films of 1980s mr prince calls this theme to committed heroic mode of kurosawa s cinema legacy legacy of general criticism since early to mid 1950s a number of critics from french new wave championed films of older japanese master kenji mizoguchi at expense of kurosawa s work new wave critic filmmaker jacques rivette said you can compare only what is comparable and that which aims high enough mizoguchi seems to be only japanese director who is completely japanese and yet is also only one that achieves a true universality that of an individual according to such french commentators mizoguchi seemed of two artists more authentically japanese but at least one film scholar has questioned validity of this dichotomy between japanese mizoguchi and western kurosawa by pointing out that had been at least as much influenced by western cinema and western culture in general as kurosawa had ever been and that this awareness of foreign trends is reflected in his work in japan there have been critics and other filmmakers who have accused kurosawa s work of elitism because of his focus on exceptional heroic individuals and groups of men in her dvd commentary on seven samurai joan mellen maintains that certain shots of samurai characters and kyuzo which as far as she is concerned reveal kurosawa privileging these samurai support argument voiced by several japanese critics that kurosawa was an elitist kurosawa was hardly a progressive director they argued since his peasants could not discover among their own ranks leaders who might rescue village kurosawa defended himself against this charge in his interview with me i wanted to say that after everything peasants were stronger closely clinging to earth it was samurai who were weak because they were being blown by winds of time owing to kurosawa s popularity with european and american audiences from early 1950s onward he did not escape charge of deliberately catering to tastes of westerners to achieve or maintain that popularity joan mellen recording violently negative reaction in 1970s of left wing director nagisa oshima to kurosawa and his work states that kurosawa had brought japanese film to a western audience meant to oshima that he must be pandering to western values and politics kurosawa always strongly denied pandering to western tastes he has never catered to a foreign audience writes audie bock and has condemned those who do reputation among filmmakers many celebrated directors have been influenced by kurosawa and have expressed admiration for his work filmmakers cited below can be presented according to four categories a those who like kurosawa himself established international critical reputations in 1950s and early 1960s b so called new hollywood directors that is american moviemakers who for most part established their reputations in early to mid 1970s c other asian directors and d modern day directors thumb left upright 0 8 a bust of swedish director ingmar bergman located in poland kurosawa was several years bergman s senior and admired him as a fellow craftsman writing him a commemorative letter at his 70th birthday swedish director ingmar bergman called his own film virgin spring touristic a lousy imitation of kurosawa and added at that time my admiration for japanese cinema was at its height i was almost a samurai myself in italy federico fellini in an interview declared director greatest living example of all that an author of cinema should be despite admitting to having seen only one of his films seven samurai in france roman polanski in 1965 cited kurosawa as one of his three favorite filmmakers with fellini and orson welles singling out seven samurai throne of blood and hidden fortress for praise italian director bernardo bertolucci considered japanese master s influence to be seminal kurosawa s movies and la dolce vita of fellini are things that pushed me sucked me into being a film director german new wave director werner herzog has cited kurosawa as one of his greatest influences of filmmakers with whom i feel some kinship griffith bunuel kurosawa and eisenstein s ivan terrible all come to mind when asked to list his favorite directors russian director andrei tarkovsky cited kurosawa as one of his favorites and named seven samurai as one of his ten favorite films according to his personal assistant anthony frewin stanley kubrick thought kurosawa was one of great film directors and followed him closely in fact i cannot think of any other director he spoke so consistently and admiringly about so if kubrick was cast away on a desert island and could only take a few films what would they be my money would be on battle of algiers danton rashomon seven samurai and throne of blood kurosawa s new hollywood admirers have included robert altman francis ford coppola steven spielberg martin scorsese george lucas and john milius in his early years while still a television director robert altman stated that when he first saw rashomon he was so impressed by its cinematographer s achievement of shooting several shots with camera aimed directly at sun allegedly it was first film in which this was done successfully that he claims he was inspired very next day to begin incorporating shots of sun into his television work it was coppola who said of kurosawa one thing that distinguishes him is that he didn t make one masterpiece or two masterpieces he made you know eight masterpieces both spielberg and scorsese have praised older man s role as teacher and role model and scorsese called him his sensei using japanese term spielberg has declared i have learned more from him than from almost any other filmmaker on face of earth while scorsese remarked let me say it simply akira kurosawa was my master and master of so many other filmmakers over years several of these moviemakers were also instrumental in helping kurosawa obtain financing for his late films lucas and coppola served as co producers on kagemusha while spielberg name lent to 1990 production dreams helped bring that picture to fruition as first asian filmmaker to achieve international prominence kurosawa has naturally served as an inspiration for other asian auteurs of rashomon most famous director of india satyajit ray said effect of film on me upon first seeing it in calcutta in 1952 was electric i saw it three times on consecutive days and wondered each time if there was another film anywhere which gave such sustained and dazzling proof of a director s command over every aspect of film making other asian admirers include japanese actor and director takeshi kitano hong kong filmmaker john woo japanese anime director hayao miyazaki and mainland chinese director zhang who called kurosawa quintessential asian director even today kurosawa continues to inspire and influence contemporary filmmakers alexander payne spent early part of his career watching kurosawa s films most notably seven samurai and ikiru guillermo del toro referred to kurosawa one of essential masters citing throne of blood high and low and ran as among his favorite films kathryn bigelow praised kurosawa as one of high impact filmmakers who can create emotionally invested characters j j abrams says he drew from kurosawa while making star wars force awakens at age of 19 alejandro gonzalez inarritu remembers being spellbound when he first saw ikiru and praises kurosawa as one of first storytelling geniuses who began to change narrative structure of films when spike lee posted a list of 87 films every aspiring director should see he included three kurosawa movies rashomon yojimbo and ran posthumous screenplays following kurosawa s death several posthumous works
