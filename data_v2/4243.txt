in a painful and rebuking speech lefeber pp 102 4 according to lefeber tara s lament has been significantly expanded if not added completely over centuries in south indian manuscripts some later interpolations elaborate tara s lament in which tara asks rama to kill her and lead her to vali rama consoles tara saying that she should accept preordained destiny lefeber pp 259 60 rama guarantees her that her rights and those of angada will be protected and that she will enjoy continued comfort rao p 57 he tells her that a wife of a hero should not hold personal sorrow in adhyatma ramayana while tara wails over death of vali rama preaches to her saying that body is ephemeral while only soul is eternal he tells her she should not grieve over decay of vali s body tara questions him asking if body is destructible why does one feel pleasure and pain rama informs her that due to egoism mind is chained in bondage to desires he declares that tara will remain untouched by karma and be emancipated from bondage of life having heard his sermon and because she had been devoted to him in a previous birth tara thus becomes free of egoism and undergoes self realization nath pp 168 9 this discourse of rama also appears in tulsidas s ramacharitamanasa but it is curtailed to just two verses and is possibly borrowed from former text tulsidasa s shri ramacharitamanasa p 523 rama says that body is perishable but soul is immortal and listening to this enlightened tara bows to rama and gains boon of supreme devotion tulsidasa s shri ramacharitamanasa p 516 a ramayana version portrays her

vali aided in funeral rites by tara and sugriva lefeber pp 105 7 marriage to sugriva after vali s death sugriva acquires vali s kingdom as well as tara ramayana does not record any formal marriage or any ritual purification like trial by fire sita had to undergo when she is reacquired by rama from ravana that tara must undertake to marry sugriva or return to vali following his return from dead sharma p 48 lack of description of formal marriage suggests according to some critics that tara s relationship to sugriva is neither widow re marriage nor polyandry but simply appropriation by sugriva guruge p 203 in references of coronation of sugriva as king angada is also described as heir apparent crown prince while tara is mentioned as sugriva s wife adhyatma ramayana declares that sugriva acquires tara nath p 178 while vali s acquisition of ruma elder brother taking his younger sister in law as wife is universally condemned however as in tara s case elder brother s widow marrying her younger brother in law seems to be a social norm sharma considers that rama s silence on marriage of tara and sugriva does not signal non acceptance of act but rather that he is not concerned with issue of sexual relations of loose vanaras in which tara and ruma exchange hands between brothers sharma pp 97 99 101 ramayana mentions that sugriva indulges in sexual pleasures of women including ruma and tara who he coveted lefeber p 115 in ramayana however angada criticizes sugriva for his lustful marriage to his elder sister in law tara who is like a mother to him though a political marriage tara serves sugriva loyally commentaries of ramayana suggest that it would be right for sugriva to marry widowed tara of kataka madhava yogindra says that this was right as they were animals tilaka by bhatt justifies sugriva s marriage to tara since sugriva was her dead husband s brother it further states that tara should remarry as she did not belong to first three castes and was young lefeber p 256 tara s action of taking sugriva as her husband after vali s death is seen as her attempt to secure futures of angada and kingdom in some rare instances like in ramavataram tara does not remarry sugriva treats her as a mother figure and salutes her srinivasan p 159 tara pacifies lakshmana thumb 250px lakshmana arrives as sugriva is enjoying company of tara left rainy season ensues and ends and rama in despair fears that sugriva has forgotten his promise to help him trace and recover sita rama sends lakshmana to kishkindha to remind complacent monarch of his promise to help irritated that city is barricaded lakshmana kicks down city gate and threatens to destroy sugriva and monkey kingdom with his divine power lakshmana is unable to tolerate sugriva breaking his vow to rama enjoying material and sensual pleasures while rama suffers alone when agitated lakshamana reaching inner chambers of sugriva and his harem reproaches sugriva for being ungrateful to rama and forgetting his promise lefeber pp 128 9 critical edition of ramayana states that tara voluntarily intervenes to calm wrath of lakshmana in some ramayana adaptations and north western indian manuscripts of ramayana it is tara not ruma in whom sugriva is engrossed when lakshmana arrives guruge p 168 south indian manuscripts portray drunk sugriva who is engrossed in lustful revel as being ignorant of lakshmana s anger and sending tara to pacify him in some versions even though she is drunk lefeber p 286 though intoxicated with half closed eyes and unsteady gait tara manages to disarm lakshmana intoxication of tara is also described in original ramayana but in a different context tara is described as having made it a habit to visit sugriva always in a tipsy state before indulging in new pleasures of love meyer p 328 ramayana narrates tara says that sugriva is mindful that through rama sugriva has gained kingship ruma and herself she defends sugriva saying that even great sage vishwamitra was tempted by pleasure sugriva a mere forest dwelling monkey is fatigued by his past hardships and is relaxing but not partaking in carnal pleasures tara informs sugriva that vali told her that ravana is a mighty king with several rakshasas in his service she reminds lakshmana that without an ally like sugriva rama cannot defeat such a powerful foe tara informs him that sugriva has summoned all monkey commanders and troops to capital lefeber pp 129 131 adhyatma ramayana also presents a similar description where tara angada and hanuman are sent by sugriva to calm lakshmana nath pp 182 3 in a condensed one verse description ramacharitamanasa says that tara and hanuman were dispatched by sugriva and were successful in appeasing lakshmana by singing rama s praises in ramavataram though not sugriva s consort tara pacifies lakshamana usual epithet of tara lustrous as moon in ramavataram signifies her white clothes sign of a widow lakshmana is reminded of his own widowed mother seeing tara pacified by tara and praised further by sugriva lakshmana begs for sugriva s pardon for abusing him lefeber pp 131 2 it is only through diplomatic intervention of tara that crisis is averted rao p 58 commentary ahalya draupadi kunti tara mandodari panchakanya remembering ever virgins five ahalya draupadi kunti tara and mandodari destroys greatest of sins orthodox hindus remember panchakanya five virgins or maidens in this daily morning prayer though none of them is considered an ideal woman who could be emulated mukherjee p pp 48 p 66 tara with ahalya and mandodari belong to ramayana while rest are from mahabharata v r devika author of tara unsung heroine describes her as a woman treated like an equal and her opinion mattered as if she were one of lieutenants ramayana presents tara as a woman intensely loved and respected by vali her husband her regard is so great that her counsel to vali sometimes have a commanding tone sharma p 83 bhattacharya author of book women of substance describes tara as a woman of unusual intelligence foresight and confidence tara s devotion to her husband is also praised mukherjee p 50 notes references category vanara in
