immigrant patients of tenement houses of lower east side she had little understanding of diverse ethnicities of her patients their poverty and conditions in which they lived fraser had been influenced by eugenics studies which caused her medical practices to be influenced by ethnic origin she became convinced that there was inadequate information available about birth control available to both physicians and patients and she sought information from non medical sources becoming an advocate soon after her arrival in new york fraser began a more intense correspondence with williams who would

be able to see patients in march 1927 fraser was offered a position in connaught laboratories a research facility dedicated to developing vaccines where her brother worked accepting position to begin at end of her internship in october meant that she would not be joining williams in england williams had hoped that fraser would join her where they might be able to live together but recognized with

own mother though two women wanted to live together raise children and continue their careers they were unwilling to displease or fail in their obligations to their mothers they also realized that though they were middle class working women economic inequalities in their pay compromised their ability to support themselves and their need to remain in good graces of their families for support when williams was bequeathed a farm near aurora ontario couple believed it might become their haven but when williams applied for courses at ontario school of agriculture she was advised courses were full for next several years they lived apart but within a 30 minute walk from each other at various residences by 1931 fraser had successfully passed her medical examinations and become licensed two

knew them best career in her research fraser worked predominantly in infectious disease studying general infection puerperal fever scarlet fever and septic sore throat among other bacterial infections she began studies on scarlet fever in early 1930s and along with dr helen plummer isolated present in strains of streptococci likely to lead to disease these findings were important in determining types of antitoxins which might be employed for immunization to neutralize disease type of research fraser was engaged in required that bacteria of disease which created a toxin be isolated so that it could be injected into a horse repeated injections of small doses of toxin allowed horse to become immune to disease serum created from blood of animals which had been immunized contained an antibody known at time as an which could then be injected into humans to cure disease development of sulfonamides rendered immunization against scarlet fever unnecessary but she continued to study other aspects of disease in 1941 she typed streptococci of scarlet fever which was an important breakthrough for tracking epidemiology of disease fraser also conducted research in an attempt to develop an antigen for tuberculosis with development of penicillin her research after 1947 shifted focus to study of antibiotics including penicillin and fraser studied various preparations of penicillin against
