casino royale first book featuring character of james bond to producer gregory ratoff for 6 000 in dollars in 1956 ratoff set up a production company with michael garrison to produce a film adaptation but wound up not finding financial backers before his death in december 1960 after ratoff s death producer charles k feldman represented ratoff s widow and obtained casino royale rights albert r broccoli who had a long time interest in adapting james bond offered to purchase casino royale rights from feldman but he declined feldman and his friend director howard hawks had an interest in adapting casino royale considering leigh brackett as a writer and cary grant as james bond they eventually gave up once they saw 1962 film dr no first bond adaptation made by broccoli and his partner harry saltzman through their company eon productions by 1964 with feldman having invested nearly 550 000 of his own money into pre production of casino royale he decided to try a deal with eon productions and its distributor united artists attempt at a co production eventually fell through as feldman frequently argued with broccoli and saltzman especially regarding profit divisions and when casino royale adaptation would start production feldman approached sean connery to play bond but rejected connery s offer to do film for one million dollars p 62 sellers robert sean connery a celebration robert hale 1 december 1999 feldman eventually decided to offer his project to columbia pictures through a script written by ben hecht and studio accepted given eon s series led to a spy film craze at time feldman opted to make his film a spoof of bond series instead of a straightforward adaptation screenplay development ben hecht s contribution to project if not final result was in fact substantial oscar winning writer was recruited by feldman to produce a screenplay for film and wrote several drafts with various evolutions of story incorporating different scenes and characters all of his treatments were straight adaptations far closer to original source novel than spoof which final production became a draft from 1957 discovered in hecht s papers but which does not identify screenwriter is a direct adaptation of novel albeit with bond character absent instead being replaced by a poker playing american gangster later drafts see vice made central to plot with le chiffre character becoming head of a network of brothels as he is in novel whose patrons are then blackmailed by le chiffre to fund spectre an invention of screenwriter racy plot elements opened up by this change of background include a chase scene through hamburg s red light district that results in bond escaping whilst disguised as a female mud wrestler new characters appear such as lili wing a brothel madam and former lover of bond whose ultimate fate is to be crushed in back of a garbage truck and gita wife of le chiffre beautiful gita whose face and throat are hideously disfigured as a result of bond using her as a shield during a gunfight in same sequence which sees wing meet her fate goes on to become prime protagonist in torture scene that features in book a role originally le chiffre s virtually nothing from hecht s scripts was ever filmed he died from a heart attack in april 1964 two days before he was due to present it to feldman time reported in 1966 that script had been completely re written by billy wilder and by time film reached production only idea that name james bond should be given to a number of other agents remained this key plot device in finished film in case of hecht s version occurs after demise of original james bond an event which happened prior to beginning of his story which as hecht s m puts it not only perpetuates his memory but confuses opposition peter sellers hired terry southern to write his dialogue and not rest of script to outshine orson welles and woody allen gerber gail lisanti tom trippin with terry southern what i think i remember mcfarland p 48 filming principal filming was carried out at pinewood studios shepperton studios and twickenham studios in london extensive sequences also featured london notably trafalgar square and exterior of 10 downing street mereworth castle in kent was used as home of sir james bond which is blown up at start of film much of filming for m s scottish castle was actually done on location in county meath ireland with killeen castle as focus however car chase sequences where bond leaves castle were shot in perthshire village of killin with further sequences in berkshire specifically old windsor and bracknell production proved to be rather troubled with five different directors helming different segments of film and with stunt co ordinator richard talmadge co directing final sequence in addition to credited writers woody allen peter sellers val guest ben hecht joseph heller terry southern and billy wilder are all believed to have contributed to screenplay to varying degrees val guest was given responsibility of splicing various chapters together and was offered unique title of co ordinating director but declined claiming chaotic plot would not reflect well on him if he were so credited his extra credit was labelled additional sequences instead guest val so you want to be in pictures reynolds hearn 2001 part of behind scenes drama of this film s production concerned filming of segments involving peter sellers screenwriter wolf mankowitz declared that sellers felt intimidated by orson welles to extent that except for a couple of shots neither was in studio simultaneously other versions of legend depict drama stemming from sellers being slighted in favour of welles by princess margaret whom sellers knew during her visit to set welles also insisted on performing magic tricks as le chiffre and director obliged director val guest wrote that welles did not think much of sellers and had refused to work with that amateur director joseph mcgrath a personal friend of sellers was punched by actor when he complained about sellers behavior on set ed mr strangelove a biography of peter sellers pan macmillan 2011 pp 310 3 some biographies of sellers suggest that he took role of bond to heart and was annoyed at decision to make casino royale a comedy as he wanted to play bond straight this is illustrated in somewhat fictionalised form in film life and death of peter sellers based on biography by roger lewis who has claimed that sellers kept re writing and improvising scenes to make them play seriously this story is in agreement with observation that only parts of film close to book are ones featuring sellers and welles lewis roger life and death of peter sellers applause books 2000 in end sellers involvement with film was cut abruptly short jean paul belmondo and george raft received major billing even though both actors appear only briefly both appear during climactic brawl at end raft flipping his trademark coin and promptly shooting himself dead with a backward firing pistol while belmondo appears wearing a fake moustache as french foreign legion officer who requires an english phrase book to translate merde into during his fistfight raft s coin flip which originally appeared in scarface 1932 had been spoofed a few years earlier in some like it hot 1959 at science fiction convention held in slough in 1978 david prowse commented on his part in this film apparently his big screen debut he claimed that he was originally asked to play super pooh a giant winnie pooh in a superhero costume who attacks tremble during torture of mind sequence this idea as with many others in film s script was rapidly dropped and prowse was re cast as a frankenstein type monster for closing scenes final sequence was principally directed by former actor and stuntman richard talmadge director credits unfinished scenes sellers went absent for days or weeks at a time refused to appear in his scenes with welles and left production before all of his scenes were shot as a result sellers was unavailable for filming of an ending and other interlinking footage leaving filmmakers to devise a way to make existing footage work without him framing device of a beginning and ending with david niven was invented to salvage footage val guest who had been given task of creating a narrative thread which would link all segments of film chose to use original bond and vesper as linking characters signs of missing footage from sellers segments are evident at various points evelyn tremble is not captured on camera an outtake of sellers entering a racing car was substituted in this outtake he calls for car a la pink panther to chase down vesper and her kidnappers next thing that is shown is tremble being tortured out takes of sellers were also used for tremble s dream sequence pretending to play piano on ursula andress torso in finale blowing out candles whilst in highland dress and at end of film when all various james bond doubles are together in kidnap sequence tremble s death is also very abruptly inserted it consists of pre existing footage of tremble being rescued by vesper followed by a later filmed shot of her abruptly deciding to shoot him followed by a freeze frame over some of previous footage of her surrounded by bodies noticeably a zoom in on previous shot as well as this an entire sequence involving tremble going to front for underground james bond training school which turns out to be under harrods of which training area was lowest level was never shot thus creating an abrupt cut from vesper announcing that tremble will be james bond to tremble exiting lift into training school so many sequences from film were removed that several well known actors never appeared in final cut including ian hendry as 006 agent whose body is briefly seen being disposed of by vesper mona and arthur mullard music for music feldman decided to bring in burt bacharach who had done score for his previous production what s new pussycat bacharach worked over two years writing for casino royale in meantime composing after fox score and being forced to decline participation in luv lyricist

of subsequent re releases are considered to be as fine as original lp release budget studio approved film s production budget of 6 million already quite large in 1966 however during filming project ran into several problems and shoot ran months over schedule with costs also running well over when film was finally completed it had doubled its original budget final production budget of 12 million made it one of most expensive films that had been made to that point previous eon bond film thunderball 1965 had a budget of 11 million while nearly contemporary you only live twice 1967 had a budget of 9 5 million extremely high budget of casino royale led to comparisons with a troubled production from 1963 and it was referred to as a runaway mini cleopatra columbia at first announced film was due to be released in time for christmas 1966 problems postponed launch until april 1967 release and reception casino royale had its world premiere in london s odeon leicester square on 13 april 1967 breaking many opening records in theatre s history its american premiere was held in new york on 28 april at capitol and cinema i theatres it opened two months prior to fifth bond film by eon productions you only live twice box office and marketing despite lukewarm nature of contemporary reviews pull of james bond name was sufficient to make it 13th highest grossing film in north america in 1967 with a gross of 22 7 million million in dollars and a worldwide total of 41 7 million million in dollars orson welles attributed success of film to a marketing strategy that featured a naked tattooed woman on film s posters and print ads as well as a billboard in new york s times square flickr com photos campaign also included a series of commercials featuring british model twiggy as late as 2011 film was still making money for estate of peter sellers who negotiated an extraordinary 3 of gross profits an estimated ps120 million with proceeds currently going to cassie unger daughter and sole heir of sellers beneficiary fourth wife lynne frederick when domestic box office receipts are adjusted for inflation casino royale is twentieth largest grossing of all bond films critical reception no advance press screenings of casino royale were held leading reviews to only appear after premiere chaotic nature of production features heavily in contemporary and later reviews roger ebert said this is possibly most indulgent film ever made time described casino royale as an incoherent and vulgar vaudeville and variety declared film to be a conglomeration of frenzied situations in gags and special effects lacking discipline and cohesion bosley crowther of new york times had some positive statements about film considering casino royale had more of talent agent than secret agent and praising fast start and scenes up to baccarat game between bond and le chiffre afterward crowther felt script became tiresome repetitive and filled with cliches due to wild and haphazard injections of in jokes and outlandish gags leading to an excessive length that made film a reckless disconnected nonsense that could be telescoped or stopped at any point writing in 1986 danny peary noted it s hard to believe that in 1967 we actually waited in anticipation for this so called james bond spoof it was a disappointment then it s a curio today but just as hard to get through peary described film as being disjointed and stylistically erratic and a testament to wastefulness in bigger is better cinema before adding it would have been a good idea to cut picture drastically perhaps down to scenes featuring peter sellers and woody allen in fact i recommend you see it on television when it s in a two hour including commercials slot then you won t expect it to make any sense a few recent reviewers have been more impressed by film andrea levasseur in allmovie review called it original ultimate spy spoof and opined that nearly impossible to follow plot made it a satire to highest degree further describing it as a hideous zany disaster levasseur concluded that it was a psychedelic absurd masterpiece cinema historian robert von has written about artistic merits of film and says like casablanca casino royale is a film of momentary vision collaboration adaption pastiche and accident it is anti auteur work of all time a film shaped by very zeitgeist it took on romano tozzi complimented acting and humour although he also mentioned that film has several dull stretches in his review of film leonard maltin remarked money money everywhere but film is terribly uneven sometimes funny often not simon winder called casino royale a pitiful spoof while robert druce described it as an abstraction of real life film holds a 26 rating on rotten tomatoes based on 38 reviews with an average rating of 4 55 10 website s critical consensus states a goofy dated parody of spy movie cliches casino royale squanders its all star cast on a meandering mostly laugh free script awards look of love was nominated for academy award for best original song losing to talk to animals from doctor dolittle burt bacharach s score also earned a grammy award nomination for best original
