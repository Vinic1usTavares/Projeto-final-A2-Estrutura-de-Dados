eight senior pilots including australia s leading flying ace group captain clive caldwell tendered their resignations to protest what they perceived as relegation of royal australian air force raaf fighter squadrons to strategically unimportant ground attack missions against japanese positions that had been bypassed in allies island hopping campaign a government investigation vindicated mutineers and three high ranking officers at first tactical air force headquarters including commander air commodore harry cobby australian flying corps top scoring ace during world war i were relieved of their posts george odgers summed up cause of incident in official history of raaf in world war ii as conviction of a group of young leaders that they were engaging in operations that were not militarily justifiable a conviction widely shared also by many australian soldiers and political leaders odgers concluded that ensuing inquiry made it clear that almost everyone concerned acted from highest motives and was convinced that in crisis he acted wisely odgers air war against japan p 450 background thumb upright right group captain arthur pictured in north africa in 1941

units expenditure in terms of men machines and ordnance was not justified by damage inflicted on enemy targets or by relative importance of those targets in december 1944 he asked his intelligence staff to produce a balance sheet to quantify losses versus results arthur presented balance sheet to air commodore cobby who reviewed it and disseminated it to his headquarters staff but took no further action alexander clive caldwell pp 185 203 odgers air war against japan pp 386 390 odgers air war against japan pp 443 450 prelude to resignations thumb left 260px caldwell fourth from left

kitted men in front of a single engined military monoplane in march 1945 frustrated by lack of response from cobby and his staff and convinced that operations were becoming yet more wasteful arthur began discussing his concerns with other senior no 1 taf pilots first he spoke to wing commander kenneth ranger a senior staff officer who had served with no 9 operational group and had made allegations regarding leadership of its commander air commodore joe hewitt who was eventually dismissed from his post arthur sought out ranger as someone with moral guts who would take a stand against type of operations we were engaged in next he enlisted caldwell s support although caldwell was at time facing charges from cobby over liquor trafficking which made it a risk that his involvement in a protest over operations would be misconstrued as an attempt to divert attention from charges arthur believed however that caldwell would go as far as he possibly could to back up his opinions which were worth a lot more than opinions of most other people in area through caldwell more officers joined protest including two other celebrated aces wing commander bobby gibbes and squadron leader john waddy as well as squadron leader bert grace squadron leader douglas and later squadron leader stuart odgers royal australian air force p 125 caldwell s official tally for war was 28 1 2 kills waddy s 15 1 2 gibbes 10 1 4 and arthur s 10 during a series of meetings early in april 1945 caldwell proposed that eight resign en masse and others agreed arthur later stated that i meant to make as big a fuss as i possibly could with object of getting position corrected all same we realised that to lay ourselves open to any charge of mutiny we might lessen force of what we were doing which was reason we put things in as resignations and not as any attempt to unseat people higher up arthur also attempted to secure cobby s support for protest commander of no 1 taf had been australian flying corps leading ace in world war i as caldwell was raaf s in world war ii arthur reasoned that although cobby was partly to blame for morale issue we felt that his value to our move because of his name with public together with group captain caldwell would give us a very considerable amount of public support he was prima donna of one war and arm in arm with prima donna of next war we would put up a reasonable front and attract a lot of attention in headlines of newspapers cobby refused to join in and later claimed to be unaware of depth of feeling among pilots mutiny on 20 april 1945 eight pilots presented cobby with identically worded letters under heading application for resignation of commission letters read i hereby respectfully make application that i be permitted to resign my commission as an officer in royal australian air force forthwith cobby appeared taken aback and would not accept resignations he spoke to seven of pilots individually but not caldwell as he was already under charge alexander cleaning augean stables bostock and jones would also omit caldwell from their interviews with pilots on morotai when men refused to withdraw letters or elaborate on reason for their actions cobby contacted his immediate superior air vice marshal bill bostock head of raaf command air force s main operational command bostock arrived on morotai next day and interviewed pilots asking them to tear up letters without success his methods were later construed as an attempt to make situation go away or to at least cover it up pilots only concession to bostock s entreaty was to resubmit their resignations with word forthwith replaced by at end of current operations odgers air war against japan p 445 thumb left 260px air vice marshal jones left and lieutenant general kenney right in july 1945 alt half length portrait of two men in tropical military uniforms following these interviews bostock advised air vice marshal jones that morale in no 1 taf was at a dangerously low level and recommended that jones fire cobby and replace him with air commodore frederick scherger odgers royal australian air force pp 122 123 jones considered pilots action absurd because an officer could not legally resign during wartime but travelled to morotai from his headquarters in melbourne to investigate matter personally he also interviewed pilots later declaring i believed them all to be sincere in what they were stating and what they had attempted to do yes sincerely held beliefs no matter how ill founded coupled possibly with a rather exaggerated sense of national duty lieutenant general kenney also became embroiled in affair having been informed by bostock and insisted on speaking directly to pilots himself over jones protest that this was an internal raaf disciplinary matter during a visit to morotai from his manila headquarters kenney tried to persuade officers to reconsider their positions but again they refused he agreed with bostock that cobby should be replaced by scherger and declared that if pilots were court martialled he would appear in their defence commander of australian army s i corps lieutenant general leslie morshead who was at morotai preparing for borneo campaign also supported cobby s removal morshead and other senior army officers were concerned that dispute could disrupt preparations for australian landings in borneo and consulted with kenney on matter coombes morshead hero of tobruk and el alamein p 196 jones resolved to dismiss not only cobby but also his staff officers group captains gibson and simms

half length outdoor portrait of man in dark suit overcoat and hat ultimately no court martial took place for any actions directly related to mutiny and most of pilots involved continued on operations until end of war an raaf investigation found that jones removal of cobby gibson and simms was justified upon jones request australian government also set up an inquiry into events on morotai headed by justice john vincent barry beginning on 16 may 1945 inquiry focused on both resignations and reports of illegal trafficking in alcohol between raaf and us service personnel on island watson killer caldwell pp 228 239 though barry s terms of reference encompassed only no 1 taf inquiry also heard evidence of shortcomings in air force s higher command that may have contributed to structural and morale problems on morotai particularly a bitter and long running feud between jones and bostock over division of operational and administrative control of raaf in pacific complete report of inquiry was released in october preceded by a summary of findings issued on 14 september 1945 judge barry vindicated arthur s balance sheet and stand taken by pilots finding that their motives in tendering their resignations were sincere no further action was taken against them over mutiny itself but caldwell and gibbes were court martialled for their involvement in alcohol racket and reduced to rank of flight lieutenant barry found that cobby had failed to maintain proper control over his command cobby defended his leadership of no 1 taf contending that although there was some discontent it was a healthy sign of discontent amongst certain officers who wished to do more in war than they were doing unfortunately it was not within power of 1st t a f to give them that more important or more interesting work odgers air war against japan pp 449 incident did not change raaf s role in dying days of war in pacific and may have hindered no 1 taf s preparations for upcoming battle of tarakan it did improve situation on morotai as air commodore scherger successfully restored morale mutineers considered that they had achieved most of their goals by effecting a change of command in no 1 taf and instigating a governmental inquiry news of resignations alcohol racket and caldwell s court martial were widely reported in australia following publication of barry s findings daily telegraph in sydney commented that raaf should have a complete new deal it is a badly run show and fault is high up same paper later called caldwell s court martial a witch hunt alexander clive caldwell pp 211 215 despite this publicity action did not become popularly known as morotai mutiny until years later phrase dated back to earliest days of incident group captain arthur having written it at top of an aide memoire he later said that alliteration must have appealed to me shortly after writing it he crossed out morotai and added a question mark following mutiny term did not catch on with public at time
