slender smooth hound or gollum attenuatus is a species of ground shark in family pseudotriakidae it is endemic to waters around new zealand where it is usually found close to bottom over continental slope at depths of an extremely slim plain brownish shark reaching in length slender smooth hound can be identified by its broad flattened head with a long distinctively bell shaped snout its mouth is angular with short furrows at corners and contains a very high number of tooth rows in both jaws its two dorsal fins are roughly equal in size diet of slender smooth hound is diverse but dominated by small benthic bony fishes and decapod crustaceans it exhibits a specialized form of aplacental viviparity with oophagy females produce a single capsule in each uterus that contains 30 80 ova of which one ovum develops into an embryo that consumes rest of ova and stores yolk material in its external yolk sac growing embryo is mainly sustained by this yolk sac during gestation though it may be additionally supplied with histotroph uterine milk produced by mother typical litter size is two pups one per uterus international union for conservation of nature iucn has assessed slender smooth hound as least concern it is taken as fishery bycatch but not in great numbers and furthermore large portions of its range see minimal fishing activity taxonomy and phylogeny first known specimen of slender smooth hound was a long adult male collected by trawler in december 1953 at a depth of off cape palliser on new zealand s north island it was preserved by crew as a curiosity and given to ichthyologist jack garrick who described it in a 1954 issue of scientific journal transactions of royal society of new zealand garrick named species triakis attenuata in reference to its extremely slender attenuate body in 1973 leonard compagno proposed a separate genus for slender smooth hound gollum after character in j r r tolkien s lord of rings to whom this shark bears some resemblance in form and habits he placed gollum with catsharks but also noted its many anatomical similarities to false catshark pseudotriakis at time compagno chose to maintain pseudotriakis as sole member of family pseudotriakidae because of its numerous unique traits more recently he and other taxonomists have increasingly tended to group gollum and pseudotriakis together in family pseudotriakidae this arrangement was corroborated by a 2006 phylogenetic study by juan andres lopez and colleagues which found that two genera have a high degree of genetic similarity across four protein coding genes and form a natural clade apart from an additional species of gollum has now been described and there is at least one additional species yet to be described distribution and habitat range of slender smooth hound is restricted to upper and middle continental slope around new zealand including submarine features to north such as three kings ridge challenger plateau and wanganella bank this uncommon species is mainly found between deep but has been recorded from deep it prefers a temperature of around and a salinity of approximately 34 8 0 generally swimming near sea floor this shark inhabits both soft and rocky bottomed habitats in terrain ranging from plateaus to steep slopes description thumb upright 1 2 left distinctive traits of slender smooth hound include its thin body and long flattened head slender smooth hound has a very thin body and a broad highly flattened head snout is long with a distinctive bell shaped outline when viewed from above eyes have an elongate horizontal oval shape and are equipped with rudimentary nictitating membranes protective third eyelids beneath each eye is a prominent ridge and behind is a much smaller spiracle nostrils are preceded by small almost triangular flaps of skin line of mouth forms an angle there are very short furrows at mouth corners upper and lower jaws contain 96 99 and 108 114 rows respectively of small very closely spaced teeth each tooth has a narrow upright central cusp flanked by smaller cusplets on both sides five pairs of gill slits are short pectoral fins originate below fourth gill slit and have gently curved margins pelvic fins are small and angular males have pointed claspers two dorsal fins are similar in size and shape with narrowly rounded apexes and concave trailing margins first dorsal fin originates over rear of pectoral fins while second dorsal fin originates between pelvic and anal fins a midline ridge is present between dorsal fins anal fin is less than half as high as first dorsal fin and has a nearly straight trailing margin short and narrow caudal fin makes up about one sixth of total length lower caudal fin lobe is indistinct while upper lobe has a strong ventral notch near tip skin is densely covered by small overlapping dermal denticles crown of each denticle is mounted on a short stalk and bears three horizontal ridges leading to marginal blade like teeth with central tooth particularly long this species is plain brownish gray above and lighter below it grows up to long and in weight with females reaching a slightly larger size than males biology and ecology thumb are a major food source for slender smooth hound slender smooth hound is likely a schooling species it preys on a variety of benthic fishes and invertebrates and also scavenges human garbage has been reported among its stomach contents small bony fishes lanternfishes in particular are most important prey type followed by decapod crustaceans cephalopods gastropods isopods brittle stars dogfish sharks and cartilaginous fish egg capsules may also be consumed on challenger plateau cephalopods are an important food source for juveniles under long like false catshark slender smooth hound exhibits aplacental viviparity with oophagy in a form different from that in mackerel sharks mature females have a single functional ovary on right side and two functional uteruses only one embryo develops within each uterus at a time resulting in litters of two rarely one pups uterus inner surface is covered by villi within a uterus 30 80 ova across are packed into a single rigid amber colored capsule of these only one ovum is fertilized and develops into an embryo while remaining ova begin to break down embryo consumes these other ova and transfers yolk material into its external yolk sac which serves as its main source of nourishment during gestation this oophagous process is completed by an embryonic length of embryo may also receive secondary nutrition in form of histotroph uterine milk produced by mother when embryo is long it emerges from capsule which by that time has become translucent and gelatinous embryos long have well developed external gill filaments external yolk sac is entirely absorbed when embryo is long and close to being born males and females reach sexual maturity at approximately long human interactions harmless to humans and of no economic value slender smooth hound is occasionally caught incidentally in bottom trawls and on bottom longlines much of its northern range lies in little fished waters and thus international union for conservation of nature iucn has listed it under least concern however this shark s very low fecundity would render it susceptible to population depletion should fishing pressure increase in future in june 2018 new zealand department of conservation classified slender smooth hound as not threatened with qualifier secure overseas under new zealand threat classification system references category gollum category endemic marine fish of new zealand category fish described in 1954
