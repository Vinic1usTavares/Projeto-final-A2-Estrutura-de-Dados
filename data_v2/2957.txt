thumb right cartoon representation of a proteasome its active sites are sheltered inside tube blue caps red in this case 11s regulatory particles on ends regulate entry into destruction chamber where protein is degraded thumb right top view of proteasome above proteasomes are protein complexes which degrade unneeded or damaged proteins by proteolysis a chemical reaction that breaks peptide bonds enzymes that help such reactions are called proteases proteasomes are part of a major mechanism by which cells regulate concentration of particular proteins and degrade misfolded proteins proteins are tagged for degradation with a small protein called ubiquitin tagging reaction is catalyzed by enzymes called ubiquitin ligases once a protein is tagged with a single ubiquitin molecule this is a signal to other ligases to attach additional ubiquitin molecules result is a polyubiquitin chain that is bound by proteasome allowing it to degrade tagged protein degradation process yields peptides of about seven to eight amino acids long which can then be further degraded into shorter amino acid sequences and used in synthesizing new proteins proteasomes are found inside all eukaryotes and archaea and in some bacteria in eukaryotes proteasomes are located both in nucleus and in cytoplasm in structure proteasome is a cylindrical complex containing a core of four stacked rings forming a central pore each ring is composed of seven individual proteins inner two rings are made of seven b subunits that contain three to seven protease active sites these sites are located on interior surface of rings so that target protein must enter central pore before it is degraded outer two rings each contain seven a subunits whose function is to maintain a gate through which proteins enter barrel these a subunits are controlled by binding to cap structures or regulatory particles that recognize polyubiquitin tags attached to protein substrates and initiate degradation process overall system of ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation is known as ubiquitin proteasome system proteasomal degradation pathway is essential for many cellular processes including cell cycle regulation of gene expression and responses to oxidative stress importance of proteolytic degradation inside cells and role of ubiquitin in proteolytic pathways was acknowledged in award of 2004 nobel prize in chemistry to aaron ciechanover avram hershko and irwin rose discovery before discovery of ubiquitin proteasome system protein degradation in cells was thought to rely mainly on lysosomes membrane bound organelles with acidic and protease filled interiors that can degrade and then recycle exogenous proteins and aged or damaged organelles however work by joseph and alfred goldberg in 1977 on atp dependent protein degradation in reticulocytes which lack lysosomes suggested presence of a second intracellular degradation mechanism this was shown in 1978 to be composed of several distinct protein chains a novelty among proteases at time later work on modification of histones led to identification of an unexpected covalent modification of histone protein by a bond between a lysine side chain of histone and c terminal glycine residue of ubiquitin a protein that had no known function it was then discovered that a previously identified protein associated with proteolytic degradation known as atp dependent proteolysis factor 1 apf 1 was same protein as ubiquitin proteolytic activities of this system were isolated as a multi protein complex originally called multi catalytic proteinase complex by sherwin wilk and marion orlowski later atp dependent proteolytic complex that was responsible for ubiquitin dependent protein degradation was discovered and was called 26s proteasome much of early work leading up to discovery of ubiquitin proteasome system occurred in late 1970s and early 1980s at in laboratory of avram hershko where aaron ciechanover worked as a graduate student hershko s year long sabbatical in laboratory of irwin rose at fox chase cancer center provided key conceptual insights though rose later downplayed his role in discovery three shared 2004 nobel prize in chemistry for their work in discovering this system although electron microscopy data revealing stacked ring structure of proteasome became available in mid 1980s first structure of proteasome core particle was not solved by x ray crystallography until 1994 structure and organization thumb right a schematic diagram of proteasome 20s core particle viewed from one side a subunits that make up outer two rings are shown in green and b subunits that make up inner two rings are shown in blue proteasome subcomponents are often referred to by their svedberg sedimentation coefficient denoted s proteasome most exclusively used in mammals is cytosolic 26s proteasome which is about 2000 kda in molecular mass containing one 20s protein subunit and two 19s regulatory cap subunits core is hollow and provides an enclosed cavity in which proteins are degraded openings at two ends of core allow target protein to enter each end of core particle associates with a 19s regulatory subunit that contains multiple atpase active sites and ubiquitin binding sites it is this structure that recognizes polyubiquitinated proteins and transfers them to catalytic core an alternative form of regulatory subunit called 11s particle can associate with core in essentially same manner as 19s particle 11s may play a role in degradation of foreign peptides such as those produced after infection by a virus 20s core particle number and diversity of subunits contained in 20s core particle depends on organism number of distinct and specialized subunits is larger in multicellular than unicellular organisms and larger in eukaryotes than in prokaryotes all 20s particles consist of four stacked heptameric ring structures that are themselves composed of two different types of subunits a subunits are structural in nature whereas b subunits are predominantly catalytic a subunits are homologous to b subunits they are assembled with their n termini adjacent to that of b subunits outer two rings in stack consist of seven a subunits each which serve as docking domains for regulatory particles and alpha subunits n termini form a gate that blocks unregulated access of substrates to interior cavity inner two rings each consist of seven b subunits and in their n termini contain protease active sites that perform proteolysis reactions three distinct catalytic activities were identified in purified complex chymotrypsin like trypsin like and peptide hydrolyzing size of proteasome is relatively conserved and is about 150 angstroms a by 115 a interior chamber is at most 53 a wide though entrance can be as narrow as 13 a suggesting that substrate proteins must be at least partially unfolded to enter in archaea such as all a and all b subunits are identical whereas eukaryotic proteasomes such as those in yeast contain seven distinct types of each subunit in mammals b1 b2 and b5 subunits are catalytic although they share a common mechanism they have three distinct substrate specificities considered chymotrypsin like trypsin like and peptidyl glutamyl peptide hydrolyzing phgh alternative b forms denoted b1i b2i and b5i can be expressed in hematopoietic cells in response to exposure to pro inflammatory signals such as cytokines in particular interferon gamma proteasome assembled with these alternative subunits is known as immunoproteasome whose substrate specificity is altered relative to normal proteasome recently an alternative proteasome was identified in human cells that lack a3 core subunit these proteasomes known as a4 a4 proteasomes instead form 20s core particles containing an additional a4 subunit in place of missing a3 subunit these alternative a4 a4 proteasomes have been known previously to exist in yeast although precise function of these proteasome isoforms is still largely unknown cells expressing these proteasomes show enhanced resistance to toxicity induced by metallic ions such as cadmium 19s regulatory particle 19s particle in eukaryotes consists of 19 individual proteins and is divisible into two subassemblies a 9 subunit base that binds directly to a ring of 20s core particle and a 10 subunit lid six of nine base proteins are atpase subunits from aaa family and an evolutionary homolog of these atpases exists in archaea called pan proteasome activating association of 19s and 20s particles requires binding of atp to 19s atpase subunits and atp hydrolysis is required for assembled complex to degrade folded and ubiquitinated proteins note that only step of substrate unfolding requires energy from atp hydrolysis while atp binding alone can support all other steps required for protein degradation e g complex assembly gate opening translocation and proteolysis in fact atp binding to atpases by itself supports rapid degradation of unfolded proteins however while atp hydrolysis is required for unfolding only it is not yet clear whether this energy may be used in coupling of some of these steps thumb right cartoon representation of 26s proteasome in 2012 two independent efforts have elucidated molecular architecture of 26s proteasome by single particle electron microscopy in 2016 three independent efforts have determined first near atomic resolution structure of human 26s proteasome in absence of substrates by cryo em in 2018 a major effort has elucidated detailed mechanisms of deubiquitylation initiation of translocation and processive unfolding of substrates by determining seven atomic structures of substrate engaged 26s proteasome simultaneously in heart of 19s directly adjacent to 20s are aaa atpases aaa proteins that assemble to a heterohexameric ring of order rpt1 rpt2 rpt6 rpt3 rpt4 rpt5 this ring is a of dimers rpt1 rpt2 rpt6 rpt3 and rpt4 rpt5 via their n terminal coiled coils these coiled coils protrude from ring largest regulatory particle non atpases rpn1 and rpn2 bind to tips of rpt1 2 and rpt6 3 respectively ubiquitin receptor binds to rpn2 and completes base cub complex lid covers one half of aaa atpase hexamer rpt6 rpt3 rpt4 and unexpectedly directly contacts 20s via rpn6 and to lesser extent rpn5 subunits rpn9 rpn5 rpn6 and which are structurally related among themselves and to subunits of complex and hence called pci subunits assemble to a horseshoe like structure enclosing rpn8 rpn11 rpn11 enzyme is placed at mouth of aaa atpase hexamer ideally positioned to remove ubiquitin moieties immediately before translocation of substrates into 20s second ubiquitin receptor identified to date is positioned at periphery of lid near subunits rpn8 and rpn9 conformational changes of 19s 19s regulatory particle within 26s proteasome has been observed in six strongly differing conformational states in absence of substrates to date a hallmark of aaa atpase configuration in this predominant low energy state is a staircase or like arrangement of aaa domains in presence of atp but absence of substrate three alternative less abundant conformations of 19s are adopted primarily differing in positioning of lid with respect to aaa atpase module in presence of atp gs or a substrate considerably more conformations have been observed displaying dramatic structural changes of aaa atpase module some of substrate bound conformations bear high similarity to substrate free ones but they are not entirely identical particularly in aaa atpase module prior to 26s assembly 19s regulatory particle in a free form has also been observed in seven conformational states notably all these are somewhat different and present distinct features thus 19s regulatory particle can sample at least 20 conformational states under different physiological conditions thumb 300px three distinct conformational states of 26s proteasome conformations are hypothesized to be responsible for recruitment of substrate its irreversible commitment and finally processing and translocation into core particle where degradation occurs regulation of 20s by 19s 19s regulatory particle is responsible for stimulating 20s to degrade proteins a primary function of 19s regulatory atpases is to open gate in 20s that blocks entry of substrates into degradation chamber mechanism by which proteasomal atpase open this gate has been recently elucidated 20s gate opening and thus substrate degradation requires c termini of proteasomal atpases which contains a specific motif i e motif atpases c termini bind into pockets in top of 20s and tether atpase complex to 20s proteolytic complex thus joining substrate unfolding equipment with 20s degradation machinery binding of these c termini into these 20s pockets by themselves stimulates opening of gate in 20s in much same way that a key in a lock opens a door precise mechanism by which this key in a lock mechanism functions has been structurally elucidated in context of human 26s proteasome at near atomic resolution suggesting that insertion of five c termini of atpase subunits rpt1 2 3 5 6 into 20s surface pockets are required to fully open 20s gate other regulatory particles 20s proteasomes can also associate with a second type of regulatory particle 11s regulatory particle a heptameric structure that does not contain any atpases and can promote degradation of short peptides but not of complete proteins it is presumed that this is because complex cannot unfold larger substrates this structure is also known as pa28 reg or mechanisms by which it binds to core particle through c terminal tails of its subunits and induces a ring conformational changes to open 20s gate suggest a similar mechanism for 19s particle expression of 11s particle is induced by interferon gamma and is responsible in conjunction with immunoproteasome b subunits for generation of peptides that bind to major histocompatibility complex yet another type of non atpase regulatory particle is yeast or human it opens only one a subunit in 20s gate and itself folds into a dome with a very small pore over it assembly assembly of proteasome is a complex process due to number of subunits that must associate to form an active complex b subunits are synthesized with n terminal propeptides that are post translationally modified during assembly of 20s particle to expose proteolytic active site 20s particle is assembled from two half proteasomes each of which consists of a seven membered pro b ring attached to a seven membered a ring association of b rings of two half proteasomes triggers threonine dependent of propeptides to expose active site these b interactions are mediated mainly by salt bridges and hydrophobic interactions between conserved alpha helices whose disruption by mutation damages proteasome s ability to assemble assembly of half proteasomes in turn is initiated by assembly of a subunits into their heptameric ring forming a template for association of corresponding pro b ring assembly of a subunits has not been characterized only recently assembly process of 19s regulatory particle has been elucidated to considerable extent 19s regulatory particle assembles as two distinct subcomponents base and lid assembly of base complex is facilitated by four assembly chaperones p27 and gankyrin names for yeast mammals these assembly chaperones bind to aaa atpase subunits and their main function seems to be to ensure proper assembly of heterohexameric aaa atpase ring to date it is still under debate whether base complex assembles separately whether assembly is by 20s core particle or whether alternative assembly pathways exist in addition to four assembly chaperones enzyme also promotes base assembly but it is not essential lid assembles separately in a specific order and does not require assembly chaperones protein degradation process thumb 250px ribbon diagram of ubiquitin highly conserved protein that serves as a molecular tag targeting proteins for degradation by proteasome ubiquitination and targeting proteins are targeted for degradation by proteasome with covalent modification of a lysine residue that requires coordinated reactions of three enzymes in first step a ubiquitin activating enzyme known as e1 atp and a ubiquitin molecule this is then transferred to e1 s active site cysteine residue in concert with of a second ubiquitin this ubiquitin is then transferred to a cysteine of a second enzyme ubiquitin enzyme e2 in last step a member of a highly diverse class of enzymes known as ubiquitin ligases e3 recognizes specific protein to be ubiquitinated and catalyzes transfer of ubiquitin from e2 to this target protein a target protein must be labeled with at least four ubiquitin monomers in form of a polyubiquitin chain before it is recognized by proteasome lid it is therefore e3 that confers substrate specificity to this system number of e1 e2 and e3 proteins expressed depends on organism and cell type but there are many different e3 enzymes present in humans indicating that there is a huge number of targets for ubiquitin proteasome system mechanism by which a polyubiquitinated protein is targeted to proteasome is not fully understood a few high resolution snapshots of proteasome bound to a polyubiquitinated protein suggest that ubiquitin receptors might be coordinated with rpn11 for initial substrate targeting and engagement ubiquitin receptor proteins have an n terminal ubiquitin like ubl domain and one or more ubiquitin associated uba domains ubl domains are recognized by 19s proteasome caps and uba domains bind ubiquitin via three helix bundles these receptor proteins may escort polyubiquitinated proteins to proteasome though specifics of this interaction and its regulation are unclear ubiquitin protein itself is 76 amino acids long and was named due to its ubiquitous nature as it has a highly conserved sequence and is found in all known eukaryotic organisms genes encoding ubiquitin in eukaryotes are arranged in tandem repeats possibly due to heavy transcription demands on these genes to produce enough ubiquitin for cell it has been proposed that ubiquitin is slowest evolving protein identified to date ubiquitin contains seven lysine residues to which another ubiquitin can be ligated resulting in different types of polyubiquitin chains chains in which each additional ubiquitin is linked to lysine 48 of previous ubiquitin have a role in proteasome targeting while other types of chains may be involved in other processes thumb 250px ubiquitination pathway unfolding and translocation after a protein has been ubiquitinated it is recognized by 19s regulatory particle in an atp dependent binding step substrate protein must then enter interior of 20s particle to come in contact with proteolytic active sites because 20s particle s central channel is narrow and gated by n terminal tails of a ring subunits substrates must be at least partially unfolded before they enter core passage of unfolded substrate into core is called translocation and necessarily occurs after deubiquitination however order in which substrates are and unfolded is not yet clear which of these processes is rate limiting step in overall proteolysis reaction depends on specific substrate for some proteins unfolding process is rate limiting while deubiquitination is slowest step for other proteins extent to which substrates must be unfolded before translocation is suggested to be around 20 amino acid residues by atomic structure of substrate engaged 26s proteasome in deubiquitylation compatible state but substantial tertiary structure and in particular interactions such as disulfide bonds are sufficient to inhibit degradation presence of intrinsically disordered protein segments of sufficient size either at protein terminus or internally has also been proposed to facilitate efficient initiation of degradation gate formed by a subunits prevents peptides longer than about four residues from entering interior of 20s particle atp molecules bound before initial recognition step are hydrolyzed before translocation while energy is needed for substrate unfolding it is not required for translocation assembled 26s proteasome can degrade unfolded proteins in presence of a non hydrolyzable atp analog but cannot degrade folded proteins indicating that energy from atp hydrolysis is used for substrate unfolding passage of unfolded substrate through opened gate occurs via facilitated diffusion if 19s cap is in atp bound state mechanism for unfolding of globular proteins is necessarily general but somewhat dependent on amino acid sequence long sequences of alternating glycine and alanine have been shown to inhibit substrate unfolding decreasing efficiency of proteasomal degradation this results in release of partially degraded byproducts possibly due to decoupling of atp hydrolysis and unfolding steps such glycine alanine repeats are also found in nature for example in silk in particular certain epstein barr virus gene products bearing this sequence can stall proteasome helping virus propagate by preventing antigen presentation on major histocompatibility complex thumb 200px left a cutaway view of proteasome 20s core particle illustrating locations of active sites a subunits are represented as green spheres and b subunits as protein backbones colored by individual polypeptide chain small pink spheres represent location of active site threonine residue in each subunit light blue chemical structures are inhibitor bortezomib bound to active sites proteolysis proteasome functions as an mechanism of proteolysis by b subunits of 20s core particle is through a threonine dependent nucleophilic attack this mechanism may depend on an associated water molecule for deprotonation of reactive threonine hydroxyl degradation occurs within central chamber formed by association of two b rings and normally does not release partially degraded products instead reducing substrate to short polypeptides typically 7 9 residues long though they can range from 4 to 25 residues depending on organism and substrate biochemical mechanism that determines product length is not fully characterized although three catalytic b subunits have a common mechanism they have slightly different substrate specificities which are considered chymotrypsin like trypsin like and peptidyl glutamyl peptide hydrolyzing phgh like these variations in specificity are result of interatomic contacts with local residues near active sites of each subunit each catalytic b subunit also possesses a conserved lysine residue required for proteolysis although proteasome normally produces very short peptide fragments in some cases these products are themselves biologically active and functional molecules certain transcription factors regulating expression of specific genes including one component of mammalian complex nf kb are synthesized as inactive precursors whose ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation converts them to an active form such activity requires proteasome to cleave substrate protein internally rather than degrading it from one terminus it has been suggested that long loops on these proteins surfaces serve as proteasomal substrates and enter central cavity while majority of protein remains outside similar effects have been observed in yeast proteins this mechanism of selective degradation is known as regulated ubiquitin proteasome dependent processing ubiquitin independent degradation although most proteasomal substrates must be ubiquitinated before being degraded there are some exceptions to this general rule especially when proteasome plays a normal role in post translational processing of protein proteasomal activation of nf kb by processing p105 into p50 via internal proteolysis is one major example some proteins that are hypothesized to be unstable due to intrinsically unstructured regions are degraded in a ubiquitin independent manner most well known example of a ubiquitin independent proteasome substrate is enzyme ornithine decarboxylase ubiquitin independent mechanisms targeting key cell cycle regulators such as p53 have also been reported although p53 is also subject to ubiquitin dependent degradation finally structurally abnormal misfolded or highly oxidized proteins are also subject to ubiquitin independent and 19s independent degradation under conditions of cellular stress evolution thumb 200px assembled complex of hslv blue and hslu red from e coli this complex of heat shock proteins is thought to resemble ancestor of modern proteasome 20s proteasome is both ubiquitous and essential in eukaryotes some prokaryotes including many archaea and bacterial order also share homologs of 20s proteasome whereas most bacteria possess heat shock genes hslv and hslu whose gene products are a multimeric protease arranged in a two layered ring and an atpase hslv protein has been hypothesized to resemble likely ancestor of 20s proteasome in general hslv is not essential in bacteria and not all bacteria possess it whereas some protists possess both 20s and hslv systems many bacteria also possess other homologs of proteasome and an associated atpase most notably and this redundancy explains why system is not essential sequence analysis suggests that catalytic b subunits diverged earlier in evolution than predominantly structural a subunits in bacteria that express a 20s proteasome b subunits have high sequence identity to archaeal and eukaryotic b subunits whereas a sequence identity is much lower presence of 20s proteasomes in bacteria may result from lateral gene transfer while diversification of subunits among eukaryotes is ascribed to multiple gene duplication events cell cycle control cell cycle progression is controlled by ordered action of cyclin dependent kinases activated by specific cyclins that demarcate phases of cell cycle mitotic cyclins which persist in cell for only a few minutes have one of shortest life spans of all intracellular proteins after a cdk cyclin complex has performed its function associated cyclin is polyubiquitinated and destroyed by proteasome which provides directionality for cell cycle in particular exit from mitosis requires proteasome dependent dissociation of regulatory component cyclin b from mitosis promoting factor complex in vertebrate cells slippage through mitotic checkpoint leading to premature m phase exit can occur despite delay of this exit by spindle checkpoint earlier cell cycle checkpoints such as post restriction point check between g1 phase and s phase similarly involve proteasomal degradation of cyclin a whose ubiquitination is promoted by promoting complex apc an e3 ubiquitin ligase apc and f box protein complex scf complex are two key regulators of cyclin degradation and checkpoint control scf itself is regulated by apc via ubiquitination of adaptor protein which prevents scf activity before g1 s transition individual components of 19s particle have their own regulatory roles gankyrin a recently identified is one of 19s subcomponents that also tightly binds cyclin dependent kinase and plays a key role in recognizing ubiquitinated p53 via its affinity for ubiquitin ligase gankyrin is anti apoptotic and has been shown to be in some tumor cell types such as hepatocellular carcinoma regulation of plant growth in plants signaling by auxins or that order direction and of plant growth induces targeting of a class of transcription factor known as aux iaa proteins for proteasomal degradation these proteins are ubiquitinated by or scf in complex with auxin receptor degradation of aux iaa proteins transcription factors in auxin response factor arf family and induces arf directed gene expression cellular consequences of arf activation depend on plant type and developmental stage but are involved in directing growth in roots and leaf veins specific response to arf is thought to be mediated by specificity in pairing of individual arf and aux iaa proteins apoptosis both internal and external signals can lead to induction of apoptosis or programmed cell death resulting deconstruction of cellular components is primarily carried out by specialized proteases known as caspases but proteasome also plays important and diverse roles in apoptotic process involvement of proteasome in this process is indicated by both increase in protein ubiquitination and of e1 e2 and e3 enzymes that is observed well in advance of apoptosis during apoptosis proteasomes localized to nucleus have also been observed to to outer membrane blebs characteristic of apoptosis proteasome inhibition has different effects on apoptosis induction in different cell types in general proteasome is not required for apoptosis although inhibiting it is pro apoptotic in most cell types that have been studied apoptosis is mediated through disrupting regulated degradation of pro growth cell cycle proteins however some cell lines in particular primary cultures of quiescent and differentiated cells such as and neurons are prevented from undergoing apoptosis on exposure to proteasome inhibitors mechanism for this effect is not clear but is hypothesized to be specific to cells in quiescent states or to result from differential activity of pro apoptotic kinase jnk ability of proteasome inhibitors to induce apoptosis in rapidly dividing cells has been exploited in several recently developed chemotherapy agents such as bortezomib and response to cellular stress in response to cellular stresses such as infection heat shock or oxidative damage heat shock proteins that identify misfolded or unfolded proteins and target them for proteasomal degradation are expressed both and chaperone proteins have been implicated in increasing activity of ubiquitin proteasome system though they are not direct participants in process hsp70 on other hand binds exposed hydrophobic patches on surface of misfolded proteins and recruits e3 ubiquitin ligases such as chip to tag proteins for proteasomal degradation chip protein carboxyl terminus of hsp70 interacting protein is itself regulated via inhibition of interactions between e3 enzyme chip and its e2 binding partner similar mechanisms exist to promote degradation of damaged proteins via proteasome system in particular proteasomes localized to nucleus are regulated by parp and actively degrade inappropriately oxidized histones oxidized proteins which often form large amorphous aggregates in cell can be degraded directly by 20s core particle without 19s regulatory cap and do not require atp hydrolysis or tagging with ubiquitin however high levels of oxidative damage increases degree of cross linking between protein fragments rendering aggregates resistant to proteolysis larger numbers and sizes of such highly oxidized aggregates are associated with aging dysregulation of ubiquitin proteasome system may contribute to several neural diseases it may lead to brain tumors such as in some of late onset neurodegenerative diseases that share aggregation of misfolded proteins as a common feature such as parkinson s disease and alzheimer s disease large insoluble aggregates of misfolded proteins can form and then result in neurotoxicity through mechanisms that are not yet well understood decreased proteasome activity has been suggested as a cause of aggregation and lewy body formation in parkinson s this hypothesis is supported by observation that yeast models of parkinson s are more susceptible to toxicity from a major protein component of lewy bodies under conditions of low proteasome activity impaired proteasomal activity may underlie cognitive disorders such as autism spectrum disorders and muscle and nerve diseases such as inclusion body myopathy role in immune system proteasome plays a straightforward but critical role in function of adaptive immune system peptide antigens are displayed by major histocompatibility complex class i mhc proteins on surface of antigen presenting cells these peptides are products of proteasomal degradation of proteins originated by invading pathogen although expressed proteasomes can participate in this process a specialized complex composed of proteins whose expression is induced by interferon gamma are primary producers of peptides which are optimal in size and composition for mhc binding these proteins whose expression increases during immune response include 11s regulatory particle whose main known biological role is regulating production of mhc ligands and specialized b subunits called b1i b2i and b5i with altered substrate specificity complex formed with specialized b subunits is known as immunoproteasome another b5i variant subunit is expressed in thymus leading to a thymus specific whose function is as yet unclear strength of mhc class i ligand binding is dependent on composition of ligand c terminus as peptides bind by hydrogen bonding and by close contacts with a region called b pocket on mhc surface many mhc class i alleles prefer hydrophobic c terminal residues and immunoproteasome complex is more likely to generate hydrophobic c termini due to its role in generating activated form of nf kb an anti apoptotic and pro inflammatory regulator of cytokine expression proteasomal activity has been linked to inflammatory and autoimmune diseases increased levels of proteasome activity correlate with disease activity and have been implicated in autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis proteasome is also involved in intracellular antibody mediated proteolysis of antibody bound virions in this neutralisation pathway a protein of tripartite motif family binds with immunoglobulin g to direct virion to proteasome where it is degraded proteasome inhibitors thumb 200px left chemical structure of bortezomib boronated form of mg132 a proteasome inhibitor used in chemotherapy that is particularly effective against

surrounded by local protein surface blue patch is catalytic threonine residue whose activity is blocked by presence of bortezomib proteasome inhibitors have effective anti tumor activity in cell culture inducing apoptosis by disrupting regulated degradation of pro growth cell cycle proteins this approach of selectively inducing apoptosis in tumor cells has proven effective in animal models

myeloma notably multiple myeloma has been observed to result in increased proteasome derived peptide levels in blood serum that decrease to normal levels in response to successful chemotherapy studies in animals have indicated that bortezomib may also have clinically significant effects in pancreatic cancer preclinical and early clinical studies have been started to examine bortezomib s effectiveness in treating other b cell related cancers particularly some types of non hodgkin s lymphoma clinical results also seem to justify use of proteasome inhibitor combined with chemotherapy for b cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia proteasome inhibitors can kill some types of cultured leukemia cells that are resistant to glucocorticoids molecule ritonavir marketed as was developed as a protease inhibitor and used to target hiv infection however it has been shown to inhibit proteasomes as well as free proteases to be specific chymotrypsin like activity of proteasome is inhibited by ritonavir while trypsin like activity is somewhat enhanced studies in animal models suggest that ritonavir may have inhibitory effects on growth of glioma cells proteasome inhibitors have also shown promise in treating autoimmune diseases in animal models for example studies in mice bearing human skin grafts found a reduction in size of lesions from psoriasis after treatment with a proteasome inhibitor inhibitors also show positive effects in rodent models of asthma labeling and inhibition of proteasome is also of interest in laboratory settings for both in vitro and in vivo study of proteasomal activity in cells most commonly used laboratory inhibitors are lactacystin and peptide aldehyde mg132 initially developed by goldberg lab fluorescent inhibitors have also been developed to specifically label active sites of assembled proteasome clinical significance proteasome and its subunits are of clinical significance for at least two reasons 1 a compromised complex assembly or a dysfunctional proteasome can be associated with underlying pathophysiology of specific diseases and 2 they can be exploited as drug targets for therapeutic interventions more recently more effort has been made to consider proteasome for development of novel diagnostic markers and strategies an improved and comprehensive understanding of pathophysiology of proteasome should lead to clinical applications in future proteasomes form a pivotal component for ubiquitin proteasome system ups and corresponding cellular protein quality control protein ubiquitination and subsequent proteolysis and degradation by proteasome are important mechanisms in regulation of cell cycle cell growth and differentiation gene transcription signal transduction and apoptosis subsequently a compromised proteasome complex assembly and function lead to reduced proteolytic activities and accumulation of damaged or misfolded protein species such protein accumulation may contribute to pathogenesis and phenotypic characteristics in neurodegenerative diseases cardiovascular diseases inflammatory responses and autoimmune diseases and systemic dna damage responses leading to malignancies several experimental and clinical studies have indicated that aberrations and of ups contribute to pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative and disorders including alzheimer s disease parkinson s disease and pick s disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als huntington s disease creutzfeldt jakob disease and motor neuron diseases diseases muscular and several rare forms of neurodegenerative diseases associated with dementia as part of ubiquitin proteasome system ups proteasome maintains cardiac protein homeostasis and thus plays a significant role in cardiac ischemic injury ventricular hypertrophy and heart failure additionally evidence is accumulating that ups plays an essential role in malignant transformation ups proteolysis plays a major role in responses of cancer cells to signals that are critical for development of cancer accordingly gene expression by degradation of transcription factors such as p53 c jun c fos nf kb c myc hif 1a sterol regulated element binding proteins and androgen receptors are all controlled by ups and thus involved in development of various malignancies moreover ups regulates degradation of tumor suppressor gene products such as coli apc in colorectal cancer rb and von hippel tumor suppressor vhl as well as a number of proto oncogenes raf myc myb rel src mos abl ups is also involved in regulation of inflammatory responses this activity is usually attributed to role of proteasomes in activation of nf kb which further regulates expression of pro inflammatory cytokines such as tnf a il b il 8 adhesion molecules 1 1 p selectin and prostaglandins and nitric oxide no additionally ups also plays a role in inflammatory responses as regulators of leukocyte proliferation mainly through proteolysis of and degradation of cdk
