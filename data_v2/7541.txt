magazine called song a clumsy collaboration in august 2018 same author placed it at number 78 on his raking of singer s singles writing forget uncharacteristic desperate crassness of choosing then hot lil wayne as a collaborator also ignore half heartedness of track s electroclash gestures what you have left is a sex equals guns metaphor that with each passing year in america grows more and more

there was darkness hung over much of first half of show because of performances of revolver and gang bang meanwhile madonna commented on a letter published in billboard i do not condone violence or use of guns rather they are symbols of wanting to appear strong and wanting to find a way to stop feelings that i find hurtful or damaging in my case it s wanting to stop lies and hypocrisy of church intolerance of many narrow minded cultures and societies i have experienced throughout my life and in some cases pain i have felt from having my heart broken track listing and formats itunes digital
