was a class of four battlecruisers built for imperial japanese navy ijn immediately before world war i designed by british naval architect george thurston lead ship of class was last japanese capital ship constructed outside japan by vickers at barrow in furness her sister ships haruna kirishima and hiei were all completed in japan during late 1920s all but hiei were reconstructed and reclassified as battleships after signing of london naval treaty in 1930 hiei was reconfigured as a training ship to avoid being scrapped following japan s withdrawal from london naval treaty all four underwent a massive second reconstruction in late 1930s following completion of these modifications which increased top speeds to over all four were reclassified as fast battleships kongo class battleships were most active capital ships of japanese navy during world war ii participating in most major engagements of war hiei and kirishima acted as escorts during attack on pearl harbor while kongo and haruna supported invasion of singapore all four participated in battles of midway and guadalcanal hiei and kirishima were both lost during naval battle of guadalcanal in november 1942 while haruna and kongo jointly bombarded american henderson field airbase on guadalcanal two remaining kongo class battleships spent most of 1943 shuttling between japanese naval bases before participating in major naval campaigns of 1944 haruna and kongo engaged american surface vessels during battle of leyte gulf kongo was torpedoed and sunk by submarine uss sealion in november 1944 while haruna was sunk at her moorings by an air attack in kure naval base in late july 1945 but later raised and scrapped in 1946 stille p 20 design thumb left kongo as she appeared in 1944 design of kongo class battlecruisers came about as a result of ijn s modernization programs as well as perceived need to compete with british royal navy in march 1908 royal navy launched at newcastle upon tyne armed with eight main guns invincible rendered all current and designed japanese capital ships obsolete by comparison in 1911 japanese diet passed emergency naval expansion bill authorizing construction of one battleship and four armoured cruisers to be designed by british naval architect george thurston gardiner and gray 1980 p 234 in his design of class thurston relied on many techniques that would eventually be used by british on under terms of contract signed with vickers in november 1910 one member of kongo class lead ship kongo was to be built in britain and vickers was to maximize transfer of naval technology to japan design of ships was from vickers design corresponding to japanese design designation b 46 original design featured eight or ten 12 inch 304 8 mm 50 calibre guns sixteen guns and eight torpedo tubes commander kato pushed for adoption of a new 45 calibre gun that was currently under development after trials of new gun which were witnessed by both japanese navy and royal navy japanese made decision on 29 nov 1911 to use new gun despite keel having already been laid down on 17 january 1911 and resulting need to quickly make a large number of alterations to design so as to not prolong construction lengerer p 142 final design of battlecruisers resulted in an improved version of displacing an estimated 27 940 tonnes 27 500 long tons jackson 2000 p 48 it also called for eight 14 inch guns mounted in four twin gun turrets two forward and two aft with a top speed of jackson 2008 p 27 to ensure transfer of latest design knowledge to japan more than 100 technical specialists were sent on 18 months from japan to vickers during construction phase of kongo if superintendents supervisors and trial witnesses are also included then about 200 japanese spent time in britain lengerer p 144 description ships had a length of overall and a beam of they had a draft of and displaced at normal load propulsion kongo class ships had two sets of parsons direct drive steam turbines except for harunas brown curtis turbines each of which drove two propeller shafts high pressure turbines drove wing shafts while low pressure turbines drove inner shafts turbines were arranged in two compartments separated by a centerline longitudinal bulkhead both compartments were situated between turrets no 3 and 4 they were designed to produce a total of using steam provided by 36 yarrow or kampon water tube boilers with working pressures ranging from lengerer pp 156 boilers arranged in eight compartments were mixed firing with fuel oil sprayed onto coal for extra power ships had a stowage capacity of of coal and of oil giving them a range of at a speed of whitley pp 178 180 battlecruisers were designed to reach a speed of and all of them exceeded that speed on their sea trials kongo and hiei attained and with and respectively lengerer p 152 in their first reconstruction during late 1920s ships were reboilered with 10 11 hiei or 16 haruna kampon boilers and their fuel stowage was rearranged to accommodate of coal and of oil this increased their range to at 14 knots and allowed fore funnel to be removed which greatly decreased smoke interference with bridge and fire control systems coupled with addition of external torpedo bulges this reduced their speed to and caused ijn to reclassify them as battleships wiper p 71 during their 1930s reconstructions into fast battleships existing boilers were removed and replaced with eleven oil fired kampon boilers these upgraded boilers gave kongo and her sister ships much greater power with ships of class capable of speeds exceeding this made them only japanese battleships at time fully suited to operations alongside fast aircraft carriers armament thumb right a 14 inch gun being installed aboard haruna october 1914 primary armament of kongo class consisted of eight 45 calibre 14 inch guns mounted in four superfiring twin gun turrets turrets had an elevation capability of 5 20 degrees except in kongo whose turrets had a maximum elevation capability of 25 degrees shells could be loaded at any p 157 and guns had a firing cycle of 30 40 seconds campbell p 183 these guns and their turrets underwent multiple modernizations throughout ships careers during first reconstruction of class during 1920s elevation of main guns was increased to a maximum of 33 degrees recoil mechanism of guns was also changed from a hydraulic to pneumatic system which allowed for a faster firing cycle of main guns campbell p 184 by world war ii guns used type 91 armor piercing capped shells each of these shells weighed and had a muzzle velocity of they had a maximum range of at 20 degrees of elevation and at 43 degrees after modernisation skulski p 19 also available was a high explosive shell that had a muzzle velocity of a special type 3 incendiary shrapnel shell was developed in 1930s for anti aircraft use as built kongo class was fitted with a secondary armament of sixteen 50 caliber six inch guns mounted in single casemates along sides of hull at level of upper deck eight guns were mounted per side and each had an arc of fire of 130 degrees and a maximum elevation of 15 degrees each gun could fire a high explosive projectile a maximum distance of at a rate of between four and six shots per minute during their reconstruction in 1930s maximum elevation of guns was increased to 30 degrees which increased their maximum range by approximately skulski p 20 during their second reconstruction two of these guns were removed from each ship bringing total to fourteen six inch guns ships also mounted four 40 caliber 76 mm anti aircraft aa guns high angle guns were in single mounts each of these guns had a maximum elevation of 75 degrees and could fire a projectile with a muzzle velocity of to a maximum height of both ships were equipped with eight submerged torpedo tubes four on each broadside stille p 15 kongo class s secondary armament changed significantly over time during modernizations of 1930s all of 76 mm guns were replaced with eight 40 caliber 40 dual purpose guns these guns were fitted on both sides of fore and aft superstructures in four twin gun mounts when firing at surface targets guns had a range of they had a maximum ceiling of at their maximum elevation of 90 degrees their maximum rate of fire was 14 rounds a minute but their sustained rate of fire was around eight rounds per minute campbell pp 192 93 during reconstruction two foremost 152 mm guns were also removed skulski p 30 light aa armament of kongo class changed dramatically from 1933 to 1944 during second reconstruction ships were fitted with four to eight twin machine guns later replaced by gun mounts both weapons were license built french hotchkiss designs campbell pp 200 202 25 mm guns were mounted on kongo class in single double and triple mounts this model was standard japanese light anti aircraft gun during world war ii but it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it a largely ineffective weapon twin and triple mounts lacked sufficient speed in train or elevation gun sights were unable to handle fast targets gun exhibited excessive vibration magazine was too small and finally gun produced excessive muzzle blast stille p 11 haruna ultimately carried 118 guns in 30 triple two twin and 24 single mounts armour kongo class battlecruisers were designed with intention of maximizing speed and maneuverability and as such were not as heavily armoured as later japanese capital ships nevertheless kongo class possessed significant quantities of armour and were heavily upgraded during their modernizations in their initial configuration kongo class possessed an upper belt that was thick and a lower belt with a thickness of moore p 165 vickers cemented was used in construction of kongo while original armour of other three was constructed of a variation of krupp cemented armour designed by german krupp arms works subsequent developments of japanese armour technology relied upon a hybrid design of two variations until drastic changes were made during design of yamato class in 1938 armoured belt near bow and stern of vessels was strengthened with an additional of cemented armour conning tower of kongo class was very heavily armoured with variations of krupp cemented armour up to thick turrets were lightly armoured compared to later designs with a maximum plate thickness of deck armour ranged from during reconstructions that each ship underwent during interwar period most of armour of kongo class was heavily upgraded main lower belt was strengthened to be a uniform thickness of 8 inches while diagonal bulkheads of a depth ranging from reinforced main armoured belt mccurtie p 185 upper belt remained unchanged but was closed by 9 inch bulkheads at bow and stern of ships turret armour was strengthened to while were added to portions of deck armour armour upgrades increased displacement by close to 4 000 tons on each ship violating terms of washington treaty even after these modifications armour capacity of kongo class remained much less than that of newer capital ships a factor which played a major role in sinking of hiei and

modern battlecruisers of imperial japanese navy according to naval historian robert jackson they outclassed all other contemporary capital ships design was so successful that construction of fourth battlecruiser of lion class was halted so that design features of kongo class could be added kongo thumb right kongo following her first reconstruction kongo was laid down 17 january 1911 at barrow in furness launched 18 may 1912 and commissioned 16 august 1913 she arrived in yokosuka via singapore in november 1913 to undergo armaments sighting checks in kure naval arsenal being placed in reserve upon her arrival on 23 august 1914 japan formally declared war on german empire as part of her contribution to anglo japanese alliance and kongo was deployed near midway island to patrol communications lines of pacific ocean attached to third battleship division of first fleet following 1922 washington naval treaty kongo and her contemporaries including ships in and es were only japanese capital ships to avoid scrapyard jackson 2000 p 69 on 1 november 1924 kongo docked at yokosuka for modifications which improved fire control and main gun elevation and increased her antiaircraft armament in september 1929 she began her first major reconstruction her horizontal armour boilers and machinery space were all improved and she was equipped to carry type 90 model 0 floatplanes when her reconstruction was completed on 31 march 1931 she was reclassified as a battleship from october 1933 to november 1934 kongo was flagship of japanese combined fleet before being

on 4 november 1911 launched 21 november 1912 and commissioned at sasebo 4 august 1914 attached to third battleship division of first fleet after conducting patrols off china and in east china sea during world war i hiei was placed in reserve in 1920 after undergoing minor reconstructions in 1924 and 1927 hiei was demilitarized in 1929 to avoid being scrapped under terms of washington treaty she was converted to a training ship in kure from 1929 to 1932 all of her armour and most of her armament were removed under restrictions of treaty and carefully preserved in 1933 she was refitted as an imperial service ship and following further reconstruction in 1934 became emperor s ship in late 1935 imperial service ships were used by japanese royalty for naval transport in 1937 following japan s withdrawal from london treaty hiei underwent a massive reconstruction along lines similar to those of her sister ships when reconstruction was completed on 31 january 1940 hiei was reclassified as a battleship hiei sailed in november 1941 as an escort of vice admiral chuichi nagumo s carrier force which attacked pearl harbor hiei provided escort cover during carrier raids on

position over next day hiei was attacked by american aircraft many different times while trying to evade an attack at 14 00 hiei lost her emergency rudder and began to show a list to stern and starboard hiei was scuttled northwest of savo island on evening of 13 november by japanese destroyers kirishima thumb right kirishima off amoy china in 1938 keel was laid in mitsubishi s nagasaki yard on 17 march 1912 she was launched about a year and a half later 1 december 1913 and transferred to sasebo naval arsenal for fitting out after her completion on 19 april 1915 she served off japan china and korea s coasts during first world war after war she alternated between being based in japan and patrolling off japanese ports on 14 september 1922 she collided with destroyer causing minor damage to both ships kirishima also assisted rescue efforts in aftermath of devastating 1923 great kanto earthquake which destroyed most of tokyo after being sent to reserve fleet in december 1923 she received a refit during 1924 returning to main fleet battlecruiser operated off china for periods of time in 1925 1926 until she returned to reserve from 1927 to 1931 in preparation for a major reconstruction her superstructure was rebuilt and she received extensive upgrades to armour propulsion and waterline bulges after a period of fleet duty in early 1930s she underwent a two year reconstruction 1934 1936 to rebuild her as a fast battleship this upgrade improved her engine plant redesigned superstructure lengthened stern and enabled her to equip floatplanes after serving as a transport and support ship during second sino japanese war kirishima escorted aircraft carrier strikeforce bound for attack on pearl harbor in december 1941 following start of world war ii kirishima served as an escort during carrier attacks on port darwin and dutch east indies kirishima joined her sister ships in escorting naval sorties against ceylon boyle p 370 she once again served escort duty during disastrous battle of midway before transferring to truk lagoon in preparation for operations against american landings on guadalcanal after participating in battles of eastern solomons and santa cruz kirishima joined hiei in a night attack on 13 november 1942 following loss of latter on evening of 13 november kirishima subsequently engaged american battleships on night of 14 15 november she managed to inflict superficial damage on but she was in turn caught off guard while attacking south dakota and was crippled by with her engines largely disabled and listing heavily to starboard kirishima was abandoned in early morning of 15 november 1942 she capsized and sank at 03 25 with loss of 212 of her crew haruna thumb right haruna in 1934 following her second reconstruction haruna was laid down at kobe by kawasaki on 16 march 1912 launched 14 december 1913 and formally commissioned 19 april 1915 after a short patrolling duty off sasebo haruna suffered a breech explosion during gunnery drills on 12 september 1920 seven crewmen were killed and no 1 turret badly damaged after a long period of time in reserve haruna underwent her first modernization from 1926 to 1928 process upgraded her propulsion capabilities enabled her to carry and launch floatplanes increasing her armour capacity by over 4 000 tons and was shortly thereafter reclassified as a battleship she was overhauled a second time from 1933 to 1935 which additionally strengthened her armour and reclassified her as a fast battleship during second sino japanese war haruna primarily served as a large scale troop transport for japanese troops to chinese mainland on eve of commencement of world war ii haruna sailed as part of vice admiral nobutake kondo s southern force on 8 december 1941 haruna provided heavy support for invasion of malaya and singapore willmott 2002 p 56 she participated in major japanese offensives in southern and southwestern pacific in early 1942 before sailing as part of carrier strike force during battle of midway haruna bombarded american positions at henderson field at guadalcanal and provided escort to carriers during solomon islands campaign in 1943 she deployed as part of a larger force on multiple occasions to counter threat of american carrier strikes but did not actively participate in a single battle in 1944 haruna was an escort during battle of philippine sea and fought american surface vessels off samar during battle of leyte gulf boyle p 508 she was only one of four battleships in her class to survive 1944 jackson 2000 p 127 haruna remained at kure
