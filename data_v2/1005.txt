yellow stingray urobatis jamaicensis is a species of stingray in family found in tropical western atlantic ocean from north carolina to trinidad this bottom dwelling species inhabits sandy muddy or seagrass bottoms in shallow inshore waters commonly near coral reefs reaching no more than across yellow stingray has a round pectoral fin disc and a short tail with a well developed caudal fin it has a highly variable but distinctive dorsal color pattern consisting of either light on dark or dark on light reticulations forming spots and blotches and can rapidly change tonality of this coloration to improve its camouflage relatively sedentary during day yellow stingray feeds on small invertebrates and bony fishes when hunting it may undulate its disc to uncover buried prey or lift front of its disc to form a cave attractive to shelter seeking organisms this species is aplacental viviparous meaning that developing embryos are sustained initially by yolk and later by histotroph uterine milk females bear two litters of up to seven young per year in seagrass following a gestation period of 5 6 months though innocuous towards humans yellow stingray can inflict a painful injury with its venomous tail spine this species is taken as bycatch by commercial fisheries and collected for aquarium trade it may also be negatively affected by habitat degradation nevertheless it remains common and widespread which has led international union for conservation of nature iucn to list it under least concern taxonomy and phylogeny french naturalist georges cuvier originally described yellow stingray as raia jamaicensis in 1816 in le regne animal d apres son organisation pour servir de base a l histoire naturelle des animaux et d introduction a l anatomie he based his account on specimens obtained from jamaica though no type specimens were designated subsequent authors moved this species to genus urolophus and then to genus urobatis some literature still refers to this species as urolophus jamaicensis other common names used for this ray include yellow spotted ray round ray and maid ray nathan lovejoy s 1996 phylogenetic analysis based on morphology found that yellow stingray is most basal member of a clade that also contains pacific urobatis species and genus of central and south america this finding would render urobatis polyphyletic though further study is warranted to elucidate relationships between these taxa description thumb left alt ray with numerous fine dark vermiculations on an almost white background blending in with sand it s resting on yellow stingray is capable of adjusting its coloration to better blend into environment yellow stingray is small growing no more than across and long it has a nearly circular pectoral fin disc slightly longer than wide with a short obtuse snout eyes are immediately followed by spiracles there is a narrow curtain of skin between nostrils with a fringed posterior margin mouth is nearly straight and contains a transverse row of 3 5 papillae on floor there are 30 34 tooth rows in upper jaw and a similar number in lower jaw arranged into bands teeth are broad based with low blunt crowns in females and juveniles and tall pointed cusps in adult males teeth of males are more widely spaced than those of females pelvic fins have nearly straight leading margins and rounded trailing margins tail is stout and flattened comprising less than half total length and terminates in a small leaf shaped caudal fin about a quarter high as long that is continuous around last vertebra a serrated spine is positioned about halfway along tail newborn rays are smooth skinned shortly after birth small blunt tubercles appear in middle of back which in larger adults extends to between eyes shoulders and base of tail adults also develop recurved thorns along upper margin of caudal fin color and pattern of yellow stingray varies significantly among individuals though most follow one of two schemes minute dark green or brown reticulations on a light background or dense white yellow or golden spots on a dark green or brown background underside is yellowish greenish or brownish white with small darker spots toward disc margin and tail this species is capable of rapidly changing tone and contrast of its coloration to better match its environment distribution and habitat thumb upright 1 2 alt ray with fine dark lines on a light background swimming over an invertebrate encrusted bottom yellow stingray prefers habitats with a dense covering of invertebrates yellow stingray is found throughout inshore waters of gulf of mexico where it is only representative of its family and caribbean sea including florida bahamas and greater and lesser antilles to trinidad on rare occasions it ranges as far north as cape lookout in north carolina it is quite abundant in florida keys and parts of antilles and rather uncommon elsewhere off mexico this species occupies a salinity range of 26 40 ppt benthic in nature yellow stingray inhabits coastal habitats such as bays lagoons estuaries and low energy surf zones and has been reported from water s edge to a depth of it particularly favors insular hard bottomed habitats with a dense encrustation of sessile invertebrates termed live bottom habitats but can also be found over sand mud or seagrass sometimes in vicinity of coral reefs off jamaica large numbers of yellow stingrays up to one per square meter gather beneath aerial roots of mangrove trees used as roosts by cattle egrets bubulcus ibis it is theorized that birds droppings sustain invertebrates that attract rays there is no evidence of seasonal migration though during spring females tend to be found closer to shore than males biology and ecology thumb upright 1 2 biofluorescence of yellow stingray during day yellow stingray is fairly inactive and spends much time buried under a thin layer of sediment or lying motionless in vegetation tracking studies have shown that it generally remains within a small home range of around with individuals covering only a portion of entire area on any particular day it favors boundaries between different terrain such as sand and reef its periscopic eyes give it a 360deg panoramic view of its surroundings each eye bears an elaborate covering or operculum that allows fine control over amount of light entering pupil therefore resting ray is well equipped to detect approaching predators which may potentially include any large carnivorous fish such as tiger shark galeocerdo cuvier yellow stingray is most sensitive to sounds of 300 600 hertz which is fairly typical among sharks and rays that have been investigated thus far it and other stingrays have a large brain relative to other rays comprising around 1 2 of body weight diet of yellow stingray is poorly documented but includes shrimps and likely also worms clams and small bony fishes typically ray will settle over a prey item and trap it against bottom whereupon it is manipulated to mouth with motions of disc like related round stingray u this species sometimes uses undulations of its disc margins to excavate pits and reveal buried prey it has also been observed raising front of its disc to create a shaded cave to attract shelter seeking organisms known parasites of yellow stingray include tapeworms acanthobothrium phyllobothrium rhinebothrium and r and monogenean dendromonocotyle yellow stingray exhibits biofluorescence that is when illuminated by blue or ultraviolet light it re emits it as green and appears differently than under white light illumination biofluorescence potentially assists intraspecific communication and camouflage life history thumb upright 1 2 left alt ray swimming over a dense bed of seagrass seagrass beds are important reproductive habitat for yellow stingrays like other stingrays yellow stingray is aplacental viviparous at first embryos are sustained by yolk which is later supplanted by uterine milk rich in proteins and lipids delivered by mother through numerous finger like extensions of uterine epithelium called trophonemata mature females have two functional uteruses with left used more than right except in a few individuals only left ovary is functional reproductive cycle is biannual with a 5 6 month long gestation period first period of ovulation occurs from january to april peaking in late february and early march with birthing from june to september peaking in late july and early august second period of ovulation occurs from august to september with birthing from november to january two cycles overlap as yolk formation begins while female is still pregnant courtship and mating in yellow stingray involves one or more males closely following a female seeking to bite and grip rear margin of her disc high pointed teeth of males serve to aid in this endeavor once male successfully holds onto female he flips under her so that two are aligned abdomen to abdomen and inserts a single clasper into her cloaca rival males may attempt to interfere with mating pair by biting or bumping them in one observation that took place in water deep near tobacco caye on belize barrier reef male pursuit lasted between 30 and 60 seconds and copulation lasted four minutes predominant source of embryonic nutrition is histotroph which supports a 46 fold weight increase from ovum to near term fetus by time embryo is across it has fully resorbed its yolk sac and external gills litter size ranges from one to seven first litter of year spring summer is larger than second autumn winter with number of offspring increasing with size of female this relationship is not observed for second litter on other hand newborns of first litter tend to be slightly smaller than those of second litter at an average length of versus second litter s fewer larger young may reflect lower temperatures of autumn winter which results in slower growth seagrass beds serve as important habitat for parturition newborns emerge tail first and are similar in coloration to adults though disc is relatively wider they also have a small knob or tentacle that covers most of spiracle which is resorbed shortly after birth males and females reach sexual maturity at disc widths of and respectively maximum lifespan is 15 25 years human interactions thumb alt a ray over a pebble bottom with front of a second ray to its right yellow stingrays at mote marine laboratory florida generally yellow stingrays pay little heed to divers and can be approached closely if stepped on or otherwise provoked however this ray will defend itself with its tail spine coated in potent venom resulting wound is extremely painful but seldom life threatening small and docile yellow stingray adapts readily to captivity and has reproduced in aquarium it requires a large amount of space at least 180 gal or 684 l and a fine deep substrate with minimal ornamentation international union for conservation of nature iucn has listed yellow stingray under least concern citing its wide distribution and high abundance in certain regions in addition its small size implies relatively high productivity which would make its population more resilient to fishing pressure this species is not targeted commercially but is probably taken incidentally by inshore fisheries throughout its range it is also harvested for home aquarium trade being most frequently available member of its family on north american market extent of this trade has not yet been quantified another potential threat is habitat degradation particularly to seagrass beds no conservation measures have been enacted for this species gallery references external links urobatis jamaicensis yellow stingray at fishbase urobatis jamaicensis yellow stingray at iucn red
