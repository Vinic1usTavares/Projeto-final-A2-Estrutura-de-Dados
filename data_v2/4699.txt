mclaren mp4 30 was a formula one racing car designed by tim goss and neil oatley for mclaren to compete in 2015 formula one season car was driven by and world drivers champion fernando alonso who returned to mclaren eight years after he last drove for team and world champion jenson button kevin magnussen who drove for team in temporarily stood in for alonso after a test accident additional testing and development work was carried out by magnussen stoffel vandoorne and oliver turvey car was first built by mclaren since mp4 7a which contested season to be powered by a honda engine known as ra615h after mclaren ended their twenty year partnership with mercedes at end of season car was nicknamed size zero formula one car by team for its distinct sharply tapered rear end which was achieved by designing honda engine to operate at higher temperatures than other engines at end of season car recorded a best finish of fifth place at and had scored just twenty seven points leaving mclaren ninth in world constructors championship button and alonso were classified in sixteenth and seventeenth positions respectively in world drivers championship while magnussen was not formally classified as he did not start one race that he entered this made 2015 most difficult season in formula one that team had endured in thirty five years as a string of technical problems and retirements compromised car s performance an analysis of project pointed towards failure in communication between mclaren and honda honda under estimating technology required for engine and critical faults in engine s design as cause of team s problems partnership was originally intended to last for ten years but was terminated after three as mp4 30 s successors mp4 31 and continued to struggle with underpowered and unreliable honda engines design and development thumb mclaren mp4 7a which contested season was last car built by mclaren that used a honda engine v12 honda e design team having developed mclaren mp4 29 in 2014 tim goss and neil oatley returned to design and build mp4 30 peter who previously worked for mclaren between and was recruited back to team from red bull racing where he had served as team s head of aerodynamics to aid in designing mp4 30 and to oversee team s trackside operations alongside former sauber designer matt morris ra615h engine was developed at honda s automobile research and development facilities in in tochigi prefecture same facility used to develop honda civic wtcc for use in world touring car championship and honda nsx gt to compete in japanese super gt championship with project led by yasuhisa arai early development honda had previously competed in formula one as a constructor when they purchased british american racing in 2006 before selling team to brawn gp ahead of 2009 season with sport introducing a brand new engine formula in 2014 and mercedes their engine supplier establishing their own team mclaren sought a new engine supplier with a view to a long term relationship partnership with honda was first announced in may 2013 and ra615h engine spent next eighteen months in development team used mercedes hybrid engine in mclaren mp4 29 throughout 2014 season development of mclaren mp4 30 started with mclaren mp4 29h 1x1 a variation of mp4 29 that was developed to test new engine car made appearances at test sessions at silverstone and yas marina circuits where it was driven by mclaren s testing and development driver stoffel vandoorne testing programme of mp4 29h 1x1 was limited by technical problems with engine that prevented significant running and chassis was shelved following its appearance at yas marina with team carrying engine over to mp4 30 chassis ahead of first pre season test of season at jerez de la frontera car was first of 2015 entries to pass its mandatory crash tests getting final approval from federation internationale de l automobile fia in december 2014 pre season testing mp4 30 made its debut at first pre season test at circuito de jerez team endured a difficult start with ra615h engine suffering from a series of recurring mechanical faults that restricted team s running over four days and they finished test having completed least amount of mileage among those present issues that had plagued car were not resolved in time for second test at circuit de barcelona catalunya prompting mclaren to replace some parts supplied by honda with parts that they had developed independently in 2014 team finally managed to get some substantial running in during final test in barcelona after completing just seven laps on first day jenson button was able to complete over one hundred on second however with two weeks until opening race longest stint of continuous running that mp4 30 had completed was twelve laps of barcelona circuit this distance is less than a quarter of a full grand prix distance of testing accident team s pre season preparations were overshadowed by an accident involving fernando alonso on final day of testing that saw alonso hospitalised with a concussion and ruled out of third and final test kevin magnussen mclaren s test and reserve driver was drafted in as his replacement for remainder of test and opening round of season alonso later attributed accident to a steering failure although mclaren maintained that there was no evidence of a car failure in telemetry data following accident power unit honda ra615h an analysis of ra615h revealed that honda had developed power unit with 2016 season in mind although no substantial revisions to technical regulations had been put forward decision was made so that honda could make a head start on developing its 2016 engine without wasting time trying to maintain development of a juvenile power unit in 2015 furthermore with mclaren developing mp4 30 to have tight packaging honda introduced several radical concepts to engine that allowed them to develop a smaller engine that weighed just and would fit within confines of chassis with trade off being that it required additional water cooling to keep temperatures under control first turbocharger was split and positioned alongside motor generator unit heat mgu h generator harvesting heat energy from exhaust manifold used to power turbine and positioned within cylinder banks forming v configuration of engine in order to make this fit honda eschewed use of a centrifugal fan in its single stage compressor in favour of using several smaller fans positioned at intervals along a shaft although this would limit ability of turbocharger to build up maximum amount of boost pressure fuel flow limit introduced in 2014 minimised impact of this motor generator unit kinetic mgu k generator harvesting energy from engine spinning while under braking was positioned in front of engine to deliver energy directly to crankshaft following convention established with introduction of kinetic energy recovery system in batteries housing energy harvested by mgu h and mgu k were merged with electronic control unit and positioned in front of engine both mgu h and mgu k were capable of harvesting of energy per lap however under 2015 regulations both systems could only deploy of energy per lap at it was noted that honda had taken unusual step of giving each engine an individual designation such as greyhawk and erica in season development with each engine manufacturer on 2015 grid being granted some limited scope to develop their engines mclaren and honda were given some leeway to develop ra615h power unit before it was required to be homologated despite having had eighteen months of uninterrupted development prior to first race under 2015 regulations power units were divided into thirty two areas for development and honda were given permission to develop nine over course of season first engine updates were introduced at aimed at improving reliability of motor generator units but by mid season engine was reported to be producing less power than mercedes hybrid engine benchmark of 2015 grid during preparations for ron dennis mclaren ceo and chairman noted that team was encouraged by aerodynamic data they had collected on chassis particularly its mid corner speeds which he claimed were similar to those produced by other teams he further added that car s performance issues could be traced back to a lack of outright power and poor fuel efficiency from engine eric boullier team principal further suggested that main problem that team faced was improving efficiency of ra615h s energy recovery systems both in harvesting and deploying additional power and that by developing these areas car could make up several seconds on lap time enough for car to compete regularly for podium finishes after engine struggled with reliability issues throughout first half of season yasuhisa arai declared himself happy with honda s progress following british grand prix and announced that development focus would switch to improving performance of ra615h ahead of next round of planned updates at with plans for a wider range of updates spread out over remainder of season with earmarked as first race that would be representative of new engine s performance honda predicted that updated ra615h would produce enough horsepower to rival ferrari 059 4 engine despite being an average slower than fastest driver through speed trap over first half of season an analysis of engine s performance revealed that it had gradually reduced deficit to renault energy f1 2015 yasuhisa arai went on to suggest that engine had a advantage over renault but was still an estimated behind mercedes updates introduced in belgium included changes to combustion chamber intake and exhaust aimed at reducing stress on other engine components to allow them to operate at peak efficiency an analysis of team s mechanical problems further suggested that there was a critical fault in internal combustion chamber that was having a residual effect on other components by placing undue stress on them and an inefficient mgu h that was using energy faster than it could be harvested with net effect that engine would lose up to halfway through a lap during race car was observed to be harvesting energy at top of kemmel straight fastest point on circuit while other cars were deploying their energy at same place despite arai s insistence that ra615h had an advantage over renault engine fernando alonso estimated that car was losing up to three seconds per lap to mercedes at and was unable to attack or defend its position against renault powered scuderia toro rosso cars even with drag reduction system deployed alonso s comments came amidst first public signs of tension between mclaren and honda with reports that team had requested that arai be removed from his position as project manager an analysis of development carried out by rival manufacturers revealed that both mercedes and ferrari had found an additional over course of season through development of bespoke fuel blends and reconfiguration of their combustion chambers to promote more efficient fuel burning offsetting gains made by honda honda started to introduce their third and final round of upgrades ahead of focusing on internal combustion engine and associated exhaust parts with aim of improving efficiency of mgu h and gradually introducing new parts over next three rounds engine ancillaries were reconfigured to allow for better packaging within chassis while axial compressor was replaced with a more conventional albeit smaller design exhaust wastegate was also updated ahead of planned development for 2016 with exhaust outlets reconfigured to improve engine s power curve honda chose to focus on internal combustion engine instead of directly addressing problems with mgu h as they felt that problems could not be adequately addressed with their remaining allowance for in season development and instead deferred development of mgu h until end of season when restrictions on development would be lifted upgrades were given to alonso with button scheduled to receive them two rounds later at updates were received positively by alonso who pointed out that he had been setting lap times that were faster than those recorded by lewis hamilton during opening phase of race and that team had identified potential to gain two and a half seconds per lap in 2016 through further refining of engine and by adopting aerodynamic design elements used by other teams button was less optimistic pointing out that engine would struggle in mexico as high altitude of autodromo hermanos rodriguez some above sea level would leave turbine down on power given low density of air although team s predictions of a difficult weekend were proven true after qualifying they highlighted deficit to leading mercedes through less power dependent sectors of circuit as being consistently within three tenths of a second narrowest margin had been over course of season reception ra615h was widely criticised by wider formula one community with team s struggles becoming a recurring theme throughout 2015 season this criticism was particularly directed at honda s project manager yasuhisa arai and rigidly compartmentalised structure between two companies that saw honda develop engine independently of and with minimal input from mclaren and their failure to recruit any engineers from rival engine manufacturers mercedes ferrari and renault even after arai s acknowledgement that honda had underestimated demands of sport and technology required to compete responding to criticism arai claimed that size zero approach demanded by mclaren attempting to create a more compact design to fit tight packaging of mp4 30 chassis had compromised overall design of engine and limited ability to develop it over course of season fernando alonso defended move suggesting that honda s independent development programme would make it difficult for other manufacturers to copy ra615h s design mclaren ceo ron dennis took a broader view attributing team s difficult season to a range of factors including chassis development and staff morale rather than engine performance alone further criticism was directed towards mclaren s decision to consciously limit honda s involvement in sport to supplying a single team with scuderia toro rosso and embattled manor marussia touted as a potential honda customer to gather additional data however team rejected criticism arguing that infrastructure needed to establish such a partnership would distract from their own campaign and earmarking season as earliest possible date that an expansion could be considered with team revising its performance targets down from podiums to regular points eric boullier acknowledged that team would be facing a budgetary shortfall for 2016 season estimated to be some us 23 million ps15 million as team had originally anticipated finishing fifth rather than ninth in world constructors championship and with it a great share of prize money in build up to alonso noted that although addressing power unit s shortcomings remained team s biggest challenge he was unhappy with some of their trackside operations citing a lack of running in friday practice sessions under preparedness in starting procedures and pit stops and unreliability of other parts such as gearbox as compounding problems with engine after being powerless to defend against repeated overtakes during race alonso was overheard condemning ra615h as embarrassing and a gp2 engine over radio despite honda alluding to running engine at its peak performance at former driver and sky sports commentator martin brundle opined that he felt mclaren were pursuing a research and development programme rather than a pure racing programme and so were looking for different outcomes for season rather than outright results with button qualifying thirteenth for half a second behind red bull of daniil kvyat brundle described team as having made their first meaningful progress of season however three races later and following upgrade introduced in mexico brundle said that engine was still down on power inefficient and lacking reliability and therefore suffering same issues that had plagued it since start of season at conclusion of 2015 season yasuhisa arai left his role within team he was replaced by yusuke hasegawa managing director of honda research and development as honda focused on development of ra615h s successor competition history season review opening rounds two weeks before fernando alonso withdrew from race on medical advice following his testing accident having driven in alonso s stead during pre season testing kevin magnussen remained with team for race team endured a difficult start to season in melbourne as button and magnussen qualified on final row of grid detuning engine ahead of race to preserve its reliability button would later be recorded going through speed trap at some slower than fastest car in a race of attrition button was final classified finisher in eleventh position two laps behind race winner in doing so he completed mp4 30 s first full race distance magnussen did not make it to start after his engine failed whilst driving to grid alonso returned to team for where engine was to operate at a higher level of performance and team introduced a range of aerodynamic updates including sidepod fins and a new front wing however alonso and button still qualified on penultimate row of grid ahead of manor marussia drivers roberto merhi and will stevens both cars retired from race with mechanical problems team did not score any points during first round of flyaway races struggling with poor reliability and a lack of engine performance chinese grand prix was only race where both cars were classified as finishing although alonso repeated team s best finish of eleventh place in bahrain any hope of improved performance was arrested with start of european season at next round in spain where button finished sixteenth and alonso retired with brake problems european season button scored car s first points in monaco with an eighth place finish he later attributed result to having confidence in car noting that he could raise ride height at front end of car and brake heavily without locking brakes or bottoming out and hitting road but without compromising performance of car when turning in to apex of a corner however in following races in canada and austria team s struggles came to a head as they were forced to reduce power output of engine to levels that had not been used since australia and could not therefore provide a competitive package for long straights and slow corners of circuit gilles villeneuve and red bull ring in addition with their arrival in austria both button and alonso had used up their quota of engine components for season which combined with unscheduled gearbox changes resulted in both drivers receiving twenty five place grid penalties team also introduced their first major aerodynamic updates for season replacing snub nose of original design with a squared off front end similar to designs of williams fw37 and red bull rb11 rear of floor was also revised with a series of slots cut into body in front of rear wheels to change air pressure flowing towards diffuser team only saw limited running as alonso retired on opening lap after a collision with kimi raikkonen but they were able to assess new design at a post race test after enduring four consecutive retirements alonso scored his first point of season with a tenth place finish in great britain thumb right mclaren struggled with engine reliability issues throughout season pictured is fernando alonso pushing his car back to pits after his engine failed during qualifying for with sporting regulations amended to allow honda to supply an extra engine without penalty mclaren opted to use it in hungary where tight confines of hungaroring and lower demands on outright power were expected to benefit mp4 30 despite further reliability problems preventing car from reaching final qualifying session as team expected both button and alonso expressed satisfaction with feeling of chassis and team s development describing it as their best weekend of season team went on to record their first finish with both cars in points after alonso finished fifth and button ninth and team went into summer break with seventeen points five points behind sauber in world constructors championship mclaren deliberately introduced two brand new engines for both alonso and button at effectively moving them to back of grid but allowing them to contest italian and singapore grands prix deemed to be crucial races in assessing engine s development without risk of a penalty despite this plan team were forced to take another penalty in italy when further engine changes were needed bringing their total use up to nine engines from original allocation of four belgium also saw team s second major aerodynamic update team added extra fins to front of floor to improve air flow under car lowered height of sidepods and revised engine cover position of radiator used to cool energy recovery system was also changed both cars completed belgian grand prix but once again finished outside points one lap down in thirteenth and fourteenth place button described result as embarrassing after both cars were classified as finishing behind sebastian vettel despite vettel retiring from race on final lap team reverted to longer specification snub nose for italian grand prix in order to provide better aerodynamic balance and lower drag on high speed autodromo nazionale monza circuit change proved to be of little benefit as both drivers were eliminated in first qualifying period and struggled throughout race button finished in fourteenth while alonso retired with an electrical problem but was classified in eighteenth position as he had completed 90 of race winner lewis hamilton s race distance race marked a milestone of fifty races since mclaren s last grand prix win at 2012 brazilian grand prix asian and american rounds with championship returning to asia for second round of flyaway races team arrived in singapore confident of scoring points despite both cars advancing to second period of qualifying and running in top ten throughout race both cars retired with gearbox problems alonso was forced out after his car kept selecting neutral without input a problem that affected several drivers button was involved in contact with pastor maldonado while trying to pass slow moving alexander rossi during a safety car restart before his gearbox overheated after experimenting with a new front wing designed to improve air flow around front tyres during free practice in singapore team introduced parts at next race in japan one week later however team struggled with tyre pressures following sebastian vettel s high speed tyre blow out during belgian grand prix fia introduced a mandatory minimum tyre pressure setting on advice of tyre supplier pirelli for japanese grand prix these pressures were raised by compared to levels used during 2014 race which affected mp4 30 s ride height and vertical suspension travel and produced increased understeer despite taking advantage of grid penalties that saw them start twelfth and fourteenth respectively alonso and button went on to finish eleventh and sixteenth with team acknowledging that singapore grand prix had represented their final opportunity to score points on merit their focus shifted to development of their 2016 car over final leg of championship in addition to engine upgrades honda brought to russia team sought to use high speed and low degradation characteristics of sochi autodrom circuit to test experimental bodywork parts including exhaust configuration in a race of attrition both button and alonso initially finished in points with button in ninth and alonso taking tenth until alonso was given a five second penalty after race that relegated him to eleventh place in addition to engine upgrades honda introduced for mclaren brought a new aerodynamic package for mp4 30 which revised front wing to increase downforce altered turning vanes to improve air flow over front splitter and adopted a concept pioneered by ferrari to rear floor designed to reduce impact of airflow washing over rear wheels and disrupting rear diffuser which in turn opened up a wider range of set up options for ride height and rake or angle between front and rear ride height these updates were designed to bring mp4 30 in line with designs developed by other teams with engine and aerodynamic updates team had hoped to compete for points on merit and while alonso clashed with felipe massa on opening lap he was running as high as fifth on closing stages and was on course to replicate team s best result of season before suffering a loss of power and slipping back down order to finish eleventh with alonso out of points button was promoted to sixth race also saw what would be car s best qualifying performance as alonso started eleventh while six points button scored saw team close to within ten points of sauber in world constructors championship however result also meant that mclaren had endured its longest winless streak of fifty three races previously set between 1977 japanese grand prix and 1981 british grand prix despite progress that team made over previous rounds mp4 30 s struggles continued in mexico with both drivers eliminated early in qualifying and jenson button setting a new record for grid penalties changing enough parts to warrant a seventy place penalty alonso retired from race with an incurable ers problem that team had identified night before and button finished fourteenth overall thumb button left racing kimi raikkonen at last race of season team s struggles continued as championship moved to brazil for penultimate round with alonso stopping twice on circuit during free practice with a recurring engine fault that forced him to miss qualifying button and alonso finished race in fifteenth and sixteenth place respectively which became fourteenth and fifteenth when felipe massa was disqualified for a tyre pressure irregularity button later noted that speed deficit of ra615h around interlagos circuit relative to other engines was scary despite honda s extensive development programme by time season came to a close in abu dhabi mclaren had completely shifted mp4 30 s development so that car became a testing platform for 2016 season with more than half of parts being considered experimental including a brand new configuration for rear suspension geometry despite an expected speed deficit on long straights of yas marina circuit with mp4 30 recording speeds some slower than fastest cars through speed trap and minor contact with valtteri bottas in pit lane button was complimentary of car in his drive to twelfth describing it as best it had felt all year alonso went on to finish seventeenth after receiving a drive through penalty for his role in causing a collision with pastor maldonado and felipe nasr on opening lap mclaren used alonso s race as a chance to experiment with full and continuous deployment of ra615h s energy recovery systems first time team had done so under race conditions which saw alonso set third fastest lap of race less than three tenths of a second slower than fastest lap of race recorded by lewis hamilton final standings mclaren finished season ninth in world constructors championship with twenty seven points nine points behind their nearest rivals sauber mp4 30 scored points in five of its nineteen starts with a best result of fifth place in hungary race was also only time in which both cars finished inside points jenson button was team s best points scorer with sixteen points to alonso s eleven though alonso scored team s best individual race result in hungary and qualifying performance with eleventh in united states result marked button s worst individual season since driving for honda racing f1 in and alonso s worst since his debut season with minardi in retirement from competition following its final race in abu dhabi mp4 30 took part in a series of tests organised by tyre supplier pirelli to assess their planned allotment of tyre compounds for season and to give teams opportunity to acquaint themselves with new compounds including four different builds of brand new ultrasoft compound stoffel vandoorne resumed testing duties for team for duration of test where he completed ninety nine laps and set fastest time of test three tenths of a second faster than rest of field and four tenths faster than fastest time set during race mp4 30 made one final appearance before being retired from competition taking part in wet tyre tests at circuit paul ricard in preparation for 2016 season car was subsequently replaced by mclaren mp4 31 under rules introduced in mp4 30 was declared a previous car by fia as were all of cars that contested 2015 season restricting its use in testing and promotional filming as
