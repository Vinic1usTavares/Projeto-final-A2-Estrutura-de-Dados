hoodoo butte is a cinder cone butte in cascade range of northern oregon located near santiam pass immediately to east lies hayrick butte a prime example of a tuya two mountains names were likely mistaken for each other but stuck with them over time area has been subjected to a number of historic fires hoodoo is sometimes considered a subfeature of mount washington shield volcano and it forms part of sisters reach which extends from south cinder peak to crane prairie reservoir running for this region has a high vent density with many mafic rich in magnesium and iron volcanoes of pleistocene to holocene age such as hoodoo while hoodoo has an intact summit crater that was blocked from erosion by glaciers it has an irregular topography giving it an open appearance a ski area also named hoodoo is located on northwest through northeast flanks of cone and includes five chairlifts other recreational activities popular in area include snowshoeing and snowmobiling during winter and fishing hiking camping mountain biking windsurfing and water skiing popular during summer season geography hoodoo butte lies in linn county in northern part of u s state of oregon with an elevation of it has a large rounded shape rising about above surrounding platform volcano lies northwest of city of bend and about southeast of portland physical geography in 1967 a stand replacement fire a fire that kills most if not all of living upper canopy layer in forest and initiates succession or regrowth burned through of surrounding santiam pass area it reached vegetation on eastern and southern flanks of hoodoo butte leaving patches of trees compared to denser forest on northern slope forest fires tore through region again during summer of 2003 soil on mountain ranges from shallow to moderately deep with loam and tends to be loose and cindery ecology bird species near hoodoo include woodpeckers and bald eagles deer and american black bears frequent surrounding area geology hoodoo butte lies near santiam pass area in eastern segment of cascade range known as high cascades which trends north south constructed towards end of pleistocene epoch these mountains are underlain by more ancient volcanoes that subsided due to parallel north south faulting in surrounding region in region stretching south from mount jefferson to santiam pass shield volcanoes dominate forming a broad ridge with cinder cones eruptions at these vents have produced rocks with compositions ranging from basaltic andesite to andesite and basalt lavas majority of rock in region consists of normally polarized material less than 730 000 years old hoodoo butte is part of sisters reach which extends from south cinder peak to crane prairie reservoir running for with at least 466 volcanoes active during quaternary it has a high vent density with many mafic rich in magnesium and iron volcanoes of pleistocene to holocene age hoodoo butte is one of larger mafic volcanoes along with three fingered jack north sister and vents of mount bachelor chain sometimes considered a subfeature of mount washington shield volcano hoodoo forms one of several glaciated remnants of pleistocene volcanoes in region other nearby examples including maxwell butte and cache mountain it is a cinder cone and possesses an intact summit crater since neighboring andesite lava dome of hayrick butte prevented pleistocene glaciers from reaching hoodoo s summit crater is open to east as a result of its irregular topography which led to uneven distribution of ejected material such that most of volcanic rock that forms edifice was deposited elsewhere cinder cone is surrounded by volcanic ash from sand mountain cones that was moved by water and some of this ash forms a layer on floor of summit crater human history according to one local story a cartographer accidentally switched names for hoodoo butte and nearby tuya hayrick butte word hoodoo refers to rock buttresses like those observed at nearby hayrick butte while hayrick is a synonym for haystack a more fitting name for hoodoo butte which has a profile that resembles a haystack shape whether or not this error actually occurred remains unclear but names remain to present day name hoodoo butte was confirmed by on november 28 1980 top of hoodoo butte has electronic communication relay sites which are owned by at t and bend
