as a whole toronto s globe and mail described a lack of excitement for games by toronto residents and lacklustre ticket sales while new york times described toronto residents as indifferent and apathetic to games due to excessive costs and apocalyptic news coverage of traffic disruptions adding canada is a country where winter sports predominate and pan am games have never been of immense interest one toronto journalist wrote in toronto s fierce desire to be a world class city pan am games are viewed as a consolation prize to previous unsuccessful olympic bids signs of a more positive reception to games began to emerge following its opening on first official day of competition 20 000 tickets were sold in comparison to a single day projection of eight to nine thousand and by next day at least 850 000 of 1 2 million total tickets had been sold by end of games approximately 1 05 million out of 1 2 million available tickets were sold marking largest total sold for a single edition of games a large illuminated toronto sculpture sign installed in nathan phillips square for games proved to be popular with locals and tourists as a spot for photos and came to become a symbol of renewed enthusiasm surrounding pan am games considering it a symbol of their legacy mayor of toronto john tory solicited suggestions for a permanent location for sign following games it was later announced that sign would remain in square in its current form through at least end of 2016 and later extended to end of 2017 with temporary addition of a maple leaf for 150th anniversary of canadian confederation and 2018 with a medicine wheel canadian television coverage although still billed as having been most extensive television coverage of pan american games ever broadcast in country cbc faced criticism for amount of coverage it produced and broadcast from 2015 pan american games only condensed tape delayed highlights of events aired on cbc television drawing comparisons to similar practices imposed by nbc s coverage of olympics most events were streamed online and pay television channel sportsnet aired soccer tournaments on television but events in some sports received only limited online coverage or were not broadcast at all part way through games cbc expanded its primetime coverage block while broadcasts of a semi final game in men s basketball on sportsnet and baseball finals online were added at last minute critics perceived these last minute changes as signs that cbc had underestimated viewer interest in pan am games cbc sports head of programming trevor pilling explained that large number of events being held along with stature of pan american games in comparison to olympics were a factor in structure of cbc s coverage stating that i do think we are victim of our own success in that having olympic coverage that is around clock but olympics are a different event than these pan am games but i feel like we ve done athletes justice by telling those stories or through live coverage or with reporters on site we ve tried to make sure we re at all significant events and with canada winning over 180 medals that s a tall task while national post also felt that budget cuts faced by cbc in recent years including those imposed following loss of its national broadcast rights to national hockey league to rogers media may have also had an impact with a cbc spokesperson arguing that resources were a factor pilling denied that this was case arguing that it was about planning it is about making good sound business decisions and promised that there would be extensive coverage of 2016 summer olympics references external links toronto 2015 pan am parapan american games web archive collected by university of toronto libraries category multi sport
