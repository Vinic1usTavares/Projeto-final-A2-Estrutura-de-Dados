accommodation began under supervision of no 5 airfield construction squadron in september 1962 however and facilities were later further improved stephens 2006 p 255 despite malaysia s policy of neutrality in regards conflict in southeast asia no 79 squadron operated as a detachment of raaf force no 78 wing based at butterworth throughout its time in thailand coulthard clark 1995 p 13 aircraft and personnel were regularly transferred between butterworth and ubon and most pilots nominally six month long tours of duty in thailand were broken into several shorter periods during which they and their aircraft were illegally rotated between two bases in march 1963 defence committee highest decision making body of department of defence recommended to cabinet that no 79 squadron be withdrawn from thailand on grounds that british and new zealand contingents had left country edwards and pemberton 1992 p 2009 p 1 cabinet s foreign affairs and defence committee decided against this on 28 march as it was believed that maintaining squadron at ubon helped maintain good relationships with thailand and united states thai government was discreetly asked if it would prefer a different form of assistance however throughout its period at ubon no 79 squadron formed part of an international force tasked with defending thailand s air space against intruders at start of deployment tensions in thailand were such that squadron s personnel believed that they were at war while situation became more stable from late july 1962 no 79 squadron maintained armed aircraft on alert at all times and scrambled sabres when unidentified aircraft were detected no air attacks were conducted against thailand however and unidentified aircraft that were intercepted almost always proved to be from central intelligence agency controlled air america in january 1965 two sabres accidentally overflew north vietnam after becoming lost during a training sortie but returned safely to ubon coulthard clark 1995 pp 14 15 from early april 1965 ubon became an important base for united states air force usaf attacks on north vietnam during vietnam war and no 79 squadron became part of an integrated air defence system controlled by usaf on 25 june this changed status of squadron s presence in thailand and raaf headquarters assessed that north vietnamese would be justified in regarding it as forming part of air campaign against their country stephens 2006 p 256 due to threat of counter attacks on ubon base s ground defences were upgraded during 1966 this included construction of defensive positions for no 79 squadron s aircraft and personnel as well as deployment of a detachment of raaf airfield defence guards coulthard clark 1995 p 15 while squadron did not play an active role in war it supported us effort by providing air defence for ubon and taking part in exercises with usaf aircraft in which sabres adopted tactics used by north vietnamese mig 17 fighters raaf historical section 1995 p 73 in december 1965 commander of united states pacific air forces general hunter harris jr wrote to chief of raaf air marshal alister murdoch to suggest that no 79 squadron join usaf operations against ho chi minh trail in southern laos which were being covertly conducted by ubon based aircraft thai government indicated that it would allow squadron to be used for this purpose as long as australian operations were conducted without a formal agreement or any public announcement edwards 1997 p 92 on 2 march 1966 australian cabinet decided to reinforce army and raaf force in south vietnam but rejected option of expanding scope of raaf operations in thailand this decision was made on grounds that expanded force in south vietnam and existing deployments to thailand malaysia and singapore represented maximum forces australia could commit to region edwards 1997 p 94 by mid 1968 no 79 squadron no longer had a clear role at ubon usaf had sufficient fighters based in thailand to defend country and was reluctant to use australian fighters which were now regarded as obsolete to intercept potentially hostile aircraft as squadron s rules of engagement did not allow it to pursue contacts that left thai airspace as a result australian military s chiefs of staff determined that raaf presence in thailand had outlived its political and military usefulness and decided to withdraw squadron without replacement no 79 squadron was taken off alert status on 26 july and disbanded at end of month stephens 2006 p 257 on 31 march 2011 it received a battle honour for its deployment to ubon between may 1962 and august 1968 butterworth on 31 march 1986 no 79 squadron was re formed at raaf base butterworth as a temporary measure to cover part of period while raaf s three
