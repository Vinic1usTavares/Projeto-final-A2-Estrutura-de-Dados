engaged in ministry pentecostal belief in personal experience spirit baptism as empowerment for service and need for evangelists and missionaries encouraged women to be active in all types of ministry what concerned some pentecostal leaders such as bell were women exercising independent authority over men council therefore approved of granting of credentials to female evangelists and missionaries while restricting office of pastor to men and it was not until 1920 that female evangelists could vote at denominational meetings by fall of 1914 out of 512 credential holders 142 were female missionaries and evangelists blumhofer 1993 pp 120 121 123 174 after 1914 church of god in christ became predominantly black and assemblies of god would remain predominantly white however there were

and originally had no creed or doctrinal statement however in response to several doctrinal issues most important being oneness teaching ag felt need for agreement on central doctrines and to reassure evangelical christians of its adherence to orthodox belief roozen 2005 pp 35 36 oneness pentecostalism rejected trinitarian theology instead identifying jehovah of old testament with christ of new furthermore oneness adherents believed that christians regardless of a previous baptism should be baptized in name of jesus rather than in name of trinity by 1915 it was adhered to by many in fellowship including founders such as goss opperman hall and henry g rodgers blumhofer 1993 pp 127 135 other influential leaders such as g t haywood adopted oneness doctrine as well in 1916 4th general council met in st louis to resolve new issue in a move that caused not a little anxiety a committee introduced statement of fundamental truths oneness proponents and others saw this as an attack on authority of bible yet it was adopted along with a recommendation that ag ministers use trinitarian baptismal formula old preaching credentials were recalled and new ones issued with fundamental truths included oneness believers including a third of fellowship s ministers robeck 2003 p 172 were forced to withdraw a loss especially felt in south where oneness doctrine had most influence a side effect of this was a transition in leadership from former apostolic faith leaders many of whom accepted oneness teaching to men with christian and missionary alliance backgrounds oneness dissenters formed general assembly of apostolic churches which later merged with another group to form pentecostal assemblies of world synan holiness pentecostal tradition 173 174 among fundamental truths was a statement regarding speaking in tongues as initial physical evidence of spirit baptism its inclusion was challenged by f f bosworth an executive presbyter who argued that while for many speaking in tongues was an evidence of baptism it was not only evidence issue was decided at general council of september 1918 where bosworth who two months earlier had resigned so as not to damage fellowship was present and invited to address council following debate two resolutions were passed which assured that initial evidence would remain an official teaching of fellowship robeck 2003 pp 181 186 while doctrinal controversy led to withdrawal of ministers fellowship experienced growth in subsequent years district councils were organized in various regions of country and

until 1939 that general presbytery enacted a policy prohibiting ordination of african americans to ministry districts were still allowed to license african americans to preach but only in district where license was issued black pentecostals seeking ordination were referred to one of colored organizations this was especially true of church of god in christ which despite fact that it predates assemblies of god was seen as a younger sibling it was not until 1962 under leadership of general superintendent thomas f zimmerman that denomination finally began issuing ordinations without regard

assemblies of god was a founding member of both national association of evangelicals and pentecostal fellowship of north america now pentecostal charismatic churches of north america blumhofer 1993 180 197 in 1950s ag was challenged by latter rain movement which began among former members of pentecostal assemblies of canada ag s canadian counterpart and quickly spread to united states new order as it was known was highly critical of denominations such as ag and taught that gifts of spirit are channeled through church elders and are given to others by laying on of hands however assemblies of god and other classical pentecostal groups maintained that charismata are not personally received or imparted but are manifested as holy spirit wills holdcroft 1980 p 48 in 1949 with a meeting of general council approaching there were fears that fellowship might split over latter rain issue but in end general council was united against what were seen as excesses of movement a general council resolution specified six errors which included imparting identifying bestowing or confirming gifts by prophecy and laying on of hands it also rejected idea that church is built on present day apostles and prophets latter rain theology of no pre tribulation rapture and manifested sons of god teaching were condemned as heresy patterson 2007 p 173 blumhofer 1993 p 211 latter rain and salvation healing revival of late 1940s and 50s would be a major influence on later renewal movements affiliation of assemblies of god with national association of evangelicals in 1942 signaled ag s alignment with evangelicalism and its opposition to mainline protestantism and ecumenical movement ag and its evangelical partners agreed on most issues and shared similar world views though ag s pentecostal distinctives spirit baptism and operation of spiritual gifts were not embraced by most evangelical christians ag s response then to charismatic movement that began in 1960s was a cautious one affirming move of holy spirit yet urging that all revival must be judged by scripture for first time beliefs and practices which had largely remained confined to classical pentecostal denominations began to impact mainline protestant and roman catholic churches on a large scale fact that this occurred in these churches which were historically seen by pentecostals as suspect multifaceted nature of movement owing to many different traditions its participants came from and perception by pentecostals that movement was based too much on experience and not on biblical teaching led some in assemblies of god to see it in relation to ecumenical movement blumhofer 1993 pp 235 237 charismatic movement forced a reevaluation of what it was to be pentecostal assemblies of god understood spirit baptism in context of evangelical theology and by 1950s emphasized certain doctrines and practices as requisite for spirit baptism charismatics challenged these views by claiming to receive holy spirit baptism outside of this context such as remaining in liturgical churches failing to reject sacramental theologies and not adopting pentecostal taboos on dancing drinking smoking etc blumhofer 1993 p 226 on local level assemblies of god churches were influenced by charismatic movement some charismatics left their original churches and joined less formal assemblies of god congregations in addition contemporary decreased emphasis on traditional pentecostal taboos in ag is in part attributable to charismatic movement which accelerated a trend already in existence blumhofer 1993 p 236 changing views on behavior war and pacifism right 200px thumb pastor ernest moen preaching at rockford first assembly of god on easter sunday 1971 since their movement s emergence early in 20th century pentecostals saw themselves as peculiar people and one of components of this identity were particular prohibitions on behavior prohibitions on drug use gambling social dancing consuming alcohol smoking attending theaters bowling swimming in public pools and beaches owning television sets and restrictions on feminine attire and fashion helped distinguish pentecostals from larger society poloma 1989 p 15 starting in 1950s attitudes in assemblies of god on many of these activities underwent dramatic change most change probably occurred over views on women s attire with former stance against wearing make up and jewelry giving way to acceptance of popular fashion most of these holiness standards are no longer adhered to however some are still held to such as proscriptions on smoking alcohol and drug use for much of its history assemblies of god officially opposed christian participation in 1989 and was listed by pacifist handbook as america s third largest peace church in 1940 official position of church until 1967 encouraged christian nonviolence we are nevertheless constrained to declare we cannot conscientiously participate in war and armed resistance which involves

most of founders and first generation members of denomination held to this view and it was presented as official teaching throughout world war i and world war ii official pacifist position remained unchanged until 1967 when denomination affirmed right of each member to choose whether to declare their position as a combatant a noncombatant or a conscientious objector general council minutes 2009 bylaws article xvii p 146 this was culmination of a process begun during world war i when it was unpopular to hold antiwar views in which ag adherents questioned their denomination s pacifist stance

of harvest such efforts failed to sustain impressive growth of 1980s however from 2003 to 2008 growth had slowed to an average annual increase of just over 1 percent with increased growth came increased acceptance and acculturation since 1980s a growing number of ag ministers have been educated and risen to leadership positions at evangelical institutions such as fuller theological seminary

church identity and change p 40 41 other traditional practices such as holding prayer meetings and altar services have faded over time as well despite efforts of denominational leaders to reassert pentecostal identity and remain more than evangelicals plus tongues process of acculturation has continued even so churches within assemblies of god have experienced revivals in last two decades which featured worship and practices reminiscent of early pentecostalism most prominent of these was brownsville revival which occurred at brownsville assembly of god in pensacola florida from 1995 into early 2000s these revivals often faced criticism from within and without assemblies of god for their unpredictability and dramatic religious experiences of participants in case of brownsville revival
