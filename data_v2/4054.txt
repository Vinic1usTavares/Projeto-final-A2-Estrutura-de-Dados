julia smith 1927 1997 holland had drawn on his own london background for inspiration naming three of original characters after his own relatives specifically his aunt lou and her children holland s cousins fraternal twins pete and pauline this family setup of a woman named lou beale with twin children pete and pauline was recreated on screen as first family of eastenders beales and fowlers eastenders inside story pp 49 50 pauline s original character outline as written by smith and holland appears in an abridged form in their book eastenders inside story casting from beginning smith considered role ideal for wendy richard with whom she had worked on 1960s bbc soap newcomers smith julia holland tony pp 129 130 holland and smith decided to approach her about role even though their casting policy was not to use stars richard was already well known in uk for playing glamorous roles such as shirley brahms in successful sitcom are you being served at their first meeting tony holland informed richard that they were planning a programme that would not duck social issues but would be a hard hitting drama including teenage pregnancy drugs racial conflict prostitution rape mental illness homosexuality alcoholism and muggings among its subjects in order to carry such controversial storylines richard was told that powerful characters to whom things just naturally happened had been invented and two families fowlers and beales were to form core of soap s narrative in her autobiography richard states if i accepted my character was to be pauline fowler a middle aged mother of two teenagers with a late baby on way pauline worked part time at launderette voted labour and supported arsenal she was married to arthur who was out of work and was really a bit of a failure not much good at anything in life richard thought it sounded like a challenging role wiggins lizzie p 113 there were initial fears that richard s glamorous image would not work for character and smith also feared that richard would be apprehensive about playing pauline who would be anything but glamorous but these fears were swept aside when richard announced that she was sick of glamour and wanted to play her own age richard has commented although it would be such a huge transformation of my screen image it was after all my twenty fifth year in showbusiness and i d realised that i couldn t go on playing dolly birds forever i knew right away i would be mad to turn down part of pauline after she accepted role richard was told by julia smith that she would have to change her appearance to make it more in keeping with pauline s unglamorous lifestyle this included having her hair cut richard has commented i was very proud of my long hair which had taken me years to grow i hadn t had it cut short for nineteen years but reluctantly i agreed i cried my eyes out for rest of day after that traumatic hair cut wiggins lizzie pp 113 114 from september 1984 richard was involved in pre production of series covering every angle from hair costume design and make up to organising set interior of her character s screen house richard has said that pauline had been given extensive biographical detail including minute specifics such as her fictional time of her birth it was vital that we should get to know our own characters intimately and so cast initially sat together in family groups to learn our lines and bond with our relations it was essential to develop rapport that families who d been together for years would naturally have wiggins lizzie pp 115 116 richard s casting was considered to be a giant leap of faith by co creators holland and smith but one that ultimately landed on its feet because pauline went on to be one of longest running characters in eastenders history remaining with show for nearly twenty two years character development and impact lineage and personality character of pauline was a cornerstone of eastenders lynchpin of fowler beale family around whom soap was originally structured at beginning of serial in 1985 pauline was a 40 year old married mother with two teenage children mark and michelle and another child on way fictional history of her younger years has been told via behind scenes books such as eastenders inside story and second tie in novel by hugh miller swings and roundabouts which explains that pauline was born and raised at 45 albert square where she lived for her entire life she married arthur fowler in 1965 raising her own children in same house where she grew up swings and roundabouts p 69 whereas most of other female characters in eastenders were portrayed in a somewhat more glamorous working class way pauline fowler was exception to rule being sole character to represent homely and domestic side of beale family as serial progressed character altered from her original outline instead of being jolly warm character she was during show s early years she became a sombre battle axe hardened by a life of misery in albert square other characters refer to her as fowler growler and in evening gazette she was described as boadicea of battle axes initial change in her demeanour is traced back to death of her mother lou beale anna wing a fierce dowager who ruled over her family with a rod of iron eastenders 20 years in albert square p 57 following lou s screen funeral in july 1988 pauline retorts shut up arthur fowler no one interrupts pauline beale when she s in full flow a line that was used similarly by lou in episode that preceded her own death this parallel symbolised transference of family s matriarchal role from lou to pauline eastenders airdate 28 july airdate 26 july 1988 wendy richard has indicated that both she and show creator julia smith had always intended for pauline to become like her mother and former eastenders executive producer john yorke has commented on importance of lineage between two characters pauline endures stoically and heroically whatever life may throw at her just as her mother did before her this sense of lineage is vitally important too pauline has been in show since its start and was handed role of matriarch on lou beale s death early storylines in first episode it is revealed that pauline aged 40 is pregnant with her third child character s pregnancy quickly became a prominent storyline within series pauline against her mother s opposition is determined to keep baby brake colin p 28 storyline was used to spread a public message on increased risk of genetic defects in late pregnancies with pauline undergoing tests wiggins p 118 storyline culminates with birth of serial s first baby martin in july 1985 pauline s early storylines concentrate on family and money troubles coping with her husband arthur s redundancy mental breakdown and imprisonment eldest son mark s delinquency and daughter michelle s teenage pregnancy in 1989 character was used to highlight another important gynaecological health issue fibroids brake colin p 74 storyline sees pauline ignoring health problems such as chronic fatigue and using homoeopathic preparations rather than seeking medical assistance her fibroids are discovered by chance when character ricky butcher sid owen knocks her down in his austin mini in 1989 boxing day episode pauline spends time in hospital recovering from a necessary hysterectomy wendy richard has since revealed that storyline had originally been scripted differently before outcome of pauline s illness was screened producers had decided that character was to be killed off with cancer this was a decision that had been made by show s boss mike gibbon to refresh format by replacing some of serial s older characters scriptwriters went as far as giving pauline a mystery illness newly appointed executive producer michael ferguson decided to scrap original storyline believing that pauline as one of soap s original characters was too valuable an asset to lose storyline was rewritten and character was given a different gynaecological ailment that was treatable wiggins lizzie p 149 marriage to arthur pauline s marriage to luckless arthur is central to her character remaining one of her defining traits even after his death in 1996 dynamics of relationship were clear from beginning of programme with pauline depicted as matriarchal force that holds fowler family together while arthur is depicted as weak emotionally unstable and easily dominated by stronger females of his family writer jacquetta may who once played rachel in programme has commented that pauline and arthur represented matriarchal relationship of strong woman weak man arthur only sporadically employed and disabled by a breakdown often behaved like a little boy while pauline had to make decisions and keep family functioning in face of poverty and unemployment teenage pregnancy and depression pauline and arthur were generally seen as most stable couple in show so arthur s affair with christine hewitt lizzie power came as a shock to viewers brake colin p 128 storyline was long running beginning early in 1992 with introduction of lonely divorcee christine who employs arthur to tend to her garden a romance between arthur and christine steadily develops throughout year facilitated by pauline s lengthy absence she is called abroad to tend to her crippled brother kenny in early june and she does not return until late september in reality wendy richard had to be temporarily written out of eastenders to allow her to act in grace and favour brake colin p 107 build up to affair contains many twists and turns starting with arthur s rebuff of christine s advances then a confrontation between pauline and christine which convinces pauline of arthur s innocence and leaves her feeling strangely sorry for pathetic lonely figure who obviously drank too much wiggins lizzie p 164 episode in which arthur finally gives into temptation and sleeps with christine aired on christmas eve 1992 it was labelled bonk of year by british press and was watched by 24 3 million viewers in 2005 it was reported as eleventh most highly viewed uk television programme of all time storyline continued throughout 1993 as christine makes greater demands on arthur threatening to tell pauline about their affair unless he does so himself in september 1993 situation finally reaches a climax on screen scriptwriters had many conferences about ways in which pauline would find out about affair should she work it out herself or should some third party tell her truth in end it was felt that arthur should tell her himself and when he does pauline becomes violent and hits him in face with a frying pan although audience had witnessed pauline and arthur rowing many times this was something different an act of betrayal on a massive scale series production manager rona mckendrick has commented on this iconic scene it was one of few times when you saw pauline really really let rip you really felt anger understood anger and realised why she went as far as she did this episode written by tony mchale and directed by keith boak was chosen by writer colin brake as episode of year in eastenders first ten years and is described by wendy richard as pauline s crowning moment for a while it seems that eastenders most solid marriage is over but arthur spends rest of 1993 trying to convince pauline that it is worth saving and they eventually reconcile brake colin p 118 however more tragedy follows when arthur is framed by a conman willy roper dubbed wicked willy by british press and wrongfully imprisoned for embezzlement in 1995 storyline captured public s imagination and a nationwide free arthur fowler campaign was launched arthur fowler is innocent t shirts were produced and a single was even released in uk singles chart promoting campaign arthur s imprisonment was a precursor to final exit of actor bill treacher who decided to leave eastenders after 11 years playing arthur while arthur goes to pieces in prison pauline is heavily embroiled in storyline pertaining to his eventual release for several months viewers witnessed willy attempt to woo pauline but she eventually uncovers his deception and then resorts to uncharacteristic seduction to gain his confession a critic for sunday mirror commented pauline fowler deserves a golden award for her performance in eastenders way which she extracted a confession from willy roper over money he stole was nothing short of brilliant arthur is exonerated but his joyful reunion with pauline is brief as an injury he sustained in prison leads to a brain haemorrhage and he dies shortly after his release his death ends an 11 year screen marriage longest run of any marriage in serial importance of family pauline remains a family oriented character throughout course of show a fiercely loyal but overbearing mother sheltering and taking on major responsibilities of her children and frequently stressing importance of family she is portrayed as a traditionalist with strict rules and beliefs first to criticise but also first to defend her children often interfering in their issues and causing rifts in their relationships quintessential matriarch she has also been compared with queen elizabeth with storylines in fictional albert square mirroring troubles of england as a whole in monarchies what are kings and queens for author points out similarities between matriarchal nature of pauline s character and that of queen both exhibit a rich mix of suffering and duty pauline has tried to bring up her family as best she can even though it hasn t always been easy her offspring have caused her nothing but trials and tribulations her husband has been wayward at times and caused her several eyebrow raising moments but pauline has steadfastly carried on monarchies p 122 early storylines between pauline and her two teenage children mark and michelle show her to be a doting mother forgiving of mark s wayward behaviour and supportive when michelle decides to become a teenage mum pauline is devoted to her twin brother pete dutiful to her mother lou allegiant to her husband arthur and a shoulder for her nephew ian to cry on wendy richard commented in 1990 it s important for her to keep family together that s why when her problem son mark suddenly came home in 1990 it was like her winning pools she had to take a lot of shocks from michelle and i think she coped remarkably well as serial progressed pauline contends with a plethora of family upsets which include many deaths her mother lou in 1988 brother pete in 1993 and husband arthur in 1996 as well as her elder son mark s fatal battle with hiv after a year long build up mark is shown to reveal his hiv status to his stunned and devastated parents in an episode that aired on boxing day 1991 attracting 19 million viewers wendy richard has given her interpretation of pauline s reaction to mark s news to say she was shell shocked was an understatement and not knowing enough about hiv she and arthur were worrying that their eldest son might die from aids at any moment wiggins lizzie p 157 hiv plot had many ramifications for character of pauline as she struggles to come to terms with her son s condition it was also instrumental in raising public awareness about illness which was still subject of much ignorance when eastenders tackled it in 1991 when storyline initially aired more people went for a hiv test in britain than at any other time wendy richard commented storyline with mark fowler when he announced he was hiv positive was really well done people have to be aware that hiv and aids are not exactly same thing minister of health who was in power at that time wrote a letter complimenting us for way that we had put information across hiv storyline came to an end on screen in 2003 when executive producer louise berridge decided to axe mark fowler in serial mark discovers his hiv medication is failing but instead of allowing pauline to witness his deterioration he leaves to spend remainder of his life travelling richard has classed mark s exit as her most difficult storyline commenting i was so genuinely upset that todd carty who played mark was going i could barely get my lines out for want of crying but everybody said i acted it well it was i think ten per cent acting and 90 per cent me crying my eyes out because i was being selfish and didn t want todd to go mark who had appeared intermittently for 18 years was eventually killed off screen in 2004 dying of an aids related illness in latter years of her time in soap pauline changes from a caring mother into a more inflexible battle axe pauline s relationship with martin is often shown to be strained by pauline s refusal to release control over his life though initially a teenage delinquent following mark s death in 2004 martin becomes pauline s dutiful son forced to put his mother s wishes above those of his wife a recurring theme within serial eventually this causes a rift between two characters when martin goes against his mother s wishes in 2006 and rekindles a romance with his adulterous ex wife sonia pauline cuts him out of her life television personality paul o grady addressed pauline s refusal to share her son like a normal mother commenting she s suspicious of anybody that comes into family who wants to take her son away from her she has already lost one son she has lost her husband so she s hanging onto last son like a mother tiger with her cub friends and enemies character s narrative also included various feuds most notably with soap s lothario den watts a family friend who gets pauline s daughter michelle pregnant at age of 16 eastenders pulled in biggest television audience of 1980s when over 30 million people watched 1986 christmas day episode in which pauline discovers that den is father of her granddaughter vicki wendy richard has commented on hostility between characters once pauline realised that dennis was vicki s father she was out to get him one way or another and actor leslie grantham who played den added from then on it was out and out war which was great an array of confrontations between den and pauline occur as she tries to force him to leave walford and keep him away from her family feud appears to end in 1989 when character den is shot and presumed dead but it is ignited once again in 2003 when den is re introduced 14 years after he supposedly died 2005 saw den killed off for final time and although pauline is not directly responsible for killing him item used to bludgeon him to death turns out to be her dog shaped iron which has been described as a nice touch of pathos a large proportion of character s scenes take place on set of walford s launderette where pauline works as an assistant for almost entire duration of her time in eastenders here pauline is frequently featured with another long running protagonist fellow launderette colleague dot cotton two characters share one of soap s most enduring screen friendships and their scenes together are often used to provide humour particular emphasis is placed on their differences which lead to numerous petty squabbles and in 2004 sees them buried alive underneath a collapsed fairground ride in midst of a cake selling war however pauline and dot are most frequently shown gossiping reminiscing about past or sharing their woes in launderette duo has been described by television personality paul o grady as a fabulous double act dot s probably pauline s one and only confidant pauline eventually will break down and tell dot things that she d never tell anybody else pauline is shown to be particularly hostile to various female characters that feature in her sons lives and she epitomises archetypal mother in law from hell one of pauline s most notable feuds is with her youngest son martin s wife sonia animosity between characters begins in 2000 when sonia gives birth to pauline s grandchild and decides to give baby chloe later renamed rebecca up for adoption in storyline pauline tries unsuccessfully to fight for custody leading sonia to retort you want to bring up chloe you couldn t bring up phlegm eastenders airdate 11 january 2001 feuding over chloe is revisited in storylines throughout 2005 and 2006 when first pauline is shown to visit her adopted granddaughter against sonia and martin s wishes and then following sonia s affair with naomi julien pauline refuses to give sonia access to child after martin regains custody critic for

escobar in a sky blue tabard and ski pants decreeing who can see their own kids who can drink where and what everyone s eating in cafe so as they won t spoil their teas if i was sonia i d have ransacked hospital s dangerous drugs box by now and given that old crone a renal meltdown various rows slaps and insults were featured between characters caused by pauline s continuous interference in sonia s relationships with martin and rebecca as martin began to cede allowing sonia access to their daughter pauline was shown to concoct ever more elaborate ways to obstruct sonia s involvement during her latter years in eastenders pauline is rarely without her cairn terrier betty dog is a stray taken in by fowler family in 2004 who quickly becomes pauline s inseparable sidekick wendy richard has since revealed that it was her decision for pauline to own a cairn when eastenders asked if pauline should have a dog i said it had to be a cairn terrier and betty joined us she s

2006 wendy richard announced that she was leaving eastenders she quit due to creative differences with show s producers regarding pauline s remarriage which she felt was disloyal to her character s beloved first husband arthur according to an interview in sun richard commented i think it s most terrible shame i really do i thought in my heart of hearts it was wrong i just couldn t believe that pauline would remarry anybody i would have stayed a bit longer if pauline hadn t got married richard felt that she did not have same chemistry with ray brooks who played joe as she did with bill treacher who played arthur she refuted producers opinions that pauline and joe looked good together and felt that she and brooks had to work very hard to turn them into a realistic looking couple within storyline just two months after wedding pauline s marriage is shown to sour after she discovers joe s criminal past their relationship steadily deteriorates throughout year and in december 2006

ashdown drew on show s early history to mark occasion of pauline s exit which was particularly emphasised by use of flashback vocal snippets of several members of pauline s deceased family critic for times tim teeman commented that wendy richard as pauline had air of departing diva queen of all she had loved lost and laid waste to her face set in a silent snarl in addition her parting scene with other eastenders long serving grand dame dot cotton played by june brown has also been praised with teeman commenting really choking scene came in launderette between pauline and dot here two grand dames had worked bitched and consoled for years richard and wonderful june brown played their final encounter as intensely as characters deserved richard herself has been less complimentary about her alter ego s departure she has spoken of her disappointment regarding pauline s changing character and depressing final storyline in an interview with biography channel she explained i did say promise me you won t make pauline nasty before she goes and unfortunately they did i wasn t too happy with way it was done they were changing pauline s character pauline would never have remarried she would have remained a widow sitting in that chair in corner that s what show creator julia smith wanted and that s what i felt was right so i resigned i think it s a shame because fowlers have gone completely now there was so much history with that family storyline dubbed who killed pauline by british press continued into 2007 as first pauline s funeral is interrupted by police in order to perform an autopsy on her body and then pauline s nemesis sonia is arrested for murder it is later revealed that killing blow had actually come from pauline s husband joe who breaks down and confesses to dot that he had rowed with pauline on christmas day off screen and in a fury struck her across head with a frying pan causing a brain haemorrhage that claimed her life plot s eventual climax in

out of fowlers first floor window while trying to apprehend a hysterical dot pauline is cremated and her ashes buried at arthur s graveside by dot in an episode that aired in june 2007 as a final tribute to pauline and wendy richard bbc aired a special television programme eastenders revealed goodbye pauline which provided an emotional look back at pauline s pivotal storylines during her time in walford it also reunited wendy richard with prior cast mates todd carty and james mark and martin respectively and featured character commentary and tributes from television critics and eastenders actors such as anna wing and pam st clement lou and pat during programme which aired on new year s day 2007 wendy richard reflected upon how proud she was of her character commenting pauline had everything in life thrown at her and i think she coped with it very well it showed how people deal with their problems she wasn t always grumpy she did have lots of laughs but sadly people don t seem to remember that which is a shame they still harp on about her wearing her cardigans and pauline stopped wearing cardigans three years after eastenders started she is a good woman she s a kind woman a loving woman and all she ever thought about was her family that was most important thing in her life reception at time of her departure from serial pauline was second longest running character to feature in eastenders and one of only two original characters to remain in show for almost 22 years her baggy woolly cardigan and long suffering nature have led to her being labelled as a soap institution a soap legend and a television icon actress wendy richard was awarded an order of british empire mbe medal in 2000 by queen elizabeth ii at buckingham palace and when queen visited set of eastenders in 2001 wendy richard was first actress introduced who then accompanied her and prince philip on their tour of set despite being popular with many character of pauline has also garnered much criticism over years persistent criticism has been given to character s dowdy attire particularly perception that she rarely wears anything but a baggy cardigan a claim that wendy richard herself categorically disputes in addition pauline has also received much criticism for her miserable demeanour a face like a month of wet weekends and a voice that could milk she has been described as wicked witch of walford and a character who became a byword for downtrodden lucy mangan culture critic from guardian newspaper summed up character pauline fowler is surely one of oddest soap creations ever she is a character without humour charisma or indeed any redeeming features who became progressively unrelentingly miserable she was presumably intended to be anchoring force for eastenders but because of writers unprecedented decision to break with traditional narrative rules and give her not a single redeeming feature she became more of a sucking chest wound than heart of show this opinion is perhaps shared by a proportion of viewers as pauline was voted 35th most annoying person of 2006 in a bbc three poll being only fictional character to appear on list in a radio times poll of over 5 000 people in 2004 13 chose pauline fowler as soap character they would most like to see retired she came third in poll behind eastenders den watts 17 and coronation street s ken barlow 15 although it had been suggested that pauline s presence in eastenders was largely peripheral for some time news of her departure in 2006 was met with dismay by fans and soap journalists alike in a report for bbc news one viewer commented it s so sad because i ve watched her for 20 years she s such a large character and another said if she goes then i think eastenders is finished bbc controller of continuing drama john yorke commented richard occupies a huge place in people s hearts and executive producer kate harwood said for many years wendy simply was eastenders for audience and pauline s indomitable nature typified grit and fight that embodies eastenders spirit we thank her for everything she has done for show inside soap editor steven murphy said that fact pauline has been such an enduring staple will make it hard for fans to cope with her departure it s huge in soap terms she s a character people love to hate you just assumed she would be there forever when addressing repercussions that pauline s exit would have on soap murphy had this to say characters like pauline are like glue because they re connected to so many other characters and they can help hold stories together in terms of that eastenders has very few of those now jonathan hughes editor of all about soap magazine added pauline s an absolute legend you can t imagine show without her people will miss her because she s been such an important part of eastenders for so many years however not all viewers were sorry to hear of character s retirement with one commenting how can you have someone like pauline fowler on television for 21 years it s best thing that s ever happened to television getting rid of her kill her off i would have blown her up years ago pauline s exit in december 2006 was described by times critic tim teeman as a landmark episode and a significant sayonara he described scenes between pauline and dot as most moving in a soap this year and added that it was a delight to finally alight on an episode that was so satisfying conversely pauline s exit was described as a mess by kevin o sullivan critic of sunday mirror newspaper he branded character s final scene unconvincing and badly acted commenting appropriately feeble scene brought down curtain on 20 terrible years of wendy richard s low quality performances we shall not see her like again if we re lucky i m certain millions didn t tune in to say farewell to sour faced pauline no they were just checking to make sure she was really dead to mark pauline s 22 year reign in eastenders wendy richard was awarded with a lifetime achievement award at british soap awards in may 2007 award was presented by todd carty who played her on screen son mark carty described richard as heart and soul of eastenders and hailed her as an inspiration to everyone in eastenders cast richard was moved to tears when she collected award in popular culture and other media when series was launching in 1985 since wendy richard was most
