supporters including brown and supporters of free coinage of silver brown s was also first administration to operate under kentucky constitution of 1891 and most of legislature s time was spent adapting state s code of laws to new constitution consequently little of significance was accomplished during brown s term brown hoped legislature would elect him to u s senate following his term as governor having already alienated free silver faction of his party he backed candidate cassius m clay jr for democratic nomination in upcoming gubernatorial election however deaths of two of brown s children ended his interest in gubernatorial race and his own senatorial ambitions at democratic nominating convention of 1899 candidate william goebel used questionable tactics to secure gubernatorial nomination and a disgruntled faction of party held a separate nominating convention choosing brown to oppose goebel in general election goebel was eventually declared winner of election

following year brown was re elected to house of representatives by an overwhelming vote of 10 888 to 457 and was allowed to assume his seat he was twice re elected serving until 1877 brown s most notable action in house was a speech he made on february 4 1875 in response to massachusetts representative benjamin f butler s call to pass civil rights act of 1875 referring to comments butler had made previous day about lawlessness against african americans in south brown claimed that unjust charges had been made against southerners by an individual who is outlawed in his own home by

describe him would sicken imagination and exhaust invective trefousse p 8 brown continued by referencing notorious scottish murderer william burke whose method of murdering his victims became known as

cassius marcellus clay dr john daniel clardy later to be elected a u s representative and attorney general parker watkins hardin party was split between supporters of corporations such as louisville and nashville railroad and supporters of agrarian interests another split was between more conservative bourbon democrats who supported maintaining gold standard and more progressive democrats who called for free coinage of silver tapp and klotter p 317 agrarian voters were about equally split between clay and clardy while free silver democrats were about equally split between hardin and clardy having lived in agrarian western part of state for most of his life and never having alienated powerful farmers alliance brown was acceptable to most agrarian interests while louisville and nashville railroad felt he was a moderate on issue of corporate regulation ireland p 124 bourbon democrats were also pleased with his sound money stand entering democratic nominating convention brown seemed to be favorite for nomination on first ballot he garnered most votes 275 leading clay 264 clardy 190 and hardin 186 over next nine ballots vote counts changed little finally convention chairman announced that candidate receiving fewest votes on next ballot would be dropped from voting clardy received fewest votes and on next ballot his supporters divided almost equally between remaining three candidates hardin was next candidate to be dropped and brown received a majority over clay on thirteenth ballot republicans nominated andrew t wood a lawyer from mount sterling who had failed in earlier elections for congress and state attorney general concurrently with gubernatorial election state s voters would decide whether to ratify a proposed new constitution for state in 1891 divided democrats had taken no stand on document as part of their convention s platform and wood spent much of campaign trying to get brown to declare his support for or opposition to it about six weeks before election brown sensing strong public support for new constitution finally came out in favor of it for remainder of race wood touted an alleged conspiracy between brown and louisville and nashville railroad to thwart meaningful corporate regulations but issue failed to gain much traction both democrats and republicans were concerned about presence of s brewer erwin nominee of newly formed populist party in race he enjoyed strong support for a third party candidate despite fact that many believed his party s platform was too radical democrats who were used to carrying agrarian vote by a wide margin were especially concerned that farmers alliance consisting of over 125 000 members in kentucky would endorse erwin this did not occur however and in general election brown defeated wood by a vote of 144 168 to 116 087 though he won election brown had not won a majority of votes populist erwin captured 25 631 votes 9 percent of total cast and a prohibition candidate received 3 292 votes governor of kentucky turmoil marked legislative sessions of brown s term his supporters had been either unwilling or unable to influence rest of democratic slate and tensions over currency issue soon split administration attorney general william jackson hendricks treasurer henry s hale and auditor luke c norman were all free silver supporters and feuded with brown and his appointed secretary of state john w headley throughout brown s term over time rift deepened and spread to entire democratic party tapp and klotter p 325 brown also frequently clashed with legislature and vetoed several of bills it passed none of his vetoes were ever overridden when general assembly convened on last day of 1891 brown reported that he had appointed a commission to study impact of new constitution on state s existing laws tapp and klotter p 326 he also announced that state s present budget deficit was 229 000 and was expected to reach almost half a million dollars by end of 1893 with these two large issues facing it assembly was in session almost continuously from december 1891 to july 1893 harrison in a new history of kentucky p 267 length of session earned it a derisive nickname long parliament part of reason for extended session was each chamber s difficulty in achieving a quorum a louisville newspaper reported that for an entire month largest attendance in house of representatives was 61 of 100 members consequently some bills were passed by a plurality instead of a majority of legislators tapp and klotter p 328 fearing that these bills would be challenged in court brown vetoed them during session brown secured termination of a statewide geological survey deeming it too expensive by constitutional mandate regular session ended august 16 but brown convened a special session of legislature on august 25 because important bills that he had vetoed needed to be rewritten and passed and because some bills he had signed needed to be amended to comply with new constitution major legislation advocated by brown and passed by general assembly included improvements in tax collection processes and tighter controls on corporations kentucky

cars called separate coach law special session lasted until november 1 tapp and klotter p 327 brown won acclaim from railroad companies for vetoing a proposed railroad tax increase but soon drew their ire for preventing merger of state s two largest railways louisville and nashville railroad and chesapeake and ohio railway mason and foard company which leased convict labor to build railroads resented brown s prison reforms brown accused his predecessor simon bolivar buckner of illegally allowing mason and foard to use convict labor a charge buckner vehemently denied during 1894 legislative session brown advocated and won passage of several government efficiency measures including a bill to transfer certain state governmental expenses to counties a bill to reform state printing contracts and measures clarifying laws governing asylums and charitable institutions most significant bill and one that generated most debate was a law giving married women individual property rights for first time in state history tapp and klotter p 334 other measures passed during session included a basic coal safety measure a common school statute a measure prohibiting bidding on tobacco new regulations on grain warehouses and a law providing free turnpikes ireland p 125 measures advocated by brown but not enacted by assembly included broadening powers of state railroad commission establishing offices of state bank inspector and superintendent of public printing and reforming prison management including separate detention of adolescent criminals brown also lobbied for abolition of state parole board when assembly refused brown vowed to ignore board s recommendations mob violence was prevalent in kentucky during brown s tenure as governor from 1892 to 1895 there were fifty six lynchings in state during one notable incident a cincinnati judge refused to extradite a black man suspected of shooting a white man in kentucky judge s decision was based on his opinion that accused was likely to be victim of mob violence if returned to kentucky in disputing judge s decision governor brown attempted to justify some of violence that had occurred in state s past declaring it is much to be regretted that we have occasionally had mob violence in this commonwealth but it has always been when passions of people have been inflamed by commission of most atrocious crimes wright pp 172 174 later life and death it was widely known that brown desired election to u s senate when his gubernatorial term expired in 1896 clark and lane p 63 leading democratic candidates to succeed brown as governor were his old rivals cassius m clay jr and parker watkins hardin and brown believed he would need his eventual successor s support to secure senate seat having already alienated hardin and his free silver allies brown threw his support to clay family tragedy would soon remove his interest in race however on october 30 1894 brown s teenage daughter susan died of tuberculosis a few months later his son archibald dixon brown divorced his wife it was subsequently discovered that he had been carrying on an extramarital affair acting on an anonymous tip his
