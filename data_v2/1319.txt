stated expression combat of partisans is strictly speaking a complete misnomer we did not have a single battle with partisans after we left mogilev fact of matter was that those found without identity cards sufficed for their arrest and executions for reasons of national security ultra program remained classified after war and decrypts pertaining to activities of security and police troops during war were not shared with britain s allies consequently they were not used during nuremberg trials or subsequent investigations of german war crimes and crimes against humanity decrypts were finally
