to 50 diners she soon added services of a barber as wet season ended in early 1852 seacole joined other traders in cruces in packing up to move to gorgona she records a white american giving a speech at a leaving dinner in which he wished that god bless best woman he ever made and asked listeners to join with him in rejoicing that she s so many shades removed from being entirely black he went on to say that if we could bleach her by any means we would and thus make her acceptable in any company as she deserves to be seacole chapter vi seacole replied firmly that she did not appreciate your

caricatures of black talk salih p xxvi seacole also comments on positions of responsibility taken on by escaped american slaves in panama as well as in priesthood army and public offices commenting that it is wonderful to see how freedom and equality elevate men seacole chapter v she also records an antipathy between and americans which she attributes in part to fact that so many of former had once been slaves of latter in gorgona seacole briefly ran a females only hotel in late 1852 she travelled home to jamaica already delayed journey was further made difficult when she encountered racial discrimination while trying to book passage on an american ship she was forced to wait for a later british boat in 1853 soon after arriving home seacole was asked by jamaican medical authorities to minister to victims of a severe outbreak of yellow fever she found that she could do little because epidemic was so severe her memoirs state that her own boarding house was full of sufferers and she saw many of them die although she wrote i was sent for by medical authorities to provide nurses for sick at up park camp she did not claim to bring nurses with her when she went she left her sister with some nurses at her house went to camp about a mile or 1 6 km from kingston and did my best but it was little we could do to mitigate severity of epidemic seacole returned to panama in early 1854 to finalise her business affairs and three months later moved to new granada mining gold company establishment at fort bowen mine some away near seacole chapter vii superintendent thomas day was related to her late husband seacole had read newspaper reports of outbreak of war against russia before she left jamaica and news of escalating crimean war reached her in panama she determined to travel to england to volunteer as a nurse to experience pomp pride and circumstance of glorious war as she described it in chapter i of her autobiography a part of her reasoning for going to crimean was that she knew some of soldiers that were deployed there in her autobiography she explains how she heard of soldiers that she had cared for in 97th and 48th regiments were being shipped back to england in preparation for fighting on crimean peninsula crimean war 1853 56 thumb sketch of mary seacole by crimean war artist william simpson 1823 1899 c 1855 crimean war lasted from october 1853

sea and turkey many thousands of troops from all countries involved were drafted to area and disease broke out almost immediately hundreds perished mostly from cholera hundreds more would die waiting to be shipped out or on voyage their prospects were little better when they arrived at poorly staffed unsanitary and overcrowded hospitals which were only medical provision for wounded in britain a trenchant letter in times on 14 october triggered sidney herbert secretary of state for war to approach florence nightingale to form a detachment of nurses to be sent to hospital to save lives interviews were quickly held suitable candidates selected and nightingale left for turkey on 21 october robinson pp 85 87 seacole travelled from navy bay in panama to england initially to deal with her investments in gold mining businesses she then attempted to join second contingent of nurses to crimea she applied to war office and other government offices but arrangements for departure were already underway in her memoir she wrote that she brought ample testimony of her experience in nursing but only example officially cited was that of a former medical officer of west granada gold mining company however seacole wrote that this was just one of testimonials she had in her possession seacole chapter viii seacole hinted that her offers were turned down because of racial prejudice writing in her autobiography now i am not for a single instant going to blame authorities who would not listen to offer of a motherly yellow woman to go to crimea and nurse her sons there suffering from cholera diarrhoea and a host of lesser ills in my country where people know our use it would have been different but here it was natural enough although i had references and other voices spoke for me that they should laugh good naturedly enough at my offer mary seacole wonderful adventures of mrs seacole in many lands chapter viii london james blackwood 1857 pp 73 81 seacole also applied to crimean fund a fund raised by public subscription to support wounded in crimea for sponsorship to travel there but she again met with refusal robinson p 90 again seacole questioned whether racism was a factor in her being turned down she wrote in her autobiography was it possible that american prejudices against colour had some root here did these ladies shrink from accepting my aid because my blood flowed beneath a somewhat duskier skin than theirs seacole wonderful adventures chapter viii pp 73 81 gretchen gerzina black victorians rutgers university press 2003 p 74 an attempt to join

herbert who also informed her that full complement of nurses had been secured seacole 78 79 this furthered her belief that racial differences were reasons for her not being able to formally serve with nurses nightingale reportedly wrote i had greatest difficulty in repelling mrs seacole s advances and in preventing association between her and my nurses absolutely out of question anyone who employs

dame of a jovial appearance but a few shades darker than white lily quoted by ramdin p 85 seacole requested soyer s advice on how to manage her business and was advised to concentrate on food and beverage service and not to have beds for visitors because few either slept on board ships in harbour or in tents in camp alexis soyer soyer s culinary campaign london g routledge 1857 p 233 hotel was

told him of her encounter with nightingale at barrack hospital you must know m soyer that miss nightingale is very fond of me when i passed through scutari she very kindly gave me board and lodging soyer p 434 when he related seacole s inquiries to nightingale she replied with a smile i should like to see her before she leaves as i hear she has done a deal of good for poor soldiers soyer p 43

on bosphorus throughout crimean war 1881 quoted in alexander dewjee p 28 her peers though wary at first soon found out how important seacole was for both medical assistance and morale one british medical officers described seacole in his memoir as acquaintance of a celebrated person mrs seacole a coloured women who out of goodness of her heart and at her own expense supplied hot tea to poor sufferers wounded men being transported from peninsula to hospital at scutari while they are waiting to be lifted into boats she did not spare herself if she could do any good to suffering soldiers in rain and snow in storm and tempest day after day she was at her self chosen post with her stove and kettle in any shelter she could find brewing tea for all who wanted it and they were many sometimes more than 200 sick would be embarked in one day but mrs seacole was always equal to occasion but seacole did more than carry tea to suffering soldiers she often carried bags of lint bandages needles and thread to tend to wounds of soldiers in late august seacole was on route to cathcart s hill for final assault on sevastopol on 7 september 1855 french troops led storming but british were beaten

catering robinson pp 146 47 seacole was joined by a 14 year old girl sarah also known as sally soyer described her as egyptian beauty mrs seacole s daughter sarah with blue eyes and dark hair nightingale alleged that sarah was illegitimate offspring of seacole and colonel henry bunbury however there is no evidence that bunbury met seacole or even visited jamaica at a time when she would have been nursing her ailing husband robinson p 155 ramdin speculates that thomas day could have been sarah s father pointing to unlikely coincidences of their meeting in panama and then in england and their unusual business partnership in crimea ramdin pp 120 23 peace talks began in paris in early 1856 and friendly relations opened between allies and russians with a lively trade across river tchernaya seacole chapter xix treaty of paris was signed on 30 march 1856 after which soldiers left crimea seacole was in a difficult financial position her business was full of provisions new goods
