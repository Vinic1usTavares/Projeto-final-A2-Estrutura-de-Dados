door in east front of house and a building which has been described as a water tower built by jenners in imitation of dovecote at avebury manor which was wrongly identified as a dovecote by english heritage garden is a severe formal approach flanked by yews and is deliberately low key and simple so as not to distract from beauty of building main border is long and at its best in midsummer flowers grade from blues and yellows through creams and apricots to pinks mauves and reds there is a restful white garden beyond for contrast orchard contains fruit trees such as quinces crab apples and pears are underplanted with spring flowering meadow plants such as narcissus cowslips and lady s smock orchard is crossed by wide mown paths meeting at a central sundial originally four weeping elms were situated at four corners of garden but they succumbed to dutch elm disease in early seventies and were replaced in 1973 by four weeping ash trees which make inviting houses orchard can be viewed from raised walk on its east side another idea copied from avebury manor a main path known as long walk is based on long walk at hidcote manor garden in gloucestershire although it is on a smaller scale it is a plain grassed walkway connecting raised walk with pond garden pond garden seat garden and croquet lawn are interlinked with aligned openings to form a vista from bay windows of
