his voyage to new south wales on christmas eve twelve days after his departure from cape a large iceberg was spotted and riou decided to use ice to replenish his stocks of fresh water that were quickly being depleted by need to supply plants and animals he was transporting riou and iceberg riou positioned himself near iceberg and despatched boats to collect ice by time last boats had been recovered night had fallen and a sudden descended hiding iceberg from view riou found himself in a dangerous situation somewhere to leeward lay a large mass of ice concealed in darkness and fog he posted lookouts in bows and rigging and began to edge slowly forward after sometime danger seemed to be past and iceberg left behind when at 9 o clock a strange pale glow was reported by lookout in bows riou ordered helm to turn hard a starboard turning into wind as a wall of ice higher than ship s masts slid by along side it briefly appeared that danger had been avoided but as she passed by guardian struck an underwater projection with a crash caught in a sudden gust of wind ship reared up and swung about driving stern into ice smashing away rudder shattering her stern frame and tearing a large gash in hull despite seriousness of situation riou remained calm using sails to pull clear of ice and then taking stock of damage thumb right distressing situation of guardian sloop capt riou after striking on a floating island of ice depiction of event printed in 1809 now clear of immediate danger of ice riou found himself in a desperate situation there was two feet of water in hold and more was rushing in while sea was rising and a gale had sprung up pumps were manned but could not keep up with influx of water and by midnight there was 6 feet of water in hold at dawn on christmas day an attempt was made to fother hull which involved lowering an oakum packed studding sail over side to cover gash in hull and slow flooding this was temporarily successful and by 11 o clock pumps had been able to reduce water to a level of 19 inches respite was short lived as sail split under pressure of water and water level began to rise again a number of seaman requested permission to take to ship s boats riou convinced them to stay but another attempt to fother hull with another sail failed when sail immediately ripped by nightfall on 25 december water in hold had risen to 7 feet and ship was rolling violently allowing water to pour over ship s side riou ordered stores guns and livestock to be thrown overboard in an attempt to lighten ship but was injured when his hand was crushed by a falling cask while trying to clear bread room by morning next day ship was settling by stern while sails had been torn away in gale again seamen this time joined by convicts requested to be allowed to take to boats riou at last agreed to this well aware that there were not enough boats for everyone and announced as for me i have determined to remain in ship and shall endeavour to make my presence useful as long as there is any occasion for it i have determined to remain in ship while boats were prepared riou wrote a letter to secretary to admiralty riou gave note to mr clements master of guardian who was given command of launch a total of 259 people chose to join five boats leaving riou with sixty two people himself three midshipmen including thomas pitt surgeon s mate boatswain carpenter three superintendents of convicts a daughter of one of superintendents thirty seamen and boys and twenty one convicts guardian was nearly awash by now with 16 feet of water in hold but a bumping noise on deck attracted attention and on investigation was found to be a number of casks that had broken free and were floating in hold trapped under lower gundeck realising that this was providing extra buoyancy riou had gun deck hatches sealed and caulked while another sail was sent under hull to control flooding having now created a substitute hull out of his deck riou raised what little sail he could and began long journey back to land with pumps being continuously manned for nine weeks riou and his small crew navigated guardian by now little more than a raft across 400 leagues to cape of good hope cape of good hope was sighted on 21 february 1790 and whalers were despatched from table bay to help battered ship to safety riou ran her aground to prevent her sinking but a gale struck coast shortly afterwards completing wreck of guardian voyage was described by j k laughton in dictionary of national biography as almost without parallel those who remained with guardian were among few survivors of accident of boats sent out on 25 december only launch with 15 people survived having been rescued by a french merchant launch had witnessed sinking of jolly boat
