king ur nammu 2112 2095 bc who created it in an effort to unify southern and northern parts of lower mesopotamia under his rule older akkadian kings themselves might have been against linking sumer and akkad in such a way in later centuries of mesopotamian history when major kingdoms were assyria and babylon title was mostly used by monarchs of babylon since they ruled lower mesopotamia for assyrian kings title became a formal assertion of authority over city of babylon and its surroundings only those assyrian rulers who actually controlled babylon used title and when assyria permanently

century bc sargon of akkad established earliest known great mesopotamian empire known as akkadian empire after its capital akkad though his empire stretched far and wide one of its most important regions was sumer southern parts of lower mesopotamia where city states had competed with each other for universal rule for centuries as such royal titles used by sargon and his akkadian successors were king of akkad akkadian sar mat akkadi and king of sumer akkadian sar mat sumeri akkadian kings also introduced some additional honorary royal titles including sargon s king of universe sar and naram sin s sargon s grandson king of four corners of world sar political union of sumer and akkad under akkadian empire largest empire that world had yet seen was seen as a monumentous event even in

akkadian royal titles king of akkad and king of sumer to create combined title of king of sumer and akkad akkadian sar mat sumeri u akkadi in an effort to unify southern and northern parts of lower mesopotamia under his rule in his time akkad would have been associated with north rather than just ruined city and proclaim reunification of sumer and akkad though both of titles that formed combined title had been used by akkadian kings double title was new some scholars suggest that sargon of akkad had during his reign explicitly been against linking sumer and akkad in such a fashion there was some precedence in mesopotamia for double titles of this kind in late early dynastic iii period double titles were sometimes used to express control over all of sumer titles usually include or allude to cities of uruk and ur at this time special titles such as attested lord of sumer and king of nation were usually unique to a single ruler and in most cases word king or an equivalent was repeated such as in attested king of uruk and king of ur used by kings and both 2400 bc before creation of titles like king of sumer king of sumer and akkad and more boastful like king of four corners of world and king of universe there were no titles designating a regional ruler and specifying him as more powerful than ruler of just a city most titles following format of king of city name ur nammu might rather have borrowed idea of combined title from hurrian king atal shen who would have ruled in land of subartu in decades immediately preceding ur nammu s own reign atal shen s title was king of and nawar a title which combines names of two cities distant from each other to claim rule over entire land in between e g subartu ur nammu was acknowledged by priesthood at nippur a religiously important city with title king of sumer and akkad and crowned as sovereign of two lands surrounding nippur to right and left though title is only well attested for ur nammu and his son shulgi r 2094 2047 bc it was primary royal title of third dynasty of ur alongside that of king of ur title continued to act as an important royal title throughout rule of succeeding dynasty of isin 1953 1717 bc many of its rulers using title after collapse of third dynasty of ur it is possible that its continued use was because of northern akkad region of mesopotamia gaining some sort of socioeconomic advantage over

capital isin through either outright conquest or forcing other states to pay tribute hammurabi extended babylonian rule throughout mesopotamia and while his early reign may be as a dual monarchy of sorts ruling both sumer and akkad as more or less separate entities his conquests to northeast and north saw formation of a true empire which would not stay intact under his successors as part in formation of his empire hammurabi took traditional ruling title of king of sumer and akkad which after his reign appears sporadically in of babylonian kings up until eighth century bc apart from babylonian kings those assyrian rulers who succeeding in conquering and controlling babylon and sumer also used title of king of sumer and akkad earliest assyrian king to succeed in this was middle

by sennacherib s heir esarhaddon in light of neo assyrian empire s southern conquests southern titles and epithets including king of sumer and akkad would have been important in order to assert control title allowed assyrian king to align himself with both akkadian and sumerian cultures with sumer referring to coastal regions of southern and akkad northern parts of south title claimed control over all of lower mesopotamia to assyrians title was not only a claim to prestige and legacy of sargon of akkad and akkadian empire but also a formal assertion of sovereignty over babylon
