john jeremy thorpe 29 april 1929 4 december 2014 was a british politician who served as member of parliament for north devon from 1959 to 1979 and as leader of liberal party between 1967 and 1976 in may 1979 he was tried at old bailey on charges of conspiracy and incitement to murder arising from an earlier relationship with norman scott a former model thorpe was acquitted on all charges but case and furore surrounding it ended his political career thorpe was son and grandson of conservative mps but decided to align with small and ailing liberal party after reading law at oxford university he became one of liberals brightest stars in 1950s he entered parliament at age of 30 rapidly made his mark and was elected party leader in 1967 after an uncertain start during which party lost ground thorpe capitalised on growing unpopularity of conservative and labour parties to lead liberals through a period of notable electoral success this culminated in general election of february 1974 when party won 6 million votes under first past post electoral system this gave them only 14 seats but in a hung parliament no party having an overall majority thorpe was in a strong position he was offered a cabinet post by conservative prime minister edward heath if he would bring liberals into a coalition his price for such a deal reform of electoral system was rejected by heath who resigned in favour of a minority labour government february 1974 election was high water mark of thorpe s career thereafter his and his party s fortunes declined particularly from late 1975 when rumours of his involvement in a plot to murder norman scott began to multiply thorpe resigned leadership in may 1976 when his position became untenable when matter came to court three years later thorpe chose not to give evidence to avoid being cross examined by counsel for prosecution this left many questions unanswered despite his acquittal thorpe was discredited and did not return to public life from mid 1980s he was disabled by parkinson s disease during his long retirement he gradually recovered affections of his party and by time of his death was honoured by a later generation of leaders who drew attention to his record as an internationalist a supporter of human rights and an opponent of apartheid family background and early childhood thumb left upright david lloyd george thorpe s earliest political hero thorpe was born in south kensington london on 29 april 1929 his father was john henry thorpe a lawyer and politician who was conservative mp for manchester rusholme between 1919 and 1923 his mother ursula norton griffiths 1903 1992 was daughter of another conservative mp sir john norton griffiths widely known as empire jack because of his passionate imperialism thorpe family claimed kinship with distant forebears carrying name including sir robert thorpe who was briefly lord chancellor in 1372 and thomas thorpe who was speaker of house of commons in 1453 54 there is no direct evidence of any link between these figures and jeremy thorpe s family more recent thorpe ancestors were irish stemming from elder of two brothers who were according to family tradition soldiers under cromwell during combat in ireland both were rewarded with land descendants of younger brother from county carlow prospered in dublin as high sheriffs and lord mayors but those of elder lost their land and became tenant farmers and tradesmen jeremy thorpe s great grandfather william thorpe was a dublin policeman who having been a labourer joined police as a constable and rose to rank of superintendent one of his many sons john thorpe became an anglican priest and served as archdeacon of macclesfield from 1922 to 1932 archdeacon s marriage in 1884 to a daughter of prosperous anglo irish aylmer family brought considerable wealth to thorpes as did his elder daughter olive s marriage into influential christie miller family of cheshire both john henry and jeremy thorpe would benefit from this connection as christie millers paid costs of their education jeremy was his parents third child following two sisters his upbringing was privileged and protected under care of nannies and until in 1935 he began attending wagner s day school in queen s gate he became a proficient violinist and often performed at school concerts although john henry thorpe was no longer in parliament he had maintained many of his political contacts and friendships and leading politicians were regularly entertained at thorpe home among strongest of these friendships was that with lloyd george family ursula thorpe was a close friend of former liberal prime minister s daughter megan who became jeremy s godmother former prime minister david lloyd george an occasional visitor became jeremy s political hero and role model and helped form his ambitions for a political career in liberal party education schooling in january 1938 jeremy went to house a school in oxfordshire that prepared boys for entry to eton by summer 1939 war looked likely and thorpe family moved from london to surrey village of limpsfield where jeremy attended hazelwood school war began in september 1939 in june 1940 with invasion threatening thorpe children were sent to live with their american aunt kay norton griffiths in boston in september that year jeremy began at rectory school in pomfret connecticut he remained there for three generally happy years his main extracurricular task he later recalled was looking after school s pigs in 1943 it was thought safe for children to return to england and john henry used his political connections to secure for jeremy a passage in royal navy cruiser hms phoebe thorpe started at eton in september 1943 he proved an indifferent scholar he lacked sporting aptitude and although superficially a rebel against conformity his frequent to authority earned him nickname oily thorpe he also annoyed his fellow pupils by parading his acquaintance with a range of famous and important people he offended school s traditionalists by resigning from school s cadet force and shocked others by expressing his intention to marry princess margaret then second in line to british throne thorpe revealed little about his eton years beyond his membership of school orchestra and his winning a cup for his violin playing he briefly considered possibility of a career as a professional violinist his time at eton was marred by death of his father in 1944 at age of 57 oxford thumb trinity college oxford having secured a place at trinity college oxford thorpe left eton in march 1947 in september he began 18 months national service but within six weeks was discharged on medical grounds after collapsing while attempting an assault course as his place at oxford was unavailable until following year thorpe worked as a temporary preparatory school teacher before his admission to trinity on 8 october 1948 thorpe was reading law but his primary interests at oxford were political and social from his earliest undergraduate days he drew attention to himself by his flamboyant behaviour according to thorpe s biographer michael bloch his pallid appearance dark hair and eyes and angular features gave him a air he was quick to seek political office initially in oxford university liberal club oulc which despite doldrums affecting liberal party nationally was a thriving club with over 800 members thorpe was elected to club s committee at end of his first term in november 1949 he became its president outside oxford thorpe showed a genuine commitment to liberalism in his enthusiastic contributions to party s national election campaigns and on reaching his 21st birthday in april 1950 applied to have his name added to party s list of possible parliamentary candidates beyond oulc thorpe achieved presidency of oxford university law society although his principal objective was presidency of oxford union an office frequently used as a stepping stone to national prominence normally would be presidents first served in union s junior offices as secretary treasurer or librarian but thorpe having impressed as a confident and forceful debater decided early in 1950 to try directly for presidency he was easily defeated by future broadcaster robin day his single minded pursuit of office and dubious strategies he sometimes employed led to some acrimonious campaigns but he gained many supporters and later in 1950 beat two formidable contenders socialist dick and conservative william rees mogg to secure presidency for hilary term of 1951 thorpe s term as president was marked by range of distinguished guest speakers that he recruited among them future lord chancellor lord hailsham barrister and former liberal mp norman birkett and humorist stephen potter time consuming nature of his various offices meant that thorpe required a fourth year to complete his law studies which ended in summer of 1952 with a third class honours degree at oxford thorpe enjoyed numerous friendships with his contemporaries many of whom later achieved distinction these were almost exclusively with men even so he was not identified as a member of any of oxford s homosexual sets he confided to a friend that politics provided him with necessary level of emotional excitement thus making sexual relationships unnecessary thus bloch suggests he was accepted by his fellow students as a basically asexual character wrapped up in politics and his career early career parliamentary candidate having been accepted as a potential liberal parliamentary candidate thorpe looked for a constituency general elections of 1950 and 1951 had seen party s mps fall first to nine then six some commentators saw little future except further attrition and further losses to two major parties journalist julian glover writes that thorpe s determination to stay with party despite its woes showed a more principled commitment to liberalism than many critics have acknowledged his prospects of reaching parliament would have been considerably greater within either conservative or labour parties thumb left barnstaple at heart of north devon constituency initially young would be candidate was offered opportunity of succeeding party leader clement davies in welsh seat of montgomeryshire when davies decided to retire there being no immediate prospect of that thorpe looked elsewhere in particular to devon and cornwall where party had long standing traditions and had polled respectably in 1950 and 1951 in these elections thorpe had assisted liberal candidate for north cornwall dingle foot whose agent recommended him to neighbouring north devon constituency torrington local party was also anxious to adopt thorpe as their candidate while foot saw him as a possible successor in north cornwall thorpe chose to fight north devon a seat once held by liberals although in 1951 party had finished in third place behind conservative and labour with less than 20 of vote thorpe was adopted as north devon s liberal candidate in april 1952 his political stance matched that of other young activists who believed that party should offer a radical non socialist alternative to conservative government he and others founded radical reform group to drive party in that direction he spent much of his spare time cultivating voters in north devon at rallies and on doorstep he mixed local concerns with conspicuously liberal views on larger international issues such as colonialism and apartheid when anthony eden who had succeeded winston churchill as prime minister called a snap general election in april 1955 thorpe fought an energetic local campaign he succeeded in halving conservative majority in constituency and restoring liberals to second place barrister at law and television journalist in need of a paid occupation thorpe opted for law and in february 1954 was called to bar in inner temple initially he found it difficult to earn a living from his fees he needed another source of income and found it in television journalism thorpe was employed by associated rediffusion at first as chairman of a science discussion programme scientist replies and later as an interviewer on station s major current affairs vehicle this week among various assignments for this week he travelled to ghana in 1957 to cover country s independence celebrations and in 1958 he reported from jordan on a plot to assassinate king hussein thorpe was a skilled broadcaster and in addition to his television work he became a regular guest on bbc radio programme any questions in 1959 he was offered post of chief commentator by associated rediffusion but as condition was that he gave up his parliamentary candidature he declined through later 1950s thorpe juggled his legal and television work with his political duties in north devon where he worked tirelessly to build up support from september 1956 liberal party was led by jo grimond a more up to date figure than his elderly predecessor davies and more in tune with ideas of thorpe and radical reform group after an uncertain beginning liberals lost one of their six seats to labour in a february 1957 by election grimond s leadership began to produce results party polled well in a series of by elections during 1957 and 1958 culminating in a victory at torrington in march 1958 a seat which party had not contested in 1955 general election thorpe who had figured prominently in torrington campaign saw this victory in an adjoining devon constituency as a harbinger of his own future success thorpe s television and radio work had brought him a measure of celebrity and his colourful and individualistic campaigning style was widely admired journalist christopher booker recalled he had an extraordinary ability both to cheer up his followers and send up his opponents throughout 1950s thorpe was leading a secret homosexual life at a time when all such activity was illegal in united kingdom and subject to heavy penalties exposure would have ended his political prospects instantly this sexual orientation concealed from wider public was known and tolerated in north devon and was at least suspected by many in wider liberal party member of parliament thorpe s efforts in north devon came to fruition in october 1959 general election when he won seat with a majority of 362 over his conservative opponent liberal party s solitary gain in what was generally an electoral triumph for harold macmillan s conservative government on 10 november 1959 he made his maiden speech during a debate on government s local employment bill he highlighted poor communications as principal reason for lack of employment opportunities in north devon and called for urgent government action thumb left barnstaple to exeter railway line which survived beeching cuts thorpe was a diligent mp active in promoting local issues a new general hospital and a link road to exeter taunton motorway and campaigned successfully to save barnstaple to exeter railway line from beeching axe on broader questions he made no secret of his anti hanging pro immigrant pro europe opinions largely not shared by his constituents he championed freedom from colonial and minority rule and was an outspoken opponent of regimes he considered oppressive such as those in south africa and short lived federation of rhodesia and nyasaland he was also noted for his verve and wit when in 1962 after a series of by election disasters macmillan sacked a third of his cabinet thorpe s reported comment an inversion of biblical verse john 15 13 was greater love hath no man than this that he lay down his friends for his life within liberal party thorpe helped to found an informal organisation known as winnable seats which directed energy and funding to selected target constituencies this strategy led to some notable by election performances during 1961 62 culminating in march 1962 with victory in orpington where a 14 760 conservative majority was turned into a liberal majority of 7 855 these results were accompanied by substantial liberal gains in municipal elections national opinion polls briefly showed party on equal terms with labour and conservative parties this advance was barely reflected in results of october 1964 general election party nearly doubled its share of national vote to 11 2 but secured a net gain of only two seats one of new liberals was peter bessell who won cornish seat of bodmin in north devon thorpe increased his personal majority to over 5 000 after election which labour won with a small majority thorpe was seen by many as grimond s natural successor his speeches were generally highlights of party s annual assemblies and he strengthened his position when in 1965 he secured important post of party treasurer he proved to be an excellent fund raiser although his insistence on personal control of much of party s funds aroused criticism and resentment in july 1965 after end of federation of rhodesia and nyasaland thorpe toured central and east africa visiting both zambia and rhodesia on his return he advised prime minister harold wilson that all white rhodesian government under ian smith would make a unilateral declaration of independence udi before end of year unless deterred by threat of armed intervention wilson would not countenance use of troops udi took place on 11 november in a speech to liberal assembly in september 1966 thorpe condemned wilson s handling of rhodesia issue misjudged and and called for bombing by united nations aircraft of rail link through which post udi rhodesian government received its oil supplies speech delighted more radical elements in liberal party but outraged many conservatives who used derisive nickname bomber thorpe for rest of thorpe s parliamentary career in march 1966 wilson called an election hoping to improve his tiny parliamentary majority he did so increasing it to almost 100 liberals although their overall share of vote fell to 8 5 increased their number of mps from nine to 12 an indication of success in targeted campaigning under winnable seats strategy thorpe suffered a personal disappointment in north devon where his majority dropped to 1 166 party leader 1967 1970 after 1966 election grimond confided to senior party officials that he wished soon to step down from leadership thorpe was now senior liberal mp after grimond and party s highest profile member although timothy beaumont chairman of party s organising committee noted in his diary i am pretty certain that he has little popularity within parliamentary party when grimond finally resigned on 17 january 1967 an election to replace him was arranged to take place within 48 hours leaving little time for manoeuvring 12 liberal mps formed whole electorate after first ballot thorpe had secured six votes against three each for eric lubbock orpington mp and emlyn hooson who had succeeded to montgomeryshire seat on 18 january lubbock and hooson withdrew their candidacies and thorpe was declared winner as liberal leader thorpe provided a clear contrast with pedestrian images of wilson and edward heath conservative leader since march 1965 he was considerably younger and much more telegenic his first years of leadership were problematic he found himself at odds with young liberals who were advocating policies far to left of liberal mainstream their demands for workers control in nationalised industries british withdrawal from nato and massive cuts in defence budget caused bitter disputes within party and damaged its public image at this time political climate was not conducive to radical policies wilson government s rapid descent into unpopularity brought a sharp swing to right among voters beneficiaries were conservatives who made spectacular by election gains at labour s expense while liberals failed to make any real impact discontent against thorpe s leadership was being voiced within a year of his election culminating in june 1968 when disaffected senior party members combined with young liberals in an attempt to depose him thorpe had just married caroline allpass and was abroad on honeymoon when plotters struck timing of their attempted coup widely seen in and out of party as treachery ensured that on thorpe s return party executive backed him by 48 votes to 2 thorpe s marriage provided him with a period of emotional stability a son rupert was born in april 1969 shortly afterwards thorpe received a political boost when liberals unexpectedly won a by election at birmingham ladywood in a previously safe labour seat this was a solitary success and party faced general election of june 1970 with little confidence results justified their gloomy premonitions party s share of vote fell to 7 5 and seven of its thirteen seats including ladywood were lost thorpe barely hung on in north devon his majority reduced to 369 three of his colleagues had comparably small majorities only grimond and hooson were relatively safe heath s conservatives secured a 30 seat majority 1970 1974 left thumb monument to caroline thorpe on codden hill bishop s it was designed by clough williams ellis and dedicated on 4 december 1971 by archbishop of canterbury and bishop of crediton after liberals poor election performance thorpe came under fire but such criticisms were stifled when ten days after election caroline thorpe was killed in a car crash for rest of 1970 and for much of 1971 thorpe was preoccupied with his loss and his plan for a permanent memorial to caroline meanwhile party began to recover chiefly through its adoption of community politics engagement with local rather than national issues and achieved modest gains in 1971 local elections by early 1972 with monument to caroline erected on codden hill thorpe was fully re engaged in political life in february he assisted passage through house of commons of heath s european communities bill approving united kingdom s accession to european economic community bill was opposed by labour and by some conservatives by aligning his party with government thorpe ensured a majority of eight for bill s second reading and it duly became law by mid 1972 liberals fortunes were rising significantly public was equally disenchanted with both major parties and community politics were proving popular impressive local election results were followed by sensational by election results in october 1972 rochdale was won from labour and in next year four victories were achieved over conservatives sutton isle of ely ripon and berwick upon tweed on 14 march 1973 thorpe married marion stein a concert pianist and former wife of george lascelles 7th earl of harewood couple had been brought together a year earlier by a mutual acquaintance pianist moura lympany year ended less happily for thorpe when secondary banking firm of london county securities of which he had been a director since may 1971 collapsed amid rumours of mismanagement and fraud marking start of secondary banking crisis of 1973 75 details were not revealed until 1976 in february 1974 heath whose government had been plagued by industrial unrest called a general election on issue of who governs britain during election campaign there was evidence of disaffection with both heath and wilson and of a surge in liberal support thorpe was confident that party would make a significant breakthrough on election day 28 february it secured its highest national vote to date 6 million and its highest share of vote 19 3 since 1929 under first past post voting system these figures translated into just 14 seats thorpe s majority in north devon rose to 11 072 coalition negotiations thumb upright harold wilson who formed a minority labour government in wake of failed heath thorpe coalition talks in march 1974 february 1974 general election produced a hung parliament neither labour with 301 seats nor conservatives with 297 seats achieved an overall majority as was his right as sitting prime minister heath did not resign hoping to persuade liberals into a conservative led coalition he met thorpe on 2 march to discuss possible bases for co operation heath s preferred option being a formal coalition in which thorpe would be given a cabinet post and junior ministries would be allocated to other senior liberals as combined conservative liberal vote amounted to 57 of electorate such a government would heath thought have some moral legitimacy if thorpe would not accept coalition a less formal basis of inter party co operation might be agreed which would enable conservative government to retain office next day after discussions with senior colleagues thorpe advised heath that a commitment to electoral reform would be a prerequisite to any arrangement between two parties thorpe proposed that heath establish a speaker s conference whose recommendations on electoral reform would if acceptable to liberals form basis of subsequent legislation with full cabinet approval after further consultations with their parties two leaders met again heath reported that while his party would not object to a speaker s conference they could not commit themselves in advance to accepting its recommendations which would be subject to a free house of commons vote this was unacceptable to thorpe who then made a separate proposal that an all party government of national unity be formed to tackle urgent economic problems facing country this idea was rejected by heath who resigned on monday 4 march thorpe later admitted that a coalition agreement would have torn party apart more radical elements in particular young liberals would never have accepted it furthermore thorpe said that even with our support heath wouldn t have had a parliamentary majority without some arrangements with scottish nationalists or ulster unionists coalition could have been brought down by first vote on queen s speech following heath s resignation wilson formed a minority labour government declining fortunes as harold wilson did not have an overall majority after february 1974 election he was widely expected to call another election before too long he did so in september 1974 thorpe anticipated a turning point in liberals fortunes and campaigned under slogan one more heave aiming for a complete breakthrough with entering a coalition a last resort phrase is attributed to advertising agent and liberal parliamentary candidate adrian slade future liberal party leader david steel called whole campaign a slightly less successful re run of february in october 1974 general election liberals received over 700 000 fewer votes and returned 13 mps down one with wilson achieving an overall majority of three thorpe and liberals were deflated by outcome of october 1974 election wilson s majority albeit slim denied thorpe role of kingmaker leaving liberals without a clear role as dutton observes apart from being neither conservative or labour liberals lacked a distinctive identity and their policies were largely unknown to public a further problem for party was divergence between its activists who were radicals well to left of official party and a large section of its recent supporters who were disgruntled conservatives thorpe whose personal majority in north devon had fallen to under 7 000 in october confided to an associate that unless party were soon to make a significant impact his days as leader might be numbered during 1975 thorpe campaigned for electoral reform citing great vote robbery of year before he argued that electoral reform on a proportional basis would bring about a centrist stability to british politics that would favour british business in june 1975 referendum on uk s continuing membership of eec thorpe campaigned for a yes vote alongside pro europeans of both major parties appearing with heath recently replaced as conservative leader by margaret thatcher at oxford union referendum resulted in a two to one approval of uk s membership but thorpe failed to stem decline in his party s electoral fortunes in woolwich west by election on 26 june 1975 party lost more than two thirds of its october 1974 vote a major humiliation according to guardian relationship with norman scott thorpe s homosexual activities from time to time came to attention of authorities and were investigated by police information was added to his mi5 file but in no case was action taken against him in 1971 he survived a party inquiry after a complaint against him by norman scott a riding instructor and would be model scott maintained that in early 1960s he had been in a sexual relationship with thorpe who had subsequently mistreated him inquiry dismissed allegations but danger represented by scott continued to preoccupy thorpe who according to his confidant david holmes felt he would never be safe with that man around scott known then as norman josiffe had first met thorpe early in 1961 when former was a 20 year old groom working for one of thorpe s wealthy friends initial meeting was brief but nearly a year later scott by then in london and destitute called at house of commons to ask mp for help thorpe later acknowledged that a friendship had developed but denied any physical relationship scott however claimed that he had been seduced by thorpe on night following commons meeting over following years thorpe made numerous attempts to help scott find accommodation and work but instead of repaying these favours with gratitude scott became increasingly resentful towards thorpe believing that he was source of all his ills and threatening him with exposure in 1965 thorpe asked his parliamentary colleague peter bessell to help him resolve problem bessell met scott and warned him that his threats against thorpe might be considered blackmail he offered to help scott obtain a new national insurance card lack of which had been a long running source of aggravation this quietened matters for a while but within a year scott was causing trouble again with thorpe s agreement bessell began paying scott a retainer of ps5 a week supposedly as compensation for welfare benefits that scott had been unable to obtain because of his missing card bessell later stated that by 1968 thorpe was considering ways in which scott might be permanently silenced he thought david holmes might organise this holmes had been best man at thorpe s wedding and was completely loyal to him when scott unexpectedly married in 1968 it appeared that problem might be over but by 1970 marriage had ended scott convinced himself that thorpe was to blame early in 1971 scott moved to village of talybont in north wales where he befriended a widow gwen parry jones to whom he recounted his tale of ill treatment at hands of thorpe she passed information to emlyn hooson who was mp for adjoining welsh constituency hooson precipitated party enquiry which cleared thorpe and left scott feeling bitter and humiliated after parry jones s death following year scott fell into a depression and for a while was quiescent in time he began to tell his story to anyone who would listen by 1974 thorpe at crest of liberal revival was terrified of exposure that might lose him liberal leadership as dominic sandbrook observes in his history of times stakes had never been higher silencing scott had never been more urgent resignation thumb porlock hill scene of newton s attempted shooting of scott over years scott made several attempts to publicise his story but no newspapers were interested satirical magazine private eye decided in late 1972 that story was defamatory and above all was ten years old from late 1974 holmes took lead in furthering plans to silence scott through various intermediaries he found andrew newton an airline pilot who said he would dispose of scott for a fee of between ps5 000 and ps10 000 meanwhile thorpe procured ps20 000 from sir jack hayward bahamas based millionaire businessman who had previously donated to liberal party stating that this was to cover election expenses incurred during 1974 thorpe arranged for these funds to be secretly channelled to holmes rather than into party s coffers he later denied that this money had been used to pay newton or anyone else as part of a conspiracy in october 1975 newton made a bungled attempt to shoot scott that resulted in killing of scott s great dane rinka newton was arrested on charges of possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life yet press remained muted possibly awaiting bigger story that they hoped would break their reticence ended in january 1976 when scott in court on a minor social security fraud charge claimed he was being hounded because of his previous sexual relationship with thorpe this statement made in court and thus protected from libel laws was widely reported on 29 january department of trade published its report into collapse of london county securities report criticised thorpe s failure to investigate true nature of company before involving himself a cautionary tale for any leading politician thorpe received some relief when his former colleague bessell who had resigned from parliament and relocated to california to escape from a string of business failures re emerged in early february after discovery by daily mail bessell gave muddled accounts of his involvement with scott but insisted that his former chief was innocent of any wrongdoing on 16 march 1976 newton s trial began at exeter crown court where scott repeated his allegations against thorpe despite efforts of prosecution s lawyers to silence him newton was found guilty and sentenced to two years imprisonment but did not incriminate thorpe erosion of public support for liberal party continued with several poor by election results in march which former leader grimond attributed to increasing lack of confidence in thorpe on 14 march sunday times printed thorpe s answer to scott s various allegations under heading lies of norman scott nevertheless many of party s senior figures now felt that thorpe should resign thorpe s problems multiplied when bessell alarmed by his own position confessed to daily mail on 6 may that in his earlier statements he had lied to protect his former leader scott was threatening to publish personal letters from thorpe who to forestall him arranged for sunday times to print two letters from 1961 although these did not conclusively indicate wrongdoing their tone indicated that thorpe had not been frank about true nature of his friendship with scott on 10 may 1976 amid rising criticism thorpe resigned party leadership convinced that a fixed determination to destroy leader could itself result in destruction of party post resignation interlude thumb left upright james callaghan prime minister 1976 79 who governed by courtesy of 1977 lib lab pact thorpe s resignation brought him a period of temporary calm new liberal leader david steel made him party spokesman on foreign affairs with responsibility for european issues wilson had by this time retired as prime minister and been replaced by james callaghan thorpe lobbied government hard for legislation to introduce direct elections to european parliament at that time meps were appointed by member nations parliaments by election losses eroded and finally removed labour s small parliamentary majority and in march 1977 callaghan was in danger of losing a confidence vote that would have precipitated a general election opinion polls indicated that an election at that time would have been equally disastrous for labour and liberal parties to ensure mutual survival a lib lab pact was agreed whereby in return for certain policy concessions liberals would support government thorpe used his influence to insist that legislation for direct elections to european parliament was part of pact but was unable to secure his principal objective a commitment to a proportional basis in these elections in parliament thorpe spoke in favour of scottish and welsh devolution arguing that there was no alternative to home rule except total separation in various debates related to unresolved issue of rhodesia thorpe pressed for involvement of representatives from african nationalists in form of patriotic front in negotiations for a peaceful settlement to long running rhodesian bush war although press was generally quiet after thorpe s resignation reporters were still investigating him most persistent of these were barry penrose and roger courtiour collectively known as pencourt who had begun by believing that thorpe was a target of south african intelligence agencies until their investigations led them to bessell in california bessell no longer covering for thorpe gave reporters his version of conspiracy to murder scott and thorpe s role in it pencourt s progress was covered in private eye to thorpe s extreme vexation when pair attempted to question him outside his devon home early in 1977 he threatened them with prosecution thorpe s relatively peaceful interlude ended in october 1977 when newton released from prison sold his story to london evening news newton s claim that he had been paid by a leading liberal to kill scott caused a sensation and led to a prolonged police investigation throughout this period thorpe endeavoured to continue his public life in and out of parliament in house of commons on 1 august 1978 when it appeared certain he would face criminal charges he asked attorney general what sum of capital possessed by an applicant would prevent him from receiving legal aid next day he made his final speech in house during a debate on rhodesia on 4 august thorpe along with holmes and two of holmes s associates was charged with conspiracy to murder scott thorpe was additionally charged with incitement to murder on basis of his alleged 1968 discussions with bessell and holmes after being released on bail thorpe declared his innocence and his determination to refute charges although he remained north devon s mp he withdrew almost completely from public view except for a brief theatrical appearance at liberals 1978 annual assembly on 14 september to annoyance of party s leaders who had asked him to stay away committal electoral defeat in november 1978 thorpe holmes and two of latter s business acquaintances john le mesurier a carpet salesman not to be confused with actor of that name and george deakin appeared before magistrates at minehead somerset in a committal hearing to determine whether they should stand trial court heard evidence of a conspiracy from scott newton and bessell it also learned that bessell was being paid ps50 000 by sunday telegraph for his story at conclusion four defendants were committed for trial at old bailey this was set to begin on 30 april 1979 but when in march government fell and a general election was called for 3 may trial was postponed until 8 may thorpe accepted invitation of his local party to fight north devon seat against advice of friends who were certain he would lose his campaign was largely ignored by national party of its leading figures only john mp for north cornwall visited constituency thorpe supported by his wife his mother and some loyal friends fought hard although much of his characteristic vigour was missing he lost to his conservative opponent by 8 500 votes overall conservatives obtained a majority of 43 seats and margaret thatcher became prime minister afterward thorpe told daily mail that he had not expected to get hammered you never do daily mail 9 may 1979 quoted in bloch 1979 p 521 liberal party s share of national vote fell to 13 8 and its total seats from 13 to 11 dutton attributes much of fall in liberal vote to lengthy adverse publicity generated by thorpe affair trial and acquittal trial which lasted for six weeks began on 8 may 1979 before mr justice cantley thorpe was defended by george carman carman quickly undermined bessell s credibility by revealing that he had a significant interest in thorpe s conviction in event of an acquittal bessell would receive only half of his newspaper fee during his cross examination of scott on 22 may carman asked you knew thorpe to be a man of homosexual tendencies in 1961 this oblique admission of his client s sexuality was a stratagem to prevent prosecution from calling witnesses who would testify to thorpe s sex life nevertheless carman insisted there was no reliable evidence of any physical sexual relationship between thorpe and scott whom carman dismissed as this inveterate liar social climber and after weeks in which court heard prosecution s evidence from committal hearings defence opened on 7 june deakin testified that although he introduced newton to holmes he had thought that this was to help deal with a blackmailer he knew nothing of a conspiracy to kill deakin was only defendant to testify thorpe and others chose to remain silent and call no witnesses on basis that testimonies of bessell scott and newton had failed to make prosecution s case on 18 june after closing speeches from prosecution and defence counsel judge began his summing up while emphasising thorpe s distinguished public record he was scathing about principal prosecution witnesses bessell was a humbug scott a fraud a sponger a whiner a parasite but of course he could still be telling truth newton was determined to milk case as hard as he can on 20 june jury retired they returned two days later and acquitted four defendants on all charges in a brief public statement thorpe said that he considered verdict a complete vindication scott said he was unsurprised by outcome but was upset by aspersions on his character made by judge from safety of bench later life after his acquittal thorpe announced that he proposed to attend 1979 liberal assembly and forthcoming liberal international congress in canada his failure to explain himself under oath was widely criticised in press and public perception was that he had been fortunate to have got off reluctantly thorpe accepted that there was no future role for him within liberal party and informed north devon association that he would not seek to fight seat again steel expressed hope that thorpe would after a suitable period of rest and recuperation find many avenues where his great talents may be used in his search for a new career thorpe applied unsuccessfully for posts of administrator of aldeburgh festival and race relations adviser to greater london council his attempts to restart a career in television also came to nothing in february 1982 it was announced that he was to become director of british section of amnesty international but appointment was opposed by many of organisation s membership and he withdrew from post after a month of controversy he kept his position as chairman of political committee of united nations association but in 1985 progression of parkinson s disease which had first been diagnosed in 1979 led to curtailment of most of his public activity he continued to live in north devon and in 1987 accepted honorary presidency of north devon liberal democrat association formed after liberal sdp merger he thought he might return to parliament via a life peerage in house of lords but although friends lobbied on his behalf merged party s leadership refused to recommend him within party generally feelings towards him warmed and when he attended 1997 annual conference he received a standing ovation in 1999 thorpe published an anecdotal memoir in my own time an anthology of his experiences in public life in book he repeated his denial of any sexual relationship with scott and maintained that decision not to offer evidence was made to avoid prolonging trial since it was clear that prosecution s case was shot through with lies inaccuracies and admissions in 2005 general election campaign thorpe appeared on television attacking both conservative and labour parties for supporting iraq war three years later in 2008 he gave interviews to guardian and to journal of liberal history york liberal journal s interviewer found thorpe able to communicate only in a barely audible whisper but with his brain power unimpaired thorpe asserted that he still had steam in my pipes reviewing current political situation he considered labour prime minister gordon brown dour and unimpressive and dubbed conservative leader david cameron a phoney a thatcherite trying to appear progressive some of thorpe s pro had been eroded over years in his final years he thought that european union had become too powerful and insufficiently accountable final years and death thorpe s last public appearance was in 2009 at unveiling of a bust of himself in grimond room at house of commons thereafter he was confined to his home nursed by marion until she became too infirm she died on 6 march 2014 thorpe survived for nine more months dying on 4 december his funeral was at st margaret s westminster on 17 december appraisal andrew rawnsley observed that general election of 1970 left liberals with just six mps at head of this band was jeremy thorpe dandy exhibitionist superb showman shallow thinker wit and mimic cunning opportunist sinister intriguer idealistic internationalist and a man with a clandestine homosexual life andrew rawnsley jeremy thorpe review michael bloch s gripping and insightful biography compulsive seducer inventive politician sinister intriguer jeremy thorpe was one of 20th century s most extraordinary british political leaders guardian 18 january 2015 most assessments of thorpe s career emphasise his downfall rather than his political achievements a fall unparalleled in british political history according to daily telegraph obituarist while thorpe hoped that acquittal would ensure he would be remembered primarily for his revival of liberal fortunes in 1960s and 1970s trial shattered his reputation irretrievably prosecuting counsel at old bailey likened case to a tragedy of truly greek or shakespearian proportions slow but inevitable destruction of a man by stamp of one defect after thorpe s death sympathetic commentators drew attention to his internationalism and social liberalism highlighting his long involvement with anti apartheid movement his denunciations of dictators his opposition to death penalty and his rejection of racism there is wide agreement that he was an outstanding political campaigner persuasive witty and warm his astonishing memory for faces persuaded voters that they were intimate friends his resourceful mind afforded quips and stunts for every occasion a different perspective on thorpe quoted by michael bloch was given by a former friend art expert david at time of trial self centred mildly entertaining slightly sinister said to be witty but if one doesn t care for impersonations he s really a bit of a bore in assessing thorpe s 10 years as party leader nick clegg credited him with providing driving force that continued liberal revival that began under jo grimond and douglas murray writing for spectator recognised his strategy of identifying and concentrating on winnable seats as basis for major liberal democrat breakthrough in 1997 election dutton in his party history took a more qualified view suggesting that in spite of thorpe s bold style and charisma party drifted without a sense of conviction and underlying purpose and was dominated by tactics rather than ideas thorpe positioned liberals in moderate centre equidistant from labour and conservative a strategy which was very successful in february 1974 when dissatisfaction with two main parties was at its height but which left party s specific identity obscure and its policies largely unknown thorpe never discussed his sexuality publicly although throughout his political career he led a double life responsible politician by day while according to murray by night he was not only very gay but rather carefree about being so writer and broadcaster jonathan fryer who was a gay activist within liberal party in 1970s maintained that in repressive climate of time thorpe couldn t have come out even if he d wanted to his double standard irritated and alienated gay liberals he wanted best of both worlds his fun and a family in his review of michael bloch s biography murray writes jeremy thorpe had hoped to be remembered as a great political leader i suppose they all do and perhaps he will be remembered longer than many other politicians of his age or ours but it will always be for same thing jeremy jeremy bang bang woof woof in popular media in 2009 bbc attempted to film a tv biopic of thorpe s life with rupert
