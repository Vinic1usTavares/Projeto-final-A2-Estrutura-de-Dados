systems net 2008 retrieved 19 august 2011 was a first generation soviet turbojet fighter developed by yakovlev design bureau okb immediately after world war ii it used a reverse engineered german junkers jumo 004 engine along with swedish saab it was one of only two jets to be successfully converted from a piston powered aircraft and enter production gunston 1995 p 472 280 aircraft were built in 1947 although nominally a fighter it was mainly used to qualify piston engine experienced pilots to fly jets design development and description on 9 april 1945 council of people s commissars ordered yakovlev okb to develop a single seat jet fighter to be equipped with a single german jumo 004 engine to save time yakovlev based new design known as yak 3 jumo or yak jumo on latest version of his successful yakovlev yak 3 piston engined fighter piston engine was removed and jet engine was mounted underneath forward fuselage so that its exhaust exited underneath middle of fuselage to protect fuselage a steel heatshield was added to its bottom deeper forward part of fuselage gave aircraft a pod and boom configuration very few changes were made to metal fuselage other than at aircraft s nose this was to accommodate armament of two nudelman suranov ns 23 autocannon an additional fuel tank above engine and engine itself no changes were made to wings other than elimination of air intakes for oil cooler and bending of front wing spar into an inverted u shape to clear engine vertical stabilizer was slightly enlarged but tailplane was unmodified conventional landing gear was also unmodified other than tailwheel which now used several steel leaf springs as shock absorbers yak jumo carried a total of of fuel gordon 2002 pp 47 61 thumb right yak 15 forward fuselage and engine taxi tests began in october 1945 but heatshield proved to be too short and heat from engine exhaust melted duralumin skin of rear fuselage as well as rubber tire of tailwheel modifications to rectify problems took until late december by this time a second prototype had been completed with a solid steel tailwheel and an enlarged tailplane after a few taxiing tests it was transferred to central institute tsagi for full scale windtunnel testing that lasted until february 1946 on 26th of that month council of people s commissars issued requirements that aircraft should have a maximum speed of at sea level and a speed of at an altitude of it should be able to climb to that altitude in 4 1 2 minutes or less and it should have a range of at 90 of maximum speed two prototypes were to be ready for flight testing on 1 september gordon 2002 p 50 according to aviation historians bill gunston and yefim gordon representatives from yakovlev and mikoyan gurevich okb tossed a coin on 24 april 1946 to determine which aircraft would be first soviet jet to fly yakovlev lost and yak jumo made one circuit of airfield before landing gunston and gordon p 106 manufacturer s flight testing of aircraft was completed on 22 june but its early success caused council of ministers to issue a new requirement on 29 april for two aircraft powered by soviet built rd 10 engine known as yak 15 yak or yak rd aside from new engine requirement differed from previous one only in a range of at optimum cruise speed and a reduction of maximum ceiling to two prototypes were ordered to be available for flight testing on 1 september 1946 yakovlev was able to adapt two existing prototypes to rd 10 with little trouble and one aircraft participated in august 1946 tushino flypast day after aerial display joseph stalin summoned artem mikoyan and aleksandr yakovlev to his office and ordered that each okb build 15 aircraft to participate in 7 november parade in red square commemorating anniversary of october revolution factory no 31 in tbilisi was chosen to build new aircraft because it was still building conventional yak 3s and could easily switch to jet fighter all 15 aircraft were built before deadline although they lacked any armour were provided with an enlarged fuel tank in lieu of armament and had an incomplete avionics outfit parade was canceled and two of aircraft were modified with a single 23 mm cannon and began state acceptance trials which lasted until april 1947 gordon 2002 p 51 tests revealed a number of problems in that thick wing inherited from yak 3 limited top speed of aircraft engine exhaust damaged surface of airfield cockpit often filled with smoke from kerosene and oil that had dripped onto engine and aircraft was very short ranged despite these problems yak 15 proved to be very easy to fly even for pilots accustomed to piston engined fighters and caused vvs to accept fighter as a conversion trainer gordon 2002 pp 58 59 even before state acceptance trials were completed council of ministers ordered aircraft into production in december 1946 50 aircraft were to be built between january and april 1947 equally split between single seat aircraft and two seat trainers armed with only a single cannon trainer ran into serious development difficulties and all aircraft of first batch were single seaters fifty of these participated in may day flypast in moscow in 1947 a total of 280 yak 15s were produced through end of year exclusive of prototypes gordon 2002 pp 59 61 aircraft were distributed in small numbers to fighter aviation regiments based in ussr poland romania hungary and manchuria for use as conversion trainers aircraft s manoeuvrability led it to be used by a number of informal acrobatic display teams throughout late 1940s mikolajczuk pp 13 15 a single prototype of two seat trainer was first aircraft of first production batch built by factory no 31 in fall of 1946 prototype did not begin manufacturer s flight testing until 5 april 1947 even though primary differences from single seat version were limited to a redesigned forward fuselage that accommodated an additional cockpit for trainee where armament used to be and a sideways opening canopy trainer was initially designated as yak jumo but it was eventually designated as yak 21 although some documents refer to it as yak 15v yak or yak 21v further work on trainer was cancelled with success of trainer version of yak 17 with its tricycle undercarriage gordon 2002 pp 51 64 one yak 15 was used to test a prototype aerial refueling system in 1949 although installation on fighter and tupolev tu 2 bomber used as tanker were both dummies to test procedures and fit yak 17 rd10 on 29 april 1946 five days after mikoyan gurevich i 300 and yak jumo made their first flights council of ministers ordered that yakovlev okb begin design of a new aircraft similar to yak jumo using rd 10 engine with improved aerodynamics this generally resembled original aircraft but wings were entirely redesigned with laminar flow airfoils tail structure was enlarged and an ejection seat was fitted back of seat was armoured and pilot was also protected by a bulletproof windscreen entire canopy was also redesigned to accommodate new windscreen landing gear could not be housed in thin wings so it was redesigned to retract into fuselage low and high wing loading wing versions were considered but low wing loading wings were chosen for prototype at an altitude of 5000 meters yak 17 rd10 as new fighter was designated was expected to have a top speed of a significant improvement over that of production yak 15 aircraft was completed on 3 september and ground tests lasted until 26 september but it never flew as yak 15 had already been ordered into production and its conventional landing gear was already deemed obsolete gordon 2002 p 62 survivors there is only a replica of yellow 37 at vadim technical museum outside moscow variants data from okb yakovlev yak jumo
