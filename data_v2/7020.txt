while latter is about all people coming to together for betterment of everyone in addition to this while god help outcasts is religious someday is according to musical theater of stephen schwartz from godspell to wicked and beyond more of an anthem of hope than a prayer dubbing god help outcasts one of highlights of her career singer heidi mollenhauer described experience in an interview with south pasadena high school as very exciting a little terrifying and sometimes overwhelming on recording song mollenhauer said challenge really was to be able to release all that this song made me feel i get choked up every time i talk about it because i think it s such a beautiful moment because esmeralda is voiced by two different actresses it was mandatory that mollenhauer s singing voice blend with actress demi moore s husky speaking voice seamlessly mollenhauer s performance of someday is featured on re release of hunchback of notre dame context scene and analysis one of hunchback of notre dame

described esmeralda as or innately christian in mickey mouse monopoly disney childhood and corporate power dr robert b pettit identified god help outcasts as a plea on behalf of all minorities not only by ethnicity but also by race class gender or sexual orientation additionally pettit feels that song might have been a jab at homophobic religious right who were organizing a boycott of disney a somber song god help outcasts also underlines theme of victor hugo s novel at one point in song we have a group of rich well off christians asking god for wealth fame and love while esmeralda a penniless gypsy who confessed that she didn t know if god was there prays for her people and asks that they be shown mercy and love additionally pointing out that jesus was also an outcast when he walked on this earth and that we re all children of god no matter who we are or what we ve done scene additionally suggests a more positive view of church than found in hugo s novel as it provides

length of three minutes and twenty six seconds a n intercessory prayer god help outcasts is both a powerfully quiet song and a heart rending aria performed with agony and beauty musically heart wrenching ballad has a broadway and choral feel to it distinct from majority of hunchback of notre dame s songs due in large to its tenderness a haunting prayer and a simple hymn god help outcasts is most spiritual and sic tune to emerge from an animated feature ballad plain in structure is a hopeful and sweet anthem and lilting plea accompanied by syrupy production according to musical theater of

dignified rhymed couplets for main tune according to book film genre 2000 new critical essays god help outcasts has an unusually somber tone for an animated disney film performed as a prayer for deliverance from gypsies pain and suffering lyrically god help outcasts a song about faith explores themes such as discrimination additionally god help outcasts touches on a basic idea behind most faiths asking was jesus god not an outcast too as esmeralda sees firsthand how her people are persecuted for their differences first verse of song reads i don t know if you can hear me or if you re even there i don t know if you would listen to a gypsy s prayer teen ink observed this part is about how it seems like god doesn t listen to you or help you no matter how much you pray or talk to him

with demi moore s speaking voice teen ink described god help outcasts as a wonderful song while about com s espie estrella highlighted god help outcasts as film s featured song hailing hunchback of notre dame as my favorite soundtrack of any disney movie emerson college s entertainment monthly extolled film for trad ing traditional happy tunes for heartfelt and heart wrenching ballads like god help outcasts in a mixed review kenneth e rathburn of sputnikmusic commented both versions of god help outcasts offer a level of mid road quality that came to be expected after disney renaissance writing of mollenhauer s film version seems to limp around a bit while delivering more of that emotional punch needed as we transition to second act while midler s has that credits vibe we all know and love from disney films which keeps us sticking around when we d otherwise abandon theater however rathburn concluded said version is a little detached for sake of thematic relevance jack smith of bbc online gave song a very unfavorable review writing sentiments of god help outcasts are spoiled by syrupy production describing midler s rendition as overwrought plugged in observed one heartwarming scene finds esmeralda praying selflessly on behalf of world s outcasts however such moments are overshadowed by simmering passions a shapely heroine and dark elements likely to upset accolades in spite of both new york times and star news predictions that god help outcasts would be nominated for academy award for best original song with star news howard cohen writing next year s best song oscar is sure to spring from this bunch our guess is sugary god help outcasts song was ultimately denied an academy award nomination at 1997 award ceremony along with rest of hunchback s original songs notably prior to hunchback of notre dame disney had been dominating original song category at academy awards often claiming multiple nominations and a win but hunchback was shut out
