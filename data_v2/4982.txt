g spot also called grafenberg spot for german gynecologist ernst grafenberg is characterized as an erogenous area of vagina that when stimulated may lead to strong sexual arousal powerful orgasms and potential female ejaculation see page 135 for prostate information and page 76 for g spot and vaginal nerve ending information it is typically reported to be located up front anterior vaginal wall between vaginal opening and urethra and is a sensitive area that may be part of female prostate existence of g spot has not been proven nor has source of female ejaculation although g spot has been studied since 1940s disagreement persists over its existence as a distinct structure definition and location g spot may be an extension of clitoris which together may be cause of orgasms experienced vaginally sexologists and other researchers are concerned that women may consider themselves to be dysfunctional if they do not experience g spot stimulation and emphasize that not experiencing it is normal theorized structure location two primary methods have been used to define and locate g spot as a sensitive area in vagina self reported levels of arousal during stimulation and stimulation of g spot leading to female ejaculation ultrasound technology has also been used to identify physiological differences between women and changes to g spot region during sexual activity see page 98 for 2009 king s college london s findings on g spot and page 145 for ultrasound physiological material with regard to g spot location of g spot is typically reported as being about 50 to 80 mm 2 to 3 in inside vagina on front wall for some women stimulating this area creates a more intense orgasm than clitoral stimulation g spot area has been described as needing direct stimulation such as two fingers pressed deeply into it attempting to stimulate area through sexual penetration especially in missionary position is difficult because of particular angle of penetration required vagina and clitoris women usually need direct clitoral stimulation in order to orgasm and g spot stimulation may be best achieved by using both manual stimulation and vaginal penetration sex toys are available for g spot stimulation one common sex toy is specially designed g spot vibrator which is a phallus like vibrator that has a curved tip and attempts to make g spot stimulation easy g spot vibrators are made from same materials as regular vibrators ranging from hard plastic rubber silicone jelly or any combination of them level of vaginal penetration when using a g spot vibrator depends on woman because women s physiology is not always same effects of g spot stimulation when using penis or a g spot vibrator may be enhanced by additionally stimulating other erogenous zones on a woman s body such as clitoris or vulva as a whole when using a g spot vibrator this may be done by manually stimulating clitoris including by using vibrator as a clitoral vibrator or if vibrator is designed for it by applying it so that it stimulates head of clitoris rest of vulva and vagina simultaneously a 1981 case study reported that stimulation of anterior vaginal wall made area grow by fifty percent and that self reported levels of arousal orgasm were deeper when g spot was stimulated another study in 1983 examined eleven women by entire vagina in a clockwise fashion and reported a specific response to stimulation of anterior vaginal wall in four of women concluding that area is g spot in a 1990 study an anonymous questionnaire was distributed to 2 350 professional women in united states and canada with a subsequent 55 return rate of these respondents 40 reported having a fluid release ejaculation at moment of orgasm and 82 of women who reported sensitive area grafenberg spot also reported ejaculation with their orgasms several variables were associated with this perceived existence of female ejaculation some research suggests that g spot and clitoral orgasms are of same origin masters and johnson were first to determine that clitoral structures surround and extend along and within labia upon studying women s sexual response cycle to different stimulation they observed that both clitoral and vaginal orgasms had same stages of physical response and found that majority of their subjects could only achieve clitoral orgasms while a minority achieved vaginal orgasms on this basis masters and johnson argued that clitoral stimulation is source of both kinds of orgasms reasoning that clitoris is stimulated during penetration by friction against its hood researchers at university of l aquila using ultrasonography presented evidence that women who experience vaginal orgasms are statistically more likely to have thicker tissue in anterior vaginal wall researchers believe these findings make it possible for women to have a rapid test to confirm whether or not they have a g spot professor of genetic epidemiology tim spector who co authored research questioning existence of g spot and finalized it in 2009 also hypothesizes thicker tissue in g spot area he states that this tissue may be part of clitoris and is not a separate erogenous zone supporting spector s conclusion is a study published in 2005 which investigates size of clitoris it suggests that clitoral tissue extends into anterior wall of vagina main researcher of studies australian urologist helen o connell asserts that this interconnected relationship is physiological explanation for conjectured g spot and experience of vaginal orgasms taking into account stimulation of internal parts of clitoris during vaginal penetration while using mri technology o connell noted a direct relationship between legs or roots of clitoris and erectile tissue of clitoral bulbs and corpora and distal urethra and vagina vaginal wall is in fact clitoris said o connell if you lift skin off vagina on side walls you get bulbs of clitoris triangular masses of erectile tissue o connell et al who performed dissections on female genitals of cadavers and used photography to map structure of nerves in clitoris were already aware that clitoris is more than just its glans and asserted in 1998 that there is more erectile tissue associated with clitoris than is generally described in anatomical textbooks they concluded that some females have more extensive clitoral tissues and nerves than others especially having observed this in young cadavers as compared to elderly ones and therefore whereas majority of females can only achieve orgasm by direct stimulation of external parts of clitoris stimulation of more generalized tissues of clitoris via intercourse may be sufficient for others french researchers odile buisson and pierre foldes reported similar findings to those of o connell s in 2008 they published first complete 3d of stimulated clitoris and republished it in 2009 with new research demonstrating ways in which erectile tissue of clitoris and surrounds vagina on basis of this research they argued that women may be able to achieve vaginal orgasm via stimulation of g spot because highly innervated clitoris is pulled closely to anterior wall of vagina when woman is sexually aroused and during vaginal penetration they assert that since front wall of vagina is inextricably linked with internal parts of clitoris stimulating vagina without activating clitoris may be next to impossible in their 2009 published study coronal planes during perineal contraction and finger penetration demonstrated a close relationship between root of clitoris and anterior vaginal wall buisson and foldes suggested that special sensitivity of lower anterior vaginal wall could be explained by pressure and movement of clitoris s root during a vaginal penetration and subsequent perineal contraction female prostate in 2001 federative committee on anatomical terminology accepted female prostate as an accurate term for skene s gland which is believed to be found in g spot area along walls of urethra male prostate is biologically homologous to skene s gland it has been unofficially called male g spot because it can also be used as an erogenous zone regnier de graaf in 1672 observed that secretions female ejaculation by erogenous zone in vagina lubricate in agreeable fashion during coitus modern scientific hypotheses linking g spot sensitivity with female ejaculation led to idea that non urine female ejaculate may originate from skene s gland with skene s gland and male prostate acting similarly in terms of prostate specific antigen and prostate specific acid phosphatase studies which led to a trend of calling skene s glands female prostate additionally enzyme involved with erectile dysfunction has additionally been associated with g spot area because of these factors it has been argued that g spot is a system of glands and ducts located within anterior front wall of vagina a similar approach has linked g spot with urethral sponge clinical significance g spot amplification also called g spot augmentation or g shot is a procedure intended to temporarily increase pleasure in sexually active women with normal sexual function focusing on increasing size and sensitivity of g spot g spot amplification is performed by attempting to locate g spot and noting measurements for future reference after numbing area with a local anesthetic human engineered collagen is then injected directly under mucosa in area g spot is concluded to be in a position paper published by american college of obstetricians and gynecologists in 2007 warns that there is no valid medical reason to perform procedure which is not considered routine or accepted by college and it has not been proven to be safe or effective potential risks include sexual dysfunction infection altered sensation dyspareunia adhesions and scarring college position is that it is untenable to recommend procedure procedure is also not approved by food and drug administration or american medical association and no peer reviewed studies have been accepted to account for either safety or effectiveness of this treatment society and culture general skepticism in addition to general skepticism among gynecologists sexologists and other researchers that g spot exists a team at king s college london in late 2009 suggested that its existence is subjective they acquired largest sample size of women to date 1 800 who are pairs of twins and found that twins did not report a similar g spot in their questionnaires research headed by tim spector documents a 15 year study of twins identical and non identical identical twins share genes while non identical pairs share 50 of theirs according to researchers if one identical twin reported having a g spot it was more likely that other would too but this pattern did not materialize study co author andrea believes it is rather irresponsible to claim existence of an entity that has never been proven and pressurise women and men too she stated that one of reasons for research was to remove feelings of inadequacy or underachievement for women who feared they lacked a g spot researcher beverly whipple dismissed findings commenting that twins have different sexual partners and techniques and that study did not properly account for lesbian or bisexual women petra boynton a british scientist who has written extensively on g spot debate is also concerned about promotion of g spot leading women to feel dysfunctional if they do not experience it we re all different some women will have a certain area within vagina which will be very sensitive and some won t but they won t necessarily be in area called g spot she stated if a woman spends all her time worrying about whether she is normal or has a g spot or not she will focus on just one area and ignore everything else it s telling people that there is a single best way to have sex which isn t right thing to do nerve endings g spot proponents are criticized for giving too much credence to anecdotal evidence and for questionable investigative methods for instance studies which have yielded positive evidence for a precisely located g spot involve small participant samples while existence of a greater concentration of nerve endings at lower third near entrance of vagina is commonly cited some scientific examinations of vaginal wall innervation have shown no single area with a greater density of nerve endings several researchers also consider connection between skene s gland and g spot to be weak urethral sponge however which is also hypothesized as g spot contains sensitive nerve endings and erectile tissue sensitivity is not determined by neuron density alone other factors include branching patterns of neuron terminals and cross or collateral innervation of neurons while g spot opponents argue that because there are very few tactile nerve endings in vagina and that therefore g spot cannot exist g spot proponents argue that vaginal orgasms rely on pressure sensitive nerves clitoral and other anatomical debates g spot having an anatomical relationship with clitoris has been challenged by vincenzo puppo who while agreeing that clitoris is center of female sexual pleasure disagrees with helen o connell and other researchers terminological and anatomical descriptions of clitoris he stated clitoral bulbs is an incorrect term from an embryological and anatomical viewpoint in fact bulbs do not develop from phallus and they do not belong to clitoris he says that clitoral bulbs is not a term used in human anatomy and that vestibular bulbs is correct term adding that gynecologists and sexual experts should inform public with facts instead of hypotheses or personal opinions c litoral vaginal uterine orgasm g a c u spot orgasm and female ejaculation are terms that should not be used by sexologists women and mass media he said further commenting that anterior vaginal wall is separated from posterior urethral wall by septum its thickness is 10 12 mm and that inner clitoris does not exist female perineal urethra which is located in front of anterior vaginal wall is about one centimeter in length and g spot is located in pelvic wall of urethra 2 3 cm into vagina puppo stated he believes that penis cannot come in contact with congregation of multiple nerves veins situated until angle of clitoris detailed by georg ludwig kobelt or with roots of clitoris which do not have sensory receptors or erogenous sensitivity during vaginal intercourse he did however dismiss orgasmic definition of g spot that emerged after ernst grafenberg stating that there is no anatomical evidence of vaginal orgasm which was invented by freud in 1905 without any scientific basis puppo s belief that there is no anatomical relationship between vagina and clitoris is contrasted by general belief among researchers that vaginal orgasms are result of clitoral stimulation they maintain that clitoral tissue extends or is at least likely stimulated by clitoral bulbs even in area most commonly reported to be g spot my view is that g spot is really just extension of clitoris on inside of vagina analogous to base of male penis said researcher kilchevsky because female fetal development is default direction of fetal development in absence of substantial exposure to male hormones and therefore penis is essentially a clitoris enlarged by such hormones kilchevsky believes that there is no evolutionary reason why females would have two separate structures capable of producing orgasms and blames porn industry and g spot promoters for encouraging myth of a distinct g spot general difficulty of achieving vaginal orgasms which is a predicament that is likely due to nature easing process of child bearing by drastically reducing number of vaginal nerve endings challenge arguments that vaginal orgasms help encourage sexual intercourse in order to facilitate reproduction o connell stated that focusing on g spot to exclusion of rest of a woman s body is a bit like stimulating a guy s testicles without touching penis and expecting an orgasm to occur just because love is present she stated that it is best to think of clitoris urethra and vagina as one unit because they are intimately related ian kerner stated that g spot may be nothing more than roots of clitoris crisscrossing urethral sponge a rutgers university study published in 2011 was first to map female genitals onto sensory portion of brain and supports possibility of a distinct g spot when research team asked several women to stimulate themselves in a functional magnetic resonance fmri machine brain scans showed stimulating clitoris vagina and cervix lit up distinct areas of women s sensory cortex which means brain registered distinct feelings between stimulating clitoris cervix and vaginal wall where g spot is reported to be i think that bulk of evidence shows that g spot is not a particular thing stated barry head of research findings it s not like saying what is thyroid gland g spot is more of a thing like new york city is a thing it s a region it s a convergence of many different structures in 2009 journal of sexual medicine held a debate for both sides of g spot issue concluding that further evidence is needed to validate existence of g spot in 2012 scholars kilchevsky lowenstein and gruenwald stated in journal reports in public media would lead one to believe g spot is a well characterized entity capable of providing extreme sexual stimulation yet this is far from truth authors cited that dozens of trials have attempted to confirm existence of a g spot using surveys pathologic specimens various imaging modalities and biochemical markers and concluded surveys found that a majority of women believe a g spot actually exists although not all of women who believed in it were able to locate it attempts to characterize vaginal innervation have shown some differences in nerve distribution across vagina although findings have not proven to be universally reproducible furthermore radiographic studies have been unable to demonstrate a unique entity other than clitoris whose direct stimulation leads to vaginal orgasm objective measures have failed to provide strong and consistent evidence for existence of an anatomical site that could be related to famed g spot however reliable reports and anecdotal testimonials of existence of a highly sensitive area in distal anterior vaginal wall raise question of whether enough investigative modalities have been implemented in search of g spot a 2014 review from nature reviews urology reported that no single structure consistent with a distinct g spot has been identified history release of fluids had been seen by medical practitioners as beneficial to health within this context various methods were used over centuries to release female seed via vaginal lubrication or female ejaculation as a treatment for suffocation ex suffocation of womb female hysteria or green sickness methods included a midwife rubbing walls of vagina or insertion of penis or penis shaped objects into vagina in book history of v catherine blackledge lists old terms for what she believes refer to female prostate skene s gland including little stream black pearl and palace of yin in china skin of earthworm in japan and nadi in india sex manual ranga blackledge p 201 17th century dutch physician regnier de graaf described female ejaculation and referred to an erogenous zone in vagina that he linked as homologous with male prostate this zone was later reported by german gynecologist ernst grafenberg coinage of term g spot has been credited to addiego et al in 1981 named after grafenberg and to alice kahn ladas and beverly whipple et al in 1982 grafenberg s 1940s research however was dedicated to urethral stimulation grafenberg stated an erotic zone always could be demonstrated on anterior wall of vagina along course of urethra concept of g spot entered popular culture with 1982 publication of g spot and other recent discoveries about human sexuality by ladas whipple and perry but it was criticized immediately by gynecologists some of them denied its existence as absence of arousal made it less likely to observe and autopsy studies did not report it see also human female sexuality human sexuality labiaplasty vaginoplasty anterior fornix erogenous
