dvd 20th century fox weekend at burnsie s is second episode vitti wrote in which a character forgets to vote at an election and second episode he wrote in which homer takes a chemical that causes him to be promoted by burns and run into conflict with smithers you can t do anything for first time at this point vitti quipped producer and former showrunner mike reiss has stated that he thoroughly enjoyed working on weekend at burnsie s i gotta say this was most fun i ever had working on an episode he said in episode s dvd commentary everyone but me had stories to tell about various things there would be about four hours of recollection before any rewriting happened because use of medicinal marijuana is prominently featured in episode fox had incredible fears about it and were very hesitant to have it broadcast they especially disapproved of a scene in which homer smokes marijuana for first time since they did not want to instruct children how to smoke staff discussed scene for a long time with network until they came up with a compromise just before joint touches homer s lips scene cuts to a psychedelic sequence that transpires from joint s tip despite their concerns jean opined that network gave staff a pretty good amount of creative freedom with episode obviously network didn t want us glorifying casual marijuana use he said in an interview with music magazine relix like we usually do we look at everything from two sides and it s supposed to be a thoughtful look at a serious thing despite modification of scene network and series staff members were still worried about how episode would be received weeks before it aired we were going this is really going to kill everything jean said in episode s dvd commentary thumb 280px american rock band phish guest starred as themselves in episode after being attacked by crows homer is seen being treated by dr hibbert at springfield general hospital while there are no visible scars on him character instead has a slightly curled hair during a color screening of scene homer s body looked a little too bloody and damaged prompting staff to change it one thing i learned a long time ago is you gotta be careful how you change characters basic model pack s jean said in episode s dvd commentary he also said that he was happy that many viewers identify with characters and don t want to see them get hurt or injured in any way they don t mind if homer falls down a cliff but he should recover while working on episode series staff debated what size to make homer s pupils when he is under influence of marijuana because a common effect of smoking marijuana is dilated pupils animators initially suggested widening homer s but settled for just them slightly silverman david 2010 commentary for weekend at burnsie s in simpsons complete thirteenth season dvd 20th century fox weekend at burnsie s features members of american rock band phish trey anastasio page mcconnell mike gordon and jon fishman as themselves at time of episode s recording phish was in middle of a two year hiatus from touring and recording but members agreed to record dialogue together for show idea to include band in episode was pitched during episode s production phish plays at rally we thought they d be perfect group to use for plot jean said meyer who pitched episode s premise was a fan of band but jean did not know much of them before they appeared in episode i ve never seen one of their concerts so i m not most familiar he said he first became aware of band after reading an article about them in entertainment weekly as they worked on episode however jean became more acquainted with band members they were nice he said jon fishman said to me that band had talked from time to time about if they were to ever be on simpsons what it would be like i said well how close was it he said pretty close to what we expected laughs that was gratifying band performs their song run like an antelope during their appearance in episode during their scene anastasio is shown playing a few bars of simpsons theme song on his guitar which he often did during band s concerts in mid 1990s as part of a series of secret language signals they had taught their fans according to peter shapiro of relix some fans of phish debated whether or not there had been any references to band before this episode while band was mentioned by name in season 12 episode lisa tree hugger there had not been any conscious attempts to reference band before weekend at burnsie s this includes a scene in season 11 episode galactica which shows duncan diving horse hanging from a hoist some phish fans argued that scene was a blatant reference to cover of band s seventh studio album hoist that was a total coincidence jean said it reminds me of whole wizard of oz pink floyd dark side of moon hook up i haven t done it and i m sure it works but i just keep thinking that it must be a coincidence before there was invention of video i don t know how pink floyd would have done a whole album to a movie themes and cultural references on may 17 2002 robert s stephens and roger a roffman of seattle times wrote an analysis of weekend at burnsie s in a guest column for newspaper two argued that drugs are almost always shown as having only negative effects even though 10 million people in united states use marijuana for recreational purposes we believe there are good reasons for a more honest dialogue about positive and negative effects of marijuana use a recent episode of popular tv show simpsons highlighted pros and cons of marijuana use and homer simpson s experiences with marijuana provide an example of what we mean they wrote for example when under influence of marijuana homer is relieved from pain in his eye and he also finds himself having a variety of sensory experiences and an enhanced appreciation of music and food these are real effects reported by many marijuana users and we would be hard pressed to call them anything other than benefits stephens and roffman wrote however homer is also depicted spending more time with other drug users than with his family and his friends find that his personality has changed eventually homer is shown having problems with memory and attention losing track of date on which a pro marijuana rally takes place stephens and roffman wrote that side effects shown in episode are perhaps a bit exaggerated but clearly there are costs of marijuana use similar to these that are experienced by real life users jean has stated that he does not know enough to say whether he approves of legislation of medicinal marijuana but none of simpsons writers use drug selman matt 2010 commentary for weekend at burnsie s in simpsons complete thirteenth season dvd 20th century fox it s one of most sober writing staffs i ve ever encountered staff writer max pross said in episode s dvd commentary pross max 2010 commentary for weekend at burnsie s in simpsons complete thirteenth season dvd 20th century fox when asked about what stance episode holds regarding legislation of medicinal marijuana jean said that series staff wanted to explore both sides of issue rather than making an absolute statement he added that episode is rather a critique of legislations that are immediately criminalized after they are legitimized stance is that it seems ridiculous to legalize something and then criminalize it which i have seen happen in various states jean said he continued it s just weird to take away a right or to grant people a liberty and then abandon it i would say that s strongest statement episode makes episode also criticizes use of genetically modified foods at beginning of episode marge announces that family s dinner includes genetically modified vegetables to which lisa replies american corporations should stop playing god with nature she then notices that her potato starts eating her carrot even though episode portrays genetic modifications in a negative light none of simpsons writers were actually against technique after scene was written reiss asked all writers if they were against genetic modifications of food and none of them were very often we take these stands on show that we do not believe in at all reiss explained in dvd commentary for episode scene was originally three times longer and was conceived during a rewrite session with staff writers reiss mike 2010

continued like many other s13 shows this one feels recycled as it lacks much to make it stand out as creative or memorable he summarized episode as being decidedly mediocre nate boss of project blu disliked episode calling it terrible utterly preachy and too damn political for its own good he criticized simpsons staff for making an episode about marijuana as he believed that children might imitate homer simpsons you just pissed off those who choose to live sober by pandering to stupid college kids and idiot high schoolers who may be your only remaining fans boss wrote since its broadcast weekend at burnsie s garnered little to no scrutiny from viewers vitti has never gotten any questions about episode except from his sister in law who wanted him to explain episode for his nephews my sister in law called me up saying that i needed to talk to my nephews about how this was wrong that homer did vitti said they watched it and had lots of questions for her and she referred them all to me so there are some people who are still bothered by it little amount of scrutiny that episode attracted took simpsons staff by surprise as they anticipated that episode would generate a lot of controversy instead blame it on lisa an episode which aired previous week caused an uproar in brazil because of its depiction of country it became one of biggest controversies series has ever faced it just goes to show that you never know what s going to be a problem jean said in dvd commentary for weekend at burnsie s references external links weekend at burnsie s at simpsons com category
