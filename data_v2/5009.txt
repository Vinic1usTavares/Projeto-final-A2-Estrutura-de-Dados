in 1966 three members of mafia invested 3 500 to turn stonewall inn into a gay bar after it had been a restaurant and a nightclub for heterosexuals once a week a police officer would collect envelopes of cash as a payoff as stonewall inn had no liquor license duberman p 185 carter p 68 it had no running water behind bar used glasses were run through tubs of water and immediately reused there were no fire exits and toilets overran consistently carter p 80 though bar was not used for prostitution drug sales and other cash transactions took place it was only bar for gay men in new york city where dancing was allowed duberman p 182 dancing was its main draw since its re opening as a gay club carter p 71 visitors to stonewall inn in 1969 were greeted by a bouncer who inspected them through a peephole in door legal drinking age was 18 and to avoid unwittingly letting in undercover police who were called lily law alice blue gown or betty badge duberman p 187 visitors would have to be known by doorman or look gay entrance fee on weekends was 3 for which customer received two tickets that could be exchanged for two drinks patrons were required to sign their names in a book to prove that bar was a private bottle club but rarely signed their real names there were two dance floors in stonewall interior was painted black making it very dark inside with pulsing gel lights or black lights if police were spotted regular white lights were turned on signaling that everyone should stop dancing or touching in rear of bar was a smaller room frequented by queens it was one of two bars where effeminate men who wore makeup and teased their hair though dressed in men s clothing could go duberman p 189 only a few transvestites or men in full drag were allowed in by bouncers customers were 98 percent male but a few lesbians sometimes came to bar younger homeless adolescent males who slept in nearby christopher park would often try to get in so customers would buy them drinks duberman p 188 age of clientele ranged between upper teens and early thirties and racial mix was evenly distributed among white black and hispanic patrons deitcher p 70 because of its even mix of people its location and attraction of dancing stonewall inn was known by many as gay bar in city carter p 74 police raids on gay bars were frequent occurring on average once a month for each bar many bars kept extra liquor in a secret panel behind bar or in a car down block to facilitate resuming business as quickly as possible if alcohol was seized bar management usually knew about raids beforehand due to police tip offs and raids occurred early enough in evening that business could commence after police had finished duberman pp 192 193 during a typical raid lights were turned on and customers were lined up and their identification cards checked those without identification or dressed in full drag were arrested others were allowed to leave some of men including those in drag used their draft cards as identification women were required to wear three pieces of feminine clothing and would be arrested if found not wearing them employees and management of bars were also typically arrested period

charles smythe and deputy inspector seymour pine arrived at stonewall inn s double doors and announced police we re taking place carter p 137 stonewall employees do not recall being tipped off that a raid was to occur that night as was custom according to duberman p 194 there was a rumor that one might happen but since it was much later than raids generally took place stonewall management thought tip was inaccurate historian david carter presents pp 96 103 indicating that mafia owners of stonewall and manager were blackmailing wealthier customers particularly those who worked in financial district they appeared to be making more money from extortion than they were from liquor sales in bar carter deduces that when police were unable to receive kickbacks from blackmail and theft of negotiable bonds facilitated by pressuring gay wall street customers they decided to close stonewall inn permanently two undercover policewomen and two undercover policemen had entered bar earlier that evening to gather visual evidence as public morals squad waited outside for signal once inside they called for backup from sixth precinct using bar s pay telephone music was turned off and main lights were turned on approximately 205 people were in bar that night patrons who had never experienced a police raid were confused a few who realized what was happening began to run for doors and windows in bathrooms but police barred doors michael fader remembered things happened so fast you kind of got caught not knowing all of a sudden there were police there and we were told to all get in lines and to have our identification ready to be led out of bar raid did not go as planned standard procedure was to line up patrons check their identification and have female police officers take customers dressed as women to bathroom to verify their sex upon which any men dressed as women would be arrested those dressed as women that night refused to go with officers men in line began to refuse to produce their identification police decided to take everyone present to police station after separating those cross dressing in a room in back of bar maria ritter then known as male to her family recalled my biggest fear was that i would get arrested my second biggest fear was that my picture would be in a newspaper or on a television report in my mother s dress carter p 142 both patrons and police recalled that a sense of discomfort spread very quickly spurred by police who began to assault some of lesbians by feeling some of them up inappropriately while them carter p 141 police were to transport bar s alcohol in patrol wagons twenty eight cases of beer and nineteen bottles of hard liquor were seized but patrol wagons had not yet arrived so patrons were required to wait in line for about 15 minutes those who were not arrested were released from front door but they did not leave quickly as usual instead they stopped outside and a crowd began to grow and watch within minutes between 100 and 150 people had congregated outside some after they were released from inside stonewall and some after noticing police cars and crowd although police forcefully pushed or kicked some patrons out of bar some customers released by police performed for crowd by posing and saluting police in an exaggerated fashion crowd s applause encouraged them further wrists were limp hair was and reactions to applause were classic teal p 2 when first patrol wagon arrived inspector pine recalled that crowd most of whom were homosexual had grown to at least ten times number of people who were arrested and they all became very quiet carter p 147 confusion over radio communication delayed arrival of a second wagon police began escorting mafia members into first wagon to cheers of bystanders next regular employees were loaded into wagon a bystander shouted gay power someone began singing we shall overcome and crowd reacted with amusement and general good humor mixed with growing and intensive hostility carter pp 147 148 an officer shoved a transvestite who responded by hitting him on head with her purse as crowd began to boo author edmund white who had been passing by recalled everyone s restless angry and high spirited no one has a slogan no one even has an attitude but something s brewing carter p 148 pennies then beer bottles were thrown at wagon as a rumor spread through crowd that patrons still inside bar were being beaten a scuffle broke out when a woman in handcuffs was escorted from door of bar to waiting police wagon several times she escaped repeatedly and fought with four of police swearing and shouting for about ten minutes described as a typical new york butch and a dyke stone butch she had been hit on head by an officer with a baton for as one witness claimed complaining that her handcuffs were too tight duberman p 196 bystanders recalled that woman whose identity remains unknown storme delarverie has been identified by some including herself as woman but accounts of people who witnessed scene including letters and news reports of woman who fought with police conflicted where witnesses claim one woman who fought her treatment at hands of police caused crowd to become angry some also remembered several butch lesbians had begun to fight back while still in bar at least one was already bleeding when taken out of bar carter pp 152 153 craig rodwell in duberman p 197 claims arrest of woman was not primary event that triggered violence but one of several simultaneous occurrences there was just a flash of group of mass anger sparked crowd to fight when she looked at bystanders and shouted why don t you guys do something after an officer picked her up and heaved her into back of wagon carter p 152 crowd became a mob and went berserk it was at that moment that scene became explosive carter p 151 violence breaks out police tried to restrain some of crowd knocking a few people down which incited bystanders even more some of those handcuffed in wagon escaped when police left them unattended deliberately according to some witnesses witness morty stated there s no doubt in my mind that those people were deliberately left unguarded i assume there was some sort of relationship between bar management and local police so they really didn t want to arrest those people but they had to at least look like they were doing their jobs marcus p 128 carter p 154 as crowd tried to overturn police wagon two police cars and wagon with a few slashed tires left immediately with inspector pine urging them to return as soon as possible commotion attracted more people who learned what was happening someone in crowd declared that bar had been raided because they didn t pay off cops to which someone else yelled let s pay them off carter p 156 coins sailed through air towards police as crowd shouted pigs and faggot cops beer cans were thrown and police lashed out dispersing some of crowd who found a construction site nearby with stacks of bricks police outnumbered by between 500 and 600 people grabbed several people including folk singer and mentor of bob dylan dave van ronk who had been attracted to revolt from a bar two doors away from stonewall though van ronk was not gay he had experienced police violence when he participated in antiwar demonstrations as far as i was concerned anybody who d stand against cops was all right with me and that s why i stayed in every time you turned around cops were pulling some outrage or another van ronk was one of thirteen arrested that night page scans ten police officers including two policewomen barricaded themselves van ronk howard smith a column writer for village voice and several handcuffed detainees inside stonewall inn for their own safety multiple accounts of riot assert that there was no pre existing organization or apparent cause for demonstration what ensued was spontaneous in years since riots occurred death of gay icon judy garland earlier in week on june 22 1969 has been attributed as a significant factor in riots but no participants in saturday morning s demonstrations recall garland s name being discussed no print accounts of riots by reliable sources cite garland as a reason for riot although one sarcastic account by a heterosexual publication suggested it carter p 260 although sylvia rivera recalls she was saddened and amazed by turnout at garland s funeral on friday june 27 she said that she did not feel like going out much but changed her mind later duberman pp 190 191 bob kohler used to talk to homeless youth in sheridan square and said when people talk about judy garland s death having anything much to do with riot that makes me crazy street kids faced death every day they had nothing to lose and they couldn t have cared less about judy we re talking about kids who were fourteen fifteen sixteen judy garland was middle aged darling of middle class gays i get upset about this because it trivializes whole thing deitcher p 72 michael fader explained we all had a collective feeling like we d had enough of this kind of shit it wasn t anything tangible anybody said to anyone else it was just kind of like everything over years had come to a head on that one particular night in one particular place and it was not an organized demonstration everyone in crowd felt that we were never going to go back it was like last straw it was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us all kinds of people all different reasons but mostly it was total outrage anger sorrow everything combined and everything just kind of ran its course it was police who were doing most of destruction we were really trying to get back in and break free and we felt that we had freedom at last or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom we weren t going to be walking meekly in night and letting them shove us around it s like standing your ground for first time and in a really strong way and that s what caught police by surprise there was something in air freedom a long time overdue and we re going to fight for it it took different forms but bottom line was we weren t going to go away and we didn t carter p 160 thumb alt a black and white photograph showing backs of three uniformed police officers and a man with short cropped hair in a suit pushing back a crowd of young

welcome in or cannot afford other places of homosexual social gathering stonewall became home to these kids when it was raided they fought for it that and fact that they had nothing to lose other than most tolerant and gay place in town explains why teal p 13 garbage cans garbage bottles rocks and bricks were hurled at building breaking windows witnesses attest that flame queens hustlers and gay

realized pivotal change brought by stonewall riots an organizer of gay activism in 1950s he was used to persuasion trying to convince heterosexuals that gay people were no different than they were when he and other people marched in front of white house state department and independence hall only five years earlier their objective was to look as if they could work for u s government cain pp 91

stonewall we had fifty to sixty gay groups in country a year later there was at least fifteen hundred by two years later to extent that a count could be made it was twenty five hundred carter p 251 similar to kameny s regret at his own reaction to shift in attitudes after riots randy wicker came to describe his embarrassment as one of greatest mistakes of his life clendinen p 25 image of gay people retaliating against police after so many years of allowing such treatment to go unchallenged stirred an unexpected spirit among many homosexuals kay lahusen who photographed marches in 1965 stated up to 1969 this movement was generally called homosexual or homophile movement many new activists consider stonewall uprising birth of gay liberation movement certainly it was birth of gay pride on a massive scale lafrank p 21 david carter in his article what made stonewall different explained that even though there were several uprisings before stonewall reason stonewall was so historical was that thousands of people were involved riot lasted a long time six days it was first to get major media coverage and it sparked formation of many gay rights groups legacy unlikely community within two years of stonewall riots there were gay rights groups in every major american city as well as canada australia and western europe adam p 82 people who joined activist organizations after riots had very little in common other than their same sex attraction many who arrived at glf or gaa meetings were taken aback by number of gay people in one place marcus pp 152 155 race class ideology and gender became frequent obstacles in years after riots this was illustrated during 1973 stonewall rally when moments after barbara gittings exuberantly praised diversity of crowd feminist activist jean o leary protested what she perceived as mocking of women by cross dressers and drag queens in attendance during a speech by o leary in which she claimed that drag queens made fun of women for entertainment value and profit sylvia rivera and lee brewster jumped on stage and shouted you go to bars because of what drag queens did for you and these bitches tell us to quit being ourselves clendinen pp 171 172 both drag queens and lesbian feminists in attendance left in disgust duberman p 236 o leary also worked in early 1970s to exclude transgender people from gay rights issues because she felt that rights for transgender people would be too difficult to attain sylvia rivera left new york city in mid 1970s relocating to upstate new york september 21 1995 accessed july 24 2015 but later returned to city in mid 1990s to advocate for homeless members of gay community september 21 1995 accessed july 24 2015 initial disagreements between participants in movements however often evolved after further reflection o leary later regretted her stance against drag queens attending in 1973 looking back i find this so embarrassing because my views have changed so much since then i would never pick on a transvestite now it was horrible how could i work to exclude transvestites and at same time criticize feminists who were doing their best back in those days to exclude lesbians marcus p 156 o leary was referring to lavender menace a description by second wave feminist betty friedan for attempts by members of national organization for women now to distance themselves from perception of now as a haven for lesbians as part of this process rita mae brown and other lesbians who had been active in now were forced out they staged a protest in 1970 at second congress to unite women and earned support of many now members finally gaining full acceptance in 1971 adam pp 90 91 growth of lesbian feminism in 1970s at times so conflicted with gay liberation movement that some lesbians refused to work with gay men many lesbians found men s attitudes patriarchal and chauvinistic and saw in gay men same misguided notions about women as they saw in heterosexual men faderman pp 211 212 issues most important to gay men entrapment and public solicitation were not shared by lesbians in 1977 a lesbian pride rally was organized as an alternative to sharing gay men s issues especially what adrienne rich termed violent self destructive world of gay bars veteran gay activist barbara gittings chose to work in gay rights movement explaining it s a matter of where does it hurt most for me it hurts most not in female arena but gay arena throughout 1970s gay activism had significant successes one of first and most important was zap in may 1970 by los angeles glf at a convention of american psychiatric association apa at a conference on behavior modification during a film demonstrating use of electroshock therapy to decrease same sex attraction morris and glf members in audience interrupted film with shouts of torture and barbarism williams retter p 121 they took over microphone to announce that medical professionals who prescribed such therapy for their homosexual patients were complicit in torturing them although 20 psychiatrists in attendance left glf spent hour following zap with those remaining trying to convince them that homosexual people were not mentally ill when apa invited gay activists to speak to group in 1972 activists brought john e fryer a gay psychiatrist who wore a mask because he felt his practice was in danger in december 1973 in large part due to efforts of gay activists apa voted unanimously to remove homosexuality from diagnostic and statistical manual marcus pp 146 147 cain p 65 gay men and lesbians came together to work in grassroots political organizations responding to organized resistance in 1977 a coalition of conservatives named save our children staged a campaign to repeal a civil rights ordinance in dade county florida save our children was successful enough to influence similar repeals in several american cities in 1978 however same year a campaign in california called briggs initiative designed to force dismissal of homosexual public school employees was defeated cain p 275 reaction to influence of save our children and briggs initiative in gay community was so significant that it has been called second stonewall for many activists marking their initiation into political participation p 214 subsequent 1979 national march on washington for lesbian and gay rights was timed to coincide with ten year anniversary of stonewall riots amin 2008 dividends of dissent how conflict and culture work in lesbian and gay marches on washington university of chicago press rejection of prior gay subculture stonewall riots marked such a significant turning point that many aspects of prior gay and lesbian culture such as bar culture formed from decades of shame and secrecy were forcefully ignored and denied historian martin duberman writes decades preceding stonewall continue to be regarded by most gay men and lesbians as some vast neolithic wasteland duberman p xv sociologist barry adam notes every social movement must choose at some point what to retain and what to reject out of its past what traits are results of oppression and what are healthy and authentic adam p 93 in conjunction with growing feminist movement of early 1970s roles of butch and femme that developed in lesbian bars in 1950s and 1960s were rejected because as one writer put it all role playing is sick adam p 94 lesbian feminists considered butch roles as archaic imitations of masculine behavior faderman p 232 some women according to lillian faderman were eager to shed roles they felt forced into playing roles returned for some women in 1980s although they allowed for more flexibility than before stonewall faderman pp 210 266 author michael bronski highlights attack on pre stonewall culture particularly gay pulp fiction for men where themes often reflected self hatred or ambivalence about being gay many books ended and drastically often with suicide and writers portrayed their gay characters as alcoholics or deeply unhappy these books which he describes as an enormous and cohesive literature by and for gay men bronski p 16 have not been reissued and are lost to later generations dismissing reason simply as political correctness bronski writes gay liberation was a youth movement whose sense of history was defined to a large degree by rejection of past

building where stonewall inn was located building and surrounding streets have been declared a national historic landmark riots spawned from a bar raid became a literal example of gay men and lesbians fighting back and a symbolic call to arms for many people historian david carter remarks in his book about stonewall riots that bar itself was a complex business that represented a community center an opportunity for mafia to blackmail its own customers a home and a place of exploitation and degradation carter p 264 true legacy of stonewall riots carter insists is ongoing struggle for lesbian gay bisexual and transgender equality carter p 266 historian nicholas edsall writes stonewall has been compared to any number of acts of radical protest and defiance in american history from boston tea party on but best and certainly a more nearly contemporary analogy is with rosa parks refusal to move to back of bus in montgomery alabama in december 1955 which sparked modern civil rights movement within months after stonewall radical gay liberation groups and newsletters sprang up in cities and on college campuses across america and then across all of northern europe as well edsall p 333 before rebellion at stonewall inn homosexuals were as historians dudley clendinen and adam nagourney write a secret legion of people known of but discounted ignored laughed at or despised and like holders of a secret they had an advantage which was a disadvantage too and which was true of no other minority group in united states they were invisible unlike african americans women native americans jews irish italians asians hispanics or any other cultural group which struggled for respect and equal rights homosexuals had no physical or cultural markings no language or dialect which could identify them to each other or to anyone else but that night for first time usual acquiescence turned into violent resistance from that night lives of millions of gay men and lesbians and attitude toward them of larger culture in which they lived began to change rapidly people began to appear in public as homosexuals demanding respect clendinen p 12 historian lillian faderman calls riots shot heard round world explaining stonewall rebellion was crucial because it sounded rally for that movement it became an emblem of gay and lesbian power by calling on dramatic tactic of violent protest that was being used by other oppressed groups events at stonewall implied that homosexuals had as much reason to be disaffected as they faderman p 195 thumb left sign left by police following raid is now on display just inside entrance joan nestle co founded lesbian herstory archives in 1974 and credits its creation to that night and courage that found its voice in streets cautious however not to attribute start of gay activism to stonewall riots nestle writes i certainly don t see gay and lesbian history starting with stonewall and i don t see resistance starting with stonewall what i do see is a historical coming together of forces and sixties changed how human beings endured things in this society and what they refused to endure certainly something special happened on that night in 1969 and we ve made it more special in our need to have what i call a point of origin it s more complex than saying that it all started with stonewall deitcher p 74 events of early morning of june 28 1969 were not first instances of gay men and lesbians fighting back against police in new york city and elsewhere not only had mattachine society been active in major cities such as los angeles and chicago but similarly marginalized people started riot at compton s cafeteria in 1966 and another riot responded to a raid on los angeles black cat tavern in 1967 witt et al p 210 however several
