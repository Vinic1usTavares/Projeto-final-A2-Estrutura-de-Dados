appreciated episode for subverting expectations by having finn s mother react supportively to news of quinn s pregnancy rather than more affluent and financially capable dan snierson for entertainment weekly opined that ballad was not as good as preceding episode wheels but that overall it did offer up a few choice cuts and fun moments while advancing one big story line james poniewozik of time agreed that ballad was not as good as wheels commenting it s amazing how glee can career from excruciating to transcendent within a single episode chicago tribune eric zorn watching glee for first time deemed episode deliriously deliciously bad deriding casting of young adult actors as teenagers one dimensional stock characters and kitschy plots zorn questioned so do people actually like this
