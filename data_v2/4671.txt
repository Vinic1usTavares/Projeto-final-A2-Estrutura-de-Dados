said he was grateful to have some of most realistic and heartfelt storylines when asked which of actors would have been drafted highest by nfl he replied probably taylor kitsch he s a good athlete but scott will kill me for saying that scott played football growing up and he has a good arm but taylor is faster and i think that would help his draft status gaius charles who plays smash williams

be allowed to survive henry goldblatt writing for entertainment weekly gave episode a grade b he accused show of abandoning racial diversity and gritty poverty of film but still allowed that peter berg had kept thrust matt saracen character was singled out as particularly promising while positively contrasting show with other teen age dramas like one tree hill goldblatt also had doubts about its staying power variety s brian lowry called show earnest beautifully shot and perhaps more organically religious than anything else in primetime still he felt show was like one of those family

men in order to survive washington post critic tom shales called show extraordinary in just about every conceivable way particularly emphasising quality of cast shales did have issues with documentary
