chess player s manual a complete guide to chess it was a handsomely produced work with more than 800 of its 900 pages devoted to openings and illustrative games book became subject of biting criticism

international chess magazine may 1888 pp 137 38 mr gossip had practiced unfair ruse of carefully preserving stray skittles games which he had happened to win or draw generally after many defeats

one of old time monks he has a good shaped cranium bald at top and is a little above medium height he believes himself to be one of greatest chessplayers in world and thinks that if everything had gone on to his liking he could have beaten all champions at tournament he is a deliberate player but every now and then he takes a nip from a flask of brandy that generally stands on his table he complained that his chair was too low and he once attributed a defeat to that finally he got a large ledger and sat upon it he did in fact seem to derive some inspiration from its contents for he played two or three excellent games afterward diggle observes that gossip developed a happy knack of treading on other people s corns by rushing into print his occasional wins in offhand games against such leading players as bird and zukertort he also vehemently denounced his critics and those with whom he disagreed for example in 1888 columbia chess chronicle quoted a lecture he had given two days before on steinitz gambit after condemning as utterly worthless analysis of that opening published in two english periodicals gossip declaimed winter 2004 quoting columbia chess chronicle september 15 1888 pp 91 92 in order therefore to establish an important point of theory and at same time to prevent american chessplayers from being misled and deceived by superficial analysis of incompetent british chess editors whose object in condemning steinitz gambit has obviously been mainly to depreciate originality of its illustrious inventor whom they invariably try to drag down to their own miserable level of shallow incompetency and self conceit i submit following variations which at any rate possess undeniable merit of exposing hollow analytical twaddle continually published in two london journals above named hooper and whyld note gossip s unusual talent for making enemies and attribute critical reception of his books to this since in their opinion his books were not significantly worse than general run of time and they were better than for example those by bird who was popular they remark on his travels that disliked in england he travelled to australia united states and canada where he also became unpopular some measure of his talent for stirring up controversy is provided by a letter pollock wrote during their 1894 95 match whyld july 2001 quoting four
