alt thumb gas metal arc welding mig welding gas metal arc welding gmaw sometimes referred to by its subtypes metal inert gas mig welding or metal active gas mag welding is a welding process in which an electric arc forms between a consumable mig wire electrode and workpiece metal s which heats workpiece metal s causing them to melt and join along with wire electrode a shielding gas feeds through welding gun which shields process from contaminants in air process can be semi automatic or automatic a constant voltage direct current power source is most commonly used with gmaw but constant current systems as well as alternating current can be used there are four primary methods of metal transfer in gmaw called globular short circuiting spray and pulsed spray each of which has distinct properties and corresponding advantages and limitations originally developed in 1940s for welding aluminium and other non ferrous materials gmaw was soon applied to steels because it provided faster welding time compared to other welding processes cost of inert gas limited its use in steels until several years later when use of semi inert gases such as carbon dioxide became common further developments during 1950s and 1960s gave process more versatility and as a result it became a highly used industrial process today gmaw is most common industrial welding process preferred for its versatility speed and relative ease of adapting process to robotic automation unlike welding processes that do not employ a shielding gas such as shielded metal arc welding it is rarely used outdoors or in other areas of moving air a related process flux cored arc welding often does not use a shielding gas but instead employs an electrode wire that is hollow and filled with flux development principles of gas metal arc welding began to be understood in early 19th century after humphry davy discovered short pulsed electric arcs in 1800 vasily petrov independently produced continuous electric arc in 1802 followed by davy after 1808 it was not until 1880s that technology became developed with aim of industrial usage at first carbon electrodes were used in carbon arc welding by 1890 metal electrodes had been invented by nikolay and c l coffin in 1920 an early predecessor of gmaw was invented by p o nobel of general electric it used direct current with a bare electrode wire and used arc voltage to regulate feed rate it did not use a shielding gas to protect weld as developments in welding atmospheres did not take place until later that decade in 1926 another forerunner of gmaw was released but it was not suitable for practical use in 1948 gmaw was developed by battelle memorial institute it used a smaller diameter electrode and a constant voltage power source developed by h e kennedy it offered a high deposition rate but high cost of inert gases limited its use to non ferrous materials and prevented cost savings in 1953 use of carbon dioxide as a welding atmosphere was developed and it quickly gained popularity in gmaw since it made welding steel more economical in 1958 and 1959 short arc variation of gmaw was released which increased welding versatility and made welding of thin materials possible while relying on smaller electrode wires and more advanced power supplies it quickly became most popular gmaw variation spray arc transfer variation was developed in early 1960s when experimenters added small amounts of oxygen to inert gases more recently pulsed current has been applied giving rise to a new method called pulsed spray arc variation gmaw is one of most popular welding methods especially in industrial environments it is used extensively by sheet metal industry and automobile industry there method is often used for arc spot welding replacing riveting or resistance spot welding it is also popular for automated welding where robots handle workpieces and welding gun to accelerate manufacturing gmaw can be difficult to perform well outdoors since drafts can dissipate shielding gas and allow contaminants into weld flux cored arc welding is better suited for outdoor use such as in construction likewise gmaw s use of a shielding gas does not lend itself to underwater welding which is more commonly performed via shielded metal arc welding flux cored arc welding or gas tungsten arc welding equipment to perform gas metal arc welding basic necessary equipment is a welding gun a wire feed unit a welding power supply a welding electrode wire and a shielding gas supply welding gun and wire feed unit right thumb 300px gmaw torch nozzle cutaway image 1 torch handle 2 molded phenolic dielectric shown in white and threaded metal nut insert yellow 3 shielding gas diffuser 4 contact tip 5 nozzle output face thumb 300px gmaw on stainless steel typical gmaw welding gun has a number of key parts a control switch a contact tip a power cable a gas nozzle an electrode conduit and liner and a gas hose control switch or trigger when pressed by operator initiates wire feed electric power and shielding gas flow causing an electric arc to be struck contact tip normally made of copper and sometimes chemically treated to reduce spatter is connected to welding power source through power cable and transmits electrical energy to electrode while directing it to weld area it must be firmly secured and properly sized since it must allow electrode to pass while maintaining electrical contact on way to contact tip wire is protected and guided by electrode conduit and liner which help prevent buckling and maintain an uninterrupted wire feed gas nozzle directs shielding gas evenly into welding zone inconsistent flow may not adequately protect weld area larger nozzles provide greater shielding gas flow which is useful for high current welding operations that develop a larger molten weld pool a gas hose from tanks of shielding gas supplies gas to nozzle sometimes a water hose is also built into welding gun cooling gun in high heat operations wire feed unit supplies electrode to work driving it through conduit and on to contact tip most models provide wire at a constant feed rate but more advanced machines can vary feed rate in response to arc length and voltage some wire feeders can reach feed rates as high as 30 m min 1200 in min but feed rates for semiautomatic gmaw typically range from 2 to 10 m min 75 400 in min tool style most common electrode holder is a semiautomatic air cooled holder compressed air circulates through it to maintain moderate temperatures it is used with lower current levels for welding lap or butt joints second most common type of electrode holder is semiautomatic water cooled where only difference is that water takes place of air it uses higher current levels for welding t or corner joints third typical holder type is a water cooled automatic electrode holder which is typically used with automated equipment power supply most applications of gas metal arc welding use a constant voltage power supply as a result any change in arc length which is directly related to voltage results in a large change in heat input and current a shorter arc length causes a much greater heat input which makes wire electrode melt more quickly and thereby restore original arc length this helps operators keep arc length consistent even when manually welding with hand held welding guns to achieve a similar effect sometimes a constant current power source is used in combination with an arc voltage controlled wire feed unit in this case a change in arc length makes wire feed rate adjust to maintain a relatively constant arc length in rare circumstances a constant current power source and a constant wire feed rate unit might be coupled especially for welding of metals with high thermal conductivities such as aluminum this grants operator additional control over heat input into weld but requires significant skill to perform successfully alternating current is rarely used with gmaw instead direct current is employed and electrode is generally positively charged since anode tends to have a greater heat concentration this results in faster melting of feed wire which increases weld penetration and welding speed polarity can be reversed only when special coated electrode wires are used but since these are not popular a negatively charged electrode is rarely employed electrode electrode is a metallic alloy wire called a mig wire whose selection alloy and size is based primarily on composition of metal being welded process variation being used joint design and material surface conditions electrode selection greatly influences mechanical properties of weld and is a key factor of weld quality in general finished weld metal should have mechanical properties similar to those of base material with no defects such as discontinuities entrained contaminants or porosity within weld to achieve these goals a wide variety of electrodes exist all commercially available electrodes contain metals such as silicon manganese titanium and aluminum in small percentages to help prevent oxygen porosity some contain metals such as titanium and zirconium to avoid nitrogen porosity depending on process variation and base material being welded diameters of electrodes used in gmaw typically range from 0 7 to 2 4 mm 0 028 0 095 in but can be as large as 4 mm 0 16 in smallest electrodes generally up to 1 14 mm 0 045 in are associated with short circuiting metal transfer process while most common spray transfer process mode electrodes are usually at least 0 9 mm 0 035 in shielding gas thumb left 250px gmaw circuit diagram 1 welding torch 2 workpiece 3 power source 4 wire feed unit 5 electrode source 6 shielding gas supply shielding gases are necessary for gas metal arc welding to protect welding area from atmospheric gases such as nitrogen and oxygen which can cause fusion defects porosity and weld metal embrittlement if they come in contact with electrode arc or welding metal this problem is common to all arc welding processes for example in older shielded metal arc welding process smaw electrode is coated with a solid flux which evolves a protective cloud of carbon dioxide when melted by arc in gmaw however electrode wire does not have a flux coating and a separate shielding gas is employed to protect weld this eliminates slag hard residue from flux that builds up after welding and must be chipped off to reveal completed weld choice of a shielding gas depends on several factors most importantly type of material being welded and process variation being used pure inert gases such as argon and helium are only used for nonferrous welding with steel they do not provide adequate weld penetration argon or cause an erratic arc and encourage spatter with helium pure carbon dioxide on other hand allows for deep penetration welds but encourages oxide formation which adversely affects mechanical properties of weld lts low cost makes it an attractive choice but because of reactivity of arc plasma spatter is unavoidable and welding thin materials is difficult as a result argon and carbon dioxide are frequently mixed in a 75 25 to 90 10 mixture generally in short circuit gmaw higher carbon dioxide content increases weld heat and energy when all other weld parameters volts current electrode type and diameter are held same as carbon dioxide content increases over 20 spray transfer gmaw becomes increasingly problematic especially with smaller electrode diameters argon is also commonly mixed with other gases oxygen helium hydrogen and nitrogen addition of up to 5 oxygen like higher concentrations of carbon dioxide mentioned above can be helpful in welding stainless steel however in most applications carbon dioxide is preferred increased oxygen makes shielding gas oxidize electrode which can lead to porosity in deposit if electrode does not contain sufficient excessive oxygen especially when used in application for which it is not prescribed can lead to brittleness in heat affected zone argon helium mixtures are extremely inert and can be used on nonferrous materials a helium concentration of 50 75 raises required voltage and increases heat in arc due to helium s higher ionization temperature hydrogen is sometimes added to argon in small concentrations up to about 5 for welding nickel and thick stainless steel workpieces in higher concentrations up to 25 hydrogen it may be used for welding conductive materials such as copper however it should not be used on steel aluminum or magnesium because it can cause porosity and hydrogen embrittlement shielding gas mixtures of three or more gases are also available mixtures of argon carbon dioxide and oxygen are marketed for welding steels other mixtures add a small amount of helium to argon oxygen combinations these mixtures are claimed to allow higher arc voltages and welding speed helium also sometimes serves as base gas with small amounts of argon and carbon dioxide added however because it is less dense than air helium is less effective at shielding weld than argon which is denser than air it also can lead to arc stability and penetration issues and increased spatter due to its much more energetic arc plasma helium is also substantially more expensive than other shielding gases other specialized and often proprietary gas mixtures claim even greater benefits for specific applications desirable rate of shielding gas flow depends primarily on weld geometry speed current type of gas and metal transfer mode welding flat surfaces requires higher flow than welding grooved materials since gas disperses more quickly faster welding speeds in general mean that more gas must be supplied to provide adequate coverage additionally higher current requires greater flow and generally more helium is required to provide adequate coverage than if argon is used perhaps most importantly four primary variations of gmaw have differing shielding gas flow requirements for small weld pools of short circuiting and pulsed spray modes about 10 l min 20 ft3 h is generally suitable whereas for globular transfer around 15 l min 30 ft3 h is preferred spray transfer variation normally requires more shielding gas flow because of its higher heat input and thus larger weld pool typical gas flow amounts are approximately 20 25 l min 40 50 ft3 h gmaw

electrode 4 shielding gas 5 molten weld metal 6 solidified weld metal 7 workpiece for most of its applications gas metal arc welding is a fairly simple welding process to learn requiring no more than a week or two to master basic welding technique even when welding is performed by well trained operators weld quality can fluctuate since it depends on a number of external factors all gmaw is dangerous though perhaps less so than some other welding methods such as shielded metal arc welding technique gmaw s basic technique is uncomplicated with most individuals able to achieve reasonable proficiency in a few weeks assuming proper training and sufficient practice as much of process is automated gmaw relieves weldor operator of burden of maintaining a precise arc length as well as feeding filler metal into weld puddle coordinated operations that are required in other manual welding processes such as shielded metal arc gmaw requires only that weldor guide gun with proper position and orientation along area being welded as well as periodically clean gun s gas nozzle to remove spatter buildup additional skill includes knowing how to adjust welder so voltage wire feed rate and gas flow rate are correct for materials being welded and wire size being employed maintaining a relatively constant contact tip to work distance stick out distance is important excessive stick out distance may cause wire electrode to prematurely melt causing a sputtering arc and may also cause shielding gas to rapidly disperse degrading quality of weld in contrast insufficient stick out may increase rate at which spatter builds up inside gun s nozzle and in extreme cases may cause damage to gun s contact tip stick out distance varies for different gmaw weld processes and applications orientation of gun relative to is also important it should be held so as to bisect angle between workpieces that is at 45 degrees for a fillet weld and 90 degrees for welding a flat surface travel angle or lead angle is angle of gun with respect to direction of travel and it should generally remain approximately vertical however desirable angle changes somewhat depending on type of shielding gas used with pure inert gases bottom of torch is often slightly in front of upper section while opposite is true when welding atmosphere is carbon dioxide position welding that is welding vertical or overhead joints may require use of a weaving technique to assure proper weld deposition and penetration in position welding gravity tends to cause molten metal to run out of puddle resulting in cratering and undercutting two conditions that produce a weak weld weaving constantly moves fusion zone around so as to limit amount of metal deposited at any one point surface tension then assists in keeping molten metal in puddle until it is able to solidify development of position welding skill takes some experience but is usually soon mastered quality two of most prevalent quality problems in gmaw are dross and porosity if not controlled they can lead to weaker less ductile welds dross is an especially common problem in aluminium gmaw welds normally coming from particles of aluminium oxide or aluminum nitride present in electrode or base materials electrodes and workpieces must be brushed with a wire brush or chemically treated to remove oxides on surface any oxygen in contact with weld pool whether from atmosphere or shielding gas causes dross as well as a result sufficient flow of inert shielding gases is necessary and welding in moving air should be avoided in gmaw primary cause of porosity is gas entrapment in weld pool which occurs when metal solidifies before gas escapes gas can come from impurities in shielding gas or on workpiece as well as from an excessively long or violent arc generally amount of gas entrapped is directly related to cooling rate of weld pool because of its higher thermal conductivity aluminum welds are especially susceptible to greater cooling rates and thus additional porosity to reduce it workpiece and electrode should be clean welding speed diminished and current set high enough to provide sufficient heat input and stable metal transfer but low enough that arc remains steady can also help reduce cooling rate in some cases by reducing temperature gradient between weld area and base metal safety arc welding in any form can be dangerous if proper precautions are not taken since gmaw employs an electric arc must wear suitable protective clothing including heavy gloves and protective long sleeve jackets to minimize exposure to arc itself as well as intense heat sparks and hot metal intense ultraviolet radiation of arc may cause sunburn like damage to exposed skin as well a condition known as arc eye an inflammation of cornea or in cases of prolonged exposure irreversible damage to eye s retina conventional welding helmets contain dark face plates to prevent this exposure newer helmet designs feature a liquid crystal type face plate that self darkens upon exposure to arc transparent welding curtains made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film are often used to shield nearby workers and bystanders from exposure to arc welders are often exposed to hazardous gases and airborne particulate matter gmaw produces smoke containing particles of various types of oxides and size of particles tends to influence toxicity of fumes smaller particles present greater danger concentrations of carbon dioxide and ozone can prove dangerous if ventilation is inadequate other precautions include keeping combustible materials away from workplace and having a working fire extinguisher nearby metal transfer modes three transfer modes in gmaw are globular short circuiting and spray there are a few recognized variations of these three transfer modes including modified short circuiting and pulsed spray globular gmaw with globular metal transfer is considered least desirable of three major gmaw variations because of its tendency to produce high heat a poor weld surface and spatter method was originally developed as a cost efficient way to weld steel using gmaw because this variation uses carbon dioxide a less expensive shielding gas than argon adding to its economic advantage was its high deposition rate allowing welding speeds of up to 110 mm s 250 in min as weld is made a ball of molten metal from electrode tends to build up on end of electrode often in irregular shapes with a larger diameter than electrode itself when droplet finally detaches either by gravity or short circuiting it falls to workpiece leaving an uneven surface and often causing spatter as a result of large molten droplet process is generally limited to flat and horizontal welding positions requires thicker workpieces and results in a larger weld pool short circuiting further developments in welding steel with gmaw led to a variation known as short circuit transfer sct or short arc gmaw in which current is lower than for globular method as a result of lower current heat input for short arc variation is considerably reduced making it possible to weld thinner materials while decreasing amount of distortion and residual stress in weld area as in globular welding molten droplets form on tip of electrode but instead of dropping to weld pool they bridge gap between electrode and weld pool as a result of lower wire feed rate this causes a short circuit and extinguishes arc but it is quickly reignited after surface tension of weld pool pulls molten metal bead off electrode tip this process is repeated about 100 times per second making arc appear constant to human eye this type of metal transfer provides better weld quality and less spatter than globular variation and allows for welding in all positions albeit with slower deposition of weld material setting weld process parameters volts amps and wire feed rate within a relatively narrow band is critical to maintaining a stable arc generally between 100 and 200 amperes at 17 to 22 volts for most applications also using short arc transfer can result in lack of fusion and insufficient penetration when welding thicker materials due to lower arc energy and rapidly freezing weld pool like globular variation it can only be used on ferrous metals cold metal transfer for thin materials cold metal transfer cmt is used by reducing current when a short circuit is registered producing many drops per second cmt can be used for aluminum spray spray transfer gmaw was first metal transfer method used in gmaw and well suited to welding aluminium and stainless steel while employing an inert shielding gas in this gmaw process weld electrode metal is rapidly passed along stable electric arc from electrode to workpiece essentially eliminating spatter and resulting in a high quality weld finish as current and voltage increases beyond range of short circuit transfer weld electrode metal transfer transitions from larger globules through small droplets to a vaporized stream at highest energies since this vaporized spray transfer variation of gmaw weld process requires higher voltage and current than short circuit transfer and as a result of higher heat input and larger weld pool area for a given weld electrode diameter it is generally used only on workpieces of thicknesses above about 6 4 mm 0 25 in also because of large weld pool it is often limited to flat and horizontal welding positions and sometimes also used for vertical down welds it is generally not practical for root pass welds when a smaller electrode is used in conjunction with lower heat input its versatility increases maximum deposition rate for spray arc gmaw is relatively high about 600 mm s 150 in min pulsed spray a variation of spray transfer mode pulse spray is based on principles of spray transfer but uses a pulsing current to melt filler wire and allow one small molten droplet to fall with each pulse pulses allow average current to be lower decreasing overall heat input and thereby decreasing size of weld pool and heat affected zone while making it possible to weld thin workpieces pulse provides a stable arc and no spatter since no short circuiting takes place this also makes process suitable for nearly all metals and thicker electrode wire can be used as well smaller weld pool gives variation greater versatility making it possible to weld in all positions in comparison with short arc gmaw this method has a somewhat slower maximum speed 85 mm s or 200 in min and process also requires that shielding gas be primarily argon with a low carbon dioxide concentration additionally it requires a special power source capable of providing current pulses with a frequency between 30 and 400 pulses per second however method has gained popularity since it requires lower heat input and can be used to weld thin workpieces as well as nonferrous materials comparison with flux cored wire fed arc welding flux cored self shielding or gasless wire fed welding had been developed for simplicity and portability this avoids gas system of conventional gmaw and uses a cored wire containing a solid flux this flux vaporises during welding and produces a plume of shielding gas although described as a flux this compound has little activity and acts mostly as an inert shield wire is of slightly larger diameter than for a comparable gas shielded weld to allow room for flux smallest available is 0 8 mm diameter compared to 0 6 mm for solid wire shield vapor is slightly active rather than inert so process is always mags but not mig inert gas shield this limits process to steel and not aluminium these gasless machines operate as dcen rather than dcep usually used for gmaw solid wire dcep or dc electrode positive makes welding wire into positively charged anode which is hotter side of arc provided that it is switchable from dcen to dcep a gas shielded wire feed machine may also be used for flux cored wire flux cored wire is considered to have some advantages for outdoor welding on site as shielding gas plume is less likely to be blown away in a wind than shield gas from a conventional nozzle a slight drawback is that like smaw stick welding there may be some flux deposited over weld bead requiring more of a cleaning process between passes flux cored welding machines are most popular at hobbyist level as machines are slightly simpler but mainly because they avoid cost of providing shield gas either through a rented cylinder or with high cost of disposable cylinders see also flux
