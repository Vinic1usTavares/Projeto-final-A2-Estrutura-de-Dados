mission cast patrick stewart thought that first next generation film star trek generations was too much like a television episode but thought that his character captain jean luc picard was redefined as a movie hero in star trek first contact reeves stevens 1998 p 278 he was concerned that in new film character would return to that seen in television series michael piller said that he felt that in order to be a hero picard should be acting out of a moral and ethical mindset and stand for principles that are important to humanity stewart was later pleased with film s romantic sub plot calling it charming and saying that he was feeling very good about it he thought that film had a lighter tone than previous films saying it shows our crew having a little more fun than we normally see them doing stewart was disappointed that a scene in which picard and anij kiss was cut from final version of film saying that it was a studio decision but still somewhat inexplicable to me as i feel audience were waiting for some kind of romantic culmination to relationship which did happen and was extremely pleasant stewart received a producer s credit on film thumb left star trek insurrection was second star trek film to be directed by jonathan frakes jonathan frakes appeared as commander william riker and as with first contact he directed project brent spiner starred as lieutenant commander data spiner had asked for his character to be killed off in insurrection because he was concerned that he was getting too old to play role his copy of script came with a note from production team saying sorry kill you later underwater scene required spiner to wear more make up than usual because it needed to be waterproof levar burton reprised his role of lieutenant commander geordi la forge a month before release of insurrection he appeared in role in a guest appearance in star trek voyager episode timeless michael dorn returned as lieutenant commander worf dorn had portrayed that character in deep space nine since 1995 reprising her role as doctor beverly crusher gates mcfadden said that shooting star trek and getting paid to do it is great but what s actually changed my life most is travelling around and being a tiny little part of this huge mythology that has changed people s lives in many ways for better marina sirtis appeared once more as counselor deanna troi she was positive about film saying we ve been involved with this for eleven years we ve done 179 episodes three movies and there are still surprises there are more layers in this movie it s not as black and white it goes back to a lot of what gene roddenberry felt about star think he s going to be very happy up there when he sees this movie before casting process no actors had been considered for roles of son a leader ba ku woman and starfleet admiral reeves stevens 1998 p 283 son a leader ahdar ru afo was portrayed by f murray abraham who won an academy award for his performance in amadeus nemecek 2003 p 337 abraham was given role without an audition abraham said of franchise i was around when series was first introduced to television and it was a hoot he praised his make up and prosthetics saying idea that you can be somebody else behind mask is an extraordinary s very primitive and mysterious a gap opens somewhere in brain and it encourages wildness it had me chewing at scenery he was particularly pleased to be working with patrick stewart donna murphy played ba ku woman anij who is picard s love interest eighty actresses auditioned for role which was awarded to murphy who had previously won two tony awards for her roles in broadway musicals passion and king and i reeves stevens 1998 p 284 murphy was such a favorite of frakes and producers that after auditioning only a small number of other actresses were seen she said of role i feel a great honor and responsibility to be a part of this film because i know that star trek audience has such a devotion to and affection for these richly drawn characters thumb right filmed scenes featuring armin shimerman and max grodenchik were cut from final release of film anthony zerbe originally auditioned for role of ru afo and was considered to be best choice for it however production team decided instead to cast him in role of admiral matthew dougherty during zerbe s audition instead of reading lines provided he recited dante s inferno before seamlessly moving into script frakes and producers unanimously decided to award him part of dougherty reeves stevens 1998 p 285 in film s smaller roles stephanie played ensign kell perim and daniel hugh kelly appeared as gregg henry appeared as gallatin and child actor michael welch played ba ku child artim nemecek 2003 p 338 michael horton returned as tactical officer he portrayed in first contact his character was called lieutenant daniels in this film nemecek 2003 p 322 rage against machine and audioslave guitarist tom morello played a son a warrior morello s make up regime began at 5am at which time he said he would normally be crawling back into my coffin several of film s actors had previously appeared in star trek franchise bruce french who portrayed son a officer number 1 appeared as sabin in next generation episode drumhead and as ocampa doctor in voyager pilot episode son a officer number 3 was played by joseph ruskin who appeared in four episodes across star trek franchise original series episode of triskelion and deep space nine episodes improbable cause and looking for par mach in all wrong places and voyager episode gravity nemecek 2003 p 343 mckenzie westmore daughter of make up supervisor michael westmore played a ba ku woman she previously appeared as a child in next generation season one episode when bough breaks and as ensign jenkins in voyager episode warhead scenes cut from film would have featured two of actors who played ferengi on deep space nine max grodenchik more familiar as rom was to have appeared as a trill in library scene armin shimerman filmed a scene in his role as quark in which he tries to set up timeshares on ba ku planet at end of film production development and writing following success of first contact paramount pictures wanted a change in pace to give follow up film a lighter tone since star trek iv voyage home was light in tone yet was most successful of all star trek films at box office paramount reasoned that this success could be repeated with new film piller 1998 p 11 michael piller was asked to write script and accepted position piller was in development hell with another project which he wished to get out of piller 1998 p 7 he wanted to give crew a feeling of family with a story featuring overtones of joseph conrad novel heart of darkness nemecek 2003 p 334 rick berman wanted to see picard undertake a rescue mission in a similar manner to 1937 film prisoner of zenda berman also originated an idea to have picard kidnapped and replaced with a surgically modified imposter piller was doubtful about berman s idea reasoning that audience would not want to see an entire film in which picard is not lead starthe character would look like patrick stewart but would be different piller 1998 p 10 a further idea from berman would have seen return of lore last seen in episode descent in a film which was described as similar in tone to star trek ii wrath of khan piller initially thought to write a fountain of youth type story later saying everybody s consumed with images of youth there s commercials plastic surgery our culture seems obsessed with youth he called initial treatment heart of lightness piller 1998 p 12 eric a stillwell was piller s executive assistant and script coordinator when piller agreed to write a book about making of insurrection pocket books hired stillwell as piller s typist and research assistant book went unpublished and it was alleged that paramount pictures suppressed it following piller s death in 2005 book was published on internet piller 1998 p 2 piller created a first draft treatment for film entitled star trek stardust with title taken from song by hoagy carmichael after hearing nat king cole s version on radio treatment featured picard resigning from starfleet after he is sent to retrieve a population and their youth giving power and bring them to an alien government and included a betrayal by picard s rogue colleague draft went through several versions with only crew s mission and briar after area from br er rabbit berman suggested that data become renegade crew member that picard must deal with plot was similar to next generation episode homeward in that a people were being relocated through use of a holodeck use of a duck blind to observe cultures was previously used in episode who watches watchers in one draft picard kills data early in film and android is later resurrected to help captain in finale first two drafts featured romulans as protagonists since they had never prominently appeared in a star trek film second draft was seen by jonathan dolgen at studio dolgen was not pleased and patrick stewart thought that it would have been only suitable for a television episode piller 1998 p 1998 p 35 in third draft son a were introduced as children of ba ku and alien race that wanted to plunder planet that version also included crew sub plots such as troi riker romance and regeneration of la forge s eyes stewart who was concerned that film was a step back in scope from first contact was consulted on treatments nemecek 2003 p 335 thumb right ira steven behr pictured reviewed first script at request of michael piller piller drafted first version of script and asked ira steven behr executive producer of star trek deep space nine to review it behr was critical of script describing son a as paper tigers piller said that i knew he was right there s no question that first draft was trying to tell two stories and that s one too many for a movie piller re drafted script adding a romantic subplot for picard in shape of anij a ba ku woman he added gravitas to son a to make them more menacing and ending was changed to include a massive son a collector ship and a confrontation between picard and ru afo aboard ship a version of script was subsequently leaked onto internet at same time piller and berman were exploring titles for prime directive directive resignation enemy within breach of promise dereliction of duty and they reasoned that they could not submit it to studio under title of stardust they could not settle on a title so they submitted it as star trek ix piller 1998 p 55 studio was pleased with post behr version of script which was first version of script they previously only seen pre script treatments piller 1998 p 57 in a memo to piller it was described as easily funniest and sexiest star trek story to date they gave piller a series of directions including a request for a resolution to troi and riker romance and for character of reginald barclay to be replaced with expanded roles either for beverley crusher worf or a new character piller 1998 p 1998 p 59 patrick stewart sought a change to script to have crew defend ba ku village in manner of battle of alamo instead of fleeing into mountains piller could not find a feasible way to include this in script and budget ruled out creation of alamo like structures in mountains piller 1998 p 72 several titles were considered for film as shooting approached star trek where time stands still star trek forever and star trek beyond paradise were all considered but were rejected piller s favorite was star trek sacred honor but studio rejected this because they were concerned that it sounded too religious when shooting began film was still called star trek ix piller 1998 p 87 final version of script was distributed to cast but patrick stewart did not receive a copy berman was concerned that if anyone had a problem with it they would call stewart to complain and it would appear as though stewart was being left out because he had criticized story levar burton called stewart to praise script stewart was sent a copy and requested a meeting to discuss changes piller feared worst but after a twenty minute meeting with stewart who requested several dialogue changes script was finalized piller 1998 p 92 during pre production marketing department wanted to decide a title preferring star trek revolution alan friend of insurrection which was selected from a choice of insurrection rebellion high treason and act of treason after filming was complete test screenings were held and production team became aware of a problem with ending piller 1998 p 98 in original ending ru afo is ejected into space from son a collector ship and de ages rapidly as he floats amongst rings of planet ba ku revised ending saw enterprise swoop in at last minute to save picard and destroy collector ship with ru afo aboard piller 1998 p 102 studio liked new ending but wanted a bigger space battle production team agreed providing they could postpone release to allow enough time for this because studio wanted insurrection to be released in time for christmas no further revisions were made to ending piller 1998 p 109 visual effects insurrection was first star trek film with space based effects produced entirely using computer generated imagery cgi while cgi had been used for specific effects since star trek ii wrath of khan insurrection was first star trek film to be made without using physical models of spacecraft santa barbara studios produced effects which included cgi starship models texture on model of enterprise e was created from a series of close up photographs of model enterprise which had been used in first contact reeves stevens 1998 p 275

polynesian styles village included a bakery a farm with a full irrigation system a city hall and a city square which was referred to as rotunda location shoot lasted for six weeks reeves stevens 1998

make them look as though they were made from stone but they were not made waterproof set suffered water damage following record levels of rainfall during spring of 1998 foam warped as it dried out in sun causing delays in shooting while repairs were made nemecek 2003 p 341 thumb right sierra nevada stood in for mountains of ba ku sets built for use in star trek voyager were redressed to appear as enterprise e in insurrection captain janeway s quarters became picard s voyager briefing room became riker s quarters and part of voyager engineering set became enterprise library interior of manned by data was originally cockpit of voyagers shuttlecraft while interior of enterprise shuttlecraft used interior set from a star trek deep space nine runabout nemecek 2003 p 342 filming began on march 31 1998 and concluded on july 2 according to frakes half of time shooting was spent on location scenes in which enterprise crew and ba ku take refuge in mountains were shot on location above lake sabrina in sierra nevada in locations which could only be reached by helicopter location was around above sea level and a medic was on standby with oxygen if cast or crew required it after filming parts of interior sets of so na ships were added using cgi reeves stevens 1998 p 271 stage 15 on paramount lot was used for climactic scene between picard and ru afo because of dangers of four story scaffolding like set actors were attached by safety cables at all times reeves stevens 1998 p 274 paramount s b was used to represent san francisco bay in star trek iv voyage used to shoot footage of picard data and anij at ba ku lake for a scene in which data walks along a lake bed actor s tricorder prop was covered with plastic to make it watertight costumes and make up make up supervisor michael westmore aimed to create a look for son a that was not exaggerated he consulted several sculptors dean jones who was on production staff for star trek deep space nine created look prosthetics for ru afo consisted of overlapping layers that were stretched over abraham s head westmore said abraham s prosthetics was like a rubber band f murray abraham could turn his head and skin would look translucent it was so thin and layers were pulling on each other nemecek 2003 p 336 two other aliens on son a vessels also had specific prosthetic make up designs created tarlac s look was based on reptilian skin while ellora required only nose and forehead prosthetics film also gave costume designer robert blackman an opportunity to address issues with starfleet dress uniforms which blackman had changed on several occasions during next generation uniforms appeared for first time in episode lonely among us and were based on 18th century designs for royal navy nemecek 2003 p 39 for insurrection blackman initially thought of creating a uniform with short jackets in blue red and gold which he later said was not a good idea his eventual design removed color palettes for specific divisions blackman said no matter what white over black has a formal look to it sanja milkovic hayes created remaining new costumes for film she avoided making ba ku look too cute and used material made from cellulose fiber specifically created for insurrection she said it was organic and was simply cooked and then glued together son a costumes were made from layers of crushed velvet and metal strips female bodysuits were made of latex hayes wanted them to appear sexy but not vulgar and described outfits as very conservative music score for insurrection was composed by jerry goldsmith his fourth score for franchise bond 1998 p 163 goldsmith continued using march and klingon themes written for star trek motion picture in 1979 adding new themes and variations insurrection opens with alexander courage s star trek original series fanfare introducing a six note motif used in many of film s action sequences ba ku are scored with a pastoral theme with repeating harps string sections and a woodwind solo ba ku s ability to slow time was accompanied with a variation of this music bond 1998 p 164 goldsmith used quick bursts of brass music to accompany starship sequences for scenes in which observers are watching ba ku unseen goldsmith used a spying theme that resembles his conspiracy theme from capricorn one composed of a piano timpani percussion and brass theme builds until it is interrupted by action theme as data opens fire goldsmith did not write a motif for son a but scored action sequence without designating son a as an antagonist suggesting film s revelation that son a and ba ku are related film s climax is scored with action theme which is balanced with sense of wonder music similar to cues from motion picture one scene in film shows patrick stewart and brent spiner conducting a duet of a british tar from gilbert and sullivan comic opera h m s pinafore this replaced original idea of picard and data reciting scenes from shakespeare s play king lear piller 1998 p 80 stewart had suggested that they sing three little maids from school are we from mikado instead but producers described this as too vulgar stewart and spiner had previously sung together on

old fashioned washington post also called film old fashioned but in best sense of word and said that film did what doctor make that dr bones mccoy ordered british journalist simon rose writing for daily mirror was more critical of film saying that it failed to break odd numbered star trek film curse and that it was feeble moribund and tedious however josh spiegel writing for buffalo news said that insurrection broke odd numbered film rule further criticism came from birmingham evening mail which said that it was an adult form of entertainment equivalent to teletubbies for babies and that there were lots of repetition rubbery faces gibberish dialogue characters leaping up and down in funny suits and some very basic effects reviewer gave film two stars for fans and none for non fans in folklore cinema popular film as vernacular culture actions of data and ba ku child artim in insurrection are seen as a metamorphosis motif where a child becomes and a computer android becomes more childlike sherman koven 2007 p 4 data specifically is a metaphor for a child who seeks to understand what being human means and then like velveteen rabbit wishes to become from confronting his father and evil brother to finding his mother data also represents potential within all of us to quest for a fuller humanity sherman koven 2007 p 87 accolades film was nominated for saturn award for best
