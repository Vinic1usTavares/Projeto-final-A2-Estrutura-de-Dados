also represented gloucestershire and marylebone cricket club mcc most commonly employed as a right handed opening batsman sainsbury was one of somerset s most talented batsman during their formative years his slow underarm bowling was effective in second class cricket but in an era when bowling was becoming standard he was used sparingly in first class game during his time at somerset county gained first class status after being led for three seasons by sainsbury s lansdown team mate stephen newton sainsbury was given somerset captaincy for 1885 season a combination of poor results and not being able to raise a full eleven during that season led to county s removal from first class game although sainsbury remained as captain until 1888 by time somerset had improved sufficiently to return to first class cricket in 1891 sainsbury had moved to neighbouring county gloucestershire where he saw out his county cricket career early life sainsbury was born on 5 july 1851 in bath somerset youngest son of john popham sainsbury he attended sherborne school an independent school in north west dorset playing for school s cricket eleven he acquired a reputation for his slow underarm bowling which could deceive even most wary opponent into conceding his wicket he was considered an even better batsman and often opened innings for school foot 1986 p 17 club and second class county cricket sainsbury played alongside his older brother francis for lansdown cricket club from at least 1865 his first recorded appearance for a representative county side was in august 1877 when he played for somerset against their dorset neighbours he opened batting for somerset team alongside hamilton ross both had been scoring plenty of runs for lansdown in club cricket roebuck 1991 p 19 and sainsbury made 32 a respectable score in match which somerset won by an innings only edward lloyd scored more posting an unbeaten 110 one of earliest centuries scored for a somerset county side sainsbury also opened bowling during match but he claimed only one wicket over two innings and bowled just 13 of 104 overs a few days later he appeared again for county side against clifton who had australian test cricketer billy midwinter in their team sainsbury scored 96 not out including a resolute partnership with stephen newton before rain forced game to be drawn subsequently he scored 7 and 81 against wiltshire wanderers and took ten wickets in match including six in first innings in two further appearances for somerset in 1877 sainsbury did not surpass score he reached against dorset but claimed two further wickets both against gentlemen of wiltshire sainsbury finished season top of somerset s batting averages having scored 230 runs at an average of 46 00 sainsbury added himself to list of early somerset centurions during 1878 hitting 105 while batting at number 6 against hertfordshire in doing so he batted for over four hours and shared an eighth wicket partnership of 114 with francis reed out of a somerset total of 249 his bowling was also on form during match and after collecting two wickets in first innings he claimed five in second somerset side during late 1870s reflected strength of lansdown club of eleven players that represented somerset in their match against marylebone cricket club in early august 1878 five of them also represented lansdown when london club travelled down to bath in between these two matches against mcc sainsbury scored a half century for somerset during their match against devon toward end of august sainsbury s bowling once again came to fore as he claimed five wickets in first innings against worcestershire to help defend somerset s lead and propel them to an innings victory he once again led somerset batting averages scoring 211 runs at an average of 35 16 while his 13 wickets were second most in team at an average of 9 69 sainsbury batting scores dipped in county cricket during 1879 in nine appearances for somerset during year his highest score was 39 he performed better with ball twice taking four wickets during an innings against both bedfordshire and mcc following county season began more positively for sainsbury as he collected nine wickets in match against sussex at lansdown s ground in bath claiming six wickets for 54 runs in second innings of game he claimed another eight wickets when somerset travelled to leicestershire during which sainsbury and arnold fothergill took five wickets each in leicestershire s first innings restricting home side to 51 runs somerset won low scoring contest by 85 runs sainsbury having scored a valuable 28 during his side s first innings somerset s visit to sussex saw sainsbury continue his success against county this time with bat rather than ball sussex built on their 63 run first innings lead with a second innings total of 183 leaving somerset task of scoring 247 runs to win match sainsbury scored his second century for somerset remaining 101 not out when somerset reached winning total he was assisted by a half century from stephen newton and scores in twenties by bill fowler and frederick smith later that month his batting was once again instrumental in setting up a somerset victory when he top scored with 87 as somerset beat mcc by an innings during 1881 season sainsbury was joined at somerset by his older brother francis who appeared four times for county sainsbury performed consistently with bat during season regularly scoring between 20 and 40 runs in an innings his highest score was made against gloucestershire when he reached his only half century of season scoring 56 while batting at number seven sainsbury bowled less frequently during 1881 and rarely opened bowling for somerset his best bowling performance of season for his county came against hampshire when having not bowled in first innings he claimed four wickets as hampshire followed on on this occasion he was fifth bowler used by somerset but he bowled highest number of overs first class cricket somerset s leading batsman towards end of 1870s journalists had suggested that somerset chose their players upon breeding rather than skill roebuck 1991 p 20 best players in county many of whom were not wealthy men were unable to afford to play for somerset in turn cricket club could not afford to pay professionals to play for them and were regarded as an occasional amateur outfit by many rather than a side that could truly represent strength of cricket within county arrival of two professional players and acquisition of a permanent home ground in taunton helped strengthen club so that in 1882 they were admitted as a first class county roebuck 1991 pp 20 28 bill roe at time a schoolboy rated sainsbury as by far best batsman in side during their pre first class years on 8 june 1882 somerset played their first match to be universally considered first class against lancashire after losing toss and fielding for over 150 overs as lancashire scored 237 somerset responded with a first innings total of 29 their second lowest total ever in first class cricket sainsbury and his fellow opening batsman fowler top scored for somerset with 9 runs each and both were once again highest scorers in second innings when fowler scored 18 and sainsbury 17 runs out of a total of 51 somerset were beaten by an innings and 157 runs and batted for less than 70 overs county suffered further heavy defeats in their next two matches losing to gloucestershire and hampshire with no somerset batsman reaching a half century in either match sainsbury reached his first half century in first class cricket when somerset hosted hampshire at county ground team mates robert ramsay and stephen newton also passed 50 for county in this match which helped somerset to their maiden first class victory sainsbury claimed a wicket in each innings of match during which he bowled just eight overs in first innings he bowled one over conceding one run and claiming one wicket in first class matches in 1882 sainsbury scored 255 runs at an average of 17 00 exceeding 50 on only one occasion he bowled infrequently claiming four wickets at an average in excess of 40 sainsbury reached a half century on his first appearance for somerset in first class cricket in 1883 scoring 51 runs against mcc he did not reach 50 in his next three appearances for county but against gloucestershire he top scored for his side in their first innings with 59 and then when somerset were forced to follow on he scored his only century in first class cricket amassing 116 runs before he became one of w g grace s eleven victims in match sainsbury played in seven matches during 1883 and achieved his highest batting average in a season his century and two fifties boosting him to 27 92 although he played another 31 first class matches during his career he did not score more than 40 runs in an innings after 1883 he also recorded his best bowling average in 1883 claiming his nine first class wickets at 18 55 in early june 1884 sainsbury played for a side representing south of england scoring 3 and 29 during a 66 run victory for south playing for lansdown against touring gentlemen of philadelphia following month he scored only century of match reaching 108 and sharing a first wicket partnership of 149 with e m grace he batted poorly for somerset during 1884 failing to reach double figures in most of his innings and hitting a top score of 30 for county his season average was dramatically lower than previous season dropping below 10 troubled captaincy following departure of somerset captain stephen newton who played all his first class cricket in london from 1885 season onwards sainsbury was given club captaincy somerset s first county match of season took place in mid july almost two months after four of counties had contested matches match played against hampshire showed little sign of troubles that were to come sainsbury scored 0 and 13 opening batting for his side but bowling of edward bastard who claimed eight wickets in first innings and three in second helped somerset to a five wicket victory county s next match played two weeks later against gloucestershire was their heaviest defeat when losing by an innings to that point gloucestershire won toss and elected to bat totalling 448 in 190 overs somerset bowlers james parfitt and charles winter both conceding over 100 runs in reply five of somerset batsman were out for ducks sainsbury parfitt and albert clapp were only ones to reach double figures sainsbury top scored with 40 runs but a team total of 100 meant that gloucestershire forced his side to follow on second innings progressed even more poorly for somerset sainsbury was one of eight batsmen who failed to reach double figures and team was dismissed for 80 runs resulting in an innings and 268 run loss matches were played more frequently in august and sainsbury and his somerset team had just four days to recover from their defeat before travelling to oval to face surrey sainsbury once again lost toss and was forced to field surrey batted for 222 1 overs as they accumulated 635 runs opening bowlers parfitt and winter once again conceded a century of runs apiece and four of somerset s other bowlers conceded over 50 runs each in total sainsbury tried seven different bowlers during innings to try to get wickets including herbie hewett who completed his career of 106 matches with just two first class wickets sainsbury himself was most successful of bowlers taking four wickets for 74 runs his best first class bowling performance in reply somerset were bowled out for 83 runs with clapp recorded as absent hurt following on somerset mustered a more respectable total of 251 aided primarily by a century from octavius radcliffe and 85 from hewett sainsbury himself added 21 to score in second innings after being dismissed for one in first defeat was heavier still than one suffered a week earlier surrey won by an innings and 301 runs morale was low at somerset and county could not raise a full team to face hampshire at southampton a week later they travelled with nine players among their number farrant reed who played eight first class matches in his life ernest murdock who played five egerton hall three and edward spurway two somerset scored 117 runs in their first innings of which sainsbury contributed nine bowling of bastard who took eight for 59 helped to restrict hampshire to 162 despite their low numbers somerset reached 166 in their second innings sainsbury scoring ten from number five in batting order with bastard unable to replicate his first innings performance hampshire reached winning total of 123 from 60 3 overs somerset played surrey and gloucestershire in their final two matches of season and lost both heavily although they did succeed in avoiding any further record defeats surrey won by an innings and five runs and gloucestershire by nine wickets sainsbury s highest score in his four innings was 14 in six matches that he played that season all for somerset sainsbury scored 119 runs at an average of 9 91 a marginal improvement on his previous season return to second class cricket somerset were stripped of their first class status for three reasons they had not organised and played enough first class fixtures during season their performances were not what was expected from a first class county and they had not succeeded in fielding a full side of eleven players in all their matches foot 1986 pp 23 28 an emergency meeting was held in taunton during which a new club secretary was appointed rules were altered and wealthy benefactors were sought despite these widespread changes sainsbury retained club captaincy roebuck 1991 pp 30 32 in somerset s first match of 1886 sainsbury hit his highest score for county in almost three years scoring 90 out of a somerset total of 241 bowling of arnold fothergill helped to restrict their opponents warwickshire in second innings but faced with requiring 150 in their second innings for victory somerset were bowled out for 58 throughout 1886 sainsbury s batting continued to be more fruitful than his efforts in previous two years of first class cricket and he regularly made scores in twenties and thirties he hit 94 from middle order against mcc in mid august his highest score of season toward end of 1886 season arrival of sammy woods and george nichols vastly improved quality of bowling for county but 1887 was nevertheless marked by a slow start roebuck 1991 pp 36 43 a victory over essex in which sainsbury scored 71 was bracketed by heavy losses to warwickshire and gloucestershire against hampshire sainsbury reached his highest total for somerset scoring 164 out of a total of 315 to help his side on their way to a six wicket victory a big win over warwickshire followed and county was said to be a ship heading out for an ocean of prosperity roebuck 1991 p 43 sainsbury s scores dipped again for somerset in 1888 his highest total for county was an unbeaten 42 against mcc in contrast in a match played for mcc sainsbury struck his highest total for side scoring 180 runs against wiltshire at lord s somerset were rated as best of second class counties in both 1887 and 1888 but at club s annual general meeting a long discussion took place regarding captaincy of club sainsbury was unable to be present for meeting but had sent a letter advising that if he was removed as captain he did not feel he could play for county any more his letter was not well received at meeting and it was decided to replace him as captain with another player who lived closer to taunton and was able to play more of county matches as sainsbury had missed a number during 1888 roe was selected as his replacement with hewett as vice captain a vote of thanks was given to sainsbury for his service to county club move to gloucestershire over following two seasons 1889 and 1890 sainsbury played club cricket for lansdown but no county cricket as he served his residential qualification for gloucestershire at gloucestershire s annual meeting in april 1891 w g grace welcomed sainsbury to club and there was some mirth at expense of somerset regarding his move his first appearance for his new county was in match in early may between club and ground sides from gloucestershire and glamorgan his first class debut for county was against kent later that month when he scored 12 runs during a rain affected match he was not only former somerset player to appear for gloucestershire in match his fellow opening partner at somerset octavius radcliffe had moved across county border in 1886 sainsbury played 13 times for gloucestershire that season with his highest score being 36 made against yorkshire at bramall lane sheffield he scored 259 runs at an average of 13 63 and did not bowl an appearance for lansdown that summer against royal agricultural college cirencester saw him score 228 runs in a drawn match following year was his last in first class cricket during which he made five appearances all for gloucestershire scoring 100 runs at an average of 10 00 he continued to play for lansdown who he captained in 1893 scoring over 1 000 runs that season clifton and mcc for a number of years captaincy during sainsbury s first year as somerset captain county suffered two of its heaviest defeats in first class cricket at hands of gloucestershire and surrey and was stripped of its first class status but it was club secretary who was replaced at end of that season and sainsbury remained in position as club captain perhaps indicating that club felt it was a lack of resources rather than sainsbury s captaincy that was to blame for poor performances in from sammy to jimmy an official history of somerset county cricket club peter roebuck suggests that sainsbury was key in improvements made by county in 1888 roebuck 1991 p 44 but fellow cricket historian david foot appears to portray a more negative image in his book sunshine sixes and cider suggesting that during sainsbury s time as captain he may have included players in team on strength of their social charm and ability to drink into early hours foot 1986 p 34 later life and death sainsbury married mary stevens on 28 august 1883 at christ church wanstead essex he established an eponymous oil cake company in bristol he died on 28 october 1930 aged 79 in weston super mare somerset and his funeral was held at st paul s church in weston super mare he was survived by at least two sons and two daughters one of those sons e a sainsbury played cricket for weston super mare and gloucestershire colts at time of his death he had a gross estate worth just over ps9 234
