solrad solar radiation 3 was a solar x ray satellite and electronic surveillance satellite third in solrad program developed by united states navy s naval research laboratory it shared satellite space with and provided cover for navy s grab 2 galactic radiation and background a secret electronic surveillance program satellite was launched atop a thor dm 21 ablestar rocket on june 29 1961 along with transit 4a and university of iowa s van allen belts injun 1 satellite after reaching orbit solrad 3 grab 2 and injun 1 separated from transit 4a but not from each other though this reduced solrad 3 s data transmission ability by half nevertheless satellite still returned valuable information regarding sun s normal levels of x ray emissions solrad experiment package also established that during solar flares higher energy of emitted x rays more disruption caused on earth s thermosphere and radio transmissions therein grab mission was also highly successful returning so much data on soviet air defense radar facilities that an automated analysis system had to be developed to process it all background united states navy s naval research laboratory nrl established itself as a player early in space race with development and management of project vanguard 1956 59 america s first satellite program after vanguard navy s next major goal was to use observational high ground of earth s orbit to survey soviet radar locations and frequencies this first space surveillance project was called grab later expanded into more innocuous galactic radiation and background as american space launches were not classified until late 1961 a co flying cover mission sharing satellite space was desired to conceal grab s electronic surveillance mission from its intended targets field of solar astronomy provided such cover since invention of rocket astronomers had wanted to fly instruments above atmosphere to get a better look at sun earth s atmosphere blocks large sections of sunlight s electromagnetic spectrum making it impossible to study sun s x ray and ultraviolet output from ground without this critical information it was difficult to model sun s internal processes which in turn inhibited stellar astronomy in general on a more practical level it was believed that solar flares directly affected earth s thermosphere disrupting radio communications navy wanted to know when its communications were going to become unreliable or compromised sounding rockets had shown that solar output was unpredictable and fluctuated rapidly a long term real time observation platform above earth s atmosphere in other words a satellite was required to properly chart sun s radiation determine its effects on earth and correlate it with ground based observations of sun in other wavelengths of light thus solrad project was conceived to address several nrl goals at once to make first long term continuous observations of sun in ultraviolet and x ray light and to correlate these measurements with ground based observations to evaluate level of hazard posed by ultraviolet and x ray radiation to better understand effect of solar activity including solar flares on radio communications to cheaply and efficiently produce a satellite for grab surveillance mission by using a proven design to obscure grab mission under a scientific cover a dummy solrad was successfully launched on april 13 1960 and solrad 1 went into orbit on june 22 1960 becoming both world s first surveillance satellite as grab 1 and first satellite to observe sun in x ray and ultraviolet light solrad 2 a duplicate of solrad 1 was launched on november 30 1960 but was lost when its booster flew off course and had to be destroyed spacecraft like its two predecessors solrads 1 and 2 solrad 3 grab 2 was a 51 cm diameter sphere based on vanguard 3 satellite unlike solrad 1 and abortive solrad 2 satellite s scientific package did not include lyman alpha photometers this is because it had been discovered since solrad 2 s failed launch that ultraviolet radiation level remained constant during solar flares instead solrad 3 carried two x ray photometers designed to cover a greater range of wavelengths than first solrad in addition to a photometer that covered same 2 8a range as earlier solrads solrad also carried one that measured bandwidth from 8 14a as was case with most early automatic spacecraft solrad 2 though spin stabilized lacked attitude control systems and thus scanned whole sky with no source in particular so that scientists could properly interpret source of x rays detected by solrad 2 spacecraft carried a vacuum photocell to determine when sun was striking its photometers and angle at which sunlight hit them solrad 3 grab 2 was significantly heavier than its predecessors 25 kg versus 19 kg for solrad 1 18 kg for solrad 2 as its grab package included equipment for monitoring two radar frequencies rather than just one as in prior flights in addition to monitoring soviet air defense radars in s band 1 550 3 900 mhz grab 2 could also detect long range air surveillance radars operating in uhf band at around 500 mhz mission and science results 200px thumb solrad 3 s thor able star takes off solrad 3 grab 2 was launched on june 29 1961 at 04 22 utc on a thor dm 21 ablestar rocket along with transit 4a and university of iowa s van allen belts injun 1 satellite from cape canaveral pad its course to orbit was more northerly than that of its predecessors to avoid possibility of fragments falling on cuba in event of a mission failure as had happened with solrad 2 after reaching orbit solrad 3 grab 2 and injun 1 separated from transit 4a but not from each other causing them to rotate more slowly than planned moreover because electro magnetic interference generated by spacecraft prevented ground controllers from requesting data from both spacecraft at same time solrad 3 grab 2 s transmissions were limited to odd numbered days injun s to even numbered days thus data was only recovered for half of each satellite s lifetime nevertheless solrad package on satellite made several important findings it established sun s normal x ray radiation levels during times of inactivity at levels below 14a in wavelength less than 5x10 3 ergs cm2 sec satellite also found that higher hardness energy level of x rays emitted during solar flares greater disturbances and microwave bursts in thermosphere both affecting radio communications grab results grab 2 portion of satellite began transmission of information on soviet radars starting july 15 returning a large volume of information over next fourteen months as opposed to cautious approach exercised by former president eisenhower president kennedy did not require personal authorization for satellite to receive and transmit collected data as a result data was collected quicker than analysts could process and by october 1961 a new automated analysis system was implemented not only to process backlog of existing data but also data from upcoming electronic surveillance flights and even air force s samos reconnaissance satellites legacy and status solrad grab series flew twice more both unsuccessful missions finishing with solrad 4b mission launched april 26 1962 afterward three more solrad missions flew with grab s signals intelligence successor poppy 1963 65 final five solrad satellites were stand alone scientific satellites three of which were also given nasa explorer program numbers these flew from 1965 76 in all there were thirteen operational satellites in solrad series grab program was declassified in 1998 solrad 3 cospar 1961 is still in orbit as of january 2019 and its position can be tracked see also general information on solrad project general
