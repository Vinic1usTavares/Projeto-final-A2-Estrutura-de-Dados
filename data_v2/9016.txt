susan b anthony dollar is a united states dollar coin minted from 1979 to 1981 when production was suspended due to poor public acceptance and then again in 1999 intended as a replacement for cumbersome eisenhower dollar new smaller one dollar coin went through testing of several shapes and compositions but all were opposed by vending machine industry a powerful lobby affecting coin legislation finally a round planchet with an eleven sided inner border was chosen for smaller dollar original design for smaller dollar coin depicted an allegorical representation of liberty on obverse but organizations and individuals in congress called for coin to depict a real woman several proposals were submitted and social reformer susan b anthony was selected as design subject much to disappointment of most numismatists who preferred original classic liberty head design reverse design of eisenhower dollar was retained an engraving of apollo 11 mission insignia showing an eagle landing on moon both sides of coin as well as rejected liberty design were created by frank gasparro chief engraver of united states mint one and a half billion coins were struck in anticipation of considerable public demand but anthony dollar was poorly received in part because of confusion caused by its similarity in size and metallic composition to quarter despite its poor reception coins eventually began seeing use in vending machines and mass transit systems depleting surplus by late 1990s in 1997 congress passed a law authorizing mintage of a new gold colored one dollar coin depicting sacagawea but production could not begin quickly enough to meet demand as a stopgap measure until new sacagawea dollar coin could be issued anthony dollar was struck again in 1999 after an eighteen year hiatus series was retired following year special coins for sale to collectors were struck in proof finish through run of susan b anthony dollar and some minting variations are valuable to collectors however most circulation strikes remained in government stockpiles for several years after minting so many of coins are available in uncirculated grades and premium over face value is minimal background in early 1960s as price of silver rose treasury department vaults were depleted of silver dollars by public no silver dollars had been minted in united states since 1935 and a shortage developed in western united states especially in areas in which gambling was common as a result congress voted to authorize production of 45 million new silver peace dollars on august 3 1964 however move drew strong condemnation from critics and public who believed that issuance of coins was a waste of resources and influenced by special interests and that they would be quickly removed from circulation a total of 316 076 1964 d peace dollars were struck before production was ordered suspended coins were melted soon afterwards and coinage act of 1965 enacted on july 23 1965 forbade all production of dollar coins for a period of five years on may 12 1969 joint commission on coinage a panel of 24 individuals organized by 1965 coinage act recommended resumption of dollar coin production following a study conducted by a congressional task force on october 1 and 3 1969 a hearing before u s house of representatives discussed proposed legislation to authorize coin in a copper nickel clad composition with same diameter of former silver dollars a provision was added requiring coin to depict former president dwight d eisenhower who had died earlier that year on obverse and a design emblematic of symbolic eagle of apollo 11 landing on moon on reverse president richard nixon signed bill into law on december 31 1970 both obverse and reverse designs were created by frank gasparro chief engraver of united states mint as with previous dollar coins new eisenhower dollar proved unpopular with public and very few of coins were found in circulation in 1976 research triangle institute conducted a survey of united states coinage among other things they recommended half dollar which also saw little use be entirely eliminated from production and size of dollar be reduced their report read in part a conveniently sized dollar coin would significantly broaden capabilities of consumers for cash transactions especially with machines members of automatic merchandising industry have expressed a strong interest in a smaller dollar indicating their willingness to adapt their machinery to its use numismatic historian david l ganz suggested that eisenhower a republican was chosen as a means of balancing half dollar depicting democrat john f kennedy in a 1977 paper he agreed with findings of institute suggesting that both coins should be eliminated half dollar production ceased entirely and dollar replaced by one of smaller diameter and with a different design treasury officials desired small dollar coin as a cost saving measure mint director stella hackel estimated that replacing half of issued dollar bills with small dollars would save 19 million today in annual production costs design history liberty design mint began preparation for reduced diameter dollar coin in 1976 although no legislation had yet been introduced treasury officials anticipated a positive reception from congress and coin had near unanimous support from mint and vending machine industry an influential lobby in area of coin design and creation in 1977 treasury secretary michael blumenthal publicly endorsed a smaller dollar coin and suggested that an allegorical representation of liberty would be a suitable subject for coin chief engraver gasparro was tasked with creating a design for proposed coin his obverse design depicted a bust of liberty while his reverse depicted a soaring eagle bust was pictured along with a pole atop which sat a phrygian cap a symbol used to represent freedom gasparro s liberty design was based on a similar obverse that he created for a 1969 american numismatic association convention medal reverse depicting an eagle flying above a mountain against rising sun was originally created by gasparro in 1967 for a proposed commemorative half dollar describing reverse design gasparro stated that it was meant to symbolize a new day being born design was reviewed by commission of fine arts and in an april 29 1976 letter commission member j carter brown praised design i believe this would be a superb design for united states coinage rooted as it is in a great tradition being based on liberty cap cent of 1794 following augustin dupre s libertas americana medal commemorating saratoga and yorktown 1777 1781 a bill to reduce diameter of dollar from to and weight from 22 68 grams to 8 5 grams was introduced to house of representatives on may 1 1978 bill was introduced to senate on may 3 and proposed weight was reduced from 8 5 grams to 8 1 grams mint conducted experiments involving eight ten eleven and thirteen sided coins but it was decided that dollar would be round as costly modifications would be required to update vending machinery to accept other shapes instead bill prescribed an eleven sided inner border which was intended to aid identification by sight and by feel for visually handicapped selection of susan b anthony treasury officials officially recommended gasparro s design which they referred to as a modernized version of classic liberty design on may 3 1978 wisconsin s william proxmire introduced legislation in senate which was identical to treasury proposal except for mandating a design which was altered to social reformer susan b anthony in place of allegorical liberty on may 15 representatives mary rose oakar and patricia schroeder introduced similar legislation to house of representatives anthony was also recommended by members of national organization for women congresswomen s caucus national women s political caucus and league of women voters in support of proposed legislation league addressed a letter to walter e fauntroy chairman of subcommittee on historic preservation and coinage reading in part league believes that time has come and is indeed long past for likeness of a prominent american woman to be placed on a denomination of u s currency we believe strongly that likeness should be that of an actual woman and not that of an imaginary or symbolic figure susan b anthony contributed immeasurably to advancement of human dignity in this nation it is entirely fitting and appropriate that her memory be honored through this measure in addition officials tallied suggestions sent to mint by general public as to subject of dollar coin and susan b anthony had received most support gasparro began work on his susan b anthony design in june 1978 before legislation was authorized by congress he enlisted help of a friend in conducting research on anthony which he felt was necessary before creating design he referenced approximately six different images while creating portrait of anthony but it was based largely on just two gasparro created several different designs before receiving final approval one of his portraits depicting anthony at age 28 was shown to anthony s great niece susan b anthony iii who rejected it on grounds that it unnecessarily prettified her great aunt and she criticized another design depicting anthony at age 84 which she believed made her appear too old gasparro made several alterations with intent to depict her at age 50 at peak of her influence as a social reformer but no photographs of anthony during that period are known to exist he eventually received approval after modification later stating his belief that he had accurately portrayed anthony initially gasparro expected that congress would retain his soaring eagle reverse design to accompany susan b anthony obverse however a late amendment introduced by utah senator jake garn altered legislation to maintain apollo 11 design in use on eisenhower dollar reverse bill was approved by congress and signed into law by president jimmy carter on october 10 1978 and production of eisenhower dollars ceased during that year after he signed bill into law carter issued a statement saying in part that he was confident that this act and new dollar will substantially improve our coinage system as well as cutting government coin production costs he went on to declare his approval of decision to depict anthony on coins i am particularly pleased that new dollar coin will for first time in history bear image of a great american woman life of susan b anthony exemplifies ideals for which our country stands anthony dollar will symbolize for all american women achievement of their unalienable right to vote it will be a constant reminder of continuing struggle for equality of all americans design criticism thumb alt a logo depicting an eagle upon surface of moon numismatists criticized pairing of susan b anthony s portrait with a design based on apollo 11 insignia gasparro regarded anthony design as most important of his career remarking on public perception of coin gasparro related that it s become part of a social movement this new dollar s more than a coin it s an issue decision to use a portrait of susan b anthony in place of allegorical liberty was met with criticism by most numismatists who believed that liberty design had far greater artistic merit art critic and numismatist cornelius vermeule was highly critical of obverse design replacement as well as decision to continue use of apollo 11 design vermeule noted that although eisenhower s administration established national aeronautics and space administration anthony had no connection to moon landing or u s space program commenting on obverse and reverse pairing he stated his belief that it was a hasty marriage and a bad one although he believed that gasparro s anthony design was well executed sculptor robert weinman criticized decision to depict anthony concerned about possibility of other groups seeking representation on coinage in response to its passage weinman characterized susan b anthony dollar legislation as a billboard or campaign button approach to a national coin reception thumb left 300px alt two coins being shown together as a comparison of their size similarity in size and material composition between new susan b anthony dollar left and washington quarter right caused immediate confusion in transactions first susan b anthony dollars were struck at philadelphia mint on december 13 1978 first strikes at denver and san francisco mints followed on january 9 1979 and january 29 respectively mint officials feared that coins would be hoarded upon release so they ordered creation of a stockpile consisting of 500 million coins prior to release date in july 1979 dollars all bore a mint mark denoting their place of origin p for philadelphia mint d for denver mint and s for san francisco mint anthony dollar was first coin to bear a p mint mark since jefferson nickel issued during world war ii other coins struck there were left without a mintmark to note their place of origin in 1980 p mint mark was added to all other circulating coins except cent struck in philadelphia treasury department in cooperation with federal reserve undertook a 655 000 marketing campaign to educate bank employees and members of public about new coin and vending industry engaged in a 100 million effort to retrofit machines to accept coins despite marketing attempts coin received an overwhelmingly negative reception from public less than two millimeters in diameter larger than quarter and struck in same copper nickel composition susan b anthony dollar was widely confused for that denomination in transactions mint director hackel noted difference in weight and design between two coins and expressed her belief that dollar would eventually find favor with public suggesting that coin would become customary to american people in time in months following its release complaints mounted and public transportation and many establishments throughout country began refusing to accept them in payment on july 13 1979 california representative jerry lewis introduced a bill to house of representatives with intent to increase size of coin to aid identification discussing bill which was never passed lewis remarked that anthony dollar had come to be known derisively as carter quarter due to its size and association with president in total 757 813 744 dollar coins dated 1979 were struck for circulation at philadelphia denver and san francisco mints demand remained low through 1980 and circulation strikes for that year totaled 89 660 708 due to its persistent unpopularity production of anthony dollars for circulation was suspended and 9 742 000 1981 dollars were struck across all three mints exclusively for sale to collectors this mintage marked end of production at close of production treasury encountered a dilemma mint struck a large number of dollars in anticipation of great public demand resulting in a surplus of 520 000 000 coins in 1981 melting coins was impractical cost of manufacture was approximately 2 cents and 98 cents earned from seignorage was applied to national debt had coins been melted their seignorage would have been added to debt accordingly coins were placed in government storage to be dispensed as needed coin s design did have repercussions north of border when canada introduced its new one dollar coin in 1987 its dimensions were made similar so that vending machine specifications could be common between two nations when baltimore maryland metro subway opened in 1984 it used susan b anthony dollar coin as tokens with which to buy tickets it became

coin act of 1997 mint struck pattern coins depicting martha washington and dated 1759 to test a more distinctive gold colored coin despite their unpopularity in transactions anthony dollars began to see heavy use in over 9 000 stamp dispensing machines situated in united states postal service buildings across country beginning in early 1990s additionally coins finally began to be used regularly with many mass transit systems and vending machine operations various propositions were discussed in congress since last dollars were produced in 1981 but no action was taken to issue a new coin until treasury s stores of anthony dollars became depleted in 1990s in february 1996 vaults totaled approximately 229 500 000 coins but that number was reduced to approximately 133 000 000 by end of 1997 faced with necessity of striking more susan b anthony dollars to fill demand treasury supported legislation authorizing a new dollar coin that would not be confused with quarter legislation authorizing a dollar coin in a gold colored composition and with a plain edge was introduced to house and senate in 1997 where it eventually received approval with a provision calling for it to depict native american guide sacagawea on december 1 1997 president bill clinton signed 50 states commemorative coin program act into law act which authorized creation of 50 state quarters program included a section entitled united states 1 coin act of 1997 that section officially authorized what became sacagawea dollar following passage of act a series of test strikes depicting martha washington were carried out to test various gold colored alloys although act provided for creation of new coin it also allowed for resumption of striking anthony design as a stop gap measure until production began on

in 2000 when new sacagawea dollar entered production collecting as few susan b anthony dollars circulated many remain available in uncirculated condition and are worth little above face value however some date and mint mark varieties are relatively valuable 1981 coins having been issued only to collectors are valued above other circulation strikes in series in addition a well known variety of 1979 circulation strikes on which date appears nearer to rim commands a higher price than regular issue all dates of dollar also exist in proof finish 1999 coins were sold as standalone proof strikes
