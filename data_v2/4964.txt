paul vaughn butterfield december 17 4 1987 was an american blues harmonica player singer and band leader after early training as a classical flautist he developed an interest in blues harmonica he explored blues scene in his native chicago where he met muddy waters and other blues greats who provided encouragement and opportunities for him to join in jam sessions he soon began performing with fellow blues enthusiasts nick gravenites and elvin bishop in 1963 he formed paul butterfield blues band which recorded several successful albums and was popular on late 1960s concert and festival circuit with performances at fillmore west in san francisco fillmore east in new york city monterey pop festival and woodstock band was known for combining electric chicago blues with a rock urgency and for their pioneering jazz fusion performances and recordings after breakup of group in 1971 butterfield continued to tour and record with band paul butterfield s better days with his mentor muddy waters and with members of roots rock group band while still recording and performing butterfield died in 1987 at age 44 of an accidental drug overdose music critics have acknowledged his development of an original approach that places him among best known blues harp players in 2006 he was inducted into blues hall of fame butterfield and early members of paul butterfield blues band were inducted into rock and roll hall of fame in 2015 both panels noted his harmonica skills and his contributions to bringing blues music to a younger and broader audience career butterfield was born in chicago and raised in city s hyde park neighborhood son of a lawyer and a painter he attended university of chicago laboratory schools a private school associated with university of chicago exposed to music at an early age he studied classical flute with of chicago symphony orchestra butterfield was also athletic and was offered a track scholarship to brown university however a knee injury and a growing interest in blues music sent him in a different direction he met guitarist and singer songwriter nick gravenites who shared an interest in authentic blues music by late 1950s they were visiting blues clubs in chicago where musicians such as muddy waters howlin wolf little walter and otis rush encouraged them and occasionally let them sit in on jam sessions pair were soon performing as nick and paul in college area coffee houses in early 1960s butterfield met aspiring blues guitarist elvin bishop bishop recalled eventually butterfield on vocals and harmonica and bishop accompanying him on guitar were offered a regular gig at big john s a folk club in old town district on chicago s near north side with this booking they persuaded bassist jerome arnold and drummer sam lay both from howlin wolf s touring band to form a group with them in 1963 their engagement at club was highly successful and brought group to attention of record producer paul a rothchild butterfield blues band with bloomfield during their engagement at big john s butterfield met and occasionally sat in with guitarist mike bloomfield who was also playing at club by chance producer rothchild witnessed one of their performances and was impressed by chemistry between two he persuaded butterfield to bring bloomfield into band and they were signed to elektra records their first attempt to record an album in december 1964 did not meet rothchild s expectations although an early version of born in chicago written by gravenites was included on 1965 elektra sampler folksong 65 and created interest in band additional early recordings were released on elektra compilation what s shakin in 1966 and original lost elektra sessions in 1995 to better capture their sound rothchild convinced elektra president jac holzman to record a live album in spring of 1965 butterfield blues band was recorded at cafe au go go in new york city these recordings also failed to satisfy rothchild but group s appearances at club brought them to attention of east coast music community rothchild persuaded holzman to agree to a third attempt at recording an album in these recording sessions rothchild had assumed role of group manager and used his folk contacts to secure band more engagements outside of chicago at last minute band was booked to perform at newport folk festival in july 1965 they were scheduled as opening act first night when gates opened and again next afternoon in an urban blues workshop at festival despite limited exposure on first night and a dismissive introduction following day by folklorist and blues researcher alan lomax band was able to attract an unusually large audience for a workshop performance maria muldaur with her husband geoff who later toured and recorded with butterfield recalled group s performance as stunning it was first time that many of mostly folk music fans had heard a high powered electric blues combo among those who took notice was festival regular bob dylan who invited band to back him for his first live electric performance with little rehearsal dylan performed a short four song set next day with bloomfield arnold and lay along with al kooper and barry goldberg performance was not well received by some and generated a controversy but it was a watershed event and brought band to attention of a much larger audience band added keyboardist mark naftalin and its debut album paul butterfield blues band was finally successfully recorded in mid 1965 and released later that year opening song a newer recording of previously released born in chicago is an upbeat blues rocker and set tone for album which included a mix of blues standards such as shake your moneymaker blues with a feeling and look over wall and compositions by band album described as a hard driving blues album that in a word rocked reached number 123 in billboard 200 album chart in 1966 but its influence was felt beyond its sales figures jazz drummer billy davenport was invited to replace lay who was ailing in july 1966 sextet recorded their second album east west which was released a month later album consists of more varied material with band s interpretations of blues robert johnson s walkin blues rock michael nesmith s mary mary r b allen toussaint s get out of my life woman and jazz selections nat adderley s work song east west reached number 65 in album chart 13 minute instrumental track east west incorporates indian raga influences and some of earliest jazz fusion and blues rock excursions with extended solos by butterfield and guitarists mike bloomfield and elvin bishop it has been described as first of its kind and root from which acid rock tradition emerged live versions of song sometimes lasted nearly an hour and performances at san francisco fillmore auditorium were a huge influence on city s jam bands bishop recalled quicksilver big brother and dead those guys were just chopping chords they had been folk musicians and weren t particularly proficient playing electric guitar bloomfield could play all these scales and arpeggios and fast time signatures he just destroyed them several live versions of east west from this period were later released on east west live in 1996 in england in november 1966 butterfield recorded several songs with john mayall bluesbreakers who had recently finished album a hard road butterfield and mayall contributed vocals and butterfield s chicago style blues harp was featured four songs were released in uk on a 45 rpm ep john mayall s bluesbreakers with paul butterfield in january 1967 later butterfield blues band in spite of its success butterfield blues band soon changed its lineup arnold and davenport left band and bloomfield went on to form his own group electric flag with bishop and naftalin remaining on guitar and keyboards band added bassist bugsy maugh drummer phillip wilson and saxophonists david sanborn and gene dinwiddie this lineup recorded band s third album resurrection of pigboy crabshaw in 1967 album cut back on extended instrumental jams and went in a more rhythm and blues influenced horn driven direction with songs such as charles brown s driftin blues retitled driftin and driftin otis rush s double trouble and junior parker s driving wheel resurrection of pigboy crabshaw was butterfield s highest charting album reaching number 52 on album chart most of this lineup performed at seminal monterey pop festival on june 17 1967 on its next album in my own dream released in 1968 band continued to move away from its roots in chicago blues towards a more soul influenced horn based sound with butterfield singing only three songs album featured more band contributions it reached number 79 in billboard album chart by end of 1968 both bishop and naftalin had left band in april 1969 butterfield took part in a concert at chicago s auditorium theater and a subsequent recording session organized by record producer norman dayron featuring muddy waters backed by otis spann mike bloomfield sam lay donald duck dunn and buddy miles such waters warhorses as forty days and forty nights i m ready baby please don t go and got my mojo working were recorded and later released on album fathers and sons waters commented we did a lot of things over we did with little walter and jimmy rogers and elgin evans on drums an early

wall street journal harmonica style like many chicago blues harp players butterfield approached instrument like a horn preferring single notes to chords and used it for soloing his style has been described as always intense understated concise and serious and he was known for purity and intensity of his tone his sustained breath control and his unique ability to bend notes to his will in his choice of notes he has been compared to big walter horton but he was never seen as an imitator of any particular harp player rather he developed a style original and powerful enough to place him in pantheon of true blues greats butterfield played hohner harmonicas and endorsed them he preferred diatonic ten hole marine band model he wrote a harmonica instruction book paul butterfield teaches blues harmonica master class a few years before his death it was not published until 1997 in it he explains various techniques demonstrated on an accompanying cd butterfield played mainly in cross harp or second position reportedly left handed he held harmonica in a manner opposite that of a right handed player i e in his right hand upside down with low notes to right using his left hand for muting effects also like other electric chicago blues harp players butterfield frequently used amplification to achieve his sound he has been associated with a shure 545 microphone although producer rothchild noted that around time of a 1965 recording session butterfield favored an altec harp microphone run through an early model fender tweed amplifier beginning with album resurrection of pigboy crabshaw he used an acoustic harmonica style following his shift to a more r b based approach personal life by all accounts paul butterfield was absorbed in his music according to his brother peter producer norman dayron recalled young butterfield as very quiet and defensive and hard edged he was this tough irish catholic kind of a hard guy he would walk around in black shirts and sunglasses dark shades and dark jackets paul was hard to be friends with although they later became close michael bloomfield commented on his first impressions of butterfield he was a bad guy he carried pistols he was down there on south side holding his own i was scared to death of that cat writer and allmusic founder michael erlewine who knew butterfield early in his recording career described him as always intense somewhat remote and even on occasion downright unfriendly he remembered butterfield as not much interested in other people butterfield married his first wife virginia mcewan at chicago city hall on november 16 1964 their first son gabriel butterfield was born in september 1965 couple remained married until 1969 and mcewan wrote and delivered eulogy at butterfield s funeral in 2015 gabriel accepted rock and roll hall of fame award for his father by 1971 butterfield had purchased his first house in rural woodstock new york and began enjoying family life with his second wife kathy peterson and their infant son lee according to maria muldaur she and her husband were frequent dinner guests which usually involved sitting around a piano and singing songs she doubted her abilities but it was butter that first encouraged me to let loose and just sing blues and not to worry about singing pretty or hitting all right notes he loosened all levels of self consciousness and doubt out of me and he ll forever live in my heart for that and for respecting me as a fellow musician death beginning in 1980 paul butterfield underwent several surgical procedures to relieve his peritonitis a serious and painful inflammation of intestines although strongly opposed to heroin as a bandleader he developed an addiction to it which according to steve huey in allmusic s butterfield biography led to speculation that he was trying to ease his peritonitis symptoms financial strain of supporting his drug habit was bankrupting him and deaths of his friend and one time musical partner mike bloomfield and manager albert grossman had shaken him on may 4 1987 at age 44 paul butterfield died at his apartment in north hollywood district of los angeles an autopsy by county coroner concluded that he was victim of an accidental drug overdose with significant levels of morphine heroin codeine tranquilizer and a trace of alcohol by time of his death paul butterfield was out of commercial mainstream although for some he was very much blues man maria muldaur commented he had whole sensibility and musicality and approach down pat he just went for it and took it all in and he embodied essence of what blues was all about unfortunately he lived that way a little too much band paul butterfield blues band final butterfield lead and backing vocals harmonica gene dinwiddie saxophones
