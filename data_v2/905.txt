spanish language rendition of frank sinatra s my way fernandez was accompanied by a 15 piece mariachi band for his ranchera performances reviewing his concert at universal amphitheatre in los angeles california los angeles times editor ernesto lechner felt that fernandez seemed to suffer from same malady that affects most modern mexican pop stars citing si tu supieras and no se olvidar as soulless alejandro riera of chicago tribune commented that fernandez has one mean set of pipes and used that voice to successfully seduce just about everybody in his mostly female audience riera also noted that unlike his father vicente who sings tequila drenched songs of unrequited love alejandro praises power that women hold over men he sees them as superior beings even when he takes on persona of disdained lover laura emerick wrote a mixed review of his performance at theatre she felt that even though fernandez is focused on being independent from his father young alejandro remains a pony not a stylistic stallion like his father he lacks vocal finesse and stage presence that make vicente such a galvanizing force she observed that mariachi band looked bored emerick however praised his ranchera tunes critical reception on its release me estoy enamorando was met with positive reviews from music critics allmusic editor terry jenkins gave album four and a half out of five stars calling

easy on ears as well as santander s songwriting on title track he compared fernandez to mexican ranchera singer javier solis like solis fernandez can whisper soft and compassionate requests for love
