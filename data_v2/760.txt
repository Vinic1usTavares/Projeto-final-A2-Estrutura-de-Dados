united states navy royal navy decided to build similar ships initial proposals called for a battleship equipped with eight guns to support main battery though under direction of william henry white director of naval construction these were replaced with four guns new ships though based on general type that had formed basis of preceding four battleship designs marked first significant change in

while they were training commonwealth and rest of 3rd battle squadron along with 3rd cruiser squadron patrolled central north sea fleet activities were limited in july owing to a threatened strike by coal miners which began on 18 july and threatened supply of coal for fleet s ships strike continued into august which led jellicoe to continue to limit fleet activities to preserve his stocks of coal
