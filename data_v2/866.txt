thyroid or thyroid gland is an endocrine gland in neck consisting of two connected lobes lower two thirds of lobes are connected by a thin band of tissue called thyroid isthmus thyroid is located at front of neck below adam s apple microscopically functional unit of thyroid gland is spherical thyroid follicle lined with follicular cells and occasional parafollicular cells that surround a lumen containing colloid thyroid gland secretes three hormones two thyroid hormones triiodothyronine t3 and thyroxine t4 and a peptide hormone calcitonin thyroid hormones influence metabolic rate and protein synthesis and in children growth and development calcitonin plays a role in calcium homeostasis secretion of two thyroid hormones is regulated by thyroid stimulating hormone tsh which is secreted from anterior pituitary gland tsh is regulated by thyrotropin releasing hormone trh which is produced by hypothalamus thyroid gland develops in floor of pharynx at base of tongue at 3 4 weeks gestation it then descends in front of pharyngeal gut and ultimately over next few weeks it migrates to base of neck during migration thyroid remains connected to tongue by a narrow canal thyroglossal duct at end of fifth week thyroglossal duct degenerates and over following two weeks detached thyroid migrates to its final position thyroid disorders include hyperthyroidism hypothyroidism thyroid inflammation thyroiditis thyroid enlargement goitre thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer hyperthyroidism is characterized by excessive secretion of thyroid hormones most common cause is autoimmune disorder graves disease hypothyroidism is characterized by a deficient secretion of thyroid hormones most common cause is iodine deficiency in iodine deficient regions hypothyroidism secondary to iodine deficiency is leading cause of preventable intellectual disability in children in iodine sufficient regions most common cause of hypothyroidism is autoimmune disorder hashimoto s thyroiditis presence of thyroid and its various diseases have been noted and treated for thousands of years although gland itself has only been described and named since renaissance knowledge of thyroid its biochemistry and its disorders developed throughout late nineteenth and twentieth centuries many modern treatments and investigative modalities evolved throughout mid twentieth century including refinement of surgical techniques for thyroid removal thyroidectomy for treatment of goitre use of radioactive iodine and thiouracil for treatment of graves disease and fine needle aspiration for diagnosis of thyroid nodules structure features thumb thyroid gland surrounds cricoid and tracheal cartilages and consists of two lobes this image shows a variant thyroid with a pyramidal lobe emerging from middle of thyroid alt image showing thyroid gland surrounding cricoid cartilage thyroid gland is a butterfly shaped organ composed of two lobes left and right connected by a narrow isthmus it weighs 25 grams in adults with each lobe being about 5 cm long 3 cm wide and 2 cm thick and isthmus about 1 25 cm in height and width gland is usually larger in women than in men and increases in size during pregnancy thyroid is near front of neck lying against and around front of larynx and trachea thyroid cartilage and cricoid cartilage lie just above gland below adam s apple isthmus extends from second to third rings of trachea with uppermost part of lobes extending to thyroid cartilage and lowermost around fourth to sixth tracheal rings muscles lie in front of gland and sternocleidomastoid muscle to side behind outer wings of thyroid lie two carotid arteries trachea larynx lower pharynx and esophagus all lie behind thyroid in this region recurrent laryngeal nerve and inferior thyroid artery pass next to or in ligament typically four parathyroid glands two on each side lie on each side between two layers of thyroid capsule at back of thyroid lobes thyroid gland is covered by a thin fibrous capsule which has an inner and an outer layer inner layer extrudes into gland and forms septae that divides thyroid tissue into microscopic lobules outer layer is continuous with pretracheal fascia attaching gland to cricoid and thyroid cartilages via a thickening of fascia to form posterior suspensory ligament of thyroid gland also known as berry s ligament this causes thyroid to move up and down with movement of these cartilages when swallowing occurs blood lymph and nerve supply thyroid is supplied with arterial blood from superior thyroid artery a branch of external carotid artery and inferior thyroid artery a branch of thyrocervical trunk and sometimes by an anatomical variant thyroid ima artery which has a variable origin superior thyroid artery splits into anterior and posterior branches supplying thyroid and inferior thyroid artery splits into superior and inferior branches superior and inferior thyroid arteries join together behind outer part of thyroid lobes venous blood is drained via superior and middle thyroid veins which drain to internal jugular vein and via inferior thyroid veins inferior thyroid veins originate in a network of veins and drain into left and right brachiocephalic veins both arteries and veins form a plexus between two layers of capsule of thyroid gland lymphatic drainage frequently passes lymph nodes located just above isthmus and pretracheal and lymph nodes gland receives sympathetic nerve supply from superior middle and inferior cervical ganglion of sympathetic trunk gland receives parasympathetic nerve supply from superior laryngeal nerve and recurrent laryngeal nerve variation thumb right upright 0 85 clear pyramidal lobe center as viewed from front there are many variants in size and shape of thyroid gland and in position of embedded parathyroid glands sometimes there is a third lobe present called pyramidal lobe when present this lobe often stretches up hyoid bone from thyroid isthmus and may be one to several divided lobes presence of this lobe ranges in reported studies from 18 3 to 44 6 it was shown to more often arise from left side and occasionally separated pyramidal lobe is also known as s pyramid pyramidal lobe is a remnant of thyroglossal duct which usually wastes away during thyroid gland s descent small accessory thyroid glands may in fact occur anywhere along thyroglossal duct from foramen cecum of tongue to position of thyroid in adult a small horn at back of thyroid lobes usually close to recurrent laryngeal nerve and inferior thyroid artery is called s tubercle other variants include a levator muscle of thyroid gland connecting isthmus to body of hyoid bone and presence of small thyroid ima artery microanatomy thumb section of a thyroid gland under microscope 1 colloid 2 follicular cells 3 endothelial cells at microscopic level there are three primary features of thyroid follicles follicular cells and parafollicular cells first discovered by in 1664 follicles thyroid follicles are small spherical groupings of cells 0 02 0 9mm in diameter that play main role in thyroid function they consist of a rim that has a rich blood supply nerve and lymphatic presence that surrounds a core of colloid that consists mostly of thyroid hormone precursor proteins called thyroglobulin an iodinated glycoprotein follicular cells core of a follicle is surrounded by a single layer of follicular cells when stimulated by thyroid stimulating hormone tsh these secrete thyroid hormones t3 and t4 they do this by transporting and thyroglobulin contained in colloid follicular cells vary in shape from flat to cuboid to columnar depending on how active they are parafollicular cells scattered among follicular cells and in spaces between spherical follicles are another type of thyroid cell parafollicular cells these cells secrete calcitonin and so are also called c cells development thumb floor of pharynx of embryo between 18 and 21 days in development of embryo at 3 4 weeks gestational age thyroid gland appears as an epithelial proliferation in floor of pharynx at base of tongue between and copula linguae copula soon becomes covered over by hypopharyngeal eminence at a point later indicated by foramen cecum thyroid then descends in front of pharyngeal gut as a bilobed diverticulum through thyroglossal duct over next few weeks it migrates to base of neck passing in front of hyoid bone during migration thyroid remains connected to tongue by a narrow canal thyroglossal duct at end of fifth week thyroglossal duct degenerates and over following two weeks detached thyroid migrates to its final position fetal hypothalamus and pituitary start to secrete thyrotropin releasing hormone trh and thyroid stimulating hormone tsh tsh is first measurable at 11 weeks by 18 20 weeks production of thyroxine t4 reaches a clinically significant and self sufficient level fetal triiodothyronine t3 remains low less than 15 ng dl until 30 weeks and increases to 50 ng dl at full term fetus needs to be self sufficient in thyroid hormones in order to guard against neurodevelopmental disorders that would arise from maternal hypothyroidism presence of sufficient iodine is essential for healthy neurodevelopment neuroendocrine parafollicular cells also known as c cells responsible for production of calcitonin are derived from foregut endoderm this part of thyroid then first forms as body which begins in ventral fourth pharyngeal pouch and joins primordial thyroid gland during its descent to its final location aberrations in prenatal development can result in various forms of thyroid dysgenesis which can cause congenital hypothyroidism and if untreated this can lead to cretinism function thumb upright 1 25 thyroid hormones t3 and t4 have a number of metabolic cardiovascular and developmental effects on body production is stimulated by release of thyroid stimulating hormone tsh which in turn depends on release of thyrotropin releasing hormone trh every downstream hormone has negative feedback and decreases level of hormone that stimulates its release alt diagram explaining relationship between thyroid hormones t3 and t4 thyroid stimulating hormone tsh and thyrotropin releasing hormone trh thyroid hormones primary function of thyroid is production of iodine containing thyroid hormones triiodothyronine t3 and thyroxine t4 and peptide hormone calcitonin thyroid hormones are created from iodine and tyrosine t3 is so named because it contains three atoms of iodine per molecule and t4 contains four atoms of iodine per molecule thyroid hormones have a wide range of effects on human body these include metabolic thyroid hormones increase basal metabolic rate and have effects on almost all body tissues appetite absorption of substances and gut motility are all influenced by thyroid hormones they increase absorption in gut generation uptake by cells and breakdown of glucose they stimulate breakdown of fats and increase number of free fatty acids despite increasing free fatty acids thyroid hormones decrease cholesterol levels perhaps by increasing rate of secretion of cholesterol in bile cardiovascular hormones increase rate and strength of heartbeat they increase rate of breathing intake and consumption of oxygen and increase activity of mitochondria combined these factors increase blood flow and body s temperature developmental thyroid hormones are important for normal development they increase growth rate of young people and cells of developing brain are a major target for thyroid hormones t3 and t4 thyroid hormones play a particularly crucial role in brain maturation during fetal development and first few years of postnatal life thyroid hormones also play a role in maintaining normal sexual function sleep and thought patterns increased levels are associated with increased speed of thought generation but decreased focus sexual function including libido and maintenance of a normal menstrual cycle are influenced by thyroid hormones after secretion only a very small proportion of thyroid hormones travel freely in blood most are bound to thyroxine binding globulin about 70 10 and albumin 15 only 0 03 of t4 and 0 3 of t3 traveling freely have hormonal activity in addition up to 85 of t3 in blood is produced following conversion from t4 by in organs around body thyroid hormones act by crossing cell membrane and binding to intracellular nuclear thyroid hormone receptors tr a1 tr a2 tr b1 and tr b2 which bind with hormone response elements and transcription factors to modulate dna transcription in addition to these actions on dna thyroid hormones also act within cell membrane or within cytoplasm via reactions with enzymes including calcium atpase adenylyl cyclase and glucose transporters hormone production thumb upright 2 synthesis of thyroid hormones as seen on an individual thyroid follicular cell thyroglobulin is synthesized in rough endoplasmic reticulum and follows secretory pathway to enter colloid in lumen of thyroid follicle by meanwhile a sodium iodide na i symporter pumps iodide i actively into cell which previously has crossed endothelium by largely unknown mechanisms this iodide enters follicular lumen from cytoplasm by transporter pendrin in a purportedly passive manner in colloid iodide i is oxidized to iodine i0 by an enzyme called thyroid peroxidase iodine i0 is very reactive and thyroglobulin at tyrosyl residues in its protein chain in total containing approximately 120 tyrosyl residues in conjugation adjacent tyrosyl residues are paired together entire complex re enters follicular cell by endocytosis proteolysis by various proteases liberates thyroxine and triiodothyronine molecules which enters blood by largely unknown mechanisms thyroid hormones are created from thyroglobulin this is a protein within colloid in follicular lumen that is originally created within rough endoplasmic reticulum of follicular cells and then transported into follicular lumen thyroglobulin contains 123 units of tyrosine which reacts with iodine within follicular lumen iodine is essential for production of thyroid hormones iodine i0 travels in blood as iodide i which is taken up into follicular cells by a sodium iodide symporter this is an ion channel on cell membrane which in same action transports two sodium ions and an iodide ion into cell iodide then travels from within cell into lumen through action of pendrin an iodide chloride in follicular lumen iodide is then oxidized to iodine this makes it more reactive and iodine is attached to active tyrosine units in thyroglobulin by enzyme thyroid peroxidase this forms precursors of thyroid hormones mit and dit when follicular cells are stimulated by thyroid stimulating hormone follicular cells thyroglobulin from follicular lumen iodinated are cleaved forming thyroid hormones t4 t3 dit mit and traces of reverse triiodothyronine t3 and t4 are released into blood hormones secreted from gland are about 80 90 t4 and about 10 20 t3 how your thyroid works a delicate feedback mechanism updated 2009 05 21 thyroid gland in endocrinology an integrated approach by stephen and saffron whitehead 2001 published by bios scientific publishers ltd enzymes in peripheral tissues remove iodine from mit and dit and convert t4 to t3 and rt3 this is a major source of both rt3 95 and t3 87 in peripheral tissues regulation production of thyroxine and triiodothyronine is primarily regulated by thyroid stimulating hormone tsh released by anterior pituitary gland tsh release in turn is stimulated by thyrotropin releasing hormone trh released in a manner from hypothalamus thyroid hormones provide negative feedback to tsh and trh when thyroid hormones are high tsh production is suppressed this negative feedback also occurs when levels of tsh are high causing trh production to be suppressed trh is secreted at an increased rate in situations such as cold exposure in order to stimulate in addition to being suppressed by presence of thyroid hormones tsh production is blunted by dopamine somatostatin and glucocorticoids calcitonin thyroid gland also produces hormone calcitonin which helps regulate blood calcium levels parafollicular cells produce calcitonin in response to high blood calcium calcitonin decreases release of calcium from bone by decreasing activity of osteoclasts cells which break down bone bone is constantly reabsorbed by osteoclasts and created by so calcitonin effectively stimulates movement of calcium into bone effects of calcitonin are opposite those of parathyroid hormone pth produced in parathyroid glands however calcitonin seems far less essential than pth since calcium metabolism remains clinically normal after removal of thyroid thyroidectomy but not parathyroid glands gene and protein expression about 20 000 protein coding genes are expressed in human cells 70 of these genes are expressed in thyroid cells two hundred fifty of these genes are more specifically expressed in thyroid and about 20 genes are highly thyroid specific in follicular cells proteins synthesized by these genes direct thyroid hormone synthesis thyroglobulin tpo and while in parafollicular c cells they direct calcitonin synthesis calca and clinical significance general practitioners family physicians and internal medicine specialists play a role in identifying and monitoring treatment of thyroid disease and are thyroid specialists thyroid surgeons or otolaryngologists are responsible for surgical management of thyroid disease functional disorders hyperthyroidism excessive production of thyroid hormones is called hyperthyroidism causes include graves disease toxic multinodular goitre solitary thyroid adenoma inflammation and a pituitary adenoma which secretes excess tsh another cause is excess iodine availability either from excess ingestion induced by drug amiodarone or following iodinated contrast imaging hyperthyroidism often causes a variety of non specific symptoms including weight loss increased appetite insomnia decreased tolerance of heat tremor palpitations anxiety and nervousness in some cases it can cause chest pain diarrhoea hair loss and muscle weakness such symptoms may be managed temporarily with drugs such as beta blockers long term management of hyperthyroidism may include drugs that suppress thyroid function such as propylthiouracil and alternatively radioactive iodine 131 can be used to destroy thyroid tissue radioactive iodine is selectively taken up by thyroid cells which over time destroys them chosen first line treatment will depend on individual and on country where being treated surgery to remove thyroid can sometimes be performed as a thyroidectomy a minimally invasive procedure surgery does however carry a risk of damage to parathyroid glands and recurrent laryngeal nerve which innervates vocal cords if entire thyroid gland is removed hypothyroidism will inevitably result and thyroid hormone substitutes will be needed thyroid problems health retrieved on 2010 02 07 hypothyroidism an thyroid gland results in hypothyroidism typical symptoms are abnormal weight gain tiredness constipation heavy menstrual bleeding hair loss cold intolerance and a slow heart rate iodine deficiency is most common cause of hypothyroidism worldwide and autoimmune disease hashimoto s thyroiditis is most common cause in developed world other causes include congenital abnormalities diseases causing transient inflammation surgical removal or of thyroid drugs amiodarone and lithium amyloidosis and sarcoidosis some forms of hypothyroidism can result in myxedema and severe cases can result in myxedema coma hypothyroidism is managed with replacement of hormone thyroxine this is usually given daily as an oral supplement and may take a few weeks to become effective some causes of hypothyroidism such as postpartum thyroiditis and subacute thyroiditis may be transient and pass over time and other causes such as iodine deficiency may be able to be rectified with dietary supplementation diseases graves disease graves disease is an autoimmune disorder that is most common cause of hyperthyroidism in graves disease for an unknown reason autoantibodies develop against thyroid stimulating hormone receptor these antibodies activate receptor leading to development of a goitre and symptoms of hyperthyroidism such as heat intolerance weight loss diarrhoea and palpitations occasionally such antibodies block but do not activate receptor leading to symptoms associated with hypothyroidism in addition gradual protrusion of eyes may occur called graves as may swelling of front of shins graves disease can be diagnosed by presence of features such as involvement of eyes and shins or isolation of autoantibodies or by results of a radiolabelled uptake scan graves disease is treated with anti thyroid drugs such as propylthiouracil which decrease production of thyroid hormones but hold a high rate of relapse if there is no involvement of eyes then use of radioactive isotopes to ablate gland may be considered surgical removal of gland with subsequent thyroid hormone replacement may be considered however this will not control symptoms associated with eye or skin nodules thyroid nodules are often found on gland with a prevalence of 4 7 majority of nodules do not cause any symptoms thyroid hormone secretion is normal and they are non cancerous non cancerous cases include simple cysts colloid nodules and thyroid adenomas malignant nodules which only occur in about 5 of nodules include follicular papillary medullary carcinomas and metastases from other sites nodules are more likely in females those who are exposed to radiation and in those who are iodine deficient when a nodule is present thyroid function tests determine whether nodule is secreting excess thyroid hormones causing hyperthyroidism when thyroid function tests are normal an ultrasound is often used to investigate nodule and provide information such as whether nodule is fluid filled or a solid mass and whether appearance is suggestive of a benign or malignant cancer a needle aspiration biopsy may then be performed and sample undergoes cytology in which appearance of cells is viewed to determine whether they resemble normal or cancerous cells presence of multiple nodules is called a multinodular goitre and if it is associated with hyperthyroidism it is called a toxic multinodular goitre goitre an enlarged thyroid gland is called a goitre goitres are present in some form in about 5 of people and are result of a large number of causes including iodine deficiency autoimmune disease both graves disease and hashimoto s thyroiditis infection inflammation and disease such as sarcoidosis and amyloidosis sometimes no cause can be found a state called simple goitre some forms of goitre are associated with pain whereas many do not cause any symptoms enlarged goitres may extend beyond normal position of thyroid gland to below sternum around airway or esophagus goitres may be associated with or hypothyroidism relating to underlying cause of goitre thyroid function tests may be done to investigate cause and effects of goitre underlying cause of goitre may be treated however many goitres with no associated symptoms are simply monitored inflammation inflammation of thyroid is called thyroiditis and may cause symptoms of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism two types of thyroiditis initially present with hyperthyroidism and are sometimes followed by a period of hypothyroidism hashimoto s thyroiditis and postpartum thyroiditis there are other disorders that cause inflammation of thyroid and these include subacute thyroiditis acute thyroiditis silent thyroiditis riedel s thyroiditis and traumatic injury including palpation thyroiditis hashimoto s thyroiditis is an autoimmune disorder in which thyroid gland is infiltrated by lymphocytes b cell and t cells these progressively destroy thyroid gland in this way s thyroiditis may have occurred insidiously and only be noticed when thyroid hormone production decreases causing symptoms of hypothyroidism hashimoto s is more common in females than males much more common after age of 60 and has known genetic risk factors also more common in individuals with hashimoto s thyroiditis are type 1 diabetes pernicious anaemia addison s disease postpartum thyroiditis occurs in some females following childbirth after delivery gland becomes inflamed and condition initially presents with a period of hyperthyroidism followed by hypothyroidism and usually a return to normal function course of illness takes place over several months and is characterised by a painless goitre antibodies against thyroid peroxidase can be found on testing inflammation usually resolves without treatment although thyroid hormone replacement may be needed during period of hypothyroidism cancer most common neoplasm affecting thyroid gland is a benign adenoma usually presenting as a painless mass in neck malignant thyroid cancers are most often carcinomas although cancer can occur in any tissue that thyroid consists of including cancer of c cells and lymphomas cancers from other sites also rarely lodge in thyroid radiation of head and neck presents a risk factor for thyroid cancer and cancer is more common in women than men occurring at a rate of about 2 1 in most cases thyroid cancer presents as a painless mass in neck it is very unusual for thyroid cancers to present with other symptoms although in some cases cancer may cause hyperthyroidism most malignant thyroid cancers are papillary followed by follicular medullary and thyroid lymphoma because of prominence of thyroid gland cancer is often detected earlier in course of disease as cause of a nodule which may undergo fine needle aspiration thyroid function tests will help reveal whether nodule produces excess thyroid hormones a radioactive iodine uptake test can help reveal activity and location of cancer and metastases thyroid cancers are treated by removing whole or part of thyroid gland radioactive iodine 131 may be given to thyroid thyroxine is given to replace hormones lost and to suppress tsh production as tsh may stimulate recurrence with exception of rare thyroid cancer which carries a very poor prognosis most thyroid cancers carry an excellent prognosis and can even be considered curable congenital a persistent thyroglossal duct is most common clinically significant congenital disorder of thyroid gland a persistent sinus tract may remain as a vestigial remnant of tubular development of thyroid gland parts of this tube may be obliterated leaving small segments to form thyroglossal cysts preterm neonates are at risk of hypothyroidism as their thyroid glands are insufficiently developed to meet their postnatal needs in order to detect hypothyroidism in newborn babies to prevent growth and development abnormalities in later life many countries have newborn screening programs at birth infants with thyroid hormone deficiency congenital hypothyroidism can manifest problems of physical growth and development as well as brain development termed cretinism children with congenital hypothyroidism are treated with levothyroxine which facilitates normal growth and development clear secretions may collect within these cysts to form either spherical masses or fusiform swellings rarely larger than 2 to 3 cm in diameter these are present in midline of neck anterior to trachea segments of duct and cysts that occur high in neck are lined by stratified squamous epithelium which is essentially identical to that covering posterior portion of tongue in region of foramen cecum disorders that occur in lower neck more proximal to thyroid gland are lined by epithelium resembling epithelium characteristically next to lining epithelium there is an intense lymphocytic infiltrate superimposed infection may convert these lesions into abscess cavities and rarely give rise to cancers another disorder is that of thyroid dysgenesis which can result in various presentations of one or more misplaced accessory thyroid glands these can be asymptomatic iodine thumb child affected by cretinism associated with a lack of iodine thyroid gland in health and disease year 1917 robert iodine deficiency most common in inland and mountainous areas can predispose to goitre if widespread known as endemic goitre pregnant women deficient of iodine can give birth to infants with thyroid hormone deficiency use of iodised salt to add iodine to diet has eliminated endemic cretinism in most developed countries and over 120 countries have made iodination of salt mandatory because thyroid concentrates iodine it also concentrates various radioactive isotopes of iodine produced by nuclear fission in event of large accidental releases of such material into environment uptake of radioactive iodine isotopes by thyroid can in theory be blocked by saturating uptake mechanism with a large surplus of non radioactive iodine taken in form of potassium iodide tablets one consequence of chernobyl disaster was an increase in thyroid cancers in children in years following accident excessive iodine intake is uncommon and usually has no effect on thyroid function sometimes though it may cause hyperthyroidism and sometimes hypothyroidism with a resulting goitre evaluation thyroid is examined by observation of gland and surrounding neck for swelling or enlargement it is then felt usually from behind and a person is often asked to swallow to better feel gland against fingers of examiner gland moves up and down with swallowing because of its attachments to thyroid and cricoid cartilages in a healthy person gland is not visible yet is palpable as a soft mass examination of thyroid gland includes search for abnormal masses and assessment of overall thyroid size character of thyroid swellings nodules and their consistency may all be able to be felt if a goitre is present an examiner may also feel down neck consider tapping upper part of chest to check for extension further tests may include raising arms pemberton s sign listening to gland with a stethoscope for testing of reflexes and palpation of lymph nodes in head and neck an examination of thyroid will also include observation of person as a whole to look for systemic signs such as weight gain or loss hair loss and signs in other locations such as protrusion of eyes or swelling of calves in graves disease tests thyroid function tests include a battery of blood tests including measurement of thyroid hormones as well as measurement of thyroid stimulating hormone tsh they may reveal hyperthyroidism high t3 and t4 hypothyroidism low t3 t4 or subclinical hyperthyroidism normal t3 and t4 with a low tsh tsh levels are considered most sensitive marker of thyroid dysfunction they are however not always accurate particularly if cause of hypothyroidism is thought to be related to insufficient thyrotropin releasing hormone trh secretion in which case it may be low or falsely normal in such a case a trh stimulation test in which trh is given and tsh levels are measured at 30 and 60 minutes after may be conducted t3 and t4 can be measured directly however as two thyroid hormones travel bound to other molecules and it is free component that is biologically active free t3 and free t4 levels can be measured t4 is preferred because in hypothyroidism t3 levels may be normal ratio of bound to unbound thyroid hormones is known as thyroid hormone binding ratio it is also possible to measure directly main carriers of thyroid hormones and binding globulin thyroglobulin will also be measurable in a healthy thyroid and will increase with inflammation and may also be used to measure success of thyroid removal or ablation if successful thyroglobulin should be undetectable lastly antibodies against components of thyroid particularly anti tpo and anti thyroglobulin can be measured these may be present in normal individuals but are highly sensitive for autoimmune related disease imaging ultrasound of thyroid may be used to reveal whether structures are solid or filled with fluid helping to differentiate between nodules and goitres and cysts it may also help differentiate between malignant and benign lesions when further imaging is required a radiolabelled iodine 123 or technetium 99 uptake scan may take place this can determine size and shape of lesions reveal whether nodules or goitres are metabolically active and reveal and monitor sites of thyroid disease or cancer deposits outside thyroid a fine needle aspiration of a sample of thyroid tissue may be taken in order to evaluate a lesion seen on ultrasound which is then sent for histopathology and cytology computed tomography of thyroid plays an important role in evaluation of thyroid cancer creative commons

iodine in 1811 and in 1896 eugen baumann documented it as central ingredient in gland he did this by boiling thyroid glands of a thousand sheep and named precipitate a combination of thyroid hormones david marine in 1907 proved that iodine is necessary for thyroid function graves disease was described by robert james graves in 1834 thyroxine was first isolated in 1914 and synthesized in 1927 and in 1952 conversion of t4 to t3 was discovered in 1970 process of discovering tsh took place over early to mid twentieth century trh was discovered by polish endocrinologist andrew in 1970 contributing in part to his nobel prize in medicine in 1977 in nineteenth century numerous authors described both cretinism and myxedema and their relationship to thyroid charles mayo coined term hyperthyroidism in 1910 hashimoto documented a case of hashimoto s thyroiditis in 1912 antibodies in this disease were demonstrated in 1956 knowledge of thyroid and its conditions developed throughout late nineteenth and twentieth centuries with many modern treatments and investigative modalities evolving throughout mid twentieth century including use of radioactive iodine thiouracil and fine needle aspiration surgery either aetius in sixth century ce or persian ali ibn abbas al in 990 ce conducted first recorded thyroidectomy as a treatment for goitre operations remained risky and generally were not successful until 19th century when descriptions emerged from a number of authors including prussian surgeon theodor billroth swiss surgeon and physiologist theodor kocher american physician charles mayo american surgeons william halsted and george these descriptions provided basis for modern thyroid surgery theodor kocher went on to win nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1909 for his work on physiology pathology and surgery of thyroid gland other animals thumb goat affected by a goitre thyroid gland is found in all vertebrates in fish it is usually located below gills and is not always divided into distinct lobes however in some teleosts patches of thyroid tissue are found elsewhere in body associated with kidneys spleen heart or eyes in tetrapods thyroid is always found somewhere in neck region in most tetrapod species there are two paired thyroid glands that is right and left lobes are not joined together however there is only ever a single thyroid gland in most mammals and shape found in humans is common to many other species in larval lampreys thyroid originates as an exocrine gland secreting its hormones into gut and associated with larva s filter feeding apparatus in adult lamprey gland separates from gut and becomes endocrine but this path of development may reflect evolutionary origin of thyroid for instance closest living relatives of vertebrates tunicates and have a structure very similar to that of larval lampreys and this also secretes iodine containing compounds though not thyroxine thyroxine is critical to metabolic regulation and growth throughout animal kingdom iodine and t4 trigger change from a plant eating water dwelling tadpole into a meat eating land dwelling frog with better neurological visuospatial smell and cognitive abilities for hunting as seen in other predatory animals a similar phenomenon happens in neotenic amphibian salamanders which without introducing iodine don t transform into land dwelling adults and live and reproduce in larval form of aquatic axolotl among amphibians administering a thyroid blocking agent such as propylthiouracil ptu can prevent tadpoles from metamorphosing into frogs in contrast administering thyroxine will trigger metamorphosis in amphibian metamorphosis thyroxine and iodine also exert a well studied experimental model of apoptosis on cells of gills tail and fins of tadpoles
