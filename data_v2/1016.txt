terrier show cradley heath 1935 thumb 200px early protection cruelty to animals act 1835 made blood sports illegal and effectively stopped bull and bear baiting in uk bull and bear baiting required large arenas which made it easier for authorities to police whereas illegal dog fighting was much harder to terminate because fight sponsors kept their venues hidden and closely guarded in private basements and similar locations as a result dog fighting continued long after bull and bear baiting had ceased it was not until passage of protection of animals act 1911 that organised dog fighting in britain largely came to an end early history in early 1800s bull and terrier crossbreeds had been developed to satisfy need for vermin control and taste for blood sports in mid 19th century james hinks wanted to develop a socially acceptable gentleman s companion with refinement cleaner lines and courage without aggressive tendencies two different types of bull and terriers resulted including hink s cross of bull and terrier with english white terrier to achieve a more refined appearance with better legs and a nicer head a later outcross included dalmatian and collie which led to development of an athletic white dog known as hink s white cavalier forerunner to modern bull terrier devotees preferred original bull and terrier type over hink s bull terrier and remained loyal to their preferred type which became modern staffordshire bull terrier of same ancestry as bull terrier theories of origin stafford was developed in what was then considered black country of staffordshire and northern parts of birmingham there are two theories about development of stafford as recognised by kc registry first and more widely held theory is that stafford like bull terrier descends from long extinct bull and terrier which originated as a cross between ferocious thickly muscled old english bulldog and agile lithe and feisty black and tan terrier aggressive old english bulldog bred for bear and bull baiting was often pitted against its own kind in organised dog fights but it was determined that lighter faster dogs were better suited for dog fighting than heavier bulldog in an effort to produce a lighter faster more agile dog with courage and tenacity of bulldog breeders outcrossed with local terriers and ultimately achieved success second less widely held theory is that old english bulldog was not crossed with terriers rather stafford as a breed began with direct descendants derived from generations of selective breeding of early bulldogs which produced a smaller dog with a more athletic build some believe theory is evidentially supported by certain genetic characteristics and similarities in appearances of modern staffords when compared to old english bulldogs depicted in some of early 19th century paintings dna analysis in 2017 a genome wide study revealed that all of bull and terrier type dogs including staffordshire bull terrier map back to terriers of ireland and to origins which date to period 1860 1870 timing coincides with historical descriptions of dog fighting contests in ireland a lack of accurate stud book documentation
