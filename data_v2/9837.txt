arab byzantine wars were a series of wars between mostly arab muslims and byzantine empire between 7th and 11th centuries ad started during initial muslim conquests under expansionist rashidun and umayyad caliphs in 7th century and continued by their successors until mid 11th century emergence of muslim arabs from arabia in 630s resulted in rapid loss of byzantium s southern provinces syria and egypt to arab caliphate over next fifty years under umayyad caliphs arabs would launch repeated raids into still byzantine asia minor twice besiege byzantine capital of constantinople and conquer byzantine exarchate of africa situation did not stabilize until after failure of second arab siege of constantinople in 718 when taurus mountains on eastern rim of asia minor became established as mutual heavily fortified and largely depopulated frontier under abbasid empire relations became more normal with embassies exchanged and even periods of truce but conflict remained norm with almost annual raids and counter raids sponsored either by abbasid government or by local rulers well into 10th century during first centuries byzantines were usually on defensive and avoided open field battles preferring to retreat to their fortified strongholds only after 740 did they begin to launch their raids in an attempt to combat arabs and take lands they had lost but still abbasid empire was able to retaliate with often massive and destructive invasions of asia minor with decline and fragmentation of abbasid state after 861 and concurrent strengthening of byzantine empire under macedonian dynasty tide gradually turned over a period of fifty years from ca 920 to 976 byzantines finally broke through muslim defences and restored their control over northern syria and greater armenia last century of arab byzantine wars was dominated by frontier conflicts with fatimids in syria but border remained stable until appearance of a new people seljuk turks after 1060 arabs also took to sea and from 650s on entire mediterranean sea became a battleground with raids and counter raids being launched against islands and coastal settlements arab raids reached a peak in 9th and early 10th centuries after conquests of crete malta and sicily with their fleets reaching coasts of france and dalmatia and even suburbs of constantinople background prolonged and escalating byzantine sasanian wars of 6th and 7th centuries and recurring outbreaks of bubonic plague plague of justinian left both empires exhausted and vulnerable in face of sudden emergence and expansion of arabs last of wars
