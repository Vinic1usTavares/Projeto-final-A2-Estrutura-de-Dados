quainton road railway station was opened in 1868 in under developed countryside near quainton in english county of buckinghamshire from london built by aylesbury and buckingham railway it was result of pressure from 3rd duke of buckingham to route railway near his home at wotton house and to open a railway station at nearest point to it serving a relatively underpopulated area quainton road was a crude railway station described as extremely primitive duke of buckingham built a short horse drawn tramway to transport goods between his estates at wotton and a terminus adjacent to station he extended it soon afterwards to provide a passenger service to town of brill and tramway was converted to locomotive operation known as brill tramway all goods to and from brill tramway passed through quainton road making it relatively heavily used despite its geographical isolation and traffic increased further when construction began on ferdinand de rothschild s mansion of waddesdon manor plan of extending brill tramway to oxford which would have made quainton road a major junction station was abandoned instead aylesbury and buckingham railway and brill tramway were absorbed by london s metropolitan railway mr which already operated line from aylesbury to london mr rebuilt quainton road and re sited it to a more convenient location allowing through running between brill tramway and aylesbury and buckingham railway when great central railway gcr from north of england opened quainton road became a significant junction at which trains from four directions met and by far busiest of mr s rural stations in 1933 metropolitan railway was taken into public ownership to become metropolitan line of london passenger transport board s london underground including quainton road lptb aimed to move away from freight operations and saw no way in which rural parts of mr could be made into viable passenger routes in 1935 brill tramway was closed from 1936 underground trains were withdrawn north of aylesbury leaving london and north eastern railway successor to gcr as only operator using station although underground services were restored for a short period in 1940s in 1963 stopping passenger services were withdrawn but fast passenger trains continued to pass through in 1966 line was closed to passenger traffic and local goods trains ceased using station line through station was singled and used by occasional freight trains only in 1969 quainton road society was formed with aim of preserving station in 1971 it absorbed london railway preservation society taking over its collection of historic railway equipment station was fully restored and reopened as a museum buckinghamshire railway centre in addition to original station buildings museum has also acquired former oxford rewley road railway station and a london transport building from wembley park both of which have been reassembled on site although no scheduled trains pass through quainton road station remains connected to railway network freight trains still use this line and passenger trains still call at station for special events at buckinghamshire railway centre origins on 15 june 1839 entrepreneur and former member of parliament for buckingham sir harry verney 2nd baronet opened aylesbury railway built under direction of robert stephenson it connected london and birmingham railway s cheddington

parliament with object of connecting buckinghamshire railway by now operated by lnwr to aylesbury 2nd duke used his influence to ensure new route would run via quainton near his remaining estates around wotton instead of intended more direct route via pitchcott beset by financial difficulties line took over eight years to build eventually opening on 23 september 1868 new line was connected to wycombe railway s aylesbury station and joined existing buckinghamshire railway lines at point where oxford bletchley line and line to buckingham already met verney junction railway station was built at point where lines joined named after sir harry who owned land on which it was built since there was no nearby town aylesbury now had railways to east north and southwest but no line southeast towards london and channel ports quainton road station was built on a curve in line at nearest point to duke s estates at wotton six miles 10 km northwest of aylesbury it was southwest of small village of quainton and immediately northwest of road connecting quainton to akeman street railway towards aylesbury crossed road via a level crossing immediately southeast of station aylesbury and buckingham railway had spent most of their limited budget on construction of line itself details of design of original quainton road station are lost but it is likely that station had a single timber covered earth platform and minimal buildings it was described in 1890 as being extremely primitive subscription required wotton tramway right thumb 260px a complex arrangement of sidings level

passengers line was to run roughly southwest from quainton road to a new railway station near wotton underwood just west of station at wotton line split one section would run west to wood siding near brill a short stub called church siding would run northwest into village of wotton underwood itself terminating near parish church and a 1 mile 57 chain 1 mile 1 254 yards 2 8 km siding would run north to a coal siding near kingswood construction began on line on 8 september 1870 it was built as cheaply as possible using cheapest available materials and winding around hills wherever feasible to avoid expensive earthworks station platforms were crude earth banks high held in place by wooden planks as duke intended that line be worked by horses it was built with longitudinal sleepers to reduce risk of them tripping on 1 april 1871 section between quainton road and wotton was formally opened by duke in a brief ceremony at time of its opening line was unnamed although it was referred to as quainton tramway in internal correspondence extension from wotton to wood siding was complete by 17 june 1871 opening date of northern branch to kingswood is not recorded but it was not yet fully open in february 1873 london and north western railway immediately began to operate a dedicated service from quainton road with three vans per week of milk collected from wotton estate shipped to broad street passengers were not carried other than estate employees and people accompanying livestock tramway did not link to a b but had its own station at quainton road at a right angle to a b a diameter turntable at end of tramway linked to a spur from a b this spur ran behind a goods shed joining a b line to northwest of road tramway had no buildings at quainton road using a b s facilities when necessary as tramway ran on east side of road opposite station spur line had its own level crossing to reach main line in 1871 permission was granted to build a direct connection between two

running out of oxford other than those which ran through aylesbury vale are not shown alt in late 1871 residents of brill former seat of mercian kings and only significant town near wotton house petitioned duke to extend route to brill and to run a passenger service on line in january 1872 a passenger timetable was published for first time and line was officially named wotton tramway but it was commonly known as brill tramway from its opening to passengers until closure new terminus of brill opened in march 1872 with horses unable to cope with loads being carried tramway was upgraded for locomotive use lightly laid track with longitudinal sleepers limited locomotive weight to a maximum of nine tons lighter than almost all locomotives then available so it was not possible to use standard locomotives two traction engines converted for railway use were bought from aveling and porter at a cost of ps398 about ps as of each locomotives were chosen on grounds of weight and reliability and had a top speed on level of only taking 95 98 minutes to travel six miles 10 km between brill and quainton road an average speed of line was heavily used for shipment of bricks from brickworks around brill and of cattle and milk from dairy farms on wotton estate by 1875 line was carrying around 40 000 gallons 180 000 l 48 000 us gal of milk each year delivery of linseed cake to dairy farms and of coal to area s buildings were also important uses of line line also began to carry large quantities of manure from london to area s farms carrying 3 200 tons 3 300 t in 1872 as it was only physical link between tramway and national railway network almost all of this traffic passed through quainton road station by mid 1870s slow speed of aveling and porter locomotives and their unreliability and inability to handle heavy loads were recognised as major problems for tramway in 1874 ferdinand de rothschild bought a site near tramway s waddesdon station to use as a site for his country mansion of waddesdon manor tramway s management recognised that construction works would lead to a significant increase in haulage of heavy goods and that aveling and porter engines would be unable to cope with increased loads newly established engineering firm of w g bagnall wrote to duke offering to hire a locomotive to him for trials offer was accepted and on 18 december 1876 locomotive was delivered tests were generally successful and an order was placed to buy a locomotive from bagnall for ps640 about ps in which was delivered on 28 december 1877 with trains now hauled by bagnall locomotive kingswood branch generally remained worked by horses and occasionally by aveling and porter engines traffic levels soon rose milk traffic rose from 40 000 gallons carried in 1875 to 58 000 gallons 260 000 l 70 000 us gal in 1879 and in 1877 tramway carried a total of 20 994 tons 21 331 t of goods in early 1877 tramway was shown on bradshaw maps for first time and from may 1882

locomotive at a curving station platform on platform is a small building with a curved roof although introduction of bagnall locomotives and traffic generated by works at waddesdon manor had boosted line s fortunes it remained in serious financial difficulty only connection with national railway network was by turntable at quainton road although 3rd duke of buckingham was both owner of wotton tramway and chairman of a b latter regarded tramway as a nuisance and in 1870s pursued a policy of charging disproportionately high fees for through traffic between tramway and main line with intention of forcing tramway out of business a b trains would deliberately miss connections with tramway causing milk shipped via quainton road to become unsellable tramway sought legal advice and was informed that duke would be likely to win a legal action against a b however a b was in such a precarious financial position that any successful legal action against it would likely have forced its through quainton road to close severing tramway s connection with national network many tramway passengers changed trains at quainton road to continue their journey on a b in 1885 5 192 passengers did so tramway s management suggested that a b subsidise tramway to sum of ps25 about ps in per month to allow passenger services to continue but a b agreed to pay only ps5 about ps in per month by mid 1880s tramway was finding it difficult to cover operating expenses of either goods or passenger operations metropolitan railway takeover of aylesbury and buckingham railway in 1837 euston railway

steadily extending its services and acquiring other local railways north and west of london in 1872 edward watkin 1819 1901 was appointed its chairman a director of many railway companies he had a vision of unifying a string of railways to create a single line from manchester via london to an intended channel tunnel and on to france in 1873 watkin entered negotiations to take control of a b and section of former buckinghamshire railway north from verney junction to buckingham he planned to extend mr north from london to aylesbury and tramway southwest to oxford creating a through route from london to oxford rail services between oxford and london at this time were poor although still an extremely roundabout route this scheme would have formed shortest route from london to oxford aylesbury buckingham and stratford upon avon duke of buckingham was enthusiastic and authorisation was sought from parliament parliament did not share enthusiasm of watkin and duke and in 1875
