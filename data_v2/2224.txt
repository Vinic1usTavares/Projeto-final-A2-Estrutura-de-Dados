which he causes a furor with a hospital scandal sheet other showing noland having to save him from being fleeced by a patient who is also a card shark there was some racially tinged comic bantering in series such as scenes with noland giving cotton to a nurse and stating honey picking cotton is part of my heritage or observing some adhesive strips labeled flesh colored and remarking maybe this is your idea of flesh colored but it wouldn t make it in my neighborhood aside from these racial issues were avoided as asher and ackerman felt that abc was not interested in having them mixed into comedy in discussing series asher noted we too often forget humanity of doctors and nurses they become godlike to most of us and yet it is their humanity that makes them so interesting and enjoyable we are not doing a drama and have no intention of doing anything like dealing with life and death issues we want to make people laugh so we de emphasize more serious elements of hospital life it isn t that he noland just sees things differently he also deals with them differently that is why noland will dream up a baby derby a gambling night at hospital a variety show at christmas and off track betting when patients get bored with hospital routine production of temperatures rising was underway by august 1972 with filming done at burbank studios in burbank california original reviews in his review of premiere episode of temperatures rising for los angeles times critic don page felt that james whitmore was totally wasted in this silly exercise and that guest jack albertson almost saves it with his portrayal of an annoyed senator otherwise diagnosis is terminal comedy likewise cecil smith another writer for times claimed it was worst show of season avoid it like plague other reviews were more favorable columnist joan crosby noted that this is kind of show you don t think you ll laugh at but you do mostly because cast is so good she noted that cleavon little joan van ark and reva rose were respectively marvelous pretty and funny and that nancy fox wins this year s cute as a kitten award barbara tv and radio editor for pittsburgh press noted that abc did a gutsy turnabout in taking heavy drama out of a hospital and replacing it with comedy venture worked well thanks to excellent performances from temperatures rising cast she praised albertson noted that whitmore was little seen and that series is kind of tidy little show that brings chuckles win fanning a syndicated columnist stated that comedy writing and performances by a beautifully integrated cast give temperatures a bright light quality so seldom achieved in a situation comedy and that it was loaded with one liners and sight gags which if kept on level of opener promise many hours of hilarity fanning praised little as one of comedy finds of any tv season and fox as a fresh new face and talent giving promise of a long successful career ahead more praise for series came after broadcast of its fourth episode an unidentified reviewer writing for armored sentinel of temple texas stated if you re suffering from case of downs this series is a sure pick up reviewer went on to note that brightest spot of series is wacky nancy fox her role applies wackiness of goldie hawn but in situation comedy form i d watch show just for her whole series is wacky and funny it s downright good i

bonanza on nbc and new sitcom maude on cbs bonanza was entering its fourteenth year and offered up an ambitious two hour season premiere dealing with marriage of little joe cartwright michael landon

bonanza s ratings dropped sharply and nbc cancelled series in november 1972 according to asher temperatures rising put bonanza out of business and was beating maude in los angeles area until mid season when nbc switched to some heavy movies which hurt us despite this series finished its first year with a consistent 29 share of ratings at a time when a 30 share was enough to assure renewal for another season abc however wanted to improve ratings and decided to make significant changes to temperatures rising for its second season second season new premise and producers as early as november

popularity polls even though his sitcom which aired opposite sonny cher comedy hour on cbs was floundering in ratings asher was against making this change but was overruled as his contractual commitments to abc had been used up of change asher stated network ugh they re so stupid sometimes shows temperatures rising and paul lynde show were doing good they weren t big hits but they were doing good they felt that if they could put paul lynde and cleavon little together that they would have a big hit i didn t want to do that i said i won t do it not at sacrifice of show it s wrong i don t think it s a good idea but they wanted to bring in somebody else as head of hospital they wanted his lynde s mother to be head of hospital and his conflicts would be with her and i just didn t think it was right i didn t want to write it i just didn t want to do it and i didn t someone else came in it was a big thing with network they cancelled paul lynde show and put paul in temperatures rising asher was replaced as producer by bruce johnson and duke vincent whose previous credits included gomer pyle usmc jim nabors hour arnie and little people they changed title of series to new temperatures rising show and tone went from lighthearted wackiness to a form of black comedy similar to hospital a 1971 film written by paddy chayefsky starring george c scott sitcom became a savage satire of medical profession with 185 a day hospital rooms incompetent fee splitting doctors operations on wrong patients misread x rays and rampant malpractice commenting on series vincent noted we re not doing stories about a fouled up hospital these things really happen every story we ve told is true they re results of untrained people inadequate staff horrendous costs worn out equipment

cardiac crash carts on each floor of hospital johnson and vincent s favorite episode was one where x rays of a professional footballer are misread resulting in him being placed by mistake in crutchfield s traction in which holes are drilled in his head and tongs inserted in them second season reviews in reviewing new temperatures rising show associated press television writer jay noted first hopeful note there are faint signs tinkering with temperatures format could make series funny later on but only if writing improves show now leaves most of mugging to lynde and no longer insists that each regular is wacky it s all feeble stuff but cast is vastly improved and new approach portends to better things ahead likewise los angeles times critic cecil smith who considered original format maybe three worse shows on television rolled into one now remarked paul lynde for first time that i can recall has a part worthy of his mettle people surrounding him are first rate sinking ratings despite some heavy promotion black comedy approach was not what audiences wanted to see especially with paul lynde as a result ratings for series fell well below levels of previous season last of new temperatures rising show s thirteen episodes aired on january 8 1974 following tuesday january 15 abc premiered happy days in its place according to co producer mitchell audience didn t buy that at all they just didn t get it it was funny if you like black comedy but if you don t it would disturb you so show failed miserably and we lost job and show summer replacement third concept when john mitchell and barry diller noticed that new temperatures rising show was failing they contacted william asher and asked him to salvage series according to asher they asked if i d go back to old temperatures only this time with paul lynde at this point we were still hoping to make it for midseason after a couple of weeks we agreed that show should go off air in january but continue production so that we would have 11 shows ready for airing any time they wanted them some of nonsense and hijinks of first season are gone and we have managed to keep a touch of reality of second version as to why series was not cancelled asher remarked i can answer that in two words paul lynde final cast for third format show reverted to its original title temperatures rising and proposed number of episodes was reduced from eleven to seven series production resumed on november 17 1973 after a three week shutdown sudie bond barbara cason jennifer darling jeff morrow and john dehner were dropped

rising aired on august 29 1974 attempt to resuscitate series was unsuccessful and abc finally cancelled it permanently andy siegel a comedy development executive for abc at time felt series failed because audiences did not want to watch a show displaying inadequate medical care even though it was done in a humorous fashion in reminiscing about series he stated when people see doctors on television they really want to feel that they re in good hands that no matter what happens it is a reassuring experience william asher in a 2000 interview summed up demise of series by saying it didn t get on it s too late you can t do that to an audience they won t accept it episodes references notes footnotes bibliography external links photo gallery from temperatures rising category 1970s
