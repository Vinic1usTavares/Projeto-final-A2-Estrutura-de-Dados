difficulty player starts on easiest variation and is lowered to a more difficult variation with each subsequent loss of a life producer hiroyuki maruyama was heavily inspired by taito s shooter metal black 1991 and founded g rev with ex taito employees specifically to develop a shooter of his own team of five did subcontract work to gather funding and build their skills programming naomi arcade hardware among projects they worked on were treasure s ikaruga 2001 and gradius v 2004 due to lack of funds they were not able to realize all ideas they conceptualized for game border down was released to mixed reception but was commercially successful and continues to maintain a steady interest from shooter fans g rev went on to make other shoot em ups including senko no ronde and under defeat gameplay thumb left player controlling red ship fights off enemies to right in first stage border down is a side scrolling shoot em up set in a futuristic setting centuries after humans have colonized mars hostile aliens begin attacking planet mars defense force mobilizes and launch a new type of unmanned aircraft player takes on role of a pilot controlling aircraft through a remote control interface game s name is derived from its border system each stage has three parallel variations or borders of varying difficulty player starts on easiest border green and if they lose a life drop to yellow and then finally difficult red border if player loses a life in red border it is game over though a continue option can be unlocked through repeated play each border is slightly different from others usually featuring other enemies and modified stage layouts and backgrounds final stage and ending are determined by amount of time spent in each border during a playthrough dreamcast version also features a remix mode with new enemy attack patterns ship s main weapon can either be fired as a continuous barrage of bullets by holding down fire button or as a set of homing missiles by tapping it a power meter slowly fills up over time which determines strength of ship s weaponry it can also be boosted by destroying enemies this meter can also power a secondary laser attack which has an additional function of canceling out any boss attack reflecting it back at them using laser comes at a cost as it drains meter and therefore weakens main weapon development border down was developed and published by g rev a team founded by producer hiroyuki maruyama with explicit purpose to develop a shoot em up team consisted of five ex taito employees three programmers one designer and maruyama himself after founding company in july 2000 he first needed to build capital and give his team an opportunity to learn skills and techniques to develop a shooter they were able to gather most of funds through producing their first game doki doki idol star seeker 2001 a puzzle game for sega s naomi arcade board remaining amount was accumulated through freelance work including subcontract work with treasure on two shooters ikaruga 2001 and gradius v 2004 ikaruga gave g rev key experience of programming for naomi hardware initial concept for border down took root with maruyama before he founded g rev he was heavily inspired by taito s shooter metal black 1991 specifically game s beam level system he also borrowed ideas from his experiences with producing g darius 1997 with taito particularly game s branching level system which inspired border system in border down with a parallel world system like this team would not need to develop as many distinct levels this was one of few parts of his original concept that was kept in final game for visual inspiration maruyama pulled from kim stanley robinson s science fiction novel red mars music was composed by yasuhisa watanabe who also composed music to metal black and was only member of staff who had worked on 1991 shooter team had to cut a significant amount of material due to lack of funds in particular maruyama wanted to flesh out ending and opening cinematics they also had plans for more visual flair including background details and explosion effects but had to cut about a third of these ideas because of naomi s graphical limitations they commissioned help for extra sound and design work release border down was released in japanese arcades in 25 april 2003 it was common for naomi shooters to be ported to sega s home console dreamcast making a significant portion of aging console s extended output sega had effectively ceased support for system in west by this time but some support remained in japan although a dreamcast conversion would seem like an obvious choice with it being a naomi game g rev spent time considering which console was most suitable for a home port they decided against playstation 2 because game would have needed a complete rebuild from ground up as for gamecube they believed border down was not suited for system s audience with these factors along with ease of porting naomi games to dreamcast they chose sega s home console according to edge and jeuxvideo com a fan petition for a dreamcast port was another factor simplicity of porting process left g rev with more time to add remix mode thumb a limited edition copy of border down complete with game and soundtrack dreamcast port was released a few months after arcade version on 25 september 2003 if bought through sega direct game came with a border down branded mouse pad in addition to standard version 3000 limited edition copies were produced that came bundled with soundtrack soundtrack contains tracks not included in original game and was also sold separately maruyama was prepared to fold g rev if border down was not successful but number of customer orders at launch exceeded g rev and sega s expectations so they continued producing new copies until they felt demand was met border down has seen continued interest post release a second volume to soundtrack was released on 13 may 2004 through sega direct containing tracks from remix mode and an original track by watanabe by 2007 japanese retailer messe sanoh was still seeing demand for game and so requested sega and g rev for another production run their request was granted a second run was produced and sold exclusively through messe sanoh retailers beginning on 17 january 2008 both production runs included less than 20 000 copies were sold it has since become one of most coveted japanese exclusives for dreamcast collectors in 2011 maruyama stated he would consider border down or his 2005 game under defeat on modern platforms under defeat was rereleased in 2012 for playstation 3 and xbox 360 a resin kit for player ship from border down was released in february 2013 reception initial reactions to arcade release were mixed maruyama recalled it s a really individualistic type of game so when we first released it in arcades it received both positive and negative reactions edge gave dreamcast version a 6 out of 10 feeling that game had all ingredients to be an outstanding shooter but lacked energy to push it to that next level they explained that border down lacked intensity to frighten players and felt that good shooters need that type of panic inducing gameplay in retrospect eurogamer called border down arguably g rev s best game among likes of senko no ronde and under defeat retro gamer called it one of highest regarded late era releases for dreamcast kurt kalata of hardcore gaming 101 wrote that game remains popular with hardcore shoot em up fans but found it hard to recommend given its high price tag within secondary markets jeuxvideo com believed it to be best horizontal shooter for dreamcast kalata and jeuxvideo com agreed that game had excellent replayability due to border and scoring systems retro gamer thought graphics were good for game s limited budget and jeuxvideo com agreed but kalata believed they were bland outside of some interesting backgrounds regarding music retro gamer wrote that it was strong enough to stand on its own while kalata and jeuxvideo com felt it was strange synth and techno jazz kalata felt gameplay similarities to darius series while jeuxvideo com called it a great mix of classic style shooters like r type and more modern manic shooters references external links category 2003 video games category arcade games category dreamcast games
