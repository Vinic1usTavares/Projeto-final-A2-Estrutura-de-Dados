agharta is a 1975 live double album by american jazz trumpeter composer and bandleader miles davis by time he recorded album davis was 48 years old and had alienated many in jazz community while attracting younger rock audiences with his radical electric fusion music after experimenting with different line ups he established a stable live band in 1973 and toured constantly for next two years despite physical pain from worsening health and emotional instability brought on by substance abuse during a three week tour of japan in 1975 trumpeter performed two concerts at festival hall in osaka on february 1 afternoon show produced agharta and evening show was released as pangaea following year davis led a septet at concert saxophonist sonny fortune bassist michael henderson and guitarist pete cosey were given space to improvise against a dense backdrop of riffs electronic effects cross beats and funk grooves from rhythm section drummer al foster guitarist reggie lucas and percussionist james mtume davis controlled their rhythmic and musical direction with hand and head gestures phrases played on his wah wah processed trumpet and drones from an accompanying electronic organ evolving nature of performance led to widespread misunderstanding that it had no compositional basis while its dark angry and somber musical qualities were seen as a reflection of bandleader s emotional and spiritual state at time agharta was first released in japan by cbs sony in august 1975 just before davis temporarily retired due to increasingly poor health and exhaustion at record label s suggestion it was titled after legendary subterranean city davis enlisted japanese artist tadanori yokoo to design its artwork which depicted cityscape of an advanced civilization with elements inspired by eastern subterranean myths and afrofuturism an alternate cover was produced for its 1976 release in north america by columbia records a highly divisive record agharta further challenged davis jazz audience and was widely panned by contemporary critics reviewers found music discordant and complained of cosey s loud guitar sounds and davis sparse trumpet playing it was reevaluated positively in subsequent years while a generation of younger musicians was influenced by band s abrasive music and cathartic playing particularly cosey s effects laden free improvisations agharta became viewed as an important jazz rock record a dramatically dynamic group performance and culmination of davis electric period spanning late 1960s and mid 1970s background right thumb miles davis in 1971 in early 1970s miles davis continued exploring directions radically different from jazz music that made him renowned in 1950s and 1960s music from this electric period in his career found him experimenting with rock funk african rhythms emerging electronic music technology and an ever changing lineup of musicians who played electric instruments trumpeter attracted younger audiences as his fusion music became more radical and abstract while alienating older listeners musicians and critics in jazz scene who accused him of selling out after recording his 1972 on corner album davis began to focus more on performing live working in studio only sporadically and haphazardly 1974 releases big fun and get up with it compiled recordings he made between 1969 and 1974 by 1973 davis had established most of his band s line up a septet featuring bassist michael henderson guitarists pete cosey and reggie lucas drummer al foster percussionist james mtume and saxophonist dave liebman liebman left group following year and was replaced by sonny fortune lucas foster and mtume functioned as band s rhythm section while cosey henderson and fortune were given space to improvise as soloists their concerts played frequently at rock venues and festivals became opportunities for davis and his sidemen to test new musical ideas and ways to exploit electronic equipment davis toured relentlessly for two years while tolerating intense physical pain and difficulty walking caused by joint pain from sickle cell anaemia badly damaged ankles after a 1972 car wreck and osteoporosis in his left hip which had been operated on a decade earlier he had also developed nodules on his larynx that often left him short of breath especially when playing trumpet to numb pain he became increasingly dependent on self medicating with painkillers cocaine and morphine which combined with his alcohol and recreational drug use led to mood swings he would by turns feel vulnerable and hostile by end of 1974 a disappointing showing in downbeat magazine s readers poll reinforced to davis that his reputation had diminished unfazed by detractors and personal troubles he kept his touring schedule intense tour of japan right thumb festival hall left center in osaka where agharta was recorded in 1975 48 year old davis embarked on a three week tour of japan between january 22 and february 8 he played 14 concerts in large hall venues to capacity crowds and enthusiastic reviews japanese critic keizo takada said at time that davis was leading his magnificent and energetic band just as duke ellington had his orchestra miles must be genius of managing men and bringing out their hidden talent takada concluded throughout tour davis was sick with pneumonia and a bleeding ulcer that grew worse while his hip occasionally and unpredictably slipped out of its socket unable to work his trumpet s volume and effects pedals because of pain in his legs he would go down on his knees to press them with his hand during performances to relieve his pain and perform he used codeine and morphine smoked and drank large quantities of heineken beer on several occasions davis was able to play two concerts in one day as he did on february 1 at festival hall in osaka japanese people were very beautiful henderson recalled from concerts they came in with their suit and ties on and we proceeded to blow roof off suckers with a million amplifiers festival hall performances were recorded by japan s cbs sony record label under supervision of teo macero davis producer of 15 years unlike with his previous electric albums macero abstained from editing and splicing recordings as he later told musician magazine japanese specifically wanted me to leave in spacy things they were released as two double albums agharta featuring afternoon concert was first released in japan in august 1975 and later in north america in 1976 evening show was issued in japan as pangaea in 1976 composition and performance right thumb sonny fortune photographed in 2007 whose solos on agharta were described by mikal gilmore as floats over formidable rhythmic density taking long and graceful breaks that wing off into a private reverie for first of afternoon concert s two sets band performed compositions tatu agharta prelude and maiysha from get up with it making up aghartas first disc of music second set performances of right off from davis 1971 jack johnson album ife from big fun and wili for dave spanned second disc between right off and ife segments band improvised a passage based on so what from 1959 album kind of blue for 41 seconds after henderson started to play its ostinato pieces were performed in medleys which were given generic track titles on agharta such as prelude and interlude as with his other live releases in 1970s davis refused to have individual compositions specified in track listing because he felt critics and other listeners often overlooked music s intrinsic meaning by indulging in abstract musical analysis i m not doing anything it doesn t need an explanation he later told leonard feather music scholars were able to identify pieces through an examination of what davis researcher enrico merlin called coded phrases which davis played on trumpet or organ to signify end of one segment and direct band toward next section he first used such cues and modulations when recording flamenco sketches in 1959 merlin said pieces featured on agharta were part of a typical set list for group but their performances of each sometimes changed almost beyond recognition from concert to concert this along with track names led to widespread misunderstanding that music was mostly or entirely improvised and unstructured lucas explained that band started each performance with a very defined compositional basis before developing it further in a highly structured yet very free way right off segment was improvised from original recording s e flat riff davis had band play around a single chord in a piece for several minutes with variations as each member performed in a different time signature foster might have been playing in common time and mtume in compound duple metre or septuple time while guitarists would comp in another tempo altogether that s a lot of intricate shit we were working off this one chord davis remarked from lucas perspective this kind of structured improvisation resulted in significant interplay between rhythm section and allowed band to improvise a lot more than just notes that were being played in solos we were improvising entire song as we went along like pangaea and dark magus two other albums showcasing septet agharta revealed what amiri baraka described as davis affinity for minimalism he abandoned melodic and harmonic conventions in favor of riffs cross rhythms and funk grooves as a backdrop for soloists to improvise throughout davis had preferred understated compositions throughout his career but by mid 1970s he showed a deeper embrace of rhythm inspired by afrocentric politics when mtume and cosey joined band his live music lost most of its european sensibilities and settled down into a deep african thing a deep african american groove emphasizing rhythm and drums rather than individual solos davis said although he did not completely reject melody we ain t in africa and we don t play just chants there s some theory under what we do simon reynolds who categorized agharta as a jazz rock record wrote in wire that music offered a drastic intensification of rock s three most radical aspects space timbre and groove in martha bayles opinion it drew from jazz only in its element of free improvisation and from rock only in its use of electronics and ear bleeding volume album also showcased davis avant garde impulses and exploration of ambient sounds according to greg tate septet created a pan ethnic web of avant garde music while sputnikmusic s hernan m campbell said they explored progressive ambiences particularly within record s second half phil alexander from mojo characterized agharta as both ambient yet thrashing melodic yet coruscating and suggestive of karlheinz stockhausen s electronic experiments during concert davis directed approximately 50 stops or breaks to band particularly rhythm section by gesturing with his head or hand these stops served as dramatic turning points in tension release structure of performances changing their tempo and allowing band to alternate between quiet passages and intense climaxes he also interjected performances with drone washes from his yamaha organ achieving a strange nearly perverse presence that mikal gilmore believed defined temper of music lucas said davis applied a feel for dynamics he had developed earlier in his career playing jazz but with a greater array of contrasts including atonal dissonant chords and his own bebop trumpet playing set against group s funk rhythms extreme textures and extreme volume lucas explained were as much part of palette as contrasting chord and rhythmic structures being equipped like a full rock band we sometimes literally blew walls out during tatu and agharta prelude segments davis abruptly stopped and started septet several times to shift tempos by playing a dissonant cacophonous organ figure giving cosey space to generate eccentric psychedelic figures and effects main theme for tatu had been played at a slower tempo when cosey first joined band but they played it faster as their rapport grew especially by time of japanese tour cosey credited davis with having ability to transmit thoughts and ideas to soloists with his playing right thumb pete cosey used an ems synthi a pictured atop a keyboard as an effects unit for his improvisations rhythmic direction of music was occasionally interrupted by densely layered percussive and electronic effects including repeated whirring and grinding sounds cosey generated these sounds by running his guitar through a ring modulator and an ems synthi a latter device was an early synthesizer with knobs and buttons but no keyboard making it useful for producing abstract noises rather than exact pitches and melodies he used it to suggest a certain soundscape during each performance whether we were in space or underwater or a group of africans playing just different soundscapes onstage he also had a table set up holding a mbira claves agogo bells and several other hand percussion instruments which he played or struck with a mallet to indicate a different break or stop i would hit them just like they do at boxing fights cosey recalled his synthesizer sometimes interacted with experimental sounds mtume was able to generate from his drum machine as during ife segment davis gave instrument to mtume after receiving it from yamaha japanese tour s sponsor and told him see what you can do with it rather than use it to create rhythms mtume processed drum machine through several different pedals and phase shifters such as mu tron bi phase creating a sound he said was total tapestry unlike davis previous recordings cadenzas throughout agharta were mostly played by fortune and cosey fortune alternated between soprano and alto saxophones and flute performing with a substance and structure gilmore believed was very much indebted to john coltrane during his a love supreme 1965 period he performed his longest alto saxophone solo on right off which opened record s second disc in a propulsive segment gilmore said flies by like a train ride in a dream where scenes flash past window in a fascinating and dream cosey played a guild s 100 electric guitar and heavily employed chromaticism dissonance and feedback in his improvisations on agharta he alternated between several effects pedals set up underneath his table of percussion instruments including a fuzzbox for distorting guitar sounds and two different wah wah pedals he used during solos or when playing more mellow tones cosey often arranged his guitar strings in different places on fretboard and never played in standard tuning using at least 36 different tuning systems each of which altered style and sound of his playing according to from premier guitar his experimental guitar playing was rooted in blues and displayed a sense of phrasing that was aggressive and blistering yet somehow also restrained particularly in his control of feedback davis had enlisted cosey to provide his music with sounds from electric blues and jimi hendrix whose use of distortion and e flat tuning was shared by cosey according to charles shaar murray he evoked guitarist s free jazz inspired solos while lucas performed in manner of hendrix s more lyrical rhythm and blues songs cosey s guitar was separated to left channel and lucas to right on agharta jazz scholar stuart nicholson wrote that davis utilized his guitarists in a way which realized waves of harmonic distortion hendrix had explored in his own music in murray s view album invoked his influence on trumpeter more explicitly than any other of his records nicholson considered it to be closest approximation to music they could have recorded together davis veered from succinct and expressive solos to unsentimental wails which suggested he was still mourning hendrix s 1970 death murray surmised that year davis had started playing with a wah wah pedal affixed to his trumpet in order to emulate register hendrix achieved on his guitar pedal created what penguin guide to jazz 2006 described as surges and in a harmonically static line allowing miles to build huge melismatic variations on a single note davis eventually developed what philip freeman called a new tone wiggly shimmering ribbons of sound that are heard on agharta where his wah wah processed solos often sounded frantic and melancholic like twisted streams of raw pain davis played his trumpet sparsely throughout concert often sounding obscured by rhythm section his presence on agharta reflected what john szwed called feel and shape of a musician s late work an music that precedes its creator s death drawing on theodor w adorno s commentary of ludwig van beethoven s late works szwed said disappearance of musician into work is a bow to mortality it was as if miles were testifying to all that he had been witness to for past thirty years both terrifying and joyful after lucas first and only solo of show climaxed ife segment davis introduced wili for dave with a few organ chords culminating in cosey s final solo and a trumpet passage by davis which paul tingen characterized as plaintive and introspective according to him live music shows typically developed toward reaching a final climax but davis concerts often dissolved into entropy on agharta tingen observed a deep sadness hanging over music as energy of wili for dave piece slowly drained away to record s fade out title and packaging aghartas title was proposed by cbs sony as a reference to subterranean utopian city city s legend was one of several eastern versions of hollow earth theory proposing that an ancient high culture originally lived on earth s surface but was forced to flee below because of some political or geological crisis myth depicted city as a divine source of power claiming that its inhabitants were highly spiritual advanced beings who would save earth from materialism and destructive technology after a cataclysmic event it was first conceived by 19th century french thinker louis as a land ruled by an ethiopian ruler alexandre saint yves d later described it as drowning in celestial all visible distinctions of race in a single chromatic of light and sound singularly removed from usual notions of perspective and acoustics album s artwork was designed by japanese artist tadanori yokoo who had been creating prints on themes of agharta and mythical kingdom of shambhala year before festival hall concert his design for carlos santana s lotus 1974 featured such themes in early 1970s yokoo had found his growing popularity in japan distracting and moved to united states where he was able to get more of his work published after returning to japan he received a phone call from davis who had seen his art and wanted him to create a cover for agharta before designing cover yokoo listened to a preliminary tape of concert meditated and reflected on his reading of raymond w bernard s 1969 book hollow earth bernard had written that city existed in a large cavern in center of earth while yokoo said he believed agharta could be down there under sea like atlantis or even hidden in jungle like lost city of el dorado he also drew on elements from other eastern subterranean myths and afrofuturism in his design critics who eventually saw album s packaging thought he had been inspired instead by psychedelic drugs popular at time thumb left back cover design by tadanori yokoo who was inspired by legendary city of front cover depicted an advanced civilization with a vast landscape of skyscrapers and red sunburst like flames rising out of cityscape as representations of agharta s power yokoo used a combination of collage airbrushing and painting techniques as he had with his previous work along with postcards collected from his trips to tahiti and new york city cityscape on front cover was taken from one of his postcards back cover showed city submerged in water embedded in coral reefs and hovered over by a diver fish and a squid ascending from city according to graphic designers storm thorgerson and aubrey powell yokoo depicted groups of jellyfish coral reefs and brightly colored fish to suggest an association between agharta and atlantis foreground of back cover s illustration featured a reptilian creature cultural studies researcher dagmar buchwald interpreted this image as an allusion to similar ideas about lemuria this mythological continent supposedly existed during earth s prehistory and was inhabited by an advanced civilization later forced under earth s surface after its homeland was destroyed by a great flood a ufo was depicted on back cover flying in a spotlight over agharta while album s inside packaging featured images of winged superhuman beings known as agharta supermen who guarded city s entrances and secret tunnels an inscription in lp s gatefold sleeve explained connection between ufo and agharta supermen during various periods in history supermen of agharta came to surface of earth to teach human race how to live together in peace and save us from wars catastrophe and destruction apparent sighting of several flying saucers soon after bombing of hiroshima may represent one visitation aghartas 1976 north american release had different artwork designed by john berg art director from davis u s label columbia records in its liner notes an inscription said record should be listened to at highest possible volume and arrangements were credited to davis after it was released macero received a complaint from columbia s accounting department about trumpeter being compensated 2 500 per arrangement arguing that none of music sounded as if it had been arranged contemporary reception agharta was originally panned by majority of professional critics according to robert christgau it became most widely criticized of davis double albums in 1970s strangers dave segal claimed it was one of most divisive records ever challenging both critics and artist s core audience much in same way lou reed s metal machine music album had in 1975 reviewing for new york times in 1976 robert palmer said agharta is marred by long stretches of sloppy one chord jams disjointed sounds and a banal quality clearly rendered by impeccable japanese engineering he complained that davis use of wah wah pedal inhibited his ability to phrase notes and that septet sounded poor by rock standards particularly cosey whose guitar whined and rumbled like a noisy machine shop and relegated lucas to background riffs jazz forum critic andrzej trzaskowski wrote that fortune seemed to be only jazz musician on record finding his solos often flawless while disparaging performances of davis lucas and cosey whose guitar and synthesizer effects he found pointlessly brutal in trzaskowski s opinion individual segments did not cohere as a whole and were further hampered by cliched rock phraseology of guitarists who he said lacked wit harmony and taste jazz critic ian carr thought davis trumpet sounded fatigued dejected and out of place with band s intense rhythms and monotonously noisy guitars in general he deemed music too non western in sense of too much rhythm and not enough structure gary giddins penned an angrily dismissive review of agharta for village voice in which he charged davis with failing to assert his musical presence on terribly sad record a few days after it was published he was sent a package full of large cotton swabs industrial strength scouring pads and a card that read next time you review miles davis clean out your head agharta received some positive contemporary reviews nathan cobb from boston globe appraised record favorably in 1976 calling it a kind of firestorm for 70s with a positively cosmic rhythmic foundation in conclusion he regarded davis as one who leads others through unknown waters of electronic jazz rock in downbeat gilmore said band performed best on breakneck segments opening each of two discs where cosey s ferocious improvisations achieved a staggering emotional dimension lacking on slower passages which he felt were redeemed by davis elegiac trumpet playing he rated album four stars out of a possible five lester bangs found agharta too difficult to definitively assess but nonetheless more fascinating than most other music being released at time he wrote in phonograph record that davis new music was product of his heart s once luminous emotional capacities having been shattered by great perhaps unbearable suffering but that soul beyond it could never be destroyed and interestingly almost glows uniquely brighter in its own dark coldness and that that which is all that is left is merely universe concert itself was received enthusiastically by osaka audience i had no idea what they were going to do henderson recalled they gave us a standing ovation that was almost as long as concert music translated poorly to commercial marketplace however ill suited for fm airplay dancing or passive listening in nicholson s words album s only appearance on a popular music chart was in april 1976 on american billboard chart where it spent five weeks and reached a peak position of 168 legacy and influence thumb left a czech jazz group at prague s agharta jazz centrum in 2008 by time of second osaka concert captured on pangaea band s level of energy had diminished significantly and davis sounded particularly absent as mtume recounted he became ill in evening and you can hear difference in energy upon returning from japan trumpeter fell ill again and was hospitalized for three months he held a few more shows and studio sessions with band but his health worsened their last show on september 5 1975 in central park ended abruptly when davis left stage and began to cry in pain he retired soon after citing physical spiritual and creative exhaustion and lived as a recluse for next several years often struggling with bouts of depression and further medical treatment before resuming his recording career in 1980 he abandoned direction he had pursued in 1970s instead playing a style of fusion far more melodic and accessible to audiences until his death in 1991 day after he died prague s wenceslas square saw opening of agharta jazz centrum a small jazz club named after album hosting nightly performances and an annual festival played by local and international acts agharta has undergone positive critical reassessment beginning in 1980 when davis returned to jazz scene of albums documenting his 1973 75 band it was considered by many critics to be best in retrospect for giddins it had become one of his favorite albums from trumpeter s electric period as he reevaluated its elements of drama relentless tension and what he considered best performances of fortune and cosey s careers there really is not a moment when music fails to reflect ministrations of sorcerer himself he later said davis biographer jack chambers believed it proved far better than most of his other electric albums maiysha and jack johnson segments in particular magically brought into focus musical forces over which many thought davis had lost control in christgau s record guide rock albums of seventies 1981 christgau saw it as his finest music since jack johnson an angry dissociated funky record built on septet s virtuosic performance particularly foster s guileless show of chops and fortune s performance which he deemed best woodwind playing on a davis album from this decade reflecting on trumpeter s 1970s concert recordings in rolling stone album guide 1992 j d considine contended that aghartas alternately audacious poetic hypnotic and abrasive music had endured passage of time best although davis use of wah wah was frequently dismissed in past as a failed experiment richard cook and brian morton believed effects pedal had in fact helped davis achieve remarkably adventurous playing on agharta cook named it among davis best works and culmination of music he had begun to explore on bitches brew 1970 while possessing an epic sound and scope agharta was also a great band record in his opinion even though davis contributed only telling details he still cued exceptional performances from his men in tingen s mind it represented high plateau of davis electric explorations because he had given band leeway for constant interplay music exhibited an organic and fluid quality with a greater variety of textures rhythms timbres and moods than dark magus henry kaiser called it best ensemble performance of jazz s electric era and steve writing in musichound jazz 1998 credited davis with conducting album s heroes to sculpt moments of shattering beauty and soul rending vehemence despite being one of davis lesser known records agharta belonged to a period in his career that influenced artists in british jazz new wave and punk rock including guitarists robert quine and tom verlaine it inspired a generation of musicians to focus on cathartic playing rather than precise instrumentation and composition quine was particularly fascinated by cosey s electric guitar sounds bangs who attended quine s performance with in 1977 claimed he steals from agharta and makes it work other writers later lauded quality and originality of cosey s playing on album viewing it as a standard for guitar mastery and contrast jazz critic bill milkowski credited his style for spawning an entire school of sick guitar playing and said combination of fortune s acerbic sax lines atop foster henderson and lucas syncopated grooves were 10 years ahead of steve coleman and greg s m base experiments tingen found cosey s solos amazingly revealing and ahead of their time when heard decades later sometimes growling scurrying around all corners like a caged tiger sometimes soaring like a bird sometimes deliriously abstract sometimes elegantly melodic and tender his electric guitar concept is one of most original to have been devised on instrument in christgau s opinion noises he produced on first track s second half comprise some of greatest free improvisations ever heard in a jazz rock context according to nicholson agharta and other jazz rock recordings such as emergency 1970 by tony williams lifetime suggested genre was progressing toward a whole new musical language a wholly independent genre quite apart from sound and conventions of anything that had gone before this development dwindled with commercialism of jazz in 1980s although agharta remained a pivotal and influential record through 1990s especially on artists in experimental rock genre it became one of favorite albums for english musician richard h kirk who recalled playing it often while working at chris watson s loft during their early years in band cabaret voltaire i can see how this album might have annoyed people but for me it was really nice grooves with improvisation and would open out and become more minimal kirk later told quietus along with on corner it was also a major influence on beastie boys 1994 album ill communication in 1998 composer and bandleader david sanford completed his dissertation on agharta as a doctoral student in composition at princeton university in it he argued that album demonstrated how jazz has utilized a variety of external influences to evolve or modernize itself in an interview several years later sanford said it was an important work that had gone to fringes of jazz and a place most other music has not explored since in all music guide to jazz 2002 thom jurek considered album inarguably greatest electric funk rock jazz record ever and declared there is simply nothing like agharta in canon of recorded music reissues album has been reissued several times in january 1991 columbia re released it in u s on cd format featuring a remaster tingen deemed inferior to original lp in sound and mix quality had cd been my first introduction i might never have liked album much he said sony later remastered agharta again as part of their davis reissue campaign and master sound series in japan with improved sound using super bit mapping this 1996 japanese cd edition restored nine additional minutes of atmospheric feedback percussion and synthesizer sounds to end of final track another remaster of album was engineered by mark wilder and maria triana at new york s battery studios it was made available in u s in 2009 when agharta was one of 52 albums re issued in mini lp replica sleeves as a part of miles davis complete columbia album collection a box set commissioned by sony legacy according to tingen this edition sounded like a woolen blanket has been lifted from previous cd clarifying especially cosey who had sounded muted in mix he still found it somewhat low on bass which he attributed to original master tapes lp version also didn t have a lot of bass but i always assumed this was due to lp cut with long album lengths grooves can hold less
