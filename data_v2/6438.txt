on approach to lisboa corner one of mortara s other brandmates juncadella tried to do same on outside line but he knocked his steering arm out of alignment from contact with an outside barrier at

exit of turn marciello narrowly avoided colliding with juncadella but vanthoor was unsighted and he understeered into right rear corner of juncadella s stalled car this created a road block that

rosenqvist and vanthoor s cars could not be repaired by their respective teams in macau due to heavy amount of structural damage and were withdrawn from race race director elected to commence event behind safety car because of damp track surface that was created from an earlier rain shower and this enabled drivers to acclimatise themselves with changing conditions safety car was withdrawn at end of lap two and cars were allowed to overtake mortara made a clean getaway from rolling start but he went slightly wide at reservoir bend corner and glanced a wall on outside of track leaving corner he was untroubled however as farfus could not get close enough to challenge mercedes amg farfus moved to inside lane but was rammed from behind by marciello at lisboa turn farfus consequently lost third to marciello farfus slowed hit an barrier and car s boot cover lifted marciello sustained damage to his car s radiator and he drove into pit lane at beginning of lap four to retire with smoke billowing from its front engel overtook yoshimoto and o young to move into sixth in meantime mortara increased his advantage upfront to six seconds as a consequence of contact between farfus and

grassi hit a barrier alongside circuit through solitude esses at high speed he stopped his car in mountain section of track soon after farfus made his pit stop under safety car for removal of his boot

began to draw closer to mortara however mortara led every lap and crossed start finish line to claim his sixth victory in macau by 0 618 seconds over closing frijns who could not overtake him engel was third farfus took fourth with his fellow brandmates mostert and wittmann fifth and sixth dumas finished seventh juncadella came eighth and yoshimoto was last of classified finishers attrition rate was moderate with nine of fourteen starters finishing event and safety car was on track for a total of six laps post race two days after race di grassi called for a global positioning system gps and accelerometer monitored automated warning system to caution drivers about an incident on track in response to sixteen car accident on qualification race s first lap proposal was heavily criticised on social media by drivers and motor racing fans who perceived proposal as a system to slow cars di grassi later explained that g force sensors and accelerometers can determine whether a car has crashed by gps positioning you can say if car is in front of you or behind you if car is in front of you there is a light on dash that glows yellow automatically without anyone having to press a button with same information we don t have same race director and marshals especially in base categories and amateur series so we need a system that reacts fast a system like that may have avoided a lot of crashes because first you don t need to look for flag if you re following someone it s much brighter if something is in front of you and then it does not react as a human component classification
