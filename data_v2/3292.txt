thumb common tern in flight thumb common tern in flight terns are seabirds in family laridae that have a worldwide distribution and are normally found near sea rivers or wetlands terns are treated as a subgroup of family laridae which includes gulls and skimmers and consist of eleven genera they are slender lightly built birds with long forked tails narrow wings long bills and relatively short legs most species are pale grey above and white below with a contrasting black cap to head but marsh terns inca tern and some noddies have dark plumage for at least part of year sexes are identical in appearance but young birds are readily distinguishable from adults terns have a non breeding plumage which usually involves a white forehead and much reduced black cap terns are birds of open habitats that typically breed in noisy colonies and lay their eggs on bare ground with little or no nest material marsh terns construct floating nests from vegetation in their wetland habitats and a few species build simple nests in trees on cliffs or in crevices white tern uniquely lays its single egg on a bare tree branch depending on species one to three eggs make up clutch most species feed on fish caught by diving from flight but marsh terns are insect eaters and some large terns will supplement their diet with small land vertebrates many terns are long distance migrants and arctic tern may see more daylight in a year than any other animal terns are long lived birds and are relatively free from natural predators and parasites most species are declining in numbers due directly or indirectly to human activities including habitat loss pollution disturbance and predation by introduced mammals chinese crested tern is in a critical situation and three other species are classed as endangered international agreements provide a measure of protection but adults and eggs of some species are still used for food in tropics eggs of two species are eaten in west indies because they are believed to have aphrodisiac properties taxonomy charadriiformes order of birds contains 18 coastal seabird and wader families within order terns form a lineage with gulls and less closely with skimmers skuas and early authors such as conrad gessner francis willughby and william turner did not clearly separate terns from gulls but linnaeus recognised distinction in his 1758 systema naturae placing gulls in genus larus and terns in sterna he gave sterna description rostrum awl shaped bill referring to long pointed bills typical of this group of birds a feature that distinguishes them from thicker billed gulls linnaeus 1758 p 84 jobling 2010 p 338 brookes 2006 p 1510 behaviour and morphology suggest that terns are more closely related to gulls than to skimmers or skuas and although charles lucien bonaparte created family sternidae for terns in 1838 for many years they were considered to be a subfamily of gull family laridae relationships between various tern species and between terns and other charadriiformes were formerly difficult to resolve because of a poor fossil record and misidentification of some finds gochfeld burger 1996 pp 624 645 following genetic research in early twenty first century terns were historically treated as a separate family sternidae most terns were formerly treated as belonging to one large genus sterna with just a few dark species placed in other genera in 1959 only noddies and inca tern were excluded from sterna a recent analysis of dna sequences supported splitting of sterna into several smaller genera one study of part of cytochrome b gene sequence found a close relationship between terns and a group of waders in suborder these results are in disagreement with other molecular and morphological studies and have been interpreted as showing either a large degree of molecular convergent evolution between terns and these waders or retention of an ancient genotype word stearn was used for these birds in old english as early as eighth century and appears in poem seafarer written in ninth century or earlier variants such as tearn occurred by eleventh century although older form lingered on in norfolk dialect for several centuries hume 1993 pp 12 13 as now term was used for inland black tern as well as marine species jobling 2010 p 365 lockwood 1984 pp 147 153 some authorities consider tearn and similar forms to be variants of stearn while others derive english words from scandinavian equivalents such as danish and norwegian or swedish and ultimately from old norse merriam webster 2014 linnaeus adopted stearn or sterna which naturalist william turner had used in 1544 as a latinisation of an english word presumably stern for black tern turner 1544 p 78 or a north germanic equivalent for his genus name sterna

atypical of family terns range in size from least tern at in length and weighing maehr kale 2005 p 111 olsen larsson 1995 p 136 to caspian tern at harrison 1988 p 368 olsen larsson 1995 p 25 they are longer billed lighter bodied and more streamlined than gulls and their long tails and long narrow wings give them an elegance in flight male and female plumages are identical although male can be 2 5 larger than female and often has a relatively larger bill sea terns have deeply forked tails and at least a shallow v is shown by all other species noddies genera anous procelsterna and gygis have unusual notched wedge shaped tails longest tail feathers being middle outer rather than central or outermost harrison 1988 pp 387 390 hutton drummond 2011 p 226 although their legs are short terns can run well they rarely swim despite having webbed feet usually landing on water only to bathe majority of sea terns have light grey or white body plumage as adults with a black cap to head legs and bill are various combinations of red orange yellow or black depending on species pale plumage is conspicuous from a distance at sea and may attract other birds to a good feeding area for these fish eating species when seen against sky white underparts also help to hide hunting bird from its intended prey inca tern has mainly dark plumage and three species that mainly eat insects black tern white winged tern and black bellied tern have black underparts in breeding season anous noddies have dark plumage with a pale head cap reason for their dark plumage is unknown but it has been suggested that in tropical areas where food resources are scarce less conspicuous colouration makes it harder for other noddies to detect a feeding bird plumage type especially head pattern is linked to phylogeny of terns and pale capped dark bodied noddies are believed to have diverged earlier than other genera from an ancestral white headed gull followed by partially black headed onychoprion and sternula groupings juvenile terns typically have brown or yellow tinged upperparts and feathers have dark edges that give plumage a scaly appearance they have dark bands on wings and short tails in most species subsequent moult does not start until after migration plumage then becoming more like adult but with some retained juvenile feathers and a white forehead with only a partial dark cap by second summer appearance is very like adult and full mature plumage is usually attained by third year after breeding terns moult into a winter plumage typically showing a white forehead heavily worn or aberrant plumages such as melanism and albinism are much rarer in terns than in gulls olsen larsson 1995 pp 6 9 voice terns have a wide repertoire of vocalisations for example common tern has a distinctive alarm kee yah also used as a warning to intruders and a shorter kyar given as an individual takes flight in response to a more serious threat this quietens usually noisy colony while its residents assess danger other calls include a down slurred keeur given when an adult is approaching nest with a fish and a kip uttered during social contact hume 1993 pp 68 75 parents and chicks can locate one another by call burton 1985 p 123 and siblings also recognise each other s vocalisations from about twelfth day after hatching which helps to keep brood together vocal differences reinforce species separation between closely related birds such as least and little terns and can help humans distinguish similar species such as common and arctic terns since flight calls are unique to each species constantine 2006 pp 73 77 distribution and habitat thumb black tern breeds on inland marshes terns have a worldwide distribution breeding on all continents including antarctica northernmost and southernmost breeders are arctic tern and antarctic tern respectively harrison 1988 pp 370 371 many terns breeding in temperate zones are long distance migrants and arctic tern probably sees more annual daylight than any other animal as it migrates from its northern breeding grounds to antarctic waters a return journey of more than a common tern that hatched in sweden and was found dead five months later on stewart island new zealand must have flown at least newton 2010 pp 150 151 actual flight distances are of course much greater than shortest possible route arctic terns from greenland were shown by radio geolocation to average on their annual migrations most terns breed on open sandy or rocky areas on coasts and islands yellow billed large billed and black fronted terns breed only on rivers and common least and little terns also sometimes use inland locations marsh terns trudeau s tern and some forster s terns nest in inland marshes black noddy and white tern nest above ground level on cliffs or in trees migratory terns move to coast after breeding and most species winter near land although some marine species like aleutian tern may wander far from land sooty tern is entirely oceanic when not breeding and healthy young birds are not seen on land for up to five years after fledging until they return to breed they lack waterproof plumage so they cannot rest on sea where they spend years prior to breeding is unknown behaviour breeding thumb left brown noddy nest on stump of casuarina equisetifolia terns are normally monogamous although trios or female female pairings have been observed in at least three species most terns breed annually and at same time of year but some tropical species may nest at intervals shorter than 12 months or asynchronously most terns become sexually mature when aged three although some small species may breed in their second year some large sea terns including sooty and bridled terns are four or older when they first breed terns normally breed in colonies and are site faithful if their habitat is sufficiently stable a few species nest in small or dispersed groups but most breed in colonies of up to a few hundred pairs often alongside other seabirds such as gulls or skimmers large tern species tend to form larger colonies which in case of sooty tern can contain up to two million pairs large species nest very close together and sit tightly making it difficult for aerial predators to land among them smaller species are less closely packed and mob intruders peruvian and damara terns have small dispersed colonies and rely on cryptic plumage of eggs and young for protection male selects a territory which he defends against conspecifics and re establishes a pair bond with his mate or attracts a new female if necessary courtship involves ritualised flight and ground displays and male often presents a fish to his partner most species have little or no nest laying eggs onto bare ground but trudeau s tern forster s tern and marsh terns construct floating nests from vegetation in their wetland habitats black and lesser noddies build nests of twigs feathers and excreta on tree branches and brown blue and grey noddies make rough platforms of grass and seaweed on cliff ledges in cavities or on other rocky surfaces watling 2003 pp 206 207 inca tern nests in crevices caves and disused burrows such as that of a humboldt penguin white tern is unique in that it lays its single egg on a bare tree branch tropical species usually lay just one egg but two or three is typical in cooler regions if there is an adequate food supply time taken to complete clutch varies but for temperate species incubation takes 21 28 days eggs of most gulls and terns are brown with dark splotches so they are difficult for predators to spot on beach precocial chicks fledge in about four weeks after hatching tropical species take longer because of poorer food supply both parents incubate eggs and feed chicks although female does more incubating and less fishing than her partner young birds migrate with adults terns are generally long lived birds with individuals typically returning for 7 10 breeding seasons maximum known ages include 34 for an arctic tern and 32 for a sooty although several other species are known to live in captivity for up to 20 years their greatest recorded ages are underestimates because birds can outlive their rings interbreeding between tern species is rare and involves closely related species when it occurs hybrids recorded include common tern with roseate sandwich with lesser crested and black with white winged olsen larsson 1995 p 10 feeding thumb an adult common tern bringing a sand eel to a juvenile most terns hunt fish by diving often hovering first and particular approach technique used can help to distinguish similar species at a distance hume pearson 1993 pp 54 55 sea terns often hunt in association with porpoises or predatory fish such as bluefish tuna or bonitos since these large marine animals drive prey to surface sooty terns feed at night as fish rise to surface and are believed to sleep on wing since they become waterlogged easily terns of several species will feed on invertebrates following plough or hunting on foot on mudflats marsh terns normally catch insects in air or pick them off surface of fresh water other species will sometimes use these techniques if opportunity arises svensson et al 2009 p 206 an individual tern s foraging efficiency increases with its age burger j gochfeld m laridae sternidae and in steele et al 2001 p 1469 1480 gull billed tern is an opportunist predator taking a wide variety of prey from marine freshwater and terrestrial habitats depending on what is available it will eat small crabs fish crayfish grasshoppers and other large insects lizards and amphibians warm blooded prey includes mice and eggs and chicks of other beach breeding birds least terns little terns and members of its own species may be victims greater crested tern will also occasionally catch unusual vertebrate species such as agamid lizards and green sea turtle hatchlings and follows trawlers for discards eyes of terns cannot accommodate under water so they rely on accurate sighting from air before they plunge dive like other seabirds that feed at surface or dive for food terns have red oil droplets in cones of their retinas birds that have to look through an air water interface have more deeply coloured carotenoid pigments in oil drops than other species varela f j palacios a g goldsmith t m color vision in birds in ziegler bischof 1993 pp 77 94 pigment also improves visual contrast and sharpens distance vision especially in hazy conditions sinclair 1985 pp 88 100 and helps terns to locate shoals of fish although it is uncertain whether they are sighting phytoplankton on which fish feed or other feeding birds lythgoe 1979 pp 180 183 red colouring reduces ultraviolet sensitivity which in any case is an adaptation more suited to terrestrial feeders like gulls and this protects eye from uv damage coles 2007 p 30 predators and parasites thumb left kleptoparasitic western gull chasing elegant tern inaccessibility of many tern colonies gave them a measure of protection from mammalian predators especially on islands but introduced species brought by humans can seriously affect breeding birds these can be predators such as foxes raccoons cats and rats or animals that destroy habitat including rabbits goats and pigs problems arise not only on formerly mammal free islands as in new zealand but also where an alien carnivore such as american mink in scotland presents an unfamiliar threat hume 1993 pp 112 119 adult terns may be hunted by owls and raptors and their chicks and eggs may be taken by herons crows or gulls less obvious nest predators include ruddy turnstones in arctic and gull billed terns in little tern colonies adults may be robbed of their catch by avian kleptoparasites such as frigatebirds skuas other terns or large gulls harrison 1988 pp 320 323 external parasites include chewing lice of genus feather lice and fleas such as ceratophyllus borealis rothschild clay 1953 p 82 130 lice are often host specific and closely related common and arctic terns carry quite different species rothschild clay 1953 p 135 internal parasites include crustacean reighardia sternae and tapeworms such as ligula intestinalis and members of genera diphyllobothrium and schistocephalus rothschild clay 1953 p 194 197 terns are normally free of blood parasites unlike gulls that often carry haemoproteus species an exception is brown noddy which sometimes harbours protozoa of that genus in 1961 common tern was first wild bird species identified as being infected with avian influenza h5n3 variant being found in an outbreak involving south african birds several species of terns have been implicated as carriers of west nile virus 2007 p 137 140 relationships with humans thumb roseate tern is trapped for food on its wintering grounds terns and their eggs have long been eaten by humans and island colonies were raided by sailors on long voyages since eggs or large chicks were an easily obtained source of protein eggs are still illegally harvested in southern europe and adults of wintering birds are taken as food in west africa and south america roseate tern is significantly affected by this hunting with adult survival 10 lower than would otherwise be expected in west indies eggs of roseate and sooty terns are believed to be aphrodisiacs and are disproportionately targeted by egg collectors tern skins and feathers have long been used for making items of clothing such as capes and hats and this became a large scale activity in second half of nineteenth century when it became fashionable to use feathers in this trend started in europe but soon spread to americas and australia white was preferred colour and sometimes wings or entire birds were used terns have sometimes benefited from human activities following plough or fishing boats for easy food supplies although some birds get trapped in nets or swallow plastic fishermen looked for feeding tern flocks since birds could lead them to fish shoals overfishing of small fish such as sand eels can lead to steep declines in colonies relying on these prey items more generally loss or disruption to tern colonies caused by human activities has caused declines in many species pollution has been a problem in some areas and in 1960s and 1970s ddt caused egg loss through thinning of shells in 1980s caused severe declines in great lakes area of us because of their sensitivity to pollutants terns are sometimes used as indicators of contamination levels habitat enhancements used to increase breeding success of terns include floating nest platforms for black common and caspian terns and artificial islands created for a number of different species more specialised interventions include providing nest boxes for roseate terns which normally nest in shelter of vegetation and using artificial eelgrass mats to encourage common terns to nest in areas not vulnerable to flooding conservation status thumb left black bellied tern is endangered by human activities a number of terns face serious threats and chinese crested tern is classed as critically endangered by birdlife international it has a population of fewer than 50 birds and a breeding range of just 9 km2 3 5 mi2 it is declining due to egg collection human disturbance and loss of coastal wetlands in china three other species are categorised as endangered with declining populations of less than 10 000 birds south asian black bellied tern is threatened by habitat loss egg collecting for food pollution and predation in new zealand black fronted tern is facing a rapid fall in numbers due to predation by introduced mammals and australian magpies disturbance by cattle and sheep and by human activities is also a factor peruvian tern was initially damaged by collapse of anchoveta stocks in 1972 but breeding colonies have subsequently been lost due to building disturbance and pollution in their coastal wetlands australasian fairy tern is described as vulnerable disturbance by humans dogs and vehicles predation by introduced species and inappropriate water level management in south australia are main reasons for its decline five species are near threatened indicating less severe concerns or only potential vulnerability elegant tern is so categorised because 95 of population breeds on one island isla rasa in gulf of california and kerguelen tern has a population of less than 5 000 adults breeding on small and often stormy pacific islands three species inca damara and river terns are expected to decline in future due to habitat loss and disturbance some tern subspecies are endangered including california least tern and easter island race of grey noddy most tern species are declining in numbers due to loss or disturbance of breeding habitat pollution and increased predation gull populations have increased over last century because of reduced persecution and availability of food from human activities and terns have been forced out of many traditional nesting areas by larger birds a few species are defying trend and showing local increases including arctic tern in scandinavia forster s tern around great lakes sandwich tern in eastern north america and its yellow billed subspecies cayenne tern in caribbean terns are protected by international legislation such as agreement on conservation of african eurasian migratory waterbirds aewa and us canada migratory bird treaty act of 1918 parties to awea agreement are required to engage in a wide range of conservation strategies described in a detailed action plan plan is intended to address key issues such as species and habitat conservation management of human activities research education and implementation
