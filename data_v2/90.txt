process and to find a way to get such marginal material to sympathetic readers she took courses in offset printing in bedford stuyvesant brooklyn and bought an printing press for her loft raw books in 1978 she founded raw books graphics a name settled on in part because of its small operation feel and part because it was reminiscent of mad magazine mouly worked from an aesthetic inspired in part by russian constructivists who brought a design sense to everyday objects raw books began by publishing postcards and prints by artists such as underground cartoonist bill griffith and dutch cartoonist joost swarte more ambitious projects included art objects such as zippy scope a cardboard device with to watch a comic strip rolled up on a film spool featuring s character zippy pinhead some projects were more commercial such as annual streets of soho map and guide whose advertising revenue financed much of raw books having in this way honed her publishing skills mouly s ambition turned to magazine publication spiegelman was at first reluctant jaded from his experience at arcade but agreed on new year s eve 1979 to co edit magazine was to provide an outlet for kinds of comics that had difficulty finding a publisher in us in particular younger cartoonists who fit neither superhero nor underground mold and european cartoonists who did not fit sex and sci fi appetites of heavy metal fans in midst of a commercial and artistic fallow period in american comics industry lavishly printed first issue of raw appeared in july 1980 its production values resulted in a 3 50 cover price

mccay and an excerpt from manhattan by contemporary french cartoonist jacques tardi to comics academic jeet heer raw was a singular mixture of visual diversity and thematic unity each issue contained a broad variety of styles linked by a common theme be it urban despair suicide or a vision of america through foreign eyes best known work to run in raw was a serialization of spiegelman s graphic novel maus which ran as an insert for duration of magazine from december 1980 second issue mouly s approach was hands on and she gave great attention to every step of printing process physicality of raw was evident in each issue tipped in plates bubblegum cards and torn covers were part of aesthetic of magazine accomplished by hand by mouly spiegelman and friends at gatherings after printing of a new issue mouly was also hands on when dealing with contributors suggesting ideas and changes an approach anathema to editor adverse underground spirit but artists welcomed her input as in end she did not interfere with their autonomy raw had a strong critical reception and also sold surprisingly well it was not without its critics who charged it with being highbrow and elitist or claimed it to be a one man spiegelman show pioneer underground cartoonist robert crumb responded in 1981 with magazine weirdo intended to remain free of editorial intrusion and stay true to comics lowbrow roots raw books published ten one shot books throughout 1980s by cartoonists such as gary panter sue coe and jerry moriarty mouly brought a similar production sensibility to these books to what she brought to raw cover to panter s jimbo was corrugated cardboard pasted with stickers of book s main character by end of decade pantheon books had begun co publishing raw books output and penguin books had picked up publishing of raw itself three issues of second volume of raw came in a smaller longer format with a changed emphasis on narrative rather than graphics mouly divided her time between publishing and parenthood following birth of daughter nadja in 1987 researching books for sue coe motivated her to take up science courses at hunter college perhaps toward a neuroscience degree she abandoned this plan in 1991 when she gave birth to son dashiell in 1991 mouly and spiegelman published final issue of raw which was no longer a small hands on operation nor was it something they still thought necessary as artists then had a range of publishing outlets that had not existed when raw first saw light of day new yorker tina brown became editor of new yorker magazine in 1992 and was intent on changing it from stolid conservative image left it by william shawn s long editorship her cover choices provoked controversy in particular one by spiegelman for 1993 valentine s day issue of a hasidic man kissing an african american woman writer lawrence weschler recommended brown consider mouly for art editor position mouly and brown met following march mouly had reservations about magazine s reputation for and brown s politics but was taken with brown on a personal level whom she described as charismatic quick witted full of energy mouly proposed magazine return to its roots by having artists as featured contributors an increase in visuals in magazine such as photographs and more illustrations and covers in topical style they had had under magazine s founder harold ross brown
