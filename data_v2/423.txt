canadian heraldry is cultural tradition and style of coats of arms and other heraldic achievements in both modern and historic canada it includes national provincial and civic arms noble and personal arms ecclesiastical heraldry heraldic displays as corporate logos and canadian heraldic descriptions derived mainly from heraldic traditions in france and united kingdom canadian heraldry also incorporates distinctly canadian symbols especially native flora and fauna references to first nations and other aboriginal peoples of canada and uniquely canadian elements such as canadian pale derived from canadian flag a unique system of cadency is used for daughters inheriting arms and a special symbol for united empire loyalists in 1988 governance of both personal and corporate heraldry in canada was from heraldic authorities in england and scotland with formation of canadian heraldic authority which now has exclusive jurisdiction over granting awards of arms in canada coats of arms are used throughout canada by all levels of government in many cases including royal insignia as a mark of authority as in recently granted arms of house of commons and senate and of parliament as a combined body use of armorial bearings is not limited to governmental bodies all citizens of canada have right to petition for an award of arms as do other entities including businesses and religious institutions granting of arms is regarded as an honour from queen of canada via her viceroy governor general of canada and thus are bestowed only on those whom chief herald has deemed worthy of receiving a grant of arms history before arrival of europeans aboriginal peoples of canada used symbolic artwork to denote their allegiance to a particular clan or sodalities and to show legendary and religious themes for west coast peoples this would be done with carvings on totem poles carvings integrated into longhouses and smaller wooden objects like boxes masks and canoes for plains people plains hide painting tradition painted images onto tipis shields and other animal hide objects history of european style heraldry in canada began with raising of royal arms of france modern by french explorer jacques cartier in 1534 when he landed on canadian soil at what is now known as gaspe peninsula from beginning of settlement of canada until treaty of paris in 1763 armorial bearings were largely either brought from france or awarded by french crown a notable exception is coat of arms of nova scotia awarded in 1625 by charles i making it oldest coat of arms in commonwealth outside united kingdom in use until 1868 when it was replaced by a new achievement original was later rediscovered and replaced 1868 version in 1929 present day coat of arms of newfoundland and labrador was granted to a private company shortly after that of nova scotia although it did not enter use as region s arms until 1920s coat of arms of hudson s bay company was first used in 1671 although no record of original grant exists and it was not registered with college of arms in london until 1921 and has been in continual use with minor cosmetic changes to official depiction ever since upon ratification of treaty of paris british crown confirmed french awards of arms between 1763 and 1867 year of canadian confederation there is little evidence of much heraldic activity after confederation however heraldry in canada became more widespread including grants of arms to provinces various educational institutions municipalities and individuals in immediate post confederation period arms were granted to new brunswick nova scotia ontario and quebec although not to country as a whole in period between treaty of paris and confederation arms of united kingdom had served as emblem of authority within canada from 1763 until 1988 heraldry in canada was under authority of college of arms in london and court of lord lyon in edinburgh in late 1980s queen issued letters patent creating canadian heraldic authority modern heraldry official before creation of canadian heraldic authority canadians wishing to obtain a legally granted coat of arms had to apply to one of two heraldic offices in united kingdom either college of arms in london or if of scottish descent court of lord lyon in edinburgh this process was quite lengthy and costly in addition heralds in britain could sometimes be unfamiliar with canadian history and symbols in time many canadians with an interest in heraldry began calling for an office that would offer armorial bearings designed by and for canadians as early as 1967 plans were reportedly in works to transfer overview of heraldry from college of arms in uk to canada push for a wholly canadian heraldic system came largely from heraldry society of canada now royal heraldry society of canada almost from its inception though it was not seen as a priority by successive national governments in 1986 vicki huntington a politician from british columbia forwarded a brief written by royal heraldry society of canada calling for creation of canadian heraldic authority to a staff member in then secretary of state david crombie s office mr crombie had his department organise a meeting in ottawa following year to which many national and international heraldic experts were invited meeting concluded with a strong recommendation to government that an authority be created two years later on 4 june 1988 then governor general jeanne sauve authorised creation of canadian heraldic authority made possible by letters patent signed by queen elizabeth ii on advice of her canadian privy council and presented by her son prince edward as a result canada became first commonwealth realm outside united kingdom to have its own heraldic authority canada also provides full equality to women in terms of inheriting and transmitting arms additionally all armigers within canada may file for trademark protection of their grant of arms under trade marks act state and national royal arms of canada are official coat of arms of canadian monarch and thus also of canada they incorporate many distinctive canadian elements such as maple leaves and reference to french royal arms in fourth quarter which replace or add to those derived from british arms are used as a mark of authority by various government agencies and representatives including prime minister and cabinet speaker of house of commons most courts including supreme court and formerly parliament and on cover of canadian passports since 1962 a banner of arms defaced with a variant of queen s cypher has formed royal standard of canada for use by canadian sovereign personal flag of governor general has featured crest of arms of canada on a blue background since 1981 on 15 february 2008 house of commons was granted its own heraldic symbol following a request by commons speaker peter milliken to canadian heraldic authority new symbol for parliament is a badge of escutcheon in arms of canada superimposed on mace used by house of commons as a symbol of its authority derived from crown senate was granted a similar badge on 15 april 2008 using its own mace parliament as a whole has been granted right to use escutcheon of arms of canada superimposed over maces of commons and senate in saltire in june 2008 mp pat martin introduced a motion into house of commons calling on government to amend coat of arms to incorporate symbols representing canada s first nations inuit and metis peoples provincial in much same way that there is a national coat of arms each province and territory possesses its own unique arms saskatchewan s is known formally as her majesty s arms in right of saskatchewan year after confederation queen victoria issued royal warrants assigning arms to canada s original four provinces quebec ontario nova scotia and new brunswick each provincial coat of arms includes specific local symbolism most also include symbolism derived from coats of arms of united kingdom france or both since 1868 each province and territory within canada has been granted arms through warrants either from monarch directly or from governor general or has assumed them through other means apart from newfoundland and labrador each province and territory bears at least some elements from its coat of arms upon its flag flags of british columbia new brunswick nova scotia and prince edward island are banners of provincial arms while alberta manitoba ontario saskatchewan northwest territories and yukon each have shield of local coat of arms on their flags with other design elements flag of nunavut uses some elements from its coat of arms along with other symbols and colours shield of arms of each province on a blue background and circled with ten gold maple leaves whole surmounted by a crown forms main element of flag of lieutenant governor of that province exceptions are nova scotia which uses union flag defaced with shield of nova scotia surrounded by green maple leaves and quebec which uses shield on a white circle with provincial motto inscribed below municipal use of armorial bearings among canadian cities is inconsistent because many of them have been assumed and brought into force by local governmental authorities rather than granted from crown many municipal coats of arms either awarded or confirmed by canadian heraldic authority may be found within public register of arms though online version of register is not complete personal in canada every citizen has right to petition crown for a grant of arms canadians who have been appointed to order of canada are automatically entitled to receive an award of arms including ribbon of order or should they already be armigerous to encircle their extant arms with ribbon amongst others all members of privy council are entitled to supporters in their arms as are speakers of house of commons and senate companions of order of canada commanders of orders of military merit merit of police forces and of royal victorian order unique canadian elements and practices aboriginal and first nations symbolism due to history of canada heraldry in country has incorporated aboriginal and first nations symbols and elements coat of arms of nunavut for example includes elements such as an inukshuk a and an igloo all of which are references to inuit peoples who live in area while arms of canadian heraldic authority include ravens a first nations symbol of creation and transformation in addition some canadians choose to bear their arms on a roundel rather than a shield a reference to a drumhead an example is coat of arms of nunavut cadency in many systems of heraldry arms of each living person must be unique english heraldry has used armorial variants to distinguish arms of brothers from their father s arms and from each other since 13th century this is now normally done by system of marks or brisures set up by early tudor herald john writhe canada adds a unique series of brisures for use by female children who inherit arms as in other heraldic systems these cadency marks are not always used in any case when heir succeeds in canada this is normally first child whether male or female according to strict primogeniture however grantee may choose another person as heir mark of cadency is removed and heir uses plain coat of arms brisures alt

and divisions of field canadian pale a pale division amounting to half entire field derived from canadian flag is widely used in canadian heraldry while canadian fess a similar horizontal division has been used once term erable referring to maple leaves is often used in canadian arms for example as a tressure erable in arms of monarchist league of canada coronets erable in arms of sudbury and canada s national history society and as a partition much like engrailed or canadian animals and birds both real and fantastical have also been widely used in arms including mythical raven bears in arms of canadian heraldic authority status of women in both english and scottish systems of heraldry from which canadian draws many of its practices a woman does not inherit or transmit arms unless she is an heraldic heiress that is a daughter of an armiger who has no sons in canadian heraldry by contrast women may inherit arms on an equal basis with their brothers if any women in canada may also transmit their arms to their heirs regardless of gender this system of equality for men and women is a result of provisions in canadian charter of rights and freedoms which guarantee among other things freedom from discrimination under law on basis of sex united empire loyalists those who are descended from citizens loyal to british crown who fled united states during and shortly after revolution are known in canada as united empire loyalists and are entitled to use of special coronets within their arms if arms are granted to them there are two versions of loyalist coronet civil which is made up of alternating oak and maple leaves and military made up of maple leaves alternating with crossed swords latter is reserved for use by families of those who served in british military during revolution proof of loyalist heritage must be provided to canadian heraldic authority before permission is granted to use coronet in arms unlike common use of coronets in heraldry loyalist coronet denotes no rank of nobility or royalty but instead alludes to ancestral allegiance helmets in canadian heraldry helmets play little role and are not blazoned as such can display their helm in whatever style they choose one notable example of a non traditional helmet used in canadian heraldry is arms of julie payette governor general of canada which bears an astronaut s helmet as helm
