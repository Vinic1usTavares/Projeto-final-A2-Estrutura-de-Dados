qualifying and maintained his start line advantage heading into first corner he kept lead through mandatory pit stops for change into a second car until he aggressively clipped a kerb on 22nd lap and retired with a broken rear left suspension that allowed bird into lead but he was challenged by jaguar s mitch evans who had made a pit stop one lap later and thus had more electrical energy with four laps left but he could not get ahead evans was then passed by di grassi and lotterer in final laps as his energy depleted and bird held off di grassi to take his second victory of season and seventh of his career result allowed jean eric vergne of techeetah to retain his lead in drivers championship but his points advantage was reduced to eighteen as bird s victory put him ahead of rosenqvist e dams renault driver sebastien buemi maintained fourth and di grassi s teammate daniel abt moved into top five after coming fourth techeetah extended their advantage in teams championship to thirty eight points over virgin mahindra scored no points and fell to third with five races left in season background preview coming into race from punta del este four weeks earlier techeetah driver jean

motorsport federation internationale de l automobile fia abolished minimum pit stop time at santiago eprix three races ago techeetah and dragon were fined for modifying their seat felts and andre lotterer techeetah clipped one of his mechanics in mexico these events prompted fia to hand all teams two cameras to aid stewards in analysing footage after race and were instructed to install them above second car of their respective drivers and be positioned in an unobstructed area of garage effective from rome eprix jean todt fia president reiterated his position that responsibility of ensuring safe pit stops laid solely with teams and drivers and revealed that decision to discard minimum pit stop time was made following two years of research if you want to try and save time and to be before you stop or to buckle after you have started you will be reported to stewards to make some strong decisions but if you follow rules and procedure i feel that there is no problem of safety i hope that every driver and every team will be responsible and we shouldn t have any problems preparations left thumb upright virginia raggi pictured in 2016 was instrumental in getting rome onto formula e calendar after city s previous administration abandoned plan plans for a formula e race around streets of italian capital of rome were discussed on 1 december 2012 by todt and series founder and ceo alejandro agag with then mayor gianni they agreed to hold a race in city as part of 2014 15 season on 1 october 2013 however these plans changed when initial season calendar was released dropping rome race with hong kong a new administration had been elected in intervening period of time and it decided against taking further action in restoring eprix to calendar but project was revitalised when in november 2016 rome s councillor for sports daniele told news agency nazionale stampa that recently elected administration of virginia raggi was in process of planning for major events slated for 2017 and 2018 raggi maintained written correspondence with fia concerning restoration of rome to formula e calendar after a meeting of councillors at rome city hall agag met raggi and a congregation of city officials in february 2017 to discuss a series of requests and evaluated a potential circuit group held another meeting a few weeks later for further negotiation two months later on 20 april proposal for a motor race on streets of rome was put forward to authorities from local assembly who voted unanimously in favour to approve permits to enable racing in city s eur residential and business district for next five years eprix was added to fia s provisional 2017 18 season calendar on 19 june and was officially confirmed as part of championship by fia world motor sport council three months later it was seventh of twelve scheduled single seater electric car rounds of 2017 18 season and took place at circuito cittadino dell eur street circuit on 18 april 2018

line was positioned near marconi obelisk circuit negotiated past major city buildings such as rome convection center and palazzo dei construction of track began on 3 april eleven days before eprix and was completed on 12 april it was dismantled two days after race circuit received a mixed response lucas di grassi audi voiced his dislike of chicane while nick heidfeld mahindra expressed his belief that chicane would be more challenging than it appeared nico prost e dams renault stated his feeling that turns four and five would provide a great amount of challenge and it reminded him of montreal street circuit however several drivers raised concerns over position of starting grid di grassi argued it should have been placed after turn two while heidfeld doubted that moving start line would make any significant difference report practice and qualifying two practice sessions both on saturday morning were held before late afternoon race first session ran for 45 minutes and second lasted half an hour a half an hour untimed shakedown session was held on friday afternoon to enable teams to check reliability of their cars and electronic systems piquet incurred a suspended three place grid penalty for exceeding maximum amount of permitted laps six during shakedown and a repeat transgression before end of season meant he would be required to serve it in first practice session held in relatively cold ambient temperatures piquet set fastest time with a 1 minute and 36 134 seconds lap followed by bird mitch evans jaguar vergne buemi lotterer rosenqvist jerome d ambrosio dragon di grassi and alex lynn virgin during session several drivers were caught out by track and some including lotterer ventured onto its run off areas as they learnt limits of track and finding a rhythm they liked jose maria lopez dragon glanced turn five barrier and damaged his car s rear right corner lynn ended session five minutes prematurely with a slide at a 45 degree angle into turn one barrier his front left suspension rosenqvist led for most of second practice session and recorded a lap late on at 1 minute and 35 467 seconds he was three tenths of a second faster than second placed bird di grassi lopez prost buemi d ambrosio piquet tom blomqvist andretti and evans completed top ten ahead of qualifying with five minutes left lynn crashed for second time when he lost control of rear of his car approaching turn sixteen seventeen chicane because of an overspeed that sent him into an outside barrier sideways with left hand side of his vehicle lynn was unhurt but crash significantly damaged his car and ended session early due to limited amount of available time saturday s afternoon one hour qualifying session was divided into four groups of five cars each group was determined by a lottery system and was permitted six minutes of on track activity all drivers were limited to two timed laps with one at maximum power fastest five overall competitors in all four groups participated in a super pole session with one driver on track at any time going out in reverse order from fifth to first each of five drivers was limited to one timed lap and starting order was determined by competitor s fastest times super pole from first to fifth and group qualifying from sixth to twentieth driver and team who recorded fastest time were awarded three points towards their respective championships thumb upright felix rosenqvist pictured in 2016 took his third pole position of season and sixth of his career in first group of five drivers blomqvist was early pace setter and was followed by maro engel venturi and prost both luca filippi nio and d ambrosio set one timed warm up lap as duo crossed timing team after first group ended due to a mistimed run that prevented them from recording a lap at maximum power rosenqvist immediately went fastest of anyone in track s first sector and topped group two buemi followed in second with bird third and vergne fourth piquet struggled with tight nature of track and was second group s slowest driver in third group evans was fastest competitor and put himself amongst top five overall runners as he eliminated vergne from super pole di grassi was second quickest with oliver turvey nio third and daniel abt audi fourth third group s slowest driver edoardo mortara venturi made heavy contact with a wall leaving obelisk chicane and broke his rear left suspension and steering arm causing him to fight for control of his car for rest of his lap before final group commenced a miscommunication caused lopez to be released from his garage at wrong time and hit sidepod of antonio felix da costa s car andretti at low speed lopez was consequently pushed into a wall because he could not steer away from felix da costa both cars sustained suspension damage and neither lopez nor felix da costa set a lap time as formula e regulations obliged teams to nominate one of driver s two cars for use in qualifying lotterer surprised all by setting fastest overall group stage lap of 1 minute and 36 593 seconds by gaining four tenths of a second in circuit s final sector after two previous average sector times on its last lap heidfeld drove on his lap to place second and lynn was third at end of group qualifying lap times set by lotterer rosenqvist buemi bird and evans advanced them into super pole although rosenqvist glanced a barrier with his right rear wheel leaving obelisk chicane he took his third pole position of season and sixth of his career with a time of 1 minute and 36 311 seconds he was joined on grid s front row by bird who was 0 676 seconds slower and had pole until rosenqvist s lap evans locked his tyres at turn nine battled for control of his car over bumps while braking for turn thirteen hairpin and took third lotterer could not replicate his group qualifying performance due to a lack of tyre cooling and was fourth after losing four tenths worth of time in first sector buemi appeared to win pole by going fastest in opening two sectors but an error with retardation of his regenerative system entering turn thirteen put him deep after missing his braking point on bumpy track and started fifth post qualifying andretti were issued a eur10 000 fine as they were deemed by stewards to have released felix da costa s car in an unsafe manner and da costa then collided with car number six that was approaching in fast lane felix da costa penalised ten grid positions for afternoon s race lopez filippi and d ambrosio also dropped two places on grid for passing chequered flag twice were granted permission by stewards to start race after application of penalties rest of order consisted of di grassi turvey vergne abt heidfeld lynn blomqvist piquet engel prost mortara filippi d ambrosio lopez and felix da costa race left thumb upright local driver luca filippi pictured in 2015 was one of three winners of fanboost vote and got caught up in a four car pile up on lap sixteen race began before a crowd of 45 000 people at 16 00 central european summer time utc 02 00 weather conditions at start were dry but cloudy air temperature throughout was between and track temperature ranged from a special feature of formula e is fan boost feature an additional 100 kilowatts 130 hp of power to use in driver s second car three drivers who were allowed to use boost were determined by a fan vote on grid rosenqvist spun his tyres and turned left to prevent bird from passing him that enabled evans to try a run on right of pair only to slide wide and return to third meanwhile turvey made a brisk start from seventh to move past di grassi and buemi around outside for fifth as field approached second turn lynn mounted rear of vergne s car this caused both cars to sustain bodywork damage with lynn shown a black flag with an orange disc which dictated that he enter pit lane for repairs engel and felix da costa made best starts in field gaining three places by end of first lap while blomqvist lost same amount of positions over same distance gaps in top ten stabilised as rosenqvist began to build a small advantage over bird further back felix da costa continued to move up order by getting ahead of filippi and mortara followed through yet mortara abandoned his attempt at steering back onto racing line as lopez space and former was briefly sideways lopez could not find any room to overtake him but untangled with mortara before entering hairpin buemi di grassi and filippi were announced as winners of fanboost vote on fourth lap soon after lopez almost completed a double overtake on filippi and prost which saw his axle interconnect as he moved past filippi but reached apex of corner allowing prost to keep fourteenth for time being upfront rosenqvist had extended his lead over bird to three seconds which remained about same until former responded to set consecutive fastest laps and close gap before mandatory pit stops to change into a second car buemi pressured turvey and got past him for fifth on lap 15 he then began drawing closer to fourth placed lotterer and was right behind him within one lap an overtaking attempt by buemi on lotterer resulted in minor contact but both sustained no damage entering pit stop window evans and lotterer had seven percent more electrical energy available than top two and fell back so that they could remain on track for one extra lap while di grassi and vergne also conserved energy as pit stops drew nearer localised yellow flags were necessitated for a four car pileup at turn 13 hairpin on lap 16 heidfeld was close to turvey two collided entering hairpin and former went into a barrier lopez was on left and pushed turvey into heidfeld then turvey s teammate filippi attempted to pass mortara and rammed into rear of his car with mortara following suit all four drivers were able to continue meanwhile felix da costa made first pit stop of race on lap rosenqvist and bird came in simultaneously with former retaining lead after pit stops buemi moved past evans for third and di grassi was close behind lotterer in fifth as full course yellow procedure was activated for lynn who was stranded in turn ten run off area after a crash on lap 18 then piquet became second retiree after stopping his car with an seat belt problem thumb upright sam bird pictured in 2015 took his second victory of season and seventh of his career after rosenqvist retired with suspension failure once racing resumed bird was still close behind rosenqvist in battle for lead and evans moved past buemi for third place on lap 22 bird took lead as rosenqvist drove over turn seventeen kerbs and broke his car s rear left suspension assembly and drive shaft it was initially attributed to an aggressive driving style but it was later traced to a loose bolt rosenqvist pulled up at side of track to retire race control activated second full course yellow procedure to enable recovery of rosenqvist s car by marshals to a safe location meanwhile di grassi got ahead of lotterer and soon after used his fanboost to overtake buemi around inside cresting a hill for third on lap 24 he thus began to gain on evans who in turn was drawing nearer to bird by having more electrical energy as battle for lead commenced buemi defended from lotterer allowing abt and vergne to duel them although lotterer was conscious over conserving electrical energy he overtook buemi at turn five on lap 26 abt lacked access to energy readouts due to a radio failure in his second car but made a similar overtaking attempt on outside of buemi entering hairpin on lap vergne temporarily took sixth and fifth away from abt and buemi two laps later before going deep at hairpin upfront evans used his electrical energy advantage to challenge bird on run to turn nine for lead on lap 29 but bird defended by steering right abt earned one point for setting race s fastest lap at 1 minute and 37 910 seconds on lap 30 and passed buemi at turn nine soon after vergne then overtook buemi around inside heading towards turn three evans used his extra electrical energy to close up to bird and had neither slowed nor regenerated for energy conservation purposes leaving him vulnerable to di grassi and lotterer this enabled bird to open up a small lead and di grassi got by evans for second place at turn nine with three laps left lotterer then tried to pass evans driving towards turn nine evans held third as lotterer was alongside him going into obelisk chicane but evans kept place by out braking him with two laps left lopez tagged rear of mortara s car damaging latter s rear wing and causing former to retire with suspension damage full course yellow was not activated on final lap because lopez stopped his car in a place where he would not obstruct anyone this proved detrimental to evans as he had five percent of electrical energy left while lotterer had two percent more lotterer turned left to pass evans at turn ten for third evans then slowed due to electrical energy depletion di grassi s conservative strategy drew him nearer to bird but was not close enough to affect an overtaking manoeuvre and bird crossed finish line after 33 laps to take his second victory of season and seventh of his career by 0 970 seconds lotterer was third and abt fourth fifth placed vergne sprained his thumb at his pit stop which left him unable to attack left hand turns for fear of oversteering into a barrier buemi d ambrosio engel evans mortara felix da costa turvey filippi prost blomqvist heidfeld and lopez were final classified finishers post race left thumb upright second placed lucas di grassi pictured in 2017 was cleared of wrongdoing during an investigation into his pit stop top three drivers appeared on podium to collect their trophies and spoke to media in a later press conference bird admitted that he may have not won race had rosenqvist retired with suspension damage and stated a driving error on his part allowed evans and di grassi to close up on him i knew they d be hunting on last lap but i tried to give myself best scenario and held on he then stated he would take a race by race approach until new york city when he would read into points standings i ve just got to do best job i can and then we ll see when we get to new york where we were strong last year di grassi was complimentary of eprix calling it extraordinary although he did not expect to draw close to buemi at start he stated his delight with his second place finish and spoke of his hope to contend for win in every race until end of season third place finisher lotterer admitted that he was still learning formula e and on how luck changes hands in series i saved a bit too much energy and performance was good but i learned a lot again today and i m happy to be on podium i m getting it bit by bit rosenqvist s retirement from lead was his second in three races after a battery failure lost him mexico city eprix he described eprix as a perfect day in every sense and vowed to return to contention we re all quite tired and i think guys deserved a win today that s going to be hard for everyone but we re going to come back evans claimed second full course yellow stopped him from securing his second podium finish of season and was aware his sole opportunity to pass bird was missed it spiralled out of control very very quick i ll take it on chin guys did a great job and i feel bad for team we could have easily got a podium maybe we were just a little bit impatient but it s my first time racing for win in this championship concerning lap 16 four car pileup at hairpin turvey called it unfortunate and said he could not avoid it from occurring heidfeld argued since turvey depleted electrical energy possibly due to too much frontal brake bias he was rendered unable to steer heidfeld said he would discuss crash with turvey towards end of race di grassi was investigated by stewards for placement of his mechanics hands at his mid race car change pit stop di grassi was later summoned to stewards office where video of his pit stop was re examined for clarification and audi were cleared of any wrongdoing when they demonstrated their procedure was legal di grassi subsequently called for technology to have a greater involvement so that consistent instructions and decisions could be enforced and lower stewards workload e dams renault team principal jean paul driot explained buemi had bird s strategy but his battle with turvey obliged him to attack too much driot stated his belief that an alternative strategy of one extra lap could have been adopted had buemi began on front row of grid unbuckling of piquet s seat belt in his second car was one of several incidents involving safety device and a similar issue affected abt in punta del este he revealed that his team decided to retire him because problem took too long to rectify and they wanted to conserve equipment it s pretty clear these cars are not made for quick pit stops and everyone is taking risks as there s no minimum time result kept vergne lead of drivers championship but his advantage was reduced to eighteen points bird s victory elevated him to second place and rosenqvist s retirement demoted him to third buemi maintained fourth position while abt took over fifth position by finishing sixth in teams championship techeetah extended their advantage over virgin who gained second place from mahindra at top to thirty four points mahindra scored no points and dropped to third while audi s strong result moved them from sixth
