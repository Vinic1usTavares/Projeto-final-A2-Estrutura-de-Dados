battle of kettle creek february 14 1779 was a minor encounter in back country of georgia during american revolutionary war it was fought in wilkes county about from present day washington georgia a militia force of patriots decisively defeated and scattered a loyalist militia force that was on its way to british controlled augusta victory demonstrated inability of british forces to hold interior of state or to protect even sizable numbers of loyalist recruits outside their immediate area british who had already decided to abandon augusta recovered some prestige a few weeks later surprising a patriot force in battle of brier creek georgia s back country would not come fully under british control until after 1780 siege of charleston broke patriot forces in south background british began their southern strategy by sending expeditions from new york city and saint augustine east florida to capture port of savannah georgia in late 1778 new york expedition under command of lieutenant colonel archibald campbell arrived first landing at tybee island on december 3 1778 and successfully captured savannah on december 29 1778 russell pp 100 103 british occupation of augusta when british brigadier general augustine prevost arrived from saint augustine in mid january he assumed command of garrison there and sent a force under campbell to take control of augusta and raise loyalist forces ashmore and olmstead p 86 leaving savannah on january 24 campbell and more than 1 000 men arrived near augusta a week later with only minimal harassment from georgia patriot militia on way augusta had been defended by south carolina general andrew williamson leading about 1 000 militia from georgia and south carolina but he withdrew most of his men when campbell approached his rear guard briefly skirmished with campbell s men before withdrawing across savannah river into south carolina wilson pp 84 86 thumb right a 1926 map reconstructing arrival routes of forces at battlefield british route is highlighted in blue patriot route in red campbell started recruiting loyalists by february 10 1779 about 1 100 men signed up but relatively few actually formed militia companies forming only 20 companies of british army campbell then began requiring oaths of loyalty on pain of forfeiture of property many took this oath insincerely quickly letting williamson know their true feelings early in his march campbell dispatched major john hamilton to recruit loyalists in wilkes county and lt colonel john boyd on an expedition to raise loyalists in backcountry of north and south carolina boyd met with success and recruited several hundred men as he traveled south back toward augusta more loyalists joined his company until it numbered over 600 men in central south carolina wilson p 86 as this column moved on men plundered and pillaged along way predictably drawing angered patriots to take up arms wilson p 87 american response continental army commander in south major general benjamin lincoln based in charleston south carolina had been unable to respond adequately to capture of savannah with only limited resources he was short of both men and funds he was able to raise about 1 400 south carolina militia but did not have authorization to order them outside state mattern p 62 on january 30 he was further reinforced at charleston by arrival of 1 100 north carolina militia under general john ashe then he immediately dispatched them to join williamson on south carolina side of savannah river near augusta mattern p 65 georgia banks of savannah in augusta area were controlled by a loyalist force led by colonel daniel mcgirth while south carolina banks were controlled by a georgia patriot militia led by colonel john dooly ashmore and olmstead p 89 when about 250 south carolina militia under colonel andrew pickens arrived pickens and dooly joined forces to conduct offensive operations into georgia with pickens taking overall command ashmore and olmstead p 91 they were at some point joined by a few companies of north carolina light horse militia elliott p 40 thumb left upright lieutenant colonel elijah clarke portrait by rembrandt peale on february 10 pickens and dooly crossed savannah river to attack a british army camp southeast of augusta finding camp unoccupied they learned that company was out on an extended patrol suspecting they would head for a stockaded frontier post called carr s fort pickens sent men directly there while main body chased after british british made it into fort but were forced to abandon their horses and baggage outside its walls ashmore and olmstead p 92 pickens then besieged fort until he learned that boyd was passing through ninety six district of south carolina with seven to eight hundred loyalists headed for georgia he reluctantly raised siege and moved to intercept boyd russell p 105 pickens established a strong presence near mouth of broad river where he expected boyd might try to cross however boyd his force grown by then to 800 men chose to go to north he first tried cherokee ford southernmost fording of savannah river where he was met with some resistance known as engagement at mcgowen s blockhouse encounter consisted of a detachment of eight patriots commanded by capt robert anderson with two small swivel guns in an entrenched position who thwarted boyd s approach to cherokee ford boyd moved north upstream about and crossed savannah river there skirmishing with a small patriot force that had shadowed his movements on georgia side ashmore and olmstead p 94 boyd reported losing 100 men killed wounded or deserted in encounter by time pickens learned that boyd had crossed river he had himself crossed into south carolina in an attempt to intercept boyd he immediately recrossed into georgia upon learning of boyd s whereabouts on february 14 pickens caught up with boyd when he paused to rest his troops near kettle creek only a few miles from colonel mcgirth s loyalist camp battle thumb right a 1926 map reconstructing tactical movements in battle no contemporary maps of battlefield have been found elliott p 97 boyd was apparently unaware that he was being followed so closely and his camp even though guards were posted was not particularly alert pickens advanced leading center with his right flank under colonel dooly and his left under georgia lieutenant colonel elijah clarke gunfire between patriot scouts and camp guards alerted boyd to situation boyd formed a defensive line near camp s rear and advanced with a force of 100 men to oppose pickens at a crude breastwork made of fencing and fallen trees pickens whose advance gave him advantage of high ground was able to flank this position even though his own wings were slowed by swampy conditions near creek in heavy fighting boyd went down with a mortal wound and small company retreated back to main loyalist line patriot flanks then began to emerge from swamps loyalists led by boyd s second in command major william engaged patriots in battle for 90 minutes some of loyalists crossed creek abandoning horses and equipment clarke alertly noticed some high ground across creek that they seemed to be heading for and led some of his men there having his horse shot from under him in process loyalist line was eventually broken and its men were killed captured or dispersed ashmore and olmstead pp 97 98 aftermath treatment of prisoners pickens took 75 prisoners including most of wounded and between 40 and 70 loyalists were killed he suffered 7 to 9 killed and 14 23 wounded or missing in battle elliott p 95 many of boyd s men including some that escaped battlefield and others that pickens paroled returned home a significant number were either captured or surrendered themselves to patriot authorities in days following battle and fate of some of his men is unknown elliott p 96 lieutenant colonel campbell reported that 270 of boyd s recruits eventually joined him he organized them into royal north carolina regiment when pickens approached mortally wounded boyd after battle loyalist leader who had lived in south carolina before war and was known to pickens asked patriot leader to deliver a brooch to his wife and inform her of his fate this pickens eventually did ashmore and olmstead p 99 of loyalist prisoners only about 20 survived their wounds pickens first took them to augusta and then ninety six where they were held along with a large number of other loyalists seeking to make an example of them south carolina authorities put a number of these loyalists on trial for treason about 50 of them were convicted and five men including some of men captured at kettle creek were hanged british military leaders were outraged over this treatment of what they considered prisoners of war even before trial was held general prevost threatened retaliation against patriot prisoners he was holding but did not act out of fear that other american held british prisoners might be mistreated his invasion of coastal south carolina in april 1779 a counter thrust against movements by general lincoln to recover georgia prompted south carolina officials to vacate most of convictions davis pp 174 178 british reaction in a council held in augusta on february 12 campbell decided to abandon augusta and began withdrawal to savannah on february 14 at 2am morning of battle hall p 84 contrary to opinions expressed by some historians campbell did not leave because of battle s outcome he did not learn of battle until after he had already left augusta his departure was prompted by arrival of 1 200 of patriot general john ashe s forces in general andrew williamson s camp across savannah river a shortage of provisions and uncertainty over whether boyd would be successful in his mission p p 89 success of kettle creek was undone to some extent by subsequent british victory at march 3 battle of brier creek which took place during campbell s retreat in present day county wilson pp 90 98 thumb right kettle creek battlefield 2010 augusta was latter recaptured by british in june 1780 after patriot forces collapsed in aftermath of siege of charleston it was
