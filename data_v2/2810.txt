thumb 450px extent of ali bey and zahir s territory between 1768 and 1774 and russian naval movements in levant based on accounts of sauveur lusignan a contemporary historian alt map of egypt and syria showing local troop movements and russian naval operations between 1768 and 1774 during revolt of ali bey and russo turkish war russian occupations of beirut were two separate military expeditions by squadrons of imperial russian navy s mediterranean fleet with first one taking place in june 1772 and second one from october 1773 to early 1774 they formed part of its levant campaign during larger russo turkish war of 1768 1774 russia s main objective in this campaign was to assist local forces led by egypt s autonomous ruler ali bey al kabir who was in open rebellion against ottoman empire ali taking advantage of empire s preoccupation with russia declared egypt s independence and in 1771 sent an army led by muhammad bey abu al dhahab to occupy ottoman territory in levant abu al dhahab unexpectedly returned to challenge ali for control of egypt ali requested russian military assistance against his rival and ottomans when this aid in form of a small russian squadron arrived in region ali had already fled egypt and taken refuge in acre power base of his ally zahir al umar after helping repel an ottoman offensive on sidon russian squadron sailed for beirut they bombarded town in june 1772 and occupied it from june23 to 28 ali now formally allied with russian empire requested further assistance from his new european partner to recover egypt from abu al dhahab russians had recently entered a period of truce with ottomans constraining their involvement in region they did however promise ali a large squadron impatient ali set out for egypt with a small force that was defeated near cairo he was imprisoned and died a few days later when russian squadron arrived in june 1773 and learned of ali s fate its commander allied with zahir and druze chieftain yusuf shihab latter had agreed to pay russians a tribute in exchange for their liberation of beirut from jazzar pasha shihab s insubordinate vassal whom he had recently appointed as governor of town bombardment of town began on august2 and jazzar surrendered after two months on october10 a few hundred albanian mercenaries were left as occupiers occupations are of debatable historical importance despite their brevity they marked first time in over 250 years that beirut was ruled by a power other than ottomans it also marked first occasion on which russian rule was imposed over an arab city background pressure of austria and russia on northern ottoman frontiers since beginning of 18th century had encouraged insubordination among local governors in largely decentralised arab provinces of ottoman syria in 1768 while russian empire was suppressing a polish uprising near ottoman border a cossack regiment chased some of rebels across border and reportedly carried out a massacre in town of balta sultan eventually responded by declaring war on russia he demanded military assistance from ali bey a mamluk who was most powerful official in ottoman egypt at time ali closely observed course of war sending required 3 000 soldiers to aid of sublime porte in 1769 early in following year however he declared egypt s independence chiefly in response to war with russia later he struck an alliance with zahir al umar a wealthy arab ruler in northern palestine ali and zahir shared common ground in their opposition to islamic fundamentalism sultan s isolationist policies towards europe and imposition of ottoman dignitaries to their courts thumb battle of at night by ivan aivazovsky 1848 at same time tsarina catherine great lacking an organised russian fleet in black sea drew up plans with count alexei orlov to detach a large number of ships from baltic fleet and deploy them to mediterranean russia hoped they would attack turkish straits from rear and that its naval presence in aegean sea would provoke a greek rebellion this newly formed mediterranean fleet headed by orlov and commanded by admiral grigory spiridov sailed from copenhagen on 1769 by 1770 first detachment was anchored off southern morea where orlov revolt broke out this was followed by bombardments and troop landings at different locations in region over coming months on a turkish fleet was crushed at battle of chesma which crippled ottoman navy and gave russians naval command of mediterranean for remainder of war turkish ships that survived retreated to dardanelles rear admiral john elphinstone proposed a direct assault on constantinople but was instead convinced by orlov to blockade straits with his squadron while rest of fleet went on offensive in northern aegean russian chronicles have described muslims as since 15th century this is a pejorative term suggesting that they were descendants of biblical hagar who was exiled into deserts of sinai russian court was aware of of ottoman tunis algeria and tripolitania in 18th century despite her negative perception of muslims catherine did not hesitate to approach them as potential allies on july 15 1769 she instructed spiridov to avoid attacking ships belonging to aforementioned states unless provoked and prompted him to attempt to turn barbary states against their ottoman overlord catherine s plans did not materialize as tunis and algeria fought on side of ottomans while correspondence of ali pasha of tripoli with orlov bore no significant results in late 1770 ali bey dispatched an army of 40 000 troops commanded by his trusted general muhammad bey abu al dhahab to palestine where it joined forces with zahir s army in spring of 1771 and went on to occupy several towns in levant however soon after fall of damascus in early june ottoman agents managed to convince abu al dhahab to turn against ali bey promising to appoint him as ruler of egypt instead of his overlord abu al dhahab retreated with his army and became embroiled in a power struggle against his former master over control of egypt zahir for his part became isolated in his sheikhdom and had to face inevitable ottoman counteroffensive on his own ali bey was then convinced that he could reverse his recent setbacks through an alliance with russia on 1771 he sent an armenian envoy named yaqub to meet with orlov at mediterranean fleet s headquarters on aegean island of where he offered russians an alliance offer was later accepted by tsarina but her knowledge of proposed alliance came after ali bey was no longer ruling egypt he had been forced to leave country and seek refuge with his ally zahir when standoff between him and abu al dhahab finally escalated to armed confrontations ignorant of ali s flight and with orders from orlov to make contact with him a detachment commanded by general adjutant rizo a greek sailed for damietta but quickly left port after learning of his fate squadron then searched for him along palestinian coast and eventually found him in acre on rizo later sent a detachment to north which intercepted an ottoman frigate from beirut near tyre meanwhile in sidon zahir s small army of 6 000 was being besieged by an ottoman force of 30 000 that included druze contingents rizo s ships joined garrison by bombarding ottoman attackers who withdrew shortly afterwards first occupation newly assembled coalition wishing to exploit ottoman setback in sidon decided to send russian squadron to small port town of beirut which was controlled at time by druze according to researcher william persen aim of this expedition was to both preoccupy druze and punish them for siding with porte blockading their port would achieve this beirut was also only port in region which had so far remained under ottoman rule likely unaware of a recent armistice between russia and porte rizo s squadron appeared off town s coast on june18 after it was reunited with its tyre and acre detachments force consisted of two frigates sv nikolai and sv pavel four polaccas five half galleys and four xebecs it was transporting an infantry division that was largely made up of greek and albanian mercenaries bombardment of town began on same day and ottoman ships docked in its port were sunk in his version of events author of catherine ii et l orient wrote that beirut s defenders were given a 24 hour ultimatum by rizo to fly russian flag and pay a tribute naval offensive lasted five days and involved an unsuccessful assault by a landing party on june21 after two days of heavier bombardment they finally landed on june23 and spent hours sacking town and its bazaar about 550 000 qirsh worth of loot in form of both trade goods and cash was taken russians left on after receiving additional payment from yusuf shihab a druze emir who ruled over surrounding mountains shihab also agreed to a four month alliance with coalition end of ali bey s revolt following russians departure ottomans ceded beirut to yusuf shihab s mount lebanon emirate shihab in turn charged ahmed bey jazzar who had previously served under ali bey with town s defence while in acre and with his allies bombarding beirut ali received his envoy yaqub he came aboard a russian frigate carrying gifts and a friendly message from catherine in which she assured him of her commitment to russia s alliance with egyptian ruler ali however was dissatisfied with mere gesture and sought russian military assistance in form of infantry artillery and naval support to reconquer egypt from abu al dhahab he sent a new envoy with this message to orlov according to historian edouard he may have also offered russians control of christian holy sites in jerusalem orlov responded by telling ali that he was bounded by truce with porte he pledged a small force of russian officers and artillery and promised to give ali all assistance he needed as soon as circumstances permitted during summer ali and zahir s forces laid siege to city of jaffa siege was joined in september by a russian transport ship which landed artillery pieces near city ship left a month later carrying a renewed plea to orlov another russian naval detachment commanded by lieutenant alexiano arrived at jaffa in november again joining bombardment and informing ali of orlov s plan to commission a large fleet for his cause alexiano s squadron consisted of frigate sv pavel and a number of polaccas and had earlier destroyed two barbary ships off damietta and captured some smaller vessels planted rumours of insubordination in abu al dhahab s camp and growing dissent in egypt had caught ali s attention he grew impatient and in april 1773 he set out for egypt at head of a small force despite being assured a month earlier that russian assistance would arrive soon ali s force was defeated by his rival s army near cairo he was taken prisoner and died a few days later likely by poisoning jazzar meanwhile had fortified beirut and chose to act independently of shihab declaring that he would recognise only sultan s authority over town orlov s promised squadron commanded by captain mikhail kozhukhov reached acre in june hearing of ali s death kozhukhov agreed to a treaty of friendship with zahir second occupation kozhukhov appeared with his squadron of at least 222 guns off beirut s coast on carrying a force of 1 200 albanian mercenaries and mobile artillery units zahir had already negotiated an alliance with shihab when latter was denied assistance by pasha of damascus against jazzar during month long negotiations that followed druze emir managed to persuade kozhukhov through zahir and his uncle amir musa mansur to deliver beirut to him shihab was to pay a tribute of 300 000 qirsh and place town under russian protection on his part kozhukhov promised that his troops would not pillage town as russian occupiers of 1772 had both sides agreed that russians would hold mansur as a hostage pending full payment by shihab order of battle by time it appeared before beirut kozhukhov s squadron consisted of following ships ship type guns nadezhda kozhukhov frigate 32 sv pavel frigate 26 sv nikolai frigate 26 frigate 22 slava frigate 16 sv polacca 20 sv anna polacca 20 sv ekaterina polacca 18 polacca 12 schooner 18 6 half galleys a bombardment began on august2 and lasted entire day destroying port area and its towers noise was so loud it could be heard in sidon about 25 miles 40 km away according to city s french consul arabic sources said that it could even be heard in damascus much of beirut was destroyed but jazzar refused to surrender kozhukhov ordered landing of troops and artillery units for a ground assault walls were breached in several places but shihab would not commit his forces to storming town citing agreement which gave kozhukhov task of delivering town to druze in exchange for payment kozhukhov chose to maintain naval and land blockade cutting off town from its food supply shihab and zahir s troops routed an ottoman relief army commanded by pasha of tripoli which approached from beqaa jazzar opened negotiations with attackers at end of september fearing that submission to either shihab or kozhukhov would eventually lead to his execution he offered to surrender himself to zahir instead and serve under his command jazzar surrendered beirut on october10 after which he left for acre with his garrison of 800 by end of their offensive russians had lost 34 men killed and 96 wounded kozhukhov restricted himself to seizing two half galleys and some weaponry after docking in accordance with his arrangement with shihab when latter could not pay full amount promised to russians kozhukhov threatened to kill mansur his druze hostage shihab managed to make a partial payment which kozhukhov accepted pending payment of balance russian commander and his squadron departed for aegean leaving behind 300 albanian mercenaries to guard mansur who was under house arrest and to remain in town as occupiers albanians occupied beirut until late january or early february 1774 though it remains unclear whether they received balance of tribute due according to french consular reports from sidon occupiers kept russian flag raised over beirut along with a large portrait of catherine great over town s main gate to which travellers were forced to pay their respects aftermath and legacy thumb 350px a map of beirut from atlas of archipelago printed in 1788 jazzar and his mercenaries defected from zahir s camp to ottomans shortly after surrendering beirut with departure of russians in early 1774 and signing of treaty of kucuk kaynarca same year zahir had to face porte s retribution by himself russo turkish peace treaty allowed russia to establish consulates wherever it wished in mediterranean to open up trade routes with middle east and to guarantee safety of christian pilgrims in holy land but made no mention of zahir or of russia s wartime territorial gains in region zahir was killed in august 1775 during a siege of acre by ottoman forces who were initially led by egypt s abu al dhahab shihab was quickly pardoned by ottomans as he was never in direct rebellion against them but he was pressured into surrendering beirut in 1776 due to heavy taxation by jazzar who had been recently appointed by ottoman government as pasha of sidon in addition to being first time an arab city came under russian rule events also marked first time that beirut had not been under ottoman control since ottoman conquest of region over two and a half centuries earlier place des canons cannons square became common name for today s martyrs square in beirut s central district in 1773 this name remained in use though unofficially until 1950s it was a reference to large artillery pieces that russians stationed in plaza which was then an empty area known as east of walled town importance of this short lived occupation remains a subject of debate among relatively few historians and scholars who have analysed it in his 1952 evaluation of events william persen played down occupation describing it simply as a new force of western penetration in middle east soviet scholars like p on other hand described it as an early manifestation of modern cold war era assistance by soviet union to national liberation movements in third world nations notes
