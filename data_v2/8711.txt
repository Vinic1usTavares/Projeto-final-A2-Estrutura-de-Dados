sr q1 class is a type of austerity steam locomotive constructed during second world war class was designed by oliver bulleid for use on intensive freight turns experienced during wartime on southern railway network a total of 40 locomotives were built bulleid incorporated many innovations and weight saving concepts to produce a highly functional design class lasted in service until july 1966 and first member of class number c1 has been preserved by national railway museum highly unusual and controversial design represents ultimate development of british 0 6 0 freight engine capable of hauling trains that were usually allocated to much larger locomotives on other railways nicknames for class included ugly ducklings coffee pots charlies biscuit tins biscuit barrels clockworks and frankensteins background in late 1939 southern railway until then primarily a high density commuter railway serving london and south east england much of it electrified with third rail pick up found itself on british front line of second world war with a severe lack of modern freight handling capability longworth section q1 class newest freight design was q class 0 6 0 of 1938 last locomotive designed by richard maunsell built to essentially victorian era principles these had been designed as replacements for many of older 0 6 0s inherited by southern railway in 1923 and entered service in january 1938 maunsell having retired at end of october 1937 was replaced by oliver bulleid southern railway became an essential strategic war asset because of its proximity to continental europe and needed to equip itself with adequate freight handling capability to transport vast quantities of supplies and troops required for conflict brief stipulated high route availability and high tractive effort construction history answer to this problem came from drawing board of southern railway s innovative chief mechanical engineer oliver bulleid in shape of q1 using minimum amount of raw materials and with all superfluous features stripped away he produced in 1942 most powerful 0 6 0 steam locomotive ever to run on britain s railways first twenty locomotives were constructed at brighton works and remaining twenty at ashford powerful and light q1s formed backbone of southern s heavy freight capability engine weighed less than 90 tons 90 6 tonnes so could be used over more than 97 of southern railway s route mileage design thumb note steeply inclined piston valves of inside cylinders class was one of several built under wartime austerity regime which stressed pure functionality above any considerations of style or decoration this austere approach to design explains its functional appearance one aspect of their shape was that like bulleid s sr merchant navy class and sr west country and battle of britain classes they could be simply driven through a coach washer for cleaning at a time when manpower for this time consuming chore could not be spared unusual shape was also dictated by use of materials lagging was made of a glass fibre insulation material known as which although cheap and plentiful during war years could not support any weight and therefore a separate casing was required which followed that seen in merchant navy class locomotives and boiler rings were adapted to lend lagging support needed a copper rather than steel firebox was utilised unlike bulleid s pacific designs wheels were smaller 5 ft 1 in 1 55 m adaptations of bulleid firth brown type utilised on pacifics locomotive had two cylinders with stephenson link outside admission piston valves having a travel in full gear of and a steam lap of it was provided with a five nozzle blast pipe boiler design was based upon that of lord nelson class and firebox used same and backplate boiler barrel measured in length with diameters of at front and at back grate area was heating surface of 209 tubes and 21 flues was that of firebox was giving a total evaporative heating surface of superheater heating surface was operational details q1 was final development of british 0 6 0 main line steam locomotive later designs of medium powered freight locomotives such as lms ivatt class 2 2 6 0 and lms ivatt class 4 moguls had a 2 6 0 wheel arrangement 0 6 0 wheel arrangement was not used in br standard designs of locomotive br classified q1 class in power classification 5f this was unusual few other 0 6 0s exceeded classification of 4f notable exceptions were lner class j20 5f lner class and lner class 6f q1 s route availability meant that although they were primarily freight locomotives they also frequently deputised on secondary passenger services however class gained a reputation for poor braking on unfitted freight trains due to light construction of tender braking system q1s thrived on their intended duties during world war ii and were an indispensable addition to southern locomotive fleet to such an extent that they all remained in service until 1960s long after they were intended to cease operation as an austerity design withdrawals began in 1963 during implementation of br modernisation plan which saw end of steam

experiences at french branch of westinghouse electric before first world war and those of his tenure in rail operating department during that conflict southern railway number followed an adaptation of
