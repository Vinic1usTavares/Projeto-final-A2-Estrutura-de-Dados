then 5 year old son jesse as crappy as possible method behind madness of south park creative planet network february 15 2012 retrieved december 28 2016 themes ike s wee wee raises question of who really can be considered one s family at first kyle s implicit idea is that family consists of those for whom we care that are related by blood based on this viewing of family he no longer feels need to help ike when he learns that they are not related by blood as story progresses kyle questions his initial beliefs and forms episode s central moral by saying that family isn t about whose blood you have it s about who you care about thus kyle s reformed view of family not only includes his adopted brother but his friends as well kyle s questioning of his own morals has been likened to engaging in dialectical socratic method of inquiry subplot of ike s wee wee satirizes certain drug subcultures as well as drug use and societal attitudes towards drug users way episode portrays mr mackey s lack of real knowledge about drug use and addiction has been described as an example of south park satirizing left wing politics when they lead to sort of hypocrisy inconsistent with a proper open society cultural references part of episode revolves around practice of religious male circumcision in judaism and related ceremony called brit milah or bris and boys misunderstanding of tradition boys believe that circumcision entails cutting off of one s penis which they refer to by childish colloquial term wee wee except for cartman who insists on calling it fireman cannabis is also referred to by various names including weed grass pot and marijuana in which mr mackey constantly pronounces letter j as as in jam which makes kyle drug as marry jew wanna drug use is often portrayed in conjunction with hippie subculture through hippie characters such as two teenagers that give lsd to mackey and woman that he befriends and eventually marries jimbo and cartman both use term hippie pejoratively during their argument jimbo tells mackey that he should just go to a grateful dead concert to which mackey says he can t since jerry garcia is deceased on two occasions episode shows people watching teletubbies while high on marijuana or in rehab in his drug prevention speech mackey claims that lsd was made famous by john lennon and paul mccartney former members of beatles both lennon and mccartney are known to have experimented with drug while walking home mr mackey drunkenly sings 1983 pat benatar song love is a battlefield during ike s supposed funeral a bagpipe player starts playing hebrew folk song hava at funerals priest uses phrase ashes to ashes dust to dust from anglican burial service when townspeople start to harass mackey one of them shouts now we see what you and homer simpson have in common dope this references famous catchphrase from simpsons d oh which sounds similar to word dope meaning illicit drugs at kyle s house kyle s parents offer boys a dish called which is not a real dish when mackey is in india he is captured by members of a team and driven away in their van mackey is taken to rehabilitation to betty ford clinic which is based on a real life hospital a common plot device is referenced where a shoulder angel represents conscience and a shoulder devil representing temptation appear near a character this concept is spoofed in episode as both devil and angel suggest to mackey that he should drink beer when stan tells kyle what he thinks a bris means a dolly zoom is used which is an unsettling filmmaking effect often used to show that a character is undergoing a major realization hallucinogenic effects of certain drugs are portrayed by different means when inhaling cannabis alley that mr mackey is in suddenly turns very colorful after taking lsd mackey s head inflates like a giant balloon and then literally detaches from his body and floats away boys interact with mackey by looking up at his head as it floats over them in scene where boys are talking to chef he leaves without answering boys sexual question angrily saying dammit children why do i always have to be one to explain all this stuff to you ask your parents for once this is in reference to chef s tendency to give advice to boys while children are trying to think of what is most important thing for a man cartman says ham to which stan angrily replies no
