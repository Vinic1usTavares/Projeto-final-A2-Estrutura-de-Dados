upright alt a headshot of a gray haired man opening his mouth to speak executive producer jeff pinkner co wrote episode olivia was co written by co showrunners j h wyman and jeff pinkner and was directed by co executive producer joe chappelle producers revealed episode title on june 30 2010 after they began their search in mid june for a fifty to sixty year old actress to play olivia s mother entertainment weekly reported on july 2 that amy madigan had been cast as marilyn dunham for roughly four episodes beginning with season premiere character was described as lovely and together and deeply devoted to her daughter further reporting a week later revealed that wire actor andre royo had been cast for season premiere as henry higgins a soulful taxi driver who is unexpectedly forced into a tense situation with olivia henry higgins is also name of a character in my fair lady even before olivia aired royo s guest appearance was extended to appear in a second episode guest actor seth gabel returned as recurring character lincoln lee and required four to five hours of make up in order to play a recovering burn victim jeff pinkner and j h wyman decided to alternate episodes between prime and parallel universes because they thought that best way to really thoroughly tell these stories was to dive into them wholeheartedly in order to fully explore journey that our heroine is on and then come back over here because is embedded in our team we have point of view characters in both universes and it seemed to us perfect opportunity to really explore in a really thorough fulsome way alternate universe wyman elaborated that he felt fans would really appreciate a mythology in two places and showing both universes just presented itself in such a natural organic way to evolution in our storytelling fox however was initially worried about premise s sustainability and that an episode without peter or walter wouldn t feel like our show anymore to which pinkner responded that not unlike a show like lost fringe has to constantly evolve to move and grow and go forward otherwise we ll get bored cast will get bored audience will get bored after first three episodes both fox and warner bros became more favorable to storyline when discussing many differences between prime and parallel universes in an interview pinkner explained that one of big themes of show is how small choices that you make define you as a person and can change your life in large ways down line pinkner and rest of fringe production team loved opportunity to build an entire new world and asked themselves what life would have been like in its most mundane forms such as within daily routines pinkner thought it allowed them to create and explore many what if moments such as if september 11 attacks had occurred against white house instead of twin towers or if statue of liberty still possessed its shiny copper sheen pinkner elaborated in another interview that when perfectionist crew were writing and constructing parallel universe they spent a lot of time on a high level of attention and detail that had all of different departments and actors weighing in pinkner thought that because parallel universe is effectively breaking down with world war ii like conditions these sort of tough times forge more noble stronger people to better differentiate two universes producers changed color of opening credit sequences by making parallel universe red and prime universe blue as with opening credits in peter episodes featuring parallel universe displayed certain fringe science words in that world including wormholes speciation pandemics and telepathy cultural references thumb upright alt a photograph of a smiling dark haired man wearing a black sweater actor tom cruise was mentioned in episode for being a television actor rather than a movie star many differences between two universes were related to popular culture a photograph of fauxlivia wearing a gold medal in marksmanship is shown proving that unlike prime universe parallel universe has that particular event in their olympic games radio in henry s taxi can be heard mentioning former president john f kennedy is stepping down from his role as ambassador proving that he was not assassinated on that same taxi dogs is depicted to be a musical in parallel universe new york city instead of cats their mail is delivered by u s mail service with a different logo instead of united states postal service and there are apparently daily flights to moon actor tom cruise is mentioned for kick ing ass on television implying that he is not a movie star in parallel universe when olivia reminds him she knows his identification information henry mentions a jedi mind trick a reference to star wars which is one popular culture similarity two universes seem to share when searching for headquarters of massive dynamic olivia instead finds a site entitled martin luther king eldridge cleaver memorial park which implies that king was also not assassinated but instead developed a close relationship with black panther militant and soul on ice author cleaver park sign also reads we have a dream which is a slight deviation from king s i have a dream speech and suggests that he and cleaver wrote it together as olivia enters park she is passed by a man riding a penny farthing bicycle as these have not been shown elsewhere it does not seem likely that they are a common means of transportation in alternate universe but rather that this is a reference to prisoner in which similar mind games were used against an agent being held prisoner in prime universe fauxlivia tells walter that she has not seen shoes like his a line of shoes from c j clark in a while and asks if he is bringing them back walter responds by asking her where did they go indicating that they were also found in alternate universe until some recent time within olivia s lifetime but are no longer found there reception as with other fringe episodes fox released a science lesson plan for grade school children focusing on science seen in olivia with intention of having students learn about types of hormones and how they are used to regulate various functions in an organism ratings olivia premiered to 5 83 million viewers in united states with a 2 1 rating for viewers 18 49 fringe was down thirty percent from previous

critical acclaim ken tucker from entertainment weekly expected a big event in vein of second season premiere and was pleasantly surprised to find something different a beautifully emotional hour with suspense humor and kissing that was superb and surprising josh wigler of mtv wrote that fringe proved once again that it s one of most most innovative entertaining genre shows currently airing on television and he couldn t wait for next week s episode jason hughes of tv squad enjoyed episode and praised how show s creators have come up with a crazy but fun way of showing both universes every other episode kelly peters from blast magazine praised anna torv s acting because she brings a sensitivity to olivia s character that is heart wrenching but so well integrated into her character that action scenes seem totally natural for her standout for her however was john noble s performance as he played lovable and brilliant walter and chillingly conniving walternate both of which makes him an even more unforgettable character as audience sees what walter could have been a v club s noel murray graded episode with an a writing that third season of fringe opened tonight with one of strongest boldest episodes in whole run of series murray especially praised well written acted and photographed taxi scenes between olivia and henry los angeles times andrew hanson particularly enjoyed nine minute opening writing that he loved episode because of three reasons olivia kicked butt and stayed a step ahead of walternate her struggles with identity and all of careful details put into parallel universe after watching first several episodes of season three aaron riccio of slant magazine gave show 3 5 4 stars and praised it for making a huge game changing step forward he continued that hard science meets soft comedy and results are consistently surprising and rarely disappointing solid mythology and high stakes keep series moving as forward as quickly as flashforward and event but dual tones of two worlds offer considerably more breadth in stories it tells olivia was captivating television robert bianco from usa today praised torv noble and jackson s performances he however disliked new plotline of two olivias explaining it s hard to fault execution of first two episodes which skillfully set up fringe s two competing universes and two misplaced olivias yet well done isn t same as welcome i m not giving up on show which was one of last year s best but i don t want to spend weeks watching our olivia suffer and their olivia make walter and peter suffer you have to give writers leeway to take you where they want to go but at a certain point commercial entertainment has to be entertaining or there s no reason to watch awards and nomination anna torv submitted olivia along with season three episodes entrada marionette and bloodline for consideration in outstanding lead actress in a drama series category at 63rd primetime emmy awards she failed to receive a nomination references external links olivia at fox category 2010 american television episodes category fringe season 3 episodes
