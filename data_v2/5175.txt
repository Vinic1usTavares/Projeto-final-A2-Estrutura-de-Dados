alt diploma of king aethelstan for wulfgar ad 931 written by aethelstan a thumb upright 1 6 original charter s 416 written by aethelstan a in hermeneutic style in 931 hermeneutic style is a style of latin in later roman and early medieval periods characterised by extensive use of unusual and arcane words especially derived from greek style is first found in work of apuleius in second century and then in several late roman writers in early medieval period some leading continental scholars were exponents including johannes scotus eriugena and odo of cluny in england seventh century bishop aldhelm was most influential hermeneutic writer latin scholarship declined in ninth century and when it revived in tenth hermeneutic style became increasingly influential unlike in continental europe where it was used only by a minority of writers in tenth century england it became nearly universal it was house style of english benedictine reform most important intellectual movement in later anglo saxon england style fell out of favour after norman conquest and twelfth century chronicler william of malmesbury described it as disgusting and bombastic historians were equally dismissive until late twentieth century when scholars such as michael lapidge argued that it should be taken seriously as an important aspect of late anglo saxon culture definition in 1953 alistair campbell argued that there were two principal styles of latin in anglo saxon england one which he called classical was exemplified by writings of bede c 672 735 while english bishop aldhelm c 639 709 was most influential author of other school which extensively used rare words including greek ones derived from hermeneutic glossaries andy orchard contrasts limpid and direct prose style of bede with its basically biblical vocabulary and syntax with highly elaborate and ornate style of aldhelm with a vocabulary and syntax ultimately derived from latin verse aldhelm was most learned man in first four centuries of anglo saxon christianity with a profound knowledge of latin poetry unlike bede his style was highly influential in two centuries after his death and it was dominant in later anglo saxon england borrowing from greek was not confined to hermeneutic writers of latin in a 2005 study j n adams michael lapidge and tobias reinhardt observe that exhumation of poorly understood greek words from greek latin glossaries for purposes of stylistic ornamentation was widespread throughout middle ages in preface to his 1962 edition of aethelweard s chronicon campbell referred to hermeneutic tradition in 1975 michael lapidge developed campbell s distinction in an essay on hermeneutic style he stated that term implies that vocabulary is based mainly on hermeneumata a name for certain greek latin glossaries he did not consider term entirely satisfactory and suggested that would be an alternative but adopted hermeneutic because it had been used by other scholars jane stevenson also expresses dissatisfaction with term and in view of rebecca stephenson word hermeneutic itself is misleading since this style has nothing to do with modern field of hermeneutics nor does it feature words drawn from hermeneumata a set of greek and latin glossaries from which its exotic vocabulary was once thought to derive however both scholars reluctantly accept term style was formerly called hisperic but scholars now reject this term as wrongly suggesting that it is irish and think hisperic should be confined to language of very obscure hisperica famina lapidge states early development alt apuleius thumb depiction of apuleius first writer known to have used hermeneutic style hermeneutic style was possibly first seen in metamorphoses of apuleius in second century and it is also found in works by late latin writers such as ammianus marcellinus and martianus capella in britain and ireland style is found in authors on threshold of medieval period including british monk gildas irish missionary columbanus and anglo saxon bishop aldhelm and works such as hisperica famina anglo saxons were first people in europe who had to learn latin as a foreign language when they converted to christianity and in lapidge s view that they attained stylistic mastery in a medium alien to them is remarkable in itself influential ninth century irish philosopher johannes scotus eriugena had a thorough knowledge of greek and through his translations and use of unusual greek words in poetry helped to raise prestige of hermeneutic style style became fashionable at laon where johannes s colleague and fellow irishman martianus lectured hincmar of rheims rebuked his nephew hincmar of laon continental europe style is found in several centres on continent in tenth century in italy leading proponents were liutprand of cremona eugenius and atto of vercelli in germany works which display it include anonymous gesta and letters of of tegernsee french works which display hermeneutic style include of saint quentin s gesta ducum and libellus by two other french authors were particularly influential in england first two books of abbo of saint germain s bella describe siege of paris by normans from 888 to 895 they received very little circulation however in order to make work a trinity three volume work he added a book described by lapidge as a series of exhortations to monastic life written in a fiercely tangled and often inscrutable latin whose vocabulary is nearly all glossary based this became a very popular textbook especially in england other influential french author was odo of cluny who was probably a mentor of oda archbishop of canterbury 941 958 a driving force behind english benedictine reform and a proponent of hermeneutic style lapidge suggests that style in northern france was particularly associated with centres of cluniac benedictine reform and leading figures in english reform oda dunstan aethelwold and oswald were all practitioners of hermeneutic style and had strong connections with continental benedictine centres lapidge argues one might surmise that hermeneutic style was cultivated energetically in england in an attempt to show that english learning was as profound and english writing as sophisticated as anything produced on continent impetus for cultivation of style in tenth century england was therefore probably of continental origin a late proponent of style was german of echternach abbot of echternach between 1083 and 1110 who was strongly influenced by aldhelm england on continent some writers were exponents of hermeneutic style in england in later tenth century almost all were study of difficult texts had been a traditional part of latin education in england since days of aldhelm and he profoundly influenced later writers in tenth century england aldhelm and abbo were studied intensively whereas hermeneutic works did not form an important part of continental curriculum aldhelm s de virginitate on virginity was particularly influential and in 980s an english scholar requested permission from archbishop aethelgar to go to winchester to study it complaining that he had been starved of intellectual food a passage in de virginitate reads so against dread beast of pride and against these sevenfold brutes of poisonous vices which strive cruelly to tear apart with their rabid teeth and virulent fangs all who are unarmed despoiled of cuirass of virginity and stripped of shield of chastity virgins of christ and young champions of church must fight with muscle and strength against as it were ferocious legions of barbarians which in their troops never cease to batter tortoise of soldiers of christ with artillery of fraud struggle must go on manfully fought with darts of spiritual weaponry and iron tipped spears of virtues let us not like timid soldiers who dread shock of war and call of trumpeter offer to foe backs of our shoulders rather than bosses of our shields anglo latin suffered a severe decline in ninth century partly due to viking invasions but it began to revive in 890s under alfred great who revered aldhelm asser s life of king alfred has a hermeneutic flavour alfred was assisted by scholars he brought in from continental europe one of them was a german john old saxon and in lapidge s view a poem he wrote praising future king aethelstan and punning on old english meaning of aethelstan as noble stone marks an early sign of a revival of hermeneutic style you prince are called by name sovereign stone look happily on this prophecy for your age you shall be noble rock of samuel seer standing with mighty strength against devilish demons often an abundant cornfield foretells a great harvest in peaceful days your stony mass is to be softened you are more abundantly endowed with holy eminence of learning i pray you may seek and glorious one may grant fulfilment implied in your noble name revival of hermeneutic style was assisted by foreign scholars at court of king aethelstan in late 920s and 930s some of them such as israel grammarian practitioners of hermeneutic latin style was first seen in tenth century england in charters drafted between 928 and 935 by an anonymous scribe of king aethelstan called by scholars aethelstan a who was strongly influenced by aldhelm and by hiberno latin works which may have been brought to england by israel according to scott thompson smith charters of aethelstan a are generally characterised by a rich pleonastic style with aggressively literary proems and anathemas ostentatious language and imagery throughout decorative rhetorical figures elaborate dating clauses and extensive witness lists charters are first seen shortly after aethelstan had become first king of all england by his conquest of viking ruled northumbria in 927 and in view of mechthild gretsch charters are result of affection of a style associated with a glorious intellectual past in order to boost what was conceived as a glorious military and political achievement alt beginning of regularis concordia thumb beginning of regularis concordia drafted by aethelwold in hermeneutic style david woodman gives a translation of start of a charter drafted by aethelstan a s 416 issued on 12 november 931 lamentable and loudly detestable sins of this tottering age surrounded by dire of obscene and fearsome mortality challenge and urge us not carefree in a homeland where peace has been attained but as it were teetering over an abyss of fetid corruption that we should flee those things not only by despising them together with their misfortunes with whole effort of our mind but also by hating them just like wearisome nausea of melancholy striving towards that gospel text give and it will be given unto you only one short hermeneutic work by mid century archbishop of canterbury oda survives but his influence can be seen in his protege of canterbury s vitae described by lapidge as most difficult anglo latin text which may dubiously be described as masterpiece of anglo latin hermeneutic style lapidge states that hermeneutic style was practised with considerable flair and enthusiasm at canterbury other centres of style were also closely associated with leaders of benedictine reform ramsey abbey founded by oswald bishop of worcester glastonbury abbey where future archbishop of canterbury dunstan was abbot in 940s and winchester where aethelwold was bishop there are different emphases in various centres a predilection for neologisms at canterbury and for at winchester while leading ramsey scholar byrhtferth favoured unusual polysyllabic adverbs most important document of benedictine reform regularis concordia drafted by aethelwold was written in hermeneutic style strongly influenced by aldhelm discussing ideology of reform movement caroline brett comments use of hermeneutic latin with its deliberately obscure neologisms and verbal borrowings must have sent potent signals of a learned caste guardians of arcane yet powerful knowledge lapidge gives a translation of a poem by dunstan christ you grant o omnipotent father may you deign to bring rewards to donor you who above depths and realms of heaven as well as earth and at same time recesses of sea throughout all this world you rule angelic citizens of such bounteous merit and may you grant to grow in me seed of holy labour by which i may always be able to hymn appropriately your name o you son who concealed in your mother s womb you gather together peoples by your father s act for i perchance am able to compose a holy narrative because you are seen to be god because glorious one glittering stars show you to world and i ask after close of my life that you grant to me from throne of heaven to take a tiny gift because of honour i have attained i beseech you holy spirit of father and son for when holy throng re echoes its songs may i then with humble voice be able to ascend quickly as i leave grave bearing then holy prayers of saints who already have scorned this present world of dust with their learned outpourings and may i fearlessly be able to pour out my glorious song to god virgin whom messenger salutes in angelic speech you were born without stain i ask that you implore him who born from conception of celestial seed holds mysterious command as deity to forgive me my sins that he may deign to grant joys through his own eternity and to look upon me with sight of his holy vision grant i beseech you o prophetic fathers o you patriarchs o you prophets of angelic distinction o you leaders blessedly confessing with lord his holy governance abraham elijah enoch his companion together with all rest that king quickly deign to render skilfully his aid to me in three sounds of o lest deceitful one who rules in front of nine fallen orders be able to say word now i beseech ancient fathers with peter their leader on behalf of wretched and anxious me pour out your prayers and aid so that custodian of each new saint may afterwards forgive me until i may overcome hideous enemy of this world christ you grant in late tenth century latin had higher prestige than anglo saxon and hermeneutic latin had higher prestige than simple latin this presented byrhtferth with a problem in his enchiridion a school text designed to teach complicated rules for calculating date of easter as hermeneutic latin is unsuitable for pedagogic instruction his solution was to include passages in hermeneutic latin condemning ignorant and lazy secular clergy who he said refused to learn latin thus justifying using anglo saxon to provide clear explanations for their benefit in a passage in latin he wrote some ignorant clerics reject calculations of this kind for shame and do not wish to keep their that is they do not preserve order which they have received in bosom of mother church nor do they persist in holy teaching of meditation they should consider carefully way of pharisees and sadducees and they should spit out their doctrine like filth a cleric ought to be keeper of his own soul just as a noble man subjects a young foal to yoke so he ought to subject his own soul to service by filling alabaster box with precious oil that is he ought to be inwardly subjected daily by obeying divine laws and admonitions of redeemer byrhtferth aimed for an elevated style but he was frequently guilty of solecisms caused by overreaching his ability in latin almost all proponents of style were clerical but there is one notable exception ealdorman aethelweard was a descendant of king aethelred i grandfather of an archbishop of canterbury and patron of aelfric of eynsham one major english writer of period who rejected style aethelweard s chronicon was a translation into hermeneutic latin of a lost version of anglo saxon chronicle his style is regarded by historians as eccentric and at times unintelligible in view of angelika lutz his prose was influenced by anglo saxon heroic poetry as well as latin and greek sources that it was later viewed as a failure may be attributed both to his limited command of latin grammar and his extreme stylistic pretensions in 2005 lapidge reflected thirty years ago when i first attempted to describe characteristic features of tenth century anglo latin literature i was rather naively bedazzled by display of vocabulary which one encounters there because much of vocabulary appeared to derive either from aldhelm or from glossaries of type called hermeneumata i followed scholarly tradition and described style as hermeneutic on assumption that principal impulse behind verbal display was that of dazzling reader with arcane vocabulary exhumed from greek latin glossaries and authors such as aldhelm i now suspect that perception needs modification that authors principal aim was not obfuscation but was their misguided perhaps attempt to reach in their prose a high stylistic register decline after norman conquest authors rejected hermeneutic style twelfth century chronicler william of malmesbury expressed his disgust at language he considered bombastic in frank stenton s view byrhtferth s hermeneutic life of oswald gives a poor impression of quality of english scholarship he described it as a disorderly work written in a flamboyant prose studded with strange words which had to be explained by glosses inserted between lines lapidge describes repudiation of hermeneutic style by modern scholars as disappointing invariably it is castigated as uncouth or barbarous and its practitioners are dismissed with contempt as fellows of dogberry in his view however unpalatable this style might be to modern taste it was none less a vital and pervasive aspect of late anglo saxon culture and it deserves closer and more sympathetic attention than it has previously received notes citations sources further reading category early medieval latin literature category language and literature in anglo saxon england
