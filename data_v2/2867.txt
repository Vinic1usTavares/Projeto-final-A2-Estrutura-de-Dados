common torpedo torpedo torpedo also known as ocellate torpedo or eyed electric ray is a species of electric ray in family torpedinidae it is found in mediterranean sea and eastern atlantic ocean from bay of biscay to angola and is a benthic fish typically encountered over soft substrates in fairly shallow coastal waters growing to long this species has a nearly circular pectoral fin disc and a short thick tail with two dorsal fins of nearly equal size and a large caudal fin it can be identified by prominent blue spots on its back which usually number five but may vary from zero to nine as well as by small knobs on rims of its spiracles for attack and defense common torpedo can deliver a strong electric shock of up to 200 volts it is a solitary nocturnal ambush predator that feeds mainly on bony fishes and crustaceans this species is aplacental viviparous with developing embryos nourished by yolk and histotroph uterine milk produced by mother females produce litters of up to 28 young every year in late summer or autumn after a gestation period of 4 8 months specifics vary between geographical regions common torpedo s shock is painful but otherwise of little danger to humans its electrogenic properties led it to be used in medicine by ancient greeks and romans in modern times it has no economic value and is mostly discarded when caught as bycatch in fisheries impact of fishing on its population is uncertain and pending more data international union for conservation of nature iucn has listed it as data deficient taxonomy common torpedo and other electric rays were familiar to peoples of classical antiquity torpedo was roman name for electric rays derived from latin meaning to be numb carl linnaeus known as father of taxonomy scientifically described common torpedo as raja torpedo in 1758 tenth edition of his systema naturae however common torpedo also appeared in at least 52 pre linnaean sources under various names such as torpedo raja laevis torpedo and torpedo sinus these early accounts including linnaeus s confounded common torpedo with other electric ray species as linnaeus did not indicate any type specimens designation of a lectotype or neotype is warranted in interest of taxonomic stability this measure has yet to be taken andre marie constant dumeril was first author to refer to torpedo as a genus in his 1806 zoologie analytique ou naturelle de classification des animaux dumeril did not name any torpedo species first author to do so was probably charles lucien bonaparte who assigned linnaeus s raja torpedo to genus torpedo in 1838 since at time t torpedo was only member of genus it became type species within genus torpedo common torpedo is placed within subgenus torpedo which differs from other subgenus tetronarce in having spiracles with papillate rims and ornate dorsal coloration this species may also be referred colloquially to as crampfish cramp ray or torpedo ray distribution and habitat native to eastern atlantic ocean common torpedo occurs from bay of biscay to angola including all around mediterranean sea a single record from belgian waters was most likely erroneous in european waters it is encountered less frequently than other electric ray species this species prefers warmer temperatures it is rare north of mediterranean and within mediterranean it is more common off north africa than off southern europe common torpedo is a bottom dweller usually found close to shore at depths of though it has occasionally been reported from as deep as it inhabits soft bottomed habitats such as sandy flats and seagrass beds description thumb left common torpedo usually has five blue spots on its back which distinguishes it from other electric rays pectoral fin disc of common torpedo is almost circular in shape and about 1 3 1 4 times wider than long front margin of disc is nearly straight two large kidney shaped electric organs are visible beneath skin on either side of head eyes are small and followed by spiracles of comparable size lateral and posterior rims of spiracles bear small low knobs which diminish in size with age and may be indiscernible in larger individuals on nape behind spiracles there is a pair of prominent mucous pores there is a wide quadrangular flap of skin between nostrils that almost reaches mouth teeth are small and arranged in a dense quincunx pattern each tooth has a single sharp cusp there are around 22 24 and 20 22 tooth rows in upper and lower jaws respectively five pairs of gill slits are placed on underside of disc pelvic fins are distinct from disc and have rounded outer margins short and thick tail bears skin folds along either side and two dorsal fins on top first dorsal fin is slightly larger than second well developed caudal fin is triangular with blunt corners and is approximately as long as space between it and first dorsal fin skin is smooth and soft entirely lacking dermal denticles dorsal coloration of common torpedo is light to dark brown with distinctive large spots ocellae on disc each ocellus is blue and encircled by darker and lighter rings typically there are five ocellae arranged symmetrically in a row of three and another of two rays with 0 4 ocellae are less common and those with more than five are rarer still an unusual male with eight ocellae was caught off tunisia and another with nine off southern france when present sixth ocellus is similarly sized to first five and positioned at their center any additional ocellae tend to be smaller than first six and placed asymmetrically towards snout underside is cream colored with dark disc margins an adult albino female was captured off tunisia males and females typically measure long respectively largest individual on record was long rays from off west africa grow larger than those from mediterranean biology and ecology thumb common torpedo is an ambush predator that lies in wait for prey on sea bottom thumb drawing collected by felix platter anonymous 1546 1558 as with other members of its family common torpedo can subdue prey and deter threats with strong electric shocks generated from a pair of large electric organs derived from muscle tissue each organ is made up of 400 500 columns each column constituting a stack of around 400 jelly filled disks columns together essentially act as batteries connected in parallel discharge of electric organs can reach 200 volts and may occur singly or in bursts trains experiments in vitro have found that nerves electric organ essentially stop functioning at temperatures below winter water temperatures regularly drop below this threshold in wild suggesting ray may not use its electric organs for part of year or has a yet unknown physiological mechanism to adapt electric organ function to colder conditions solitary and nocturnal common torpedo spends much time resting on sea floor often buried in sediment it is an ambush predator that pounces onto prey and stuns them with electricity process taking only a fraction of a second once prey is immobilized it is manipulated to mouth with motions of disc and swallowed whole adults feed almost entirely on small benthic bony fishes including soles herring mullet gobies goatfishes porgies and jack large decapod crustaceans are a minor secondary food source while very rarely skates may be consumed juveniles are less exclusively piscivorous than adults and feed on a variety of invertebrates as well most significant prey species differ between seasons and geographic regions for example in tyrrhenian sea juvenile common sole solea solea are by far most important prey item in autumn and winter but in spring and summer they become less available and other fishes figure more prominently in ray s diet known parasites of this species include tapeworm phyllobothrium lactuca and monogeneans and amphibdelloides life history common torpedo is aplacental viviparous in which embryos are sustained by yolk supplemented by histotroph uterine milk secreted by mother however organic content of histotroph in this species is only 1 2 much lower than in stingrays and embryo loses mass over course of development as its initial yolk supply is expended for metabolic processes adult females have two functional ovaries and two functional uteruses though reproductive tract on right side is more developed and consequently tends to carry more embryos it has an annual reproductive cycle with well defined seasonality though details differ between geographic regions in mediterranean mating occurs from december to february and birthing from late august to early september after a gestation period of 4 6 months litter sizes range up to 19 and newborns measure long by contrast off west africa gestation period lasts 6 8 months and birthing occurs from september to october litter sizes range up to 28 and newborns measure long litter size increases with female size sexual segregation occurs during breeding season as pregnant females move into shallow coastal waters common torpedo is unusual among sharks and rays in that birthing has been documented both at higher and at lower salinities than seawater in estuaries and lagoons immediately after birth this species is capable of producing electric shocks of up to four volts newborns grow rapidly with a commensurate increase in electrogenic capacity after four months they almost double in weight and can generate 26 volts males and females mature sexually at similar lengths respectively in tyrrhenian sea respectively off egypt for both off tunisia and respectively off senegal human interactions electric shock of common torpedo can be severe but is not life threatening in classical antiquity electrogenic properties of this species led it and other strongly electric fishes to be used in medicine for treatment of pain and diseases such as gout for example roman physician scribonius in his c 50 ad recommended that chronic headaches be treated by application of a live torpedo to affected area common torpedo is edible but is little valued by commercial or artisanal fisheries and is mostly discarded when caught because of its shallow water habits it may survive being captured and discarded relatively well it is susceptible to several types of demersal fishing gear including bottom trawls and trammel nets fishing activity is heavy within its range but no specific data regarding this species are available as a result international union for conservation of nature iucn has listed it under data deficient
