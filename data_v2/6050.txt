canadian national vimy memorial is a war memorial site in france dedicated to memory of canadian expeditionary force members killed during first world war it also serves as place of commemoration for canadian soldiers of first world war killed or presumed dead in france who have no known grave monument is centrepiece of a preserved battlefield park that encompasses a portion of ground over which canadian corps made their assault during initial battle of vimy ridge offensive of battle of arras battle of vimy ridge was first time all four divisions of canadian expeditionary force participated in a battle as a cohesive formation and it became a canadian national symbol of achievement and sacrifice france ceded to canada perpetual use of a portion of land on vimy ridge on understanding that canada use land to establish a battlefield park and memorial wartime tunnels trenches craters and unexploded munitions still honeycomb grounds of site which remains largely closed off for reasons of public safety along with preserved trench lines several other memorials and cemeteries are contained within park project took designer walter seymour allward eleven years to build king edward viii unveiled it on 26 july 1936 in presence of french president albert lebrun and a crowd of over 50 000 people including 6 200 attendees from canada following an extensive multi year restoration queen

historic sites of canada located outside country other being beaumont hamel newfoundland memorial background topography vimy ridge is a gradually rising escarpment on western edge of douai plains northeast of arras ridge gradually rises on its western side dropping more quickly on eastern side ridge is approximately in length wide at its narrowest point and culminates at an elevation of above

under german control in october 1914 during race to sea as franco british and german forces continually attempted to outflank each other through northeastern france french tenth army attempted to dislodge germans from region during second battle of artois in may 1915 by attacking their positions at vimy ridge and notre dame de lorette during attack french 1st moroccan division briefly captured height of ridge where vimy memorial is currently located but was unable to hold it owing to a lack of reinforcements french made another attempt during third battle of artois in september 1915 but were once again unsuccessful in capturing top of ridge french suffered approximately 150 000 casualties in their attempts to gain control of vimy ridge and surrounding territory british xvii corps relieved french tenth army from sector in february 1916 on 21 may 1916 german infantry attacked british lines along a front in an effort to force them from positions along base of ridge germans captured several british controlled tunnels and mine craters before halting their advance and entrenching their positions temporary lieutenant richard basil jones was posthumously awarded victoria cross for his ultimately unsuccessful defence of crater during attack british counter attacks on 22 may did not manage to change situation canadian corps relieved british iv corps stationed along western slopes of vimy ridge in october 1916 battle of vimy ridge battle of vimy ridge was first instance in which all four canadian divisions participated in a battle together as a cohesive formation nature and size of planned canadian corps assault necessitated support and resources beyond its normal operational capabilities consequently british 5th infantry division and supplementary artillery engineer and labour units reinforced four canadian divisions already in place 24th british division of i corps supported canadian corps along its northern flank while xvii corps did so to south ad hoc

increments often every three minutes while medium and heavy howitzers established a series of standing barrages against known defensive systems further ahead 1st 2nd and 3rd canadian divisions quickly captured their first objectives 4th canadian division encountered a great deal of trouble during its advance and was unable to complete its first objective until some hours later 1st 2nd and 3rd canadian divisions captured their second objective by approximately 7 30 am failure of 4th canadian division to capture top of ridge delayed further advances and forced 3rd canadian division to expend resources establishing a defensive line to its north reserve units from 4th canadian division renewed attack on german positions on top of ridge and eventually forced german troops holding southwestern portion of hill 145 to withdraw on morning of 10 april canadian corps commander lieutenant general julian byng moved up three fresh brigades to support continued advance fresh units leapfrogged units already in place and captured third objective line including hill 135 and town of thelus by 11 00 am by 2 00 pm both 1st and 2nd canadian divisions reported capturing their final objectives by this point pimple a heavily defended knoll west of town of givenchy en gohelle was only german position remaining on vimy ridge on 12 april 10th canadian brigade attacked and quickly overcame hastily entrenched german troops with support of artillery and 24th british division by nightfall on 12 april canadian corps was in firm control of ridge canadian corps suffered 10 602 casualties 3 598 killed and 7 004 wounded german sixth army suffered an unknown number of casualties and around 4 000 men became prisoners of war although battle is not generally considered canada s greatest military achievement image of national unity and achievement imbued battle with considerable national significance for canada according to pierce historical reality of battle has been reworked and reinterpreted in a conscious attempt to give purpose and meaning to an event that came to symbolize canada s coming of age as a nation idea that canada s identity and nationhood were born out of battle is an opinion that is widely held in military and general histories of canada history selection thumb right design competition submissions alt approximately a dozen monument models sit on tables in a stone walled room in 1920 government of canada announced that imperial war graves commission had awarded canada eight sites five in france and three in belgium on which to erect memorials each site represented a significant canadian engagement and canadian government initially decided that each battlefield be treated equally and commemorated with identical monuments in september 1920 canadian government formed canadian battlefields memorials commission to discuss process and conditions for holding a memorial competition for sites in europe commission held its first meeting on 26 november 1920 and during this meeting decided that architectural design competition would be open to all canadian architects designers sculptors and artists jury consisted of charles herbert reilly representing royal institute of british architects paul philippe cret representing societe centrale des francais and frank darling representing royal architectural institute of canada each jury member was a leader in architectural field reilly was training students in design and development of war memorials and cret had been selected by united states to design national monuments in europe interested parties submitted 160 design drawings and jury selected 17 submissions for consideration commissioning each finalist to produce a plaster of their respective design jury recommended in a 10 september 1921 report to commission that two of designs be executed in october 1921 commission formally selected submission of toronto sculptor and designer walter seymour allward as winner of competition design submitted by frederick chapman clemesha was selected as runner up complexity of allward s design precluded possibility of duplicating design at each site approach of selecting one primary memorial ran counter to recommendation of canadian battlefields memorials commission architectural advisor percy erskine nobbs who had consistently expressed his preference for a series of smaller monuments consensus went in allward s favour his design receiving both public and critical approval commission revised its initial plans and decided to build two distinctive memorials those of allward and clemesha and six smaller identical memorials thumb left a design model of memorial alt a white plaster design model of vimy memorial from front side displayed against a black background at outset members of commission debated where to build allward s winning design jury s assessment was that allward s submission was best suited to a low hill rather than to a continuous and lofty bluff or cliff like vimy ridge commission committee initially recommended placing monument in belgium on hill 62 near location of battle of mont sorrel as site provided an imposing view this ran counter to desires of prime minister william lyon mackenzie king who while speaking in house of commons of canada in may 1922 argued in favour of placing memorial at vimy ridge king s position received unanimous support of house and in end commission selected vimy ridge as preferred site government announced its desire to acquire a more considerable tract of land along ridge after commission selected vimy ridge as preferred location for allward s design in interval between 1st and 2nd session of 14th canadian parliament speaker of house of commons of canada rodolphe lemieux went to france to negotiate acquisition of more land on 5 december 1922 lemieux concluded an agreement with france in which france granted canada freely and for all time use of of land on vimy ridge inclusive of hill 145 in recognition of canada s war effort only condition placed on donation was that canada use land to erect a monument commemorating canadian soldiers killed during first world war and assume responsibility for maintenance of memorial and surrounding battlefield park memorial construction thumb right alt scaffolding surrounds a half finished concrete foundation dozens of metal steel poles rise from foundation a dozen workmen are visible and involved in various construction tasks laying foundation of memorial following competition allward spent remainder of 1921 and spring of 1922 preparing for his move to europe after selling his home and studio allward finally departed for belgium on 6 june 1922 and spent several months seeking a suitable studio in belgium and then paris though he eventually set up a studio in london allward had initially hoped to use white marble for memorial s facing stone but percy nobbs suggested this would be a mistake because marble was unlikely to weather well in northern france and memorial would have a ghost like appearance allward undertook a tour of almost two years to find stone of right colour texture and luminosity he found it in ruins of diocletian s palace at split croatia he observed that palace had not weathered over years which allward took as evidence of stone s durability his choice seget limestone came from an ancient roman quarry located near seget croatia difficulties with quarrying process coupled with complicated transportation logistics delayed delivery of limestone and thus construction of memorial first shipment did not arrive at site until 1927 and larger blocks intended for human figures did not begin to arrive until 1931 on allward s urging canadian battlefields memorials commission hired oscar faber a danish structural engineer in 1924 to prepare foundation plans and provide general supervision of foundation work faber had recently designed substructure for menin gate at ypres and he selected a design that employed cast in place reinforced concrete to which facing stone would be bonded major unwin simson served as principal canadian engineer during construction of memorial and oversaw much of daily operations at site allward moved to paris in 1925 to supervise construction and carving of sculptures construction commenced in 1925 and took eleven years to complete imperial war graves commission concurrently employed french and british veterans to carry out necessary roadwork and site landscaping while awaiting first delivery of stone simson noticed that battlefield landscape features were beginning to deteriorate seeing an opportunity to not only preserve a portion of battlefield but also keep his staff occupied simson decided to preserve a short section of trench line and make grange subway more accessible labourers rebuilt and preserved sections of sandbagged trench wall on both canadian and german sides of grange crater group in concrete workforce also built a new concrete entrance for grange subway and after excavating a portion of tunnel system installed electric lighting left thumb statue carving in progress alt partially completed statue of

limestone bonded to a cast concrete frame a foundation bed of 11 000 tonnes of concrete reinforced with hundreds of tonnes of steel served as support bed for memorial memorial base and twin pylons contained almost 6 000 tonnes of seget limestone sculptors carved 20 approximately double life sized human figures on site from large blocks of stone carvers used half size plaster models produced by allward in his studio now on display at canadian war museum and an instrument called a pantograph to reproduce figures at proper scale carvers conducted their work year round inside temporary studios built around each figure inclusion of names of those killed in france with no known grave was not part of original design and allward was unhappy when government asked him to include them allward argued that inclusion of names was not part of original commissioning through a letter to canadian battlefields memorials commission in october 1927 allward indicated his intention to relegate names of missing to pavement stones around monument collective dismay and uproar of commission forced allward to relent and incorporate names of missing on memorial walls task of inscribing names did not begin until early 1930s and employed a typeface that allward designed for monument pilgrimage and unveiling thumb right upright special passport issued by canada for 1936 vimy pilgrimage alt a passport with canadian coat of arms in middle and text in both french and english identifying book as a passport for vimy pilgrimage in 1919 year after war ended around 60 000 british tourists and mourners made pilgrimages to western front transatlantic voyage was longer and more expensive from canada many attempts to organize large pilgrimages failed and journeys overseas were largely made individually or in small unofficial groups delegates of 1928 national convention of canadian legion passed a unanimous resolution asking that a pilgrimage be organized to western front battlefields a plan began to take form wherein legion aimed to coordinate pilgrimage with unveiling of vimy memorial which at time was expected to be completed in 1931 or 1932 due to construction delays with memorial it was not until july 1934 that canadian legion announced a pilgrimage to former battlefield sites in conjunction with unveiling of memorial although exact date of memorial unveiling was still not set legion invited former service members to make tentative reservations with their headquarters in ottawa response from veterans and their families was enthusiastic 1 200 inquiries by november 1934 legion announced that memorial would be unveiled on dominion day 1 july 1936 even though government still did not know when it would be completed for event planning purposes legion and government established areas for which each was responsible government was responsible for selection of official delegation and program for official unveiling of memorial legion was responsible for more challenging task of organizing pilgrimage for legion this included planning meals accommodations and transportation for what was at time largest single peacetime movement of people from canada to europe legion took position that pilgrimage would be funded by its members without subsidies or financial aid from canadian taxpayers and by early 1935 they had established that price of 3 1 2 week trip inclusive of all meals accommodation health insurance and sea and land transportation would be per person as of 2016 indirect assistance came in a number of forms government waived passport fees and made a special vimy passport available to pilgrims at no extra cost government and private sector also provided paid leave for their participating employees it was not until april 1936 that government was prepared to publicly commit to an unveiling date 26 july 1936 on 16 july five transatlantic liners escorted by and departed port of montreal with approximately 6 200 passengers and arrived in le havre on 24 and 25 july limited accommodation made it necessary for legion to lodge pilgrims in nine cities throughout northern france and belgium and employ 235 buses to move pilgrims

french president albert lebrun and a crowd of over 50 000 attended event absent though was canadian prime minister william lyon mackenzie king it being well understood that he was generally not comfortable around veterans and felt it more appropriate for a war veteran in cabinet to act as minister in attendance before ceremony began king edward viii present in his capacity as king of canada

general safety of memorial canada could do little more than protect sculptures and bases of pylons with sandbags and await developments when war did break out in september 1939 british expeditionary force bef deployed to france and assumed responsibility for arras sector which included vimy in late may 1940 following british retreat to dunkirk after battle of arras status and condition of memorial became unknown to allied forces germans took control of site and held site s caretaker george stubbs in an ilag internment camp for allied civilians in st denis france rumoured destruction of vimy memorial either during fighting or at hands of germans was widely reported in canada and united kingdom rumours led german ministry of public enlightenment and propaganda to formally deny accusations that germany had damaged or desecrated memorial to demonstrate memorial had not been desecrated adolf hitler who reportedly admired memorial for its peaceful nature was photographed by press while personally touring it and preserved trenches on 2 june 1940 undamaged state of memorial was not confirmed until september 1944 when british troops of 2nd battalion welsh guards of guards armoured division recaptured vimy ridge post war years immediately following second world war very little attention was paid to battle of vimy ridge or vimy memorial winnipeg free press and legionary magazine of royal canadian legion were only publications to note 35th anniversary of battle in 1952 40th anniversary in 1957 received even less notice with only halifax herald making any mention interest in commemoration remained low in early 1960s but increased in 1967 with 50th anniversary of battle paired with canadian centennial a heavily attended ceremony at memorial in april 1967 was broadcast live on television commemoration of battle decreased once again throughout 1970s and only returned in force with 125th anniversary of canadian confederation and widely covered 75th anniversary of battle in 1992 1992 ceremony at memorial was attended by canadian prime minister brian mulroney and at least 5 000 people subsequent smaller scale ceremonies were held at memorial in

in france and belgium in order to maintain and present them in a respectful and dignified manner in 2005 vimy memorial closed for major restoration work veterans affairs canada directed restoration of memorial in cooperation with other canadian departments commonwealth war graves commission consultants and specialists in military history time wear and severe weather conditions led to many identified problems single most pervasive being water damage in building a memorial made of cast concrete covered in stone allward had failed to take into account how these materials would shift over time builders and designer failed to incorporate sufficient space between concrete and stones which resulted in water infiltrating structure through its walls and platforms dissolving lime in concrete foundation and masonry as water exited it deposited lime on exterior surfaces obscuring many of names inscribed thereon poor drainage and water flows off monument also caused significant deterioration of platform terrace and stairs restoration project was intended to address root causes of damage and included repairs to stone walkways walls terraces stairs and platforms in order to respect allward s initial vision of a seamless structure restoration team were required to remove all foreign materials employed in patchwork repairs replace damaged stones with material from original quarry in croatia and correct all minor displacement of stones caused by freeze thaw activity underlying structural flaws were also corrected queen elizabeth ii escorted by prince philip duke of edinburgh

carved into wall above each group to symbolize victory and peace in breaking of sword three young men are present one of whom is crouching and breaking his sword this statue represents defeat of militarism and general desire for peace this grouping of figures is most overt image to pacifism in monument breaking of a sword being extremely uncommon in war memorials original plan for sculpture included one figure crushing a german helmet with his foot it was later decided to dismiss this feature because of its overtly militaristic imagery in sympathy of canadians for helpless one man stands erect while three other figures stricken by hunger or disease are crouched and kneeling around him standing man represents canada s sympathy for weak and oppressed figure of a cloaked young woman

285 canadians killed in france whose final resting place is unknown most commonwealth war graves commission memorials present names in a descending list format in a manner that permits modification of panels as remains are found and identified allward instead sought to present names as a seamless list and decided to do so by inscribing names in continuous bands across both vertical and horizontal seams around base of monument as a consequence as remains were discovered it was not possible to remove commemorated names without interrupting seamless list and as a consequence there are individuals who have a known grave but are commemorated on memorial memorial contains names of four posthumous victoria cross recipients robert grierson combe frederick hobson william johnstone milne and robert

brigade commanders colonels gaston cros and louis augustus theodore grange subway first world war s western front included an extensive system of tunnels subways and dugouts grange subway is a tunnel system that is approximately in length and once connected reserve lines to front line this permitted soldiers to advance to front quickly securely and unseen a portion of this tunnel system is open to public through regular guided tours provided by canadian student guides arras vimy sector was conducive to tunnel excavation owing to soft porous yet extremely stable nature of chalk underground as a result pronounced underground warfare had been a feature of vimy sector since 1915 in preparation for battle of vimy ridge five british tunnelling companies excavated 12 subways along canadian corps front longest of which was in length tunnellers excavated subways at a depth of 10 metres to ensure protection from large calibre howitzer shellfire subways were often dug at a pace of four metres a day and were often two metres tall and one metre wide this underground network often incorporated or included concealed light rail lines hospitals command posts water reservoirs ammunition stores

that canada s national identity and nationhood were born out of battle of vimy ridge is an opinion that is widely repeated in military and general histories of canada historian denise thomson suggests that construction of vimy memorial represents culmination of an increasingly assertive nationalism that developed in canada during interwar period hucker suggests that memorial transcends battle of vimy ridge and now serves as an enduring image of whole first world war while expressing enormous impact of war in general and also considers that 2005 restoration project serves as evidence of a new generation s determination to remember canada s contribution and sacrifice during first world war historic sites and monuments board of canada recognized importance of site by recommending its designation as one of national historic sites of canada it was so designated in 1996 and is one of only two outside of canada other is beaumont hamel newfoundland memorial also in france remembrance has also taken other forms vimy foundation having been established to preserve and promote canada s first world war legacy as symbolized by victory at battle of vimy ridge and vimy ridge day to commemorate deaths and casualties during battle local vimy resident georges spent 13 years until his death in 2009 offering car rides to canadian tourists to and from memorial at no charge as a way of paying tribute to canadians who fought at vimy memorial is not without its critics alana vincent has argued that constituent parts of monument are in conflict and as a result message conveyed by monument is not unified visually vincent argues there is a dichotomy between triumphant pose of figures at top of pylons and mourning posture of those figures at base textually she argues inscription
