battle of taegu was an engagement between united nations command un and north korean forces early in korean war with fighting continuing from august 5 20 1950 around city of taegu south korea it was a part of battle of pusan perimeter and was one of several large engagements fought simultaneously battle ended in a victory for un after their forces were able to drive off an offensive by korean people s army kpa divisions attempting to cross naktong river and assault city five kpa divisions massed around city preparing to cross naktong river and assault it from north and west defending city were us 1st cavalry division and republic of korea army rok ii corps in a series of engagements each of kpa divisions attempted to cross naktong and attack defending forces success of these attacks varied by region but attacks in 1st cavalry division sector were repulsed and attacks in rok sector were more successful during battle however kpa troops were able to surprise us troops on hill 303 and capture them late in battle these troops were machine gunned in hill 303 massacre despite these setbacks un forces were successful in driving most of kpa off but decisive battle to secure city would occur during battle of bowling alley background outbreak of war following invasion of south korea by north korea and outbreak of korean war on june 25 1950 united nations security council voted to send armed forces to defend south korea united states a permanent member of security council immediately deployed armed forces us navy and us air force usaf units to southeastern south korea because of their immediate availability from their bases in japan and okinawa where military occupation of japan was still in effect countries such as australia canada new zealand and united kingdom all quickly contributed naval ships in support of un action goal of american armed forces was to support remnants of rok in fighting back north korean invasion but only in southeastern part of south korea around major seaport of pusan to prevent complete collapse of rok and of south korean government however un commander general douglas macarthur after an inspection trip to south korea realised us army ground forces would need to be committed at time of north korean invasion closest us ground force was 24th infantry division which was based in japan this division had fewer than its normal contingent of soldiers and most of its equipment was rather old due to u s congress s reductions in military spending in any case 24th infantry division was only part of us army that was available to quickly reinforce south korea thumb left alt soldiers carrying their bags off of a train in a korean train station task force smith arrives in south korea thus 24th infantry division was first american armed force sent to south korea with mission to blunt advance of kpa and to set up a defensive perimeter around pusan pusan perimeter with aid of usaf us navy and united states marine corps aviation forces macarthur decided to have his us and rok troops to dig in around pusan and hold on until he could assemble a powerful force x corps to make an amphibious counterattack at inchon on northwestern coast of south korea near seoul later on in 1950 24th infantry division along with rok held out inside pusan perimeter and awaited reinforcements and counterattacks against kpa among us units that reinforced pusan perimeter as soon as they could arrive were 1st cavalry division 7th infantry division and 25th infantry divisions along with other units of us eighth army that provided logistical medical and intelligence support advance units of 24th infantry division were badly defeated in battle of osan on july 5 in first encounter between us and kpa troops for first month after defeat at osan 24th division were repeatedly pushed back and forced southeastward by larger numbers of kpa troops equipped with rugged soviet made t 34 tanks troops of 24th division were systematically pushed southeast in battle of chochiwon battle of chonan and battle of pyongtaek as well as in smaller engagements 24th division made a desperate stand against kpa in battle of taejon where it was badly battered but it delayed kpa advance until july 20 by that time eighth army s force of combat troops were roughly equal in numbers to kpa forces attacking pusan perimeter with new un forces arriving from america australia new zealand etc nearly every day north korean advance thumb 250px tactical map of pusan perimeter in august 1950 fight at p ohang dong occurred between north and south korean forces on northeastern line alt a map of a perimeter on southeastern tip of a land mass with city of taejon captured kpa began surrounding pusan perimeter on north and west in an attempt to crush it kpa 4th and 6th infantry divisions advanced south in a wide flanking maneuver these two kpa divisions attempted to turn un left flank in order to capture pusan from southwest but they became dispersed in process they were also exposed to repeated air attacks from usaf and us navy kpa attacked us troops with superior numbers at first and with t 34 tanks but despite local defeats un troops with help of aviation and naval units were able to extend pusan perimeter all way south to east china sea and to blunt all kpa attacks toward pusan american air supremacy over pusan perimeter was a significant factor in helping un ground forces maintain their positions un forces were pushed back repeatedly before finally halting kpa advance in a series of battles around edges of pusan perimeter forces of 3rd battalion 29th infantry newly arrived in country were wiped out at hadong in a coordinated ambush by kpa forces on july 27 opening a pass to pusan area soon after kpa forces took chinju to west pushing back us 19th infantry regiment and leaving routes to pusan open for more kpa attacks us formations were subsequently able to defeat and push back kpa on flank in battle of notch on august 2 suffering mounting losses kpa force in west withdrew for several days to re equip and receive reinforcements this granted both sides a reprieve to prepare for attack on pusan perimeter taegu in meantime eighth army commander lieutenant general walton walker had established taegu as eighth army s headquarters right at center of pusan perimeter taegu stood at entrance to naktong river valley an area where kpa forces could advance in large numbers in close support natural barriers provided by naktong river to south and mountainous terrain to north converged around taegu which was also major transportation hub and last major south korean city aside from pusan itself to remain in un hands from south to north city was defended by 1st cavalry division and rok 1st and 6th divisions of rok ii corps 1st cavalry division was spread out along a long line along naktong river to south with its 5th and 8th cavalry regiments holding a line along river south of waegwan facing west 7th cavalry regiment held position to east in reserve along with artillery forces ready to reinforce anywhere a crossing could be attempted rok 1st division held a northwest facing line in

from south to north 10th 3rd 15th 13th and 1st divisions occupied a wide line encircling taegu from tuksong dong and around waegwan to kunwi kpa planned to use natural corridor of naktong valley from sangju to taegu as its main axis of attack for next push south so divisions all eventually moved through this valley crossing naktong at different areas along low ground elements of 105th armored division also supported attack battle on night of august 4 to 5 kpa 13th division began crossing naktong river at naktong ni northwest of taegu crossing was not discovered until august 5 when rok artillery and mortar fire was called on crossing over course of three nights kpa soldiers from division s three regiments crossed river on rafts or by wading carrying their weapons and equipment over their heads entire division was across by august 7 and assembling several miles from rok 1st division s prepared defenses at same time kpa 1st division crossed river on barges between ang and sangju in rok 6th division s sector from august 6 to 8 this attack was discovered quickly by us reconnaissance planes and kpa 1st division was immediately engaged by rok forces two divisions locked in battle

kpa 1st and 13th divisions were converging on tabu dong area about north of taegu kpa 15th division next of kpa divisions in line to south received 1 500 replacements at kumch on on august 5 which brought its strength to about 6 500 troops on next day its 45th regiment marched northeast toward naktong river this regiment passed through on august 7 and crossed river southeast of that town while under attack by us aircraft once across river this regiment headed into mountains initially encountering no opposition its other two regiments 48th and 50th departed from kumch on later and began crossing naktong between and waegwan before dawn of august 8 constructing underwater bridges for their vehicles kpa supported this crossing by direct tank fire from western side of river these tanks next carried out their own river crossing during day kpa 15th division seized hills 201 and 346 on east side of river at crossing site before advancing eastward into mountains toward tabu dong away on next day rok 1st division regained high ground at crossing sites driving kpa forces further eastward into mountains from august 12 through 16 three regiments of kpa 15th division united on east side

discovering this crossing units of 5th cavalry regiment directed automatic weapon fire against kpa units and also called in pre registered artillery fire on crossing site although kpa regiment suffered some casualties bulk of it reached east bank and then moved inland into hills about 30 minutes later 8th and 9th regiments began crossing river to south 5th cavalry regiment and all its supporting mortars and artillery now fully alerted spotted and decimated troops of two regiments and turned them back to west bank only a small number of kpa reached eastern side from there they were either captured by un troops or hid out until next night when they retreated across river triangulation hill at dawn on august 9 1st cavalry division commander major general hobart r gay at his headquarters in taegu learned of kpa s river crossing in area of his division south of waegwan since first reports were vague general gay decided to withhold counterattack until he learned more about situation he quickly learned that around 750 kpa infantry troops had gathered on hill 268 also known as triangulation hill which was southeast of waegwan and northwest of taegu general gay ordered his division to counterattack enemy gathering to force them across river he and general walker thought that this attack could be a feint and that kpa could be planning a larger attack to their north furthermore hill was important because of its proximity to lines of supply main korean north south highway and main seoul pusan railroad skirted base of triangulation hill at about 09 30 general gay ordered 1st battalion of 7th cavalry to counter kpa penetration this battalion moved from its bivouac area just outside taegu accompanied by five tanks of a company 71st heavy tank battalion this motorized force proceeded to foot of hill 268 meanwhile 61st field artillery battalion shelled hill heavily thumb left alt a soldier hides in some bush aiming at a target off camera a 1st cavalry

southwest to hill 154 hill 268 was covered with thick brush from about and trees eight to high day was very hot and many of american soldiers collapsed from heat exhaustion during attack which was not well coordinated with artillery fire kpa repulsed attack on next morning august 10 air raids and artillery rocked hill 268 devastating kpa battalion that afternoon general gay ordered five american tanks to move along waegwan road until they could fire onto hill from northwest into its reverse slope this tank gun fire caught kpa troops unprepared while they were hiding from artillery fire trapped between two barrages they started to vacate their positions an american infantry attack next reached crest of triangulation hill without much trouble and this battle was over by about 16 00 us artillery and mortar fire was now shifted westward and this cut off kpa retreat white phosphorus shells fired from 61st field artillery battalion caught kpa troops in a village while they attempted to retreat and they were then routed by us infantry suffering over 200 killed that evening 1st battalion 7th cavalry returned to serve as division reserve and elements of 5th cavalry finished securing hill 268 kpa 7th regiment 3rd division had been destroyed on hill 1st battalion 7th cavalry suffered 14 men killed and another 48 wounded in two day battle about 1 000 men of 7th regiment had crossed

followed it and occupied hill 409 kpa on hill 409 soon ambushed a patrol from 21st infantry regiment 24th infantry division which was moving north and trying to establish contact with 7th cavalry regiment during battle of naktong bulge occurring simultaneously to south further north 25th regiment started crossing naktong around 03 00 on august 12 in vicinity of tuksong dong on koryong taegu road 2nd battalion 7th cavalry regiment covered this crossing site which was southwest of taegu by daylight a kpa force of 300 to 400 had penetrated to wich on dong and 2nd battalion s h company engaged it in close combat in a grenade and automatic weapons attack kpa overran advance positions of company mortar observation post and heavy machine gun positions kpa were apparently attempting to control high ground east of yongp o in order to provide protection for main crossing that was to follow by 09 00 however 2nd battalion supported by 77th field artillery battalion and air strikes drove kpa back through yongp o and dispersed them second yongp o attack in three days from august 10 to 12 naktong river had dropped in depth and it was only shoulder deep at many places due to lack of rain and torrid weather this made any attempt at crossing river considerably easier a more determined kpa crossing of naktong in vicinity of blown bridge between tuksong dong and yongp o began early in morning on august 14 by 06 20 about 500 kpa soldiers had penetrated as far as yongp o fifteen minutes later 2nd battalion 7th cavalry soldiers engaged kpa at wich on dong east of crossing site at 08 00 general gay ordered 1st battalion 7th cavalry to move to yongp o area to support 2nd battalion kpa artillery and tank fire from west side of river supported infantry crossing a large number of kpa reinforcements were crossing in barges near bridge while under fire from us air strikes and artillery this attack also stalled with deepest kpa penetration reaching dong beyond blown up bridge from there combined fire of us light weapons mortars and artillery drove them back to river by noon large groups of kpa were trying to recross river to west side as american artillery continued hammering them causing heavy casualties by nightfall 7th cavalry regiment had eliminated kpa bridgehead at yongp o in fight only major one to take place along naktong at a prefabricated crossing site 25th and 27th regiments of kpa 10th division suffered crippling losses 7th cavalry estimated that of 1 700 kpa troops that had succeeded in crossing river 1 500 had been killed two days after battle h company

dawn on 17th troops from both 1st and 2nd battalions of 5th cavalry regiment supported by a company of 70th tank battalion attacked hill 303 but heavy kpa mortar fire stopped them at edge of waegwan during morning heavy artillery preparations pounded kpa positions on hill at 14 00 an air strike came in attacking hill with napalm conventional bombs rockets and machine guns air strike and artillery bombardment were successful in pushing kpa off hill after strike infantry attacked up hill at 15 30 unopposed and secured it by 16 30 combined strength of e and f companies on top of hill was about sixty men artillery and air attacks killed and wounded an estimated 500 enemy troops on hill 303 with survivors fleeing in a complete rout in regaining hill 303 on august 17 5th cavalry regiment

heavy mortar platoon who had been wounded by automatic weapons fire manring had crawled down hill until he saw scouts of attacking force in all about 45 men were shot by kpa in event of which only five survived total number of men executed around hill 303 is unclear as several more men were subsequently discovered in other locations around hill with evidence of execution angered general of army douglas macarthur commander of un forces in korea broadcast a warning to north korean leaders they would be held accountable for atrocity however intercepted documents show kpa command was also concerned with conduct of its troops and issued orders to limit killing of prisoners of war carpet bombing in mountains northeast of waegwan and hill 303 rok 1st division continued to suffer kpa attacks throughout mid august kpa pressure against rok 1st division never ceased for long under command of brigadier general paik sun yup this division fought an extremely bloody defense of mountain approaches to taegu us planners believed main kpa attack would come from west and so us command massed its forces to west of taegu us command mistakenly believed up to 40 000 kpa troops were near taegu this number was above actual troop numbers for kpa which had only 70 000 men along entire perimeter us artillery fire from 1st cavalry division sector supported rok in this area division s 13th regiment still held some positions along river while 11th and 12th regiments battled kpa in high mountain masses of suam san and yuhak san west and northwest of tabu dong and to east of naktong river kpa continued to use underwater bridge across naktong north of waegwan as their major route for supply and reinforcements un forces continued to target this bridge even scoring a direct hit with a 155mm howitzer but it was not seriously damaged thumb 250px alt bombs explode over a large area of land us air force bombers drop heavy ordnance near waegwan through middle of august kpa forces relentlessly attacked sectors occupied by rok 13th regiment and us 5th cavalry regiment this assault together with increasingly heavy pressure against main force of rok 1st division in tabu dong area began to endanger un control of taegu on august 16 750 korean police were stationed on outskirts of city to reinforce faltering military lines refugees had swollen taegu s normal population of 300 000 to 700 000 a crisis seemed to be developing among people on august 18 when several kpa artillery shells landed in taegu shells falling near railroad station damaged roundhouse destroyed one yard engine killed one korean civilian and wounded eight others korean provincial government subsequently ordered evacuation of taegu and president of south korea syngman rhee moved national leaders to pusan following ordered evacuation swarms of panicked korean refugees began to pour out on roads leading from city threatening to stop all military traffic but eighth army eventually halted evacuations on august 14 general macarthur ordered lieutenant general george e stratemeyer to conduct a carpet bombing of a rectangular area on west side of naktong river opposite rok 1st division intelligence estimates placed greatest concentrations of enemy troops in this area some estimates being as high as four kpa divisions and several armored regiments totalling 40 000 men who were reportedly using area to stage their attack on taegu general gay commanding 1st cavalry division repeatedly requested that bombing include area northeast of waegwan this request was denied because of fear that bombing there might cause casualties among 1st cavalry and rok 1st division troops stratemeyer did not think his aircraft could successfully carpet bomb an area larger than square but he complied with macarthur s order anyway at 11 58 on august 16 first of 98 b 29 superfortresses of 19th 22nd 92nd 98th and 307th bomber groups arrived over target area from their far east air force bases in japan and okinawa last planes cleared target at 12 24 bombers from dropped approximately 960 tons of 500 and 1 000 pound bombs attack had required entirety of feaf bombing component and they had dropped 3 084 bombs and 150 bombs this comprised largest usaf operation since battle of normandy in world war ii general walker reported to general macarthur next day that damage done to kpa by bombing could not be evaluated because of smoke and dust and ground forces could not reach it because of kpa fire information obtained later from kpa prisoners revealed enemy divisions far east command thought to be still west of naktong had already crossed to east side and were not in bombed area no evidence was found that bombing killed a single kpa soldier however bombing seems to have destroyed a significant number of kpa artillery batteries un ground and air commanders opposed future massive carpet bombing attacks unless there was precise information on an enemy concentration and situation was critical instead they recommended fighter bombers and dive bombers would better support ground forces they subsequently canceled a second bombing of an area east of naktong scheduled for august 19 aftermath battles around taegu saw repeated attempts by kpa to attack city however kpa were repeatedly stopped or slowed by us and rok troops and airstrikes five kpa divisions each suffered heavy casualties and each of them finally collapsed under strain of both mounting losses and lack of supplies however some of these division s troops were able to disperse into mountains some of these troops later assembled for different battles these final elements of kpa were finally defeated in battle of bowling alley casualties among 1st cavalry division were relatively light this division suffered a total of about 600 casualties with around 200 killed in action including those at hill 303 american forces in established positions were able to decimate kpa units crossing naktong in open with their artillery fire and air attacks exact numbers of soldiers captured and executed compared with those killed in combat are difficult to determine because of conflicting accounts of how many prisoners were actually held on hill 303 kpa suffered much higher casualties and also a much higher percentage of them killed in action kia this included 2 500 at yongp o 500 at hill 303 and 700 on triangulation hill this places total killed at over 3 700 troops though exact number of casualties is unknown in carpet bombing operation because patrols of un troops were unable to this area until
