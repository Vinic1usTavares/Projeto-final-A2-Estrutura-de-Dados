invasion of martinique of 1809 was a successful british amphibious operation against french west indian island of martinique that took place between 30 january and 24 february 1809 during west indies campaign 1804 1810 of napoleonic wars martinique like nearby guadeloupe was a major threat to british trade in caribbean providing a sheltered base from which privateers and french navy warships could raid british shipping and disrupt trade routes that maintained british economy islands also provided a focus for larger scale french operations in region and in autumn of 1808 following spanish alliance with britain admiralty decided to order a british squadron to neutralise threat beginning with martinique british mustered an overwhelming force under vice admiral sir alexander cochrane and lieutenant general george beckwith who collected 29 ships and 10 000 men almost four times number of french regular forces garrisoning martinique landing in force on both southern and northern coasts of island british troops pushed inland defeating french regulars in central highlands and routing local militia units in south of island by 9 february entire island was in british hands except fort desaix a powerful position intended to protect capital fort de france which had been bypassed during british advance in a siege lasting 15 days fort was constantly bombarded french suffering 200 casualties before finally surrendering capture of island was a significant blow to french power in region eliminating an important naval base and denying safe harbours to french shipping in region consequences of losing martinique were so severe that french navy sent a battle squadron to reinforce garrison during invasion arriving much too late to affect outcome these reinforcements were intercepted off islands and scattered during action of 14 17 april 1809 half force failed to return to france with martinique defeated british attention in region turned against guadeloupe which was captured following year background during napoleonic wars british royal navy was charged with limiting passage and operations of french navy french merchant ships and french privateers to achieve this objective royal navy imposed a system of blockades on french ports especially major naval bases at toulon and brest this stranglehold on french movement off their own coastline seriously affected french colonies including those in west indies as their produce could not reach france and supplies and reinforcements could not reach them without risk of british interception and seizure gardiner p 17 these islands provided excellent bases for french ships to raid british trade routes through caribbean sea in previous conflicts british had countered threat posed by french west indian colonies by seizing them through force such as martinique which had been previously captured by armed invasion in 1762 and 1794 rodger p 74 an attempt in 1780 was defeated by a french battle squadron at battle of martinique by 1808 there were no french squadrons at sea any that left port were eliminated or driven back in a series of battles culminating at disastrous defeat at battle of trafalgar in 1805 fleet that was destroyed at trafalgar had visited martinique year before and was last full scale french fleet to visit caribbean for rest of war gardiner p 59 250px thumb map of martinique invasion forces landed on southern southwestern and northern coasts with bulk of french navy confined to port british were able to strike directly at french colonies although their reach was limited by significant resources required in blockading french coast and so size and quality of operations varied widely in 1804 haiti fell to a nationalist uprising supported by royal navy and in 1806 british forces secured most of northern coast of south america from its dutch owners in 1807 danish west indies were invaded and in 1808 spain changed sides and allied with britain while cayenne fell to an improvised force under captain james lucas yeo in january 1809 gardiner p 76 77 damage done to martinique economy during this period was severe as british frigates raided coastal towns and shipping and merchant vessels were prevented from trading martinique s produce with france or allied islands disaffection grew on island especially among recently emancipated black majority and during summer of 1808 island s governor vice amiral louis thomas villaret de joyeuse sent urgent messages back to france requesting supplies and reinforcements james p 206 some of these messages were intercepted by british ships and low morale on martinique was brought to attention of admiralty who ordered their commander on west indian station vice admiral sir alexander cochrane to raise an expeditionary force from ships and garrisons available to him and invade island clowes p 283 during winter of 1808 1809 cochrane gathered his forces off carlisle bay barbados accumulating 29 ships and 10 000 soldiers under command of lieutenant general george beckwith woodman p 242 landings were planned on island s southern and northern coasts with forces ordered to converge on capital fort de france soldiers would be supported and supplied by royal navy force which would shadow their advance offshore beckwith s army was more than twice size of french garrison half of which was composed of an untrained and irregular black militia which could not be relied on in combat news of poor state of martinique s defences also reached france during autumn of 1808 attempts were made to despatch reinforcements and urgently needed food supplies but on 30 october 1808 circe captured 16 gun french curieux class brig british then captured frigate thetis in bay of biscay at action of 10 november 1808 another relief attempt was destroyed in december off leeward islands and hms aimable captured corvette iris carrying flour to martinique off dutch coast on 2 january 1809 clowes p 430 only frigate amphitrite whose stores and reinforcements were insignificant compared to forces under cochrane and beckwith managed to reach martinique gardiner p 75 invasion thumb 275px sir george prevost with sword from nova

force was then divided one squadron anchoring off sainte luce on southern coast and another off le robert on northern james p 207 invasion began same morning 3 000 soldiers going ashore at sainte luce under command of major general frederick maitland supervised by captain william charles fahie while 6 500 landed at le robert under major general sir george prevost supervised by captain philip beaver beckwith remained on cochrane s flagship hms neptune to direct campaign from offshore clowes p 284 a third force under a major henderson and consisting entirely of 600 soldiers from royal york rangers landed at cape salomon near les anses d on southwestern peninsula to secure entrance to fort de france bay gardiner p 77 during first day of invasion two main forces made rapid progress inland militia troops sent against them retreating and deserting without offering resistance serious opposition to british advance did not begin until 1 february when french defenders on heights of desfourneaux and were attacked by prevost s troops under direct command of brigadier general daniel hoghton fighting was fierce throughout next two days as outnumbered french used fortified high ground to hold back a series of frontal assaults british lost 84 killed and 334 wounded to french losses of over 700 casualties and by 3 february french had been forced back withdrawing to fort desaix near capital james p 208 progress was also made at cape salomon where appearance of british troops panicked french defenders into burning naval brig carnation and retreating to small island aux offshore henderson s men assisted by a naval brigade under captain george cockburn set up batteries on coast and by 4 february had bombarded island into surrender opening principal harbour of martinique to naval attack a small naval squadron consisting of hms aeolus hms cleopatra and brig hms recruit advanced into fort de france bay on 5 february this advance spread panic among french militia defending bay and amphitrite and other shipping anchored there were set on fire and destroyed while forts in southern part of island were abandoned on 8 february maitland s force which had not yet fired a shot arrived on western side of fort desaix and laid siege to it minor detachments spread across remainder of island lieutenant colonel edward barnes captured saint pierre and another force occupied fort de france and seized corvette in harbour by 10 february when prevost s force linked up with maitland s fort desaix was only remaining point of resistance for nine days british soldiers and sailors of expeditionary force constructed gun batteries and trenches around fort bringing ashore large quantities of supplies and equipment in readiness for a lengthy siege at 16 30 on 19 february preparations were complete and bombardment began 14 heavy cannon and 28 mortars beginning a continuous attack on fort which lasted for next four days french casualties in overcrowded fort were severe with 200 men killed or wounded british casualties were minimal with five killed and 11 wounded principally in an explosion in an ammunition tent manned by sailors from hms amaranthe at 12 00 on 23 february villaret de joyeuse s trumpeter was sent to british camp with a message proposing surrender terms these were unacceptable to beckwith and bombardment resumed at 22 00 continuing until 09 00 following morning when three white flags were raised over fort and french admiral surrendered unconditionally bombardment had cracked roof of fort s magazine and there were fears that further shelling might have ignited gunpowder and destroyed building completely aftermath thumb left invasion of martinique 1809 monument st george s round church halifax nova scotia with surrender of fort desaix british forces solidified their occupation of island of martinique remaining shipping and military supplies were seized and regular soldiers of garrison taken as prisoners of war militia were disbanded and martinique became a british colony remaining under british command until restoration of french monarchy in 1814 when it was returned to french control chandler p 328 british losses in campaign were heavy with 97 killed 365 wounded and 18 missing french total losses are uncertain but garrison suffered at least 900 casualties principally in fighting in central highlands on 1 and 2 february and during siege of fort desaix james p 209 upon his return to france villaret s conduct was condemned by an inquiry council he requested in vain a court martial to clear his name and lived in disgrace for two years p 220 in britain both houses of parliament voted their thanks to cochrane and beckwith who immediately began planning invasion of guadeloupe executed in january 1810 financial and professional rewards were provided for junior officers and enlisted men and in 1816 battle honour martinique was awarded to ships and regiments involved with date 1809 added in 1909 to distinguish campaign from earlier operations of 1762 and 1794 rodger p 36 four decades later operation was among actions recognised by a clasp attached to naval general service medal and military general service medal awarded upon application to all british participants still living in 1847 in france defeat was subject of a court martial in december 1809 at which villaret de joyeuse and a number of his subordinates were stripped of their commissions honours and ranks for inadequately preparing for invasion in particular for failing properly to strengthen and disperse magazine at fort desaix there was a subsequent french effort to reach martinique launched in february 1809 before news of british invasion had reached europe three ships of line and two disarmed frigates were sent with soldiers and supplies towards island but learned of villaret de joyeuse s surrender in late march and instead took shelter in iles des saintes blockaded by cochrane s squadron gardiner p 78 on 14 april cochrane seized saintes and french fled three ships of line drawing away cochrane s forces so that frigates could slip away and reach guadeloupe during ensuing action of 14 17 april 1809 french flagship hautpoult was chased down and captured but two ships of line escaped and frigates reached guadeloupe although neither would ever return to france woodman p 243 british order of battle admiral
