eastern mole or common mole scalopus aquaticus is a medium sized overall grey north american mole and only member of genus scalopus its large hairless spade shaped forefeet are adapted for digging species is native to canada ontario mexico and eastern united states and has widest range of any north american mole species prefers loamy soils found in thin woods fields pastures and meadows and builds both deep and shallow burrows characterized by discarded excess soil collected in molehills its nest is composed of leaves and grasses and its two to five young are on their own at about four weeks its diet consists principally of earthworms and other soil life but mole will eat vegetable matter dogs cats foxes and coyotes prey upon mole and species hosts a variety of parasites unlike gophers moles do not eat vegetation and pose no threat to human concerns occasional damage to lawns is offset by aeration provided soil and consumption of insects construction of golf courses has provided mole with ideal habitat species is abundant occurs in protected areas faces no major threats and is of little concern to conservationists description thumb skeleton of an eastern mole eastern mole is a small sturdy animal which lives principally underground and is highly specialized for a subterranean way of life its body is somewhat shaped with an elongated head a fleshy moveable snout projecting over mouth with nostrils on upper part is used as an organ of touch minute degenerative eyes are hidden in fur eyelids are fused and sight is limited to simply distinguishing between light and dark ear opening is small and concealed in fur but hearing is fairly acute a short thick tail is lightly furred and is used as an organ of touch guiding mole when it moves backward in tunnel very large front feet are broader rather than long with well developed claws and possess a specialized bone attached to wrist that aids digging front feet are normally held in a vertical position with palms facing outward both front feet and small hind feet are fringed with sensory hairs that help mole in its excavations bones of front limbs and breast are hugely enlarged and provide strong support for attached muscles used in digging hip girdle is narrow permitting mole to turn around in its tunnel by doing a partial somersault or doubling back upon itself mole has grey brown plush like fur with paler or browner underparts and may appear to have a silver sheen depending on angle it is viewed fur offers little resistance to backward movement in tunnel compared to female male tends to have a brighter orange strip on belly being caused by secretion of skin glands in region albinos occur but these may appear white orange or cinnamon yellow depending on skin gland secretion face feet and tail are whitish to pink molting occurs in spring and fall with new pelage appearing first on underparts on back new fur appears first at tail then works forward a distinct line usually marks old and new fur and there is no distinct underfur hairs are of equal length and when viewed microscopically are seen to possess a whip like tip unlike hairs of any other mammal sexes are determined externally by number of openings in groin area female has three forward one is urinary opening in urinary papilla or projection second is vagina and third is anus at tail male has two openings combined urinary reproductive opening in penis and anus testes never descend into a scrotum but remain within body cavity there are six teats on belly a pair at chest a pair at groin and a pair between two a rank musky odor is emitted from a scent gland on belly and is left on floor of tunnel as mole passes it probably serves as a form of communication between sexes during breeding season and to discourage predators other scent glands are found at anus measurements mole is about in length including a 3 cm long tail and weighs about males collected from various parts of species range showed following extremes in measurements total length 152 tail 22 30mm hind foot 18 21 mm and females displayed extremes of total length 144 16 mm tail 15 28 mm hind foot 18 21 mm weight 40 50 grams males are larger than females and males collected in northern midwest were largest of all twelve adults from northeastern florida averaged total length 142 tail 24 5 hind foot 17 8 mm in hillsborough and pasco counties in florida eastern mole is still smaller and in area north of tampa bay total length does not exceed 140 mm and hind foot rarely exceeds 17 mm smallest and darkest moles are those found in miami area in pennsylvania specimens range in weight from 40 to 64 grams tooth count numbers 36 i3 2 c1 0 p3 3 m3 3 and chromosome diploid number is 34 distribution and habitat eastern mole is native to canada ontario mexico and united states and has widest range of any north american mole in united states species is found from southern south dakota and southern wisconsin to eastern massachusetts and south to tip of florida and louisiana and west to nebraska kansas and central texas it is absent from appalachian mountains most of canada and northern new england species is found in southern tip of ontario and northern tamaulipas mexico its distribution however is patchy colonies in southwestern texas and coahuila and tamaulipas mexico are isolated and small species prefers well drained loose sandy or loamy soil and avoids heavy clay stony or gravelly soils and very dry or very wet soils it frequents pastures open fields meadows and thin woods in some marginal areas human activities such as building of roads and golf courses often provide beneficial habitat due to higher quality soils and adequate moisture population characteristics in a study from 1976 home range areas of seven moles were calculated after each had been located periodically during periods ranging from 11 months to 3 years mean home range area was males averaged and females because male range is so large males generally predominate in samples species fossorial habit tends to limit its dispersal and gene flow and soil character often limits populations eastern moles are good swimmers and not limited by rivers but heavy clay soils associated with some waterways may limit dispersal moles probably have a long life span due to a paucity of predators and a low reproductive rate young are grayer than adults and with age skull flattens and teeth display wear females live longer than males longevity has been estimated at 6 years with mark recapture methods in south carolina in kansas longevity was estimated at greater than 3 5 years eastern mole is common in most of united states but populations in southern texas and mexico are considered extremely rare and possibly extinct behavior species is more abundant in warm climes rather than cool or cold climes and in southern united states cultivated fields will often be riddled with their burrows after a penetrating rain eastern mole is active at all hours with peaks in activity near dawn and at dusk length of time between bouts of activity averages about three hours but may last up to 6 5 h burrowing thumb left eastern mole digs both deep permanent burrows and shallow temporary ones just under surface used for foraging regular permanent highway is often built 25 cm or more below surface and is used as a retreat during hot dry weather or when frost has descended oxygen levels in tunnels can be as low as 14 3 and carbon dioxide as high as 5 5 when digging new burrows mole will push excess soil up through vertical shafts called molehills new burrows just below surface are marked by ridges and molehills and such burrows appear to be used to facilitate capture of earthworms and other soil life after a rain in building burrows and probably at other times mole uses its nose as a tactile organ poking about here and there in friable soil species can burrow at a rate of 6 m h mole s nest is built of leaves and grasses and is usually situated several inches to a foot or more below surface it is typically found beneath a boulder stump or bush and has several approaches including one that enters from below eastern mole in florida is reported to not build a nest diet thumb common earthworm eastern mole is a voracious predator and will daily consume food equal to 25 to 50 of its weight in captivity it will eat almost anything including ground beef and dog food in its natural environment species principally feeds on earthworms when these are available but will eat many other foods including slugs snails centipedes larval and adult insects scarab beetle grubs and ants at all their life stages vocalizations moles vocalize by making high pitched squeals harsh guttural squeaks short snorting sounds and grating teeth reproduction gestation is usually 45 days and a single litter of two to five young is produced between mid april and june in warm climates young may be born in march they are born blind and naked and are relatively large compared to size of mother at 10 days they exhibit a fine velvety light gray fur which is retained for several weeks rapid growth permits young to leave nest and shift for themselves at about four weeks survival dogs cats foxes and coyotes are some of predators of species eastern mole harbors many parasites one hundred four moles taken in indiana exhibited four species of fleas one species of sucking louse one species of beetle and at least 20 species of mites several of them entirely new species with one of them constituting a new genus scientific and common names thumb linnaeus linnaeus based original description of species upon a specimen found dead in water a fact noted on collection label he named species aquaticus certainly a misnomer because species is least aquatic of north american moles first part of scientific name scalopus is from two greek words which mean digging and foot mole derived from word to dig and pous foot word refers to species large front feet which are used for digging second word of name aquaticus is latin and means found in water word is misleading but was given to species because its webbed foot suggested it was accustomed to a water habitat and original specimen was found dead in water first part of common name eastern refers to species range and second part mole is from middle english molle which in turn is related to another middle english word mold which means earth thrower fossils fossil remains have been reported from upper ohio valley in pennsylvania and west virginia and pleistocene cave faunas in texas interaction with humans and conservation thumb moles till and form soil feed on destructive insects such as cutworms and japanese beetles and dig tunnels that soil and permit moisture to penetrate deeper soil layers pelt is small and does not take dyes well it is thus of no commercial interest to fur industry when moles disfigure lawns damage roots of garden plants while searching for food or take sprouting corn they are considered undesirable in one anecdote a homeowner reported animal completely eradicated japanese beetles on his grounds species is listed as least concern on iucn red list because of its wide distribution presumed large population occurrence in a number of protected areas tolerance to some degree of habitat modification and because it is unlikely to be declining at nearly rate required to qualify for listing in a threatened category see also rockport virus hantavirus pulmonary syndrome references external links category mammals described in 1758
