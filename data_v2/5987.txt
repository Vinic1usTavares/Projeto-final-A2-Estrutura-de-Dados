order but it eventually ended in a scramble for safety and many french soldiers became prisoners engagement occurred near end of peninsular war in mid february wellington s army broke out of its small area of conquered territory near bayonne moving east allies drove french back from several river lines after a pause in campaign western most allied corps surrounded and isolated bayonne resuming

provoking a guerilla war by french civilians british commander imposed a vigorous discipline on his british and portuguese soldiers and sent most of his spanish troops home since his men were paid and fed by british government pablo morillo s spanish division remained with army wellington s policy paid dividends his soldiers soon found that guarding roads in his army s rear areas was no longer required in january 1814 soult sent reinforcements to napoleon transferred to campaign in northeast france were 7th and 9th infantry divisions and anne francois charles s dragoons altogether this

sufficiently far to east a strong allied corps would seize a bridgehead over adour river to west of bayonne and encircle that fortress because soult s army was weakened by three divisions wellington s forces were superior enough to risk dividing them into two bodies soult wished to contain his opponent in a wedge of occupied french territory strongly garrisoned bayonne blocked north side of allied

from to sauveterre de bearn to navarrenx on 17 february hill s corps forded river breaching yet another french defensive line french marshal sent abbe s division to help defend bayonne a questionable move which left his army with fewer troops to fight wellington by 18 february soult had his troops in position on gave d oloron that day weather broke again causing another pause in operations during lull wellington ordered john hope s corps to begin isolation of bayonne since adour is wide with a tidal rise of below bayonne soult never suspected allies would cross there and did not guard north bank facing an allied offensive that required crossing rivers french marshal believed that his foes would not have enough boats or pontoons to bridge river hope sent eight companies from 1st division across adour on 23 february to form a bridgehead that evening congreve rockets dispersed two french battalions that were sent to investigate incursion next day 34 vessels of 30 to 50 tons sailed into

line to seven british light companies three 5th 60th foot rifle companies and entire 11th cacadores battalion this heavy skirmish line moved forward until it came into contact with soult s main

bullet during advance as wellington was teasing alava he was knocked off his horse when a bullet sized canister shot struck his sword hilt in pain from a badly bruised hip british army commander remounted and continued to direct battle at this time soult realized that hill s column might cut off his army from orthez to sault de navailles road he ordered his army to retreat covered by villatte darmagnac rouget and paris at first tricky withdrawal was conducted in good order though it was closely followed by british horse artillery and infantry because they had to retreat on narrow paths and across country retreating french units became badly mixed and unit cohesion was lost fearful of capture retreating soldiers became more and more confused and demoralized villatte and harispe covered withdrawal at troops from french right and center poured into main road soldiers from villatte s division held that village until expelled by 42nd foot black watch in a hard fight for final to sault de navailles bridge most of soult s army was a mob that cavalry brigades of fane vivian and somerset did not wreak havoc on french was due to terrain which was criss crossed with walls and ditches only 7th hussars made an effective charge riding down one battalion of 115th line and a french national guard unit from harispe s division at sault de navailles soult s artillery chief louis set up a 12 gun battery to cover bridge over luy de bearn soult s beaten men flowed across bridge and kept going until they reached villatte and harispe s infantry and pierre soult s cavalry stayed in sault de

total of 2 174 of these portuguese casualties numbered 156 killed 354 wounded and 19 captured while british losses were 211 killed 1 373 wounded and 61 captured in addition to battle casualties many of recently conscripted french soldiers promptly deserted soult did not attempt to defend luy de bearn with his demoralized army instead he retreated north to saint sever on adour soult was in a dilemma he could not defend both important southwestern port of bordeaux and toulouse he decided that trying to hold bordeaux would put garonne estuary at his back and that it would be difficult to obtain food in that area therefore french marshal determined to operate to east in direction of toulouse on 2 march allies clashed with french at aire sur l adour in a combat that cost french about 250 men killed and wounded including 12 officers and 100 captured da costa sent his portuguese brigade to attack a strong position when it was repulsed with losses of five officers and 100 men da costa failed to rally soldiers and was replaced in command british losses were 156 killed and wounded in 2nd division after this action with hill harispe abandoned aire soult withdrew to a position between and plaisance where his army was left alone for ten days wishing to capitalize on soult s failure to defend bordeaux wellington sent beresford and 4th and 7th divisions to seize seaport beresford departed allied camp on 7 march and occupied bordeaux on 12 march leaving 7th division as an occupation force beresford hurried back with 4th division to join wellington on 19 march during this period allied infantry strength fell to 29 000 which was why wellington did not trouble soult to make up for deficit british army commander called for his heavy cavalry brigades to join him he also asked for 8 000 spanish reinforcements to be forwarded to army soldiers to be paid by british treasury battle of toulouse would be fought on 10 april notes references further reading this is an
