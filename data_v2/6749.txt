miscellaneous criteria plot lloyd irving and his friend genis sage accompany chosen colette brunel and her guardians raine sage and kratos aurion on her journey of world regeneration purpose of journey is to replenish sylvarant with mana a necessary energy to their survival raine today is day of prophecy it is a very important day which chosen of mana will receive an oracle from goddess martel now chosen one colette tell us about journey of world regeneration colette it is a journey to seal upon passing trials of goddess martel summon spirit that protect world awaken and mana is restored path of journey consists of five temples which must be unsealed by colette on their journey they meet sheena fujibayashi who comes from tethe alla a world parallel to sylvarant she tells them about how two worlds vie for each other s mana through journey of regeneration sheena my world is called tethe alla two worlds lie directly adjacent to each other they just can t see one another our scholars say they exist on shifted dimensions anyway two worlds can t see or touch each other but they do in fact exist next to and affect each other they vie for supply of mana when one world weakens mana from that world flows to other as a result one world is always flourishing and other waning sort of like an hourglass sylvarant s mana is flowing to tethe alla therefore sylvarant is in decline without mana crops won t grow and magic becomes unusable if there is no mana summon spirits that protect world alongside goddess martel can t survive in sylvarant either as a result world slips even further down path of destruction raine then chosen s world regeneration is actually process of reversing mana flow sheena exactly when chosen breaks seal mana flow reverses and summon spirit that governs seal awakens hoping to find answers from angel remiel party meets him at final seal and are betrayed by remiel and kratos both are revealed to be part of an evil organization led by mithos yggdrasill party leaves for tethe alla to search for a way to save both worlds and are joined by zelos wilder and regal bryant party learns that awakening summon spirits in both worlds will sever mana tie between them undine mana flows from world in which summon spirits sleep to world in which summon spirits are awake this is first time summon spirits have been awakened in both worlds at same time because of this mana connecting two worlds has been eliminated believing that to be answer they successfully sever all mana ties between two worlds lloyd does that mean that sylvarant and tethe alla have stopped competing for each other s mana volt raine i do not know only thing certain is that flow of mana between worlds has been severed undine yes eventually worlds shall separate genis you mean two worlds will split apart zelos that s perfect then they ll stop competing for each other s mana their actions instead destabilize great seed supplier of mana to both worlds causing it to grow and engulf sylvarant at an exponential rate kratos having lost stability afforded by protection of summon spirits great seed has gone out of control yuan no purpose of summon spirits was to isolate great seed from outside world and prevent it from growing kratos that was only half of it two worlds were forced out of phase by yggdrasill they should have drifted apart from each other and have been consumed by void but this was prevented from happening because great seed was placed in center between two worlds great seed is constantly being pulled upon from both worlds as they try to separate from one another it s a miracle that this delicate balance held up for even this long yuan wait so mana links served as a cage to contain great seed in space between two worlds is that what you re saying kratos exactly and because you provided unstable great seed with mana germinated in a twisted form and has gone out of control it s even engulfed martel lloyd who cares why this happened i wanna know what s gonna happen if we can t stop this thing yuan if what kratos says is true then sylvarant will be consumed and destroyed by great seed and if sylvarant is destroyed tethe alla will be destroyed as well as it is linked by holy ground of kharlan and otherworldly gate after party re stabilizes seed they learn from yuan ka fai about origins of sylvarant and tethe alla and how they used to be one world but was split by mithos with eternal sword party realizes they can save world if they wield eternal sword merge worlds and germinate great seed they decide to confront and defeat mithos before seeking eternal sword kratos is revealed to have been gathering materials to have lloyd use eternal sword he succeeds but mithos survives his apparent death and possesses a member from party before fleeing to comet derris kharlan mithos attempts to take great seed with him but is foiled and killed by lloyd using eternal sword lloyd merges sylvarant and tethe alla together and germinates great seed into a giant kharlan tree to supply world with mana origin world was originally separated into two in order to prevent its destruction if it returns to its true form world lacks mana to support itself land is dying lloyd i don t need to know why it s dying what do we need to do to stop it origin support two worlds by linking them with giant tree that is only way to stop destruction of land lloyd this is my final wish eternal sword rise giant kharlan tree development and release game was first announced on may 8 2002 by namco to be one of many titles it would be
