also known as advanced generation after years of nintendo being sole publisher of franchise in all regions pokemon company began co publishing games for first time since establishment of joint owned company in 1998 they were first released in japan in late 2002 and internationally in 2003 pokemon emerald an enhanced version was released two years later in each region remakes of two games titled pokemon omega ruby and alpha sapphire were released for nintendo 3ds worldwide on november 21 2014 exactly twelve years to date of original ruby and sapphire release date with exception of europe where it released on november 28 2014 gameplay is mostly unchanged from previous games player controls main character from an overhead perspective and controls are largely same as those of previous games as with previous games main objectives are to catch all of pokemon in games and defeat elite four also like their predecessors games main subplot involves player character defeating a criminal organization that attempts to take over region new features such as double battles and pokemon abilities along with 135 new pokemon were added owing to increased capabilities of game boy advance four players may be connected to each other at a time instead of previous limit of two additionally games can be connected to an e reader or other third generation pokemon games ruby and sapphire received mostly positive reviews though critics were divided in their assessment of games especially on gameplay and graphics most of complaints focused on fact that gameplay had not changed much since previous generations and connectivity issues revolving around past generations with popularity of pokemon waning at time games sold less than previous generations however they were still critical and commercial successes with around 16 22 million copies sold according to ign they are best selling titles for game boy advance gameplay basic mechanics of ruby and sapphire are largely same as their predecessors as with all pokemon games for handheld consoles gameplay is in third person overhead perspective and consists of three basic screens a field map in which player navigates main character a battle screen and menu in which player configures their party items or gameplay settings players begin game with one pokemon and can capture more using poke balls they can also use their pokemon to battle other pokemon when player encounters a wild pokemon or is challenged by a trainer to a battle screen switches to a turn based battle screen where pokemon fight during battle player may use a move use an item switch their active pokemon or flee although fleeing is not an option in battles against trainers all pokemon have hit points hp when a pokemon s hp is reduced to zero it faints and cannot battle until it is revived if player s pokemon defeats opposing pokemon causes it to faint it receives experience points after accumulating enough experience points it will level up most pokemon evolve into a new species of pokemon when they reach a certain level pokemon sapphire version instruction booklet p 35 apart from battling capturing pokemon is most essential element of pokemon gameplay during battle with a wild pokemon player may use a poke ball on them if successful pokemon will be added to player s active party or stored if player already has maximum six pokemon in their party pokemon sapphire version instruction booklet p 37 factors in success rate of capture include hp status effects such as paralysis or sleep and strength of poke ball used lower target s hp and stronger poke ball higher success rate of capture is pokemon sapphire version instruction booklet p 32 other trainers pokemon cannot be captured new features most prominent change in battle mechanics is introduction of double battles in which opposing parties each use two pokemon at same time consequently certain pokemon moves can affect multiple combatants at once hollinger p 3 multi battles were added alongside double battles they are identical to double battles but there are two trainers to a side each controlling one of two pokemon sent out also new to games are innate abilities and natures former is shared by every pokemon of a certain species while latter may vary among a particular species abilities grant their holders certain powers in battle such as immunity against certain types of moves or strengthening a certain type of move natures like innate abilities affect strength of pokemon in battle however they affect stats of pokemon rather than directly affecting strength of moves hollinger p 6 another stat introduced in pokemon ruby and sapphire is condition an important factor in pokemon contests mini games in which participants perform moves before a judge both pokemon and their moves have a condition which is increased by using pokeblocks which are candies made from berries hollinger p 76 ruby and sapphire are first games in series to have weather conditions such as harsh sunlight rain hail and sandstorms that also affect battles in unique ways secret bases were added as a one off feature where players could open up a hole in world and customize area with various items picked up in game players who linked up with others who set up secret bases were able to battle an npc version of that trainer within their secret base like pokemon gold silver and crystal pokemon ruby and sapphire keep track of real life time this influences events like tides and berry plant growth however unlike their predecessors ruby and sapphire do not differentiate between day and night also due to differences in technical specifications of game boy link cables and game boy advance link cables ruby and sapphire cannot be linked with pokemon games of previous generations one cannot battle with or trade to previous generations pokemon sapphire version instruction booklet p 50 connectivity to other devices ruby and sapphire have limited e reader support nintendo released battle e cards a set of e reader cards that contained trainer battles in which player could see previously hidden pokemon a special e reader card called eon ticket was also released obtained through mystery gift function ticket allows player to reach a place called southern island there player faces either or latias depending on which version of game is used ruby and sapphire are also able to connect to gamecube games pokemon colosseum pokemon xd gale of darkness and pokemon box ruby and sapphire in former two once players reach a certain point in game they are able to transfer pokemon between colosseum xd and ruby sapphire additionally those who pre ordered colosseum were able to access pokemon jirachi and see a preview of movie pokemon jirachi wish maker pokemon box a so called pokemon microsoft office allows players to store and organize their pokemon on gamecube also in european version of pokemon channel players could receive a jirachi at a certain point in game which they could then transfer over to ruby or sapphire plot setting thumb ruby and sapphire are set in hoenn region designed to be similar to japan s island of kyushu pokemon ruby and sapphire take place in hoenn region located some distance from kanto and johto regions featured in previous games design of hoenn was based on japanese island and region of kyushu however hoenn is rotated 90deg relative to kyushu as junichi masuda felt that it would provide a better gameplay balance like kyushu hoenn possesses many smaller islands and part of region is dominated by sea routes several of which contain areas where player can dive underwater story like other pokemon games ruby and sapphires gameplay is linear main events occur in a fixed order hollinger p 12 protagonist of pokemon ruby and sapphire is a child who has recently moved to a small town called littleroot town at beginning of games player chooses either treecko torchic or to protect professor birch regional professor from an attacking after defending birch player is taken to his lab and receives chosen pokemon as their starter pokemon after that player encounters may brendan child of professor birch player s rival who appears as professor s child is also a pokemon trainer and occasionally battles player games two main goals are defeating eight gym leaders proving oneself worthy of challenging elite four and champion to become new champion and completing pokedex by capturing evolving and trading to obtain all 202 pokemon available between ruby and sapphire it is possible to obtain all 386 pokemon but this requires trading with pokemon firered and leafgreen in addition to main quest of defeating gym leaders there are side quests in which player can aid npcs by fulfilling tasks usually by obtaining items most prominent subplot involves team aqua and team magma crime syndicates who want to use pokemon to alter climate of hoenn in ruby villains team magma want to use legendary pokemon groudon to dry up oceans of hoenn and increase region s landmass in sapphire team aqua are villains and they try to use groudon s counterpart kyogre to flood landmasses of hoenn and increase region s ocean prior to facing eighth gym leader player has a showdown with magma or aqua where team s leader uses a mystical orb that awakens slumbering pokemon believing it has power to enthrall their respective target only for pokemon to become enraged and cause catastrophic region wide climate changes a drought in ruby and heavy rainfall in sapphire until it is defeated or captured by protagonist hollinger pp 61 62 player s father also introduces them to wally a sickly young boy whom player helps capture a pokemon to be his companion as he moves away from big city wally eventually overcomes his illness and becomes a successful pokemon trainer ultimately becoming final challenger player must face before elite four development and release left thumb development director junichi masuda pokemon ruby and sapphire were developed by game freak and nintendo under direction of junichi masuda as with its predecessors ken sugimori was art director although these were first games in which he did not single handedly produce all of art when asked where his design team came up with ideas for all of new pokemon sugimori stated that they got their ideas from past experiences in their childhood involving nature animals and media and then base them on insects even looking at world in a different perspective sometimes provided inspiration for creatures first we select an insect and after that we add essential elements to insects to make it more like pokemon such as adding some hard shape to it to be more like steel sugimori said describing process of creating a pokemon as game boy advance was able to handle enhanced graphics ruby and sapphire were first games in series that allowed up to four people to share information at one time as opposed to previous limit of two however development team used a more basic graphics engine in order to keep game simple and not overly confusing team wanted games to appeal to a large audience so game was designed to be easy enough for younger generations of children to play but new features were added to bring veteran gamers back masuda stated that basic philosophy of all pokemon games is communication in pokemon series this is manifested in trading and battling with other people when asked about new concept of double battles developers noted that they tried to focus more on original one on one battles as main type of competition and only added double battles as a new challenge they stated that if they receive positive feedback about double battles feature may appear more in future generations games were first in series that did not contain all of pokemon from previous generations sugimori stated that team tried to include all new pokemon as well as some from previous generations when asked about any features that could not be included due to technical restrictions masuda noted that he wanted each individual pokemon to make up to three different cries depending on its mood nintendo did not promote ruby and sapphire at 2002 e3 convention however it launched a 7 million promotional campaign that lasted from march to may 2003 in addition to rewarding pre orders of games with merchandise nintendo held a contest in which participants submitted videos of themselves singing pokemon theme song with their own re written lyrics grand prize for that event was a lugia pt cruiser later that year nintendo launched eon ticket summer tour in which 125 toys r us stores across united states offered eon ticket e card in stores from july 19 to september 1 nintendo aired two television advertisements faces and names on prime time network cable and syndication faces featured pokemon juxtaposed with human look alikes names featured people shouting out names of pokemon and emphasized fact that games introduced 100 new pokemon additionally nintendo collaborated with united kingdom beverage brand vimto to promote games audio audio of ruby and sapphire consists entirely of game music all dialogue is on screen music composed by junichi masuda go ichinose and morikazu aoki is completely instrumental except for two tracks with vocals trick master and slateport

out of 10 rating and awarded them editor s choice award in 2007 games were collectively named tenth best game boy advance game of all time in an ign article gamezone also gave games a 9 5 out of 10 rating and gave games an outstanding award gamepro gave games 5 out of 5 stars and named them editor s choices computerandvideogames com gave games a 9 out of 10 and gamespot gave games 8 1 out of 10 eurogamer and 1up com were less enthusiastic about games however eurogamer gave games 7 out of 10 and 1up com gave them a b reviewers were divided in their critiques of games especially concerning gameplay and graphics ign praised deep design and noted that addition of features such as double battles greatly increased strategic aspect of games gamepro also thought that addition of double battles add ed challenge and made harder battles far more strategic than before way game should be likewise computerandvideogames com called gameplay incredibly compelling and addictive gamezone noted that gameplay was more refined and challenging than that of previous titles however gamespot called games a cakewalk from start to finish and claimed that ruby and sapphire don t offer much of a challenge eurogamer also felt that mechanics get very tired very fast 1up com also felt that games were formulaic and that double battles were underused computerandvideogames com was enthusiastic over graphics calling them gorgeous other reviewers were less enthusiastic however gamepro felt that graphics were only a fair bit prettier than those of game boy color games gamezone said that games still use simple animations and basic character designs that were created for original color less game boy ign and 1up com noted that graphics had received only a minor upgrade and eurogamer felt that graphics had been upgraded to a functional level at best audio was generally well received gamezone and gamespot both felt audio was catchy gamezone gave audio an 8 out of 10 score saying that while music was annoying at times it s also very good i found myself humming music when i wasn t playing other complaints included removal of time system of gold and silver and inability to import pokemon from games of previous generations sales pokemon ruby and sapphire were highly anticipated in japan they sold 1 25 million units within first four days of release and were best selling games of 2002 holiday season sales totaled around 4 4 million within six weeks of release they also became first games to sell 2 million copies in japan since 2001 s final fantasy x and first games for a handheld console to do so since 2000 s yu gi oh duel monsters 4 in north america alone nintendo sold 2 2 million units by april 2003 less than one month after games release in that region ruby and sapphire were second and third best selling games respectively of 2003 games enjoyed success in europe as well they were second best selling games of holiday season in 2002 even before release european retailers imported cartridges from united states to meet high demand for games with around 16 million units sold worldwide games are best selling titles for game boy advance however analysts noted that with young kids gravitating toward yu gi oh at time popularity was waning this was reflected in games sales compared to those of previous generations red and blue sold nearly 27 million units worldwide and gold and silver sold over 23 million units related games pokemon emerald is an enhanced version of pokemon ruby and sapphire developed by game freak published by pokemon company and nintendo for game boy advance it was released in japan on september 16 2004 north america on may 1 2005 australia on june 9 2005 and europe on october 21 2005 although gameplay is as that of ruby and sapphire emerald introduces new features plot is modified both team magma and aqua are villains who are locked in a constant gang war and awaken groudon and kyogre respectively when two legendary pokemon begin to battle each other protagonist must unleash legendary pokemon rayquaza to calm them some of game mechanics are changed as well though double battles were clearly marked in ruby and sapphire in emerald two separate trainers might unite to battle as a pair fixed in games thereafter after elite four is defeated player may re battle gym leaders in a double battle if they are called on their also pokemon sprites are animated in battle like they were in pokemon crystal possibly most significant addition is battle frontier an expanded version of battle tower in ruby and sapphire another change made in emerald is addition of team magma s base on side of mt chimney moreover legendary pokemon groudon is found here rather than in seafloor cavern both teams make repeated efforts to alter landscape team magma attempts to make a volcano erupt while team aqua tries to steal a weather altering pokemon a new character named scott is also introduced in this game unknown to player he is creator of battle frontier he follows player throughout game watching them battle each gym leader and even meeting up with them when they get to battle frontier emerald has been generally well received game has an aggregate rating of 77 on gamerankings gamespot gave it a 7 5 out of 10 ign gave it an impressive rating of 8 0 out of 10 eurogamer however gave emerald a score of 6 out of 10 though it praised emerald for looking better than either ruby or sapphire and for having harder and longer gameplay it criticized game for not even being a half changed update but more of a director s cut emerald was second best selling game in united states in 2005 it sold 6 32 million copies making it third best selling game for game boy advance in 2011 it was reported that game was still selling in japan in 2010 with approximately 7 724 units sold that year pokemon box ruby and sapphire pokemon box ruby and sapphire or simply pokemon box is a spin off pokemon game for gamecube bundled with a gamecube game boy advance link cable and a memory card 59 it was released in japan on may 30 2003 and in north america on july 11 2004 but only through new york pokemon center and its online store it is no longer available in either location game was released in some parts of europe as pokemon memory magic due to translation problems and europeans could only get game by using points from nintendo of europe s loyalty program or by buying pokemon colosseum mega pack game is essentially a storage system for game boy advance pokemon games that allows players to trade and store pokemon that they have caught in ruby sapphire emerald firered and leafgreen onto a gamecube memory card players can then organize and interact with their pokemon on gamecube such as allowing them to breed unique pokemon can also be acquired another feature allows games to be played on television via gamecube game boy advance link cable options such as taking screenshots of game are available in this mode another addition is showcase where players can create and display game pieces of pokemon nintendo referred to game as most exclusive pokemon software ever offered to north american pokemon fans but it was generally considered to be unnecessary receiving a score of 50 on gamerankings from 1 review craig harris of ign gave game a meh rating of 5 0 out of 10 praising interface which makes organization of pokemon much easier as compared to game boy advance interface as well as emulator which allows ruby and sapphire to be played on gamecube he also stated that game was a good deal due to inclusion of a memory card and link cable however harris cited showcase as entirely unnecessary and completely out of place and said that overall game lacked much to do he wrote it s targeted specifically for truly die hard pokemon fan but it requires so many specific elements to actually be useful to anyone allgame gave game three and a half out of five stars pokemon omega ruby and alpha sapphire on may 7 2014 nintendo announced remakes of ruby and sapphire titled pokemon omega ruby and alpha sapphire which were released for nintendo 3ds on november 21 2014 worldwide with exception of europe where it
