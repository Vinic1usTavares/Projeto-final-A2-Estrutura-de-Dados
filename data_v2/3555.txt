1992 queensland storms were a series of thunderstorms which struck southeastern queensland australia on 29 november 1992 storms produced strong winds flash flooding and large hailstones in region including capital city of brisbane storms also spawned two of most powerful tornadoes recorded in australia including only australian tornado to be given an official f4 classification on fujita scale whitaker 2005 199 coenraads 2005 229 meteorological instability in region resulted in formation of at least five supercell thunderstorms in space of around three hours storms which spawned progressively further up coast from brisbane to gladstone as afternoon progressed left a trail of damage resulting from hail rain and wind event has been described as one of most widespread outbreaks of severe thunderstorms recorded by veteran meteorologist richard whitaker davies et al 1992 whitaker 2005 200 climatology and conditions november is traditionally start of thunderstorm season along eastern seaboard of australia with a rise in average humidity and warmer ground temperatures combining with more frequent occurrences of cool air in upper atmosphere these conditions are conducive for producing severe thunderstorms particularly those which feature hail whitaker 2005 195 conditions on sunday 29 november were extremely unsettled there were a series of thunderstorm cells that formed early in morning despite it being more common for thunderstorms to form in late afternoon in south east queensland region these storms which had periodic bursts of severe lightning cleared quickly chambers n d thunderstorms began to form again just before midday as hot and humid conditions became more acute in middle part of day bureau of meteorology radar picked up a series of cells to north west of brisbane capital of queensland and data suggested that there was a possibility of large hail bureau immediately issued a severe thunderstorm warning for coastal region between brisbane and sunshine coast 100 km to north whitaker 2005 196 main cell in thunderstorm system appeared from bureau of meteorology radar analysis to split into two separate and distinct cells this development resulted in one part of major storm to head north to maroochydore while other part headed south towards brisbane southern cell struck brisbane just after 1 00pm with intense lightning activity and hailstones size of marbles falling storm caused a lengthy delay during first test of series between australia and west indies when hail forced play to be stopped at brisbane cricket ground around 1 15pm whitaker 2005 197 northern cell continued to intensify throughout afternoon bureau of meteorology then recognised it as a supercell which often bring erratic developments and often last for long periods of time storm dropped hailstones which were between eight and ten centimeters around maroochydore on sunshine coast damaging roofs of around 80 houses in area hail also damaged aircraft at a local airport and dented cars as well as inflicting injuries to a handful of swimmers at beaches near maroochydore whitaker 2005 198 tornadoes thumb tornado near bucca extreme instability in this area caused at least three more severe supercells in region two separate cells both produced a tornado that were recorded as two of most powerful in australian history third supercell which formed just after 3 00pm immediately after two tornadoes near gladstone produced golf ball sized hail that caused crop damage around gladstone coenraads 2005 228 total damage to crops from event was placed in millions a bureau of meteorology 2007 oakhurst tornado early in afternoon another supercell developed around town of maryborough around 300 km north of brisbane it developed rapidly also and at 2 30pm a number of reports sent to bureau of meteorology reported a tornado had touched down in oakhurst a rural area 10 km west of maryborough however due to low population density in area reported damage was sparse with one house destroyed several others unroofed and hundreds of trees were snapped upon investigation and analysis of measurements and damage caused by tornado it was given a rating of f3 on fujita scale this was one of most powerful tornadoes ever recorded in australia and scale indicated tornado may have produced winds of between 252 and 300 kilometres per hour bucca tornado only minutes after oakhurst tornado another supercell developed to south west of bundaberg around 400 km north of brisbane and 150 km north of oakhurst tornado it strengthened and moved in a north east direction causing severe damage to and bucca areas with giant hailstones described as size of a cricket ball supercell then spawned a tornado in bucca and kolan area according to reports by meteorologists tornado was so strong and effects caused on area it hit were so extreme that household appliances were displaced small objects were embedded in trees and house walls and a 3 tonne truck body was carried 300 metres across ground however as with oakhurst rural nature of area affected limited damage caused by tornado examination by a severe weather team from bureau of meteorology examined damage in bucca and kolan region and recorded it as an f4 on fujita scale this corresponds to tornado being able to produce winds between 331 and 417 kilometres per hour and of devastating intensity this is first tornado ever to be recorded as an f4 in australian history see also list of southern hemisphere tornadoes and tornado outbreaks notes references category disasters in
