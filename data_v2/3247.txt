lcd has a pixels resolution giving it a density of 216 pixels per inch ppi its ips display enables a wide viewing angle without significant color distortion and enhances color reproduction tablet s thin lightweight form factor was achieved without sacrificing computer power through a special lcd design called asus truvivid lcd panel uses a one glass solution and a non traditional lamination technique tablet touchscreens typically comprise four pieces of glass two that sandwich liquid crystal a touch sensor glass and a protective glass whereas asus truvivid design fuses protective and sensor glass with sensor attached as a film conventional lamination technique for touchscreens involves air bonding in which glass layers are glued around edges leaving air in between asus used a full lamination technique in which glass layers are fused by adhesive with no air between this yielded thinner display panels but made production more difficult as there was less tolerance for imprecision without affecting quality of screen tablet s display is protected by a layer of corning fit glass contrasting with company s usual method for designing motherboards first components that asus placed on device s pcb were speakers this was done to ensure other components did not force speaker placement towards one side which would harm sound quality design saw implementation of two microphones to
