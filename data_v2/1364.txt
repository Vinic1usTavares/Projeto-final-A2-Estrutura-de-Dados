year of meiji in october of that year and ended in second year of meiji sometimes known as japanese revolution was a civil war in japan fought from 1868 to 1869 between forces of ruling tokugawa shogunate and those seeking to return political power to imperial court war found its origins in dissatisfaction among many nobles and young samurai with shogunate s handling of foreigners following opening of japan during prior decade increasing western influence in economy led to a decline similar to other asian countries at time an alliance of western samurai particularly domains of choshu satsuma and tosa and court officials secured control of imperial court and influenced young emperor meiji tokugawa yoshinobu sitting shogun realizing futility of his situation abdicated political power to emperor yoshinobu had hoped that by doing this tokugawa house could be preserved and participate in future government however military movements by imperial forces partisan violence in edo and an imperial decree promoted by satsuma and choshu abolishing house of tokugawa led yoshinobu to launch a military campaign to seize emperor s court in kyoto military tide rapidly turned in favor of smaller but relatively modernized imperial faction and after a series of battles culminating in surrender of edo yoshinobu personally surrendered those loyal to tokugawa retreated to northern honshu and later to hokkaido where they founded ezo republic defeat at battle of hakodate broke this last holdout and left imperial rule supreme throughout whole of japan completing military phase of

foreigners from japan and instead adopted a policy of continued modernization with an eye to eventual renegotiation of unequal treaties with western powers due to persistence of saigo takamori a prominent leader of imperial faction tokugawa loyalists were shown clemency and many former shogunate leaders and samurai were later given positions of responsibility under new government when boshin

sentiments and breaking with centuries of imperial tradition began to take an active role in matters of state as opportunities arose he fulminated against treaties and attempted to interfere in shogunal succession his efforts culminated in march 1863 with his order to expel barbarians although shogunate had no intention of enforcing it order nevertheless inspired attacks against shogunate itself and against foreigners in japan most famous incident was that of english trader charles lennox richardson for whose death tokugawa government had to pay an indemnity of one hundred thousand british pounds jansen pp 314 315 other attacks included shelling of foreign shipping in shimonoseki hagiwara p 35 during 1864 these actions were successfully countered by armed retaliations by foreign

court was held but were repelled by shogunate forces under future shogun tokugawa yoshinobu shogunate further ordered a punitive expedition against choshu first choshu expedition and obtained choshu s
