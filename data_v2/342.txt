a period 1 element is one of chemical elements in first row or period of periodic table of chemical elements periodic table is laid out in rows to illustrate periodic recurring trends in chemical behaviour of elements as their atomic number increases a new row is begun when chemical behaviour begins to repeat meaning that analog elements fall into same vertical columns first period contains fewer elements than any other row in table with only two hydrogen and helium this situation can be explained by modern theories of atomic structure in a quantum mechanical description of atomic structure this period corresponds to filling of 1s orbital period 1 elements obey duet rule in that they need two electrons to complete their valence shell hydrogen and helium are oldest and most abundant elements in universe periodic trends all other periods in period table contain at least 8 elements and it is often helpful to consider periodic trends across period however period 1 contains only two elements so this concept does not apply here in terms of vertical trends down groups helium can be seen as a typical noble gas at head of iupac group 18 but as discussed below hydrogen s chemistry is unique and it is not easily assigned to any group position of period 1 elements in periodic table first electron shell consists of only one orbital and maximum number of valence electrons that a period 1 element can accommodate is two both in 1s orbital valence shell lacks p or any other kind of orbitals due to general constraint on quantum numbers therefore period 1 has exactly two elements although both hydrogen and helium are in s block neither of them behaves similarly to other s block elements their behaviour is so different from other s block elements that there is considerable disagreement over where these two elements should be placed in periodic table hydrogen belongs to group 1 which places it above lithium it is sometimes placed above carbon above fluorine above both lithium and fluorine appearing twice or left floating above other elements and not assigned to any group in periodic table helium has a complete valence shell and hence is almost always placed above neon which is in p block in periodic table as a noble gas although it is occasionally placed above beryllium due to their similar electron configuration elements chemical element chemical

with atomic number 1 at standard temperature and pressure hydrogen is a colorless odorless nonmetallic tasteless highly flammable diatomic gas with molecular formula h2 with an atomic mass of 1 amu hydrogen is lightest element hydrogen is most abundant of chemical elements constituting roughly 75 of universe s elemental mass stars in main sequence are mainly composed of hydrogen in its plasma state elemental hydrogen is relatively rare on earth and is industrially produced from hydrocarbons such as methane after which most elemental hydrogen is used meaning locally at production site with largest markets almost equally divided between fossil fuel upgrading such as hydrocracking and ammonia production mostly for fertilizer market hydrogen may be produced from water using process of electrolysis but this process is significantly more expensive commercially than hydrogen production from natural gas most common naturally occurring isotope of hydrogen known as protium has a single proton and no neutrons in ionic compounds it can take on either a positive charge becoming a cation composed of a bare proton or a negative charge becoming an anion known as a hydride hydrogen can form compounds with most elements and is present in water and most organic compounds it plays a particularly important role in acid base chemistry in which many reactions involve exchange of protons between soluble molecules as only neutral atom for which schrodinger equation can be solved analytically study of energetics and spectrum of hydrogen atom has played a key role in development of quantum mechanics interactions of hydrogen with various metals are very important in metallurgy as many metals can suffer hydrogen embrittlement and in developing safe ways to store it for use as a fuel hydrogen is highly soluble in many compounds composed of rare earth metals and transition metals and can be dissolved in both crystalline and amorphous metals hydrogen solubility in metals is influenced by local distortions or impurities in metal crystal lattice helium thumb upright 150px helium discharge tube helium he is a colorless odorless tasteless non toxic inert monatomic chemical element that heads noble gas series in periodic table and whose atomic number is 2 its boiling and melting points are lowest among elements and it exists only as a gas except in extreme conditions helium was discovered in 1868 by french astronomer pierre janssen who first detected substance as an unknown yellow spectral line signature in light from a solar eclipse in 1903 large reserves of helium were found in natural gas fields of united states which is by far largest supplier of gas substance is used in cryogenics in deep sea breathing systems to cool superconducting magnets in helium dating for inflating balloons for providing lift in airships and as a protective gas for industrial uses such as arc welding and growing silicon wafers inhaling a small volume of gas temporarily changes timbre and quality of human voice behavior of liquid helium 4 s two fluid phases helium i and helium ii is important to researchers studying quantum mechanics and phenomenon of superfluidity in particular and to those looking at effects that temperatures near absolute zero have on matter such as with superconductivity helium is second lightest element and is second most abundant in observable universe most helium was formed during big bang but new helium is being created as a result of nuclear fusion of hydrogen in stars on earth helium is relatively rare and is created by natural decay of some radioactive elements because alpha particles that are emitted consist of helium nuclei this radiogenic helium is trapped with natural gas in concentrations of up to seven percent by volume from which it is extracted commercially by a low temperature separation process called fractional distillation references further reading category periods periodic table
