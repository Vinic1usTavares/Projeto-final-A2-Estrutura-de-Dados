typhoon kirogi known in philippines as typhoon ditang was a large typhoon that caused severe damage in japan during early july 2000 forming out of an area of disturbed weather on june 30 kirogi initially tracked slowly towards north on july 3 storm underwent rapid intensification and attained category 4 status on saffir simpson hurricane scale next day according to jtwc on july 5 japan meteorological agency jma assessed storm to have reached its peak intensity with winds of 155 km h 100 mph 10 minute sustained and a barometric pressure of 940 mbar hpa 27 76 inhg over following several days storm tracked towards northeast and accelerated towards japan early on july 8 kirogi brushed eastern japan before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone initial news reports stated that kirogi produced deadly flooding in philippines however storm was too far from country to have any impacts in japan kirogi produced torrential rainfall and high winds killing five people and leaving 15 billion 2001 jpy 140 million usd in damages flooding inundated nearly 1 300 homes around tokyo and high winds cut power to roughly 20 000 residences three homes were destroyed in a landslide on kozushima meteorological history typhoon kirogi originated out of a disorganized area of showers and thunderstorms on june 30 2000 associated with a weak area of low pressure situated roughly 650 km 405 mi east of philippine island of mindanao system remained nearly stationary for two days as it became increasingly organized on july 1 joint typhoon warning center jtwc issued a tropical cyclone formation alert as they anticipated low to develop into a significant tropical cyclone within 24 hours around 0600 utc following day japan meteorological agency jma began monitoring system as a tropical depression at same time jtwc also classified system as tropical depression 05w and six hours later philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration pagasa began issuing advisories on same system classifying it as tropical depression ditang throughout day on july 2 depression began to take a slow northward track in response to a mid level subtropical ridge to east and later that day jtwc upgraded it to a tropical storm early next day jma also upgraded system to a tropical storm at which time it received name kirogi although a broad cyclone convection was gradually wrapping around southern periphery of circulation several hours after being named jma upgraded kirogi to a severe tropical storm and later a typhoon at same time jtwc classified storm as a typhoon upon being upgraded typhoon featured a well developed outflow and prominent banding features consolidating around system thumb right typhoon kirogi approaching japan on july 7 alt satellite image of a weakening typhoon south of japan storm s eye is mostly cloud filled and cloud cover is mostly extending to north of center not long after attaining typhoon intensity kirogi began to undergo rapid intensification roughly 18 hours later jtwc reported that storm had attained its peak intensity with winds of 215 km h 135 mph 1 minute sustained equivalent to a category 4 hurricane on saffir simpson hurricane scale by this time typhoon was situated roughly 870 km 540 mi southeast of okinawa storm featured a 59 km 37 mi wide symmetrical eye early on july 5 jma reported that kirogi attained its peak intensity with winds of 155 km h 100 mph 10 minute sustained and a barometric pressure of 940 mbar hpa 27 76 inhg storm was a relatively large typhoon with a gale diameter of 520 km 325 mi several hours after attaining peak intensity on july 5 a mid level trough caused convection around center of kirogi to weaken and eye became cloud filled later in day most of convective bands were confined to eastern periphery of system around this time storm took a northeasterly track which it maintained for several days increasing in forward motion storm began to weaken however it also grew in size by july 6 storm had a gale diameter of 925 km 575 mi gradual weakening took place as kirogi tracked towards japan with both jtwc and jma reporting sustained winds at 140 km h 85 mph by july 7 early on july 8 storm brushed eastern coast of japan near chiba with winds of 130 km h 80 mph 10 minute sustained several hours later typhoon weakened to a severe tropical storm before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone near southeast coast of hokkaido by this time storm took a sharp eastward turn and briefly slowed before re accelerating remnants of storm persisted until july 10 at which time it dissipated to southwest of aleutian islands to measure wind speeds at storm s center japan meteorological agency and joint typhoon warning center use 10 minute sustained winds and one minute sustained winds respectively conversion factor between 10 minute and one minute winds is 1 14x jma s peak intensity for kirogi was 155 km h 100 mph 10 minute sustained or 185 km h 115 mph one minute sustained jtwc s peak intensity for kirogi was 215 km h 135 mph one minute sustained or 185 km h 115 mph 10 minute sustained preparations and impact philippines in typhoon s early stages news reports stated that outer bands of storm produced heavy rainfall in philippines resulting in 16 fatalities however a meteorological analysis of storm showed that kirogi was not responsible for rain instead a monsoon depression that later became typhoon kai tak caused flooding rains typhoon kirogi was never closer than 835 km 520 mi from philippines however large swells produced by storm caused moderate damage along coastal areas of philippines forcing workers in manila to clear debris left by damaging waves japan thumb right 220px severe tropical storm kirogi

clouds cover center of storm in japan kirogi became first typhoon to threaten city of tokyo since a storm in 1989 pacific typhoon season prompting hundreds of residents to evacuate a total of 120 flights were canceled ahead of storm and 30 ferry services were halted due to rough seas up to on kozushima 788 residents were evacuated as heavy rain from typhoon produced landslides forecasters warned that upwards of of rain could fall in tokyo region in city of tokyo japanese officials ordered 800 residents to evacuate to shelters due to threat of typhoon kirogi since storm weakened considerably from its peak intensity damage was much less than initially anticipated in all damages from storm amounted to 15 billion 2001 jpy 140 million usd three people were killed by storm all of whom were found in irrigation ditches first fatality was an 81 year old man second was a 30 year old man who lost control of his car and crashed into a ditch and last fatality was a 3 year old boy who fell in a ditch near his home two 11 year old boys initially reported as missing were later found in a ditch after being swept away by flood waters about 1 300 homes were inundated by flood waters around tokyo and three were destroyed on kozushima by a landslide widespread power outages took place leaving an estimated 20 000 people without power in kanagawa and shizuoka prefectures as winds up to knocked down trees and power lines rainfall from storm fell at rates of 55 mm h 2 2 in h total amounts reached in tokyo on izu oshima and in miyagi prefecture these rains were more than double monthly average for july in eastern japan rainfall up to caused flooding throughout eastern hokkaido resulting in widespread agricultural losses throughout aomori prefecture large stretches of roads were washed out by flood waters and several thousand homes were inundated damage from storm in aomori was estimated at 600 million 2001 jpy 6 6 million usd in obihiro hokkaido a total of of agricultural land was inundated by flood waters fishing industry in district hokkaido sustained severe losses amounting to 889 million 2001 jpy 10 million usd high winds in district resulted in
