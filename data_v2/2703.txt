cranial nerves are nerves that emerge directly from brain including brainstem in contrast to spinal nerves which emerge from segments of spinal cord ten of cranial nerves originate in brainstem cranial nerves relay information between brain and parts of body primarily to and from regions of head and neck spinal nerves emerge sequentially from spinal cord with spinal nerve closest to head c1 emerging in space above first cervical vertebra cranial nerves however emerge from central nervous system above this level each cranial nerve is paired and is present on both sides depending on definition in humans there are twelve or thirteen cranial nerves pairs which are assigned roman numerals i xii sometimes also including cranial nerve zero numbering of cranial nerves is based on order in which they emerge from brain front to back brainstem terminal nerves 0 olfactory nerves i and optic nerves ii emerge from cerebrum or forebrain and remaining ten pairs arise from brainstem which is lower part of brain cranial nerves are considered components of peripheral nervous system pns although on a structural level olfactory i optic ii and trigeminal v nerves are more accurately considered part of central nervous system cns board review series neuroanatomy fourth edition lippincott williams wilkins maryland 2008 p 177 anatomy most typically humans are considered to have twelve pairs of cranial nerves i xii with terminal nerve 0 more recently canonized they are olfactory nerve i optic nerve ii oculomotor nerve iii trochlear nerve iv trigeminal nerve v abducens nerve vi facial nerve vii vestibulocochlear nerve viii glossopharyngeal nerve ix vagus nerve x accessory nerve xi and hypoglossal nerve xii terminology cranial nerves are generally named according to their structure or function for example olfactory nerve i supplies smell and facial nerve vii supplies motor innervation to face because latin was lingua franca common language of study of anatomy when nerves were first documented recorded and discussed many nerves maintain latin or greek names including trochlear nerve iv named according to its structure as it supplies a muscle that attaches to a pulley trigeminal nerve v is named in accordance with its three components meaning triplets and vagus nerve x is named for its wandering course cranial nerves are numbered based on their rostral caudal front back position when viewing brain if brain is carefully removed from skull nerves are typically visible in their numeric order with exception of last cn xii which appears to emerge rostrally to above cn xi cranial nerves have paths within and outside skull paths within skull are called intracranial and paths outside skull are called extracranial there are many holes in skull called foramina by which nerves can exit skull all cranial nerves are paired which means that they occur on both right and left sides of body muscle skin or additional function supplied by a nerve on same side of body as side it originates from is referred to an ipsilateral function if function is on opposite side to origin of nerve this is known as a contralateral function intracranial course nuclei cell bodies of many of neurons of most of cranial nerves are contained in one or more nuclei in brainstem these nuclei are important relative to cranial nerve dysfunction because damage to these nuclei such as from a stroke or trauma can mimic damage to one or more branches of a cranial nerve in terms of specific cranial nerve nuclei midbrain of brainstem has nuclei of oculomotor nerve iii and trochlear nerve iv pons has nuclei of trigeminal nerve v abducens nerve vi facial nerve vii and vestibulocochlear nerve viii and medulla has nuclei of glossopharyngeal nerve ix vagus nerve x accessory nerve xi and hypoglossal nerve xii fibers of these cranial nerves exit brainstem from these nuclei ganglia some of cranial nerves have sensory or parasympathetic ganglia collections of cell bodies of neurons which are located outside brain but can be inside or outside skull sensory ganglia of cranial nerves directly correspond to dorsal root ganglia of spinal nerves and are known as cranial nerve ganglia sensory ganglia exist for nerves with sensory function v vii viii ix x there are also parasympathetic ganglia which are part of autonomic nervous system for cranial nerves iii vii ix and x trigeminal ganglia of trigeminal nerve v occupies a space in dura mater called trigeminal cave this ganglion contains cell bodies of sensory fibers of three branches of trigeminal nerve geniculate ganglion of facial nerve vii is found just after nerve enters facial canal it contains cell bodies of sensory fibers of facial nerve superior and inferior ganglia of glossopharyngeal nerve ix are located just after nerve passes through jugular foramen and contain cell bodies of sensory fibers of this nerve inferior ganglion of vagus nerve ganglion is located below jugular foramen and contains cell bodies of sensory fibers of vagus nerve x exiting skull and extracranial course exits of cranial nerves from skull location nerve cribriform plate terminal nerve 0 cribriform plate olfactory nerve i optic foramen optic nerve ii superior orbital fissure oculomotor iii trochlear iv abducens vi trigeminal v1 ophthalmic foramen rotundum trigeminal v2 maxillary foramen ovale trigeminal v3 mandibular stylomastoid foramen facial nerve vii internal auditory canal vestibulocochlear viii jugular foramen glossopharyngeal ix vagus x accessory xi hypoglossal canal hypoglossal xii after emerging from brain cranial nerves travel within skull and some must leave this bony compartment in order to reach their destinations often nerves pass through holes in skull called foramina as they travel to their destinations other nerves pass through bony canals longer pathways enclosed by bone these foramina and canals may contain more than one cranial nerve and may also contain blood vessels terminal nerve 0 is a thin plexus of fibers associated with dura and lamina terminalis running rostral to olfactory nerve with projections through cribriform plate olfactory nerve i actually composed of many small separate nerve fibers passes through perforations in cribriform plate part of bone these fibers terminate in upper part of nasal cavity and function to convey impulses containing information about odors to brain optic nerve ii passes through optic foramen in sphenoid bone as it travels to eye it conveys visual information to brain oculomotor nerve iii trochlear nerve iv abducens nerve vi and ophthalmic branch of trigeminal nerve v1 travel through cavernous sinus into superior orbital fissure passing out of skull into orbit these nerves control small muscles that move eye and also provide sensory innervation to eye and orbit maxillary division of trigeminal nerve v2 passes through foramen rotundum in sphenoid bone to supply skin of middle of face mandibular division of trigeminal nerve v3 passes through foramen ovale of sphenoid bone to supply lower face with sensory innervation this nerve also sends branches to almost all of muscles that control chewing facial nerve vii and vestibulocochlear nerve viii both enter internal auditory canal in temporal bone facial nerve then reaches side of face by using stylomastoid foramen also in temporal bone its fibers then spread out to reach and control all of muscles of facial expression vestibulocochlear nerve reaches organs that control balance and hearing in temporal bone and therefore does not reach external surface of skull glossopharyngeal ix vagus x and accessory nerve xi all leave skull via jugular foramen to enter neck glossopharyngeal nerve provides innervation to upper throat and back of tongue vagus provides innervation to muscles in voicebox and continues downward to supply parasympathetic innervation to chest and abdomen accessory nerve controls trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles in neck and shoulder hypoglossal nerve xii exits skull using hypoglossal canal in occipital bone and reaches tongue to control almost all of muscles involved in movements of this organ function cranial nerves provide motor and sensory innervation mainly to structures within head and neck sensory innervation includes both general sensation such as temperature and touch and special innervation such as taste vision smell balance and hearing vagus nerve x provides sensory and autonomic parasympathetic motor innervation to structures in neck and also to most of organs in chest and abdomen pheromonal response 0 terminal nerve 0 is involved in hormonal responses to smell and has been implicated in sexual response and mate selection smell i olfactory nerve i conveys sense of smell damage to olfactory nerve i can cause an inability to smell a distortion in sense of smell or a distortion or lack of taste if there is suspicion of a change in sense of smell each nostril is tested with substances of known odors such as coffee or soap intensely smelling substances for example ammonia may lead to activation of pain receptors of trigeminal nerve that are located in nasal cavity and this can confound olfactory testing vision ii optic nerve ii transmits visual information damage to optic nerve ii affects specific aspects of vision that depend on location of lesion a person may not be able to see objects on their left or right sides homonymous hemianopsia or may have difficulty seeing objects on their outer visual fields bitemporal hemianopsia if optic chiasm is involved vision may be tested by examining visual field or by examining retina with an ophthalmoscope using a process known as visual field testing may be used to pin point structural lesions in optic nerve or further along visual pathways eye movement iii iv vi thumb 150px various deviations of eyes due to abnormal function of targets of cranial nerves oculomotor nerve iii trochlear nerve iv and abducens nerve vi coordinate eye movement damage to nerves iii iv or vi may affect movement of eyeball globe both or one eye may be affected in either case double vision diplopia will likely occur because movements of eyes are no longer synchronized nerves iii iv and vi are tested by observing how eye follows an object in different directions this object may be a finger or a pin and may be moved at different directions to test for pursuit velocity if eyes do not work together most likely cause is damage to a specific cranial nerve or its nuclei damage to oculomotor nerve iii can cause double vision diplopia and inability to coordinate movements of both eyes strabismus also eyelid drooping ptosis and pupil dilation lesions may also lead to inability to open eye due to paralysis of levator muscle individuals suffering from a lesion to oculomotor nerve may compensate by tilting their heads to alleviate symptoms due to paralysis of one or more of eye muscles it controls damage to trochlear nerve iv can also cause diplopia with eye adducted and elevated result will be an eye which can not move downwards properly especially downwards when in an inward position this is due to impairment in superior oblique muscle which is innervated by trochlear nerve damage to abducens nerve vi can also result in diplopia this is due to impairment in lateral rectus muscle which is innervated by abducens nerve trigeminal nerve v trigeminal nerve v comprises three distinct parts ophthalmic v1 maxillary v2 and mandibular v3 nerves combined these nerves provide sensation to skin of face and also controls muscles of mastication chewing conditions affecting trigeminal nerve v include trigeminal neuralgia cluster headache and trigeminal zoster trigeminal neuralgia occurs later in life from middle age onwards most often after age 60 and is a condition typically associated with very strong pain distributed over area innervated by maxillary or mandibular nerve divisions of trigeminal nerve v2 and v3 thumb upright facial nerve passes through temporal bone internal auditory meatus facial canal stylomastoid foramen and then parotid gland facial expression vii lesions of facial nerve vii may manifest as facial palsy this is where a person is unable to move muscles on one or both sides of their face in blunt trauma facial nerve is most commonly injured cranial nerve a very common and generally temporary facial palsy is known as bell s palsy bell s palsy is result of an idiopathic unknown cause unilateral lower motor neuron lesion of facial nerve and is characterized by an inability to move ipsilateral muscles of facial expression including elevation of eyebrow and furrowing of forehead patients with bell s palsy often have a drooping mouth on affected side and often have trouble chewing because buccinator muscle is affected bell s palsy occurs very rarely affecting around 40 000 americans annually there are studies in mice and humans suggesting members of family are capable of producing bell s palsy facial paralysis may be caused by other conditions including stroke and similar conditions to bell s palsy are occasionally misdiagnosed as bell s palsy bell s palsy fact sheet http ws causes of facial palsy bell s palsy is a temporary condition usually lasting 2 6 months but can have life changing effects and can reoccur strokes typically also affect seventh cranial nerve by cutting off blood supply to nerves in brain that signal this nerve and so can present with similar symptoms hearing and balance viii vestibulocochlear nerve viii splits into vestibular and cochlear nerve vestibular part is responsible for innervating vestibules and semicircular canal of inner ear this structure transmits information about balance and is an important component of reflex which keeps head stable and allows eyes to track moving objects cochlear nerve transmits information from cochlea allowing sound to be heard when damaged vestibular nerve may give rise to sensation of spinning and dizziness function of vestibular nerve may be tested by putting cold and warm water in ears and watching eye movements caloric stimulation damage to vestibulocochlear nerve can also present as repetitive and involuntary eye movements nystagmus particularly when looking in a horizontal plane damage to cochlear nerve will cause partial or complete deafness in affected ear oral sensation taste and salivation ix right thumb 100px deviating uvula due to cranial nerve ix lesion glossopharyngeal nerve ix innervates muscle and provides sensory innervation to oropharynx and back of tongue glossopharyngeal nerve also provides parasympathetic innervation to parotid gland unilateral absence of a gag reflex suggests a lesion of glossopharyngeal nerve ix and perhaps vagus nerve x bickley lynn s peter g szilagyi and barbara bates bates guide to physical examination and history taking philadelphia wolters kluwer health lippincott williams wilkins 2013 print vagus nerve x loss of function of vagus nerve x will lead to a loss of parasympathetic innervation to a very large number of structures major effects of damage to vagus nerve may include a rise in blood pressure and heart rate isolated dysfunction of only vagus nerve is rare but if lesion is located above point at which vagus first branches off can be diagnosed by a hoarse voice due to dysfunction of one of its branches recurrent laryngeal nerve damage to this nerve may result in difficulties swallowing shoulder elevation and head turning xi right 120px thumb winged scapula may occur due to lesion of spinal accessory damage to accessory nerve xi will lead to ipsilateral weakness in trapezius muscle this can be tested by asking subject to raise their shoulders or shrug upon which shoulder blade scapula will protrude into a winged position additionally if nerve is damaged weakness or an inability to elevate scapula may be present because levator scapulae muscle is now solely able to provide this function depending on location of lesion there may also be weakness present in sternocleidomastoid muscle which acts to turn head so that face points to opposite side tongue movement xii hypoglossal nerve xii is unique in that it is innervated from motor cortices of both hemispheres of brain damage to nerve at lower motor neuron level may lead to fasciculations or atrophy of muscles of tongue fasciculations of tongue are sometimes said to look like a bag of worms upper motor neuron damage will not lead to atrophy or fasciculations but only weakness of innervated muscles when nerve is damaged it will lead to weakness of tongue movement on one side when damaged and extended tongue will move towards weaker or damaged side as shown in image clinical significance examination physicians neurologists and other medical professionals may conduct a cranial nerve examination as part of a neurological examination to examine functionality of cranial nerves this is a highly formalized series of tests that assess status of each nerve a cranial nerve exam begins with observation of patient because some cranial nerve lesions may affect symmetry of eyes or face visual fields are tested for nerve lesions or nystagmus via an analysis of specific eye movements sensation of face is tested and patients are asked to perform different facial movements such as puffing out of cheeks hearing is checked by voice and tuning forks position of patient s uvula is examined because asymmetry in position could indicate a lesion of glossopharyngeal nerve after ability of patient to use their shoulder to assess accessory nerve xi and patient s tongue function is assessed by observing various tongue movements damage compression nerves may be compressed because of increased intracranial pressure a mass effect of an intracerebral haemorrhage or tumour that presses against nerves and interferes with transmission of impulses along nerve a loss of functionality of a single cranial nerve may sometimes be first symptom of an intracranial or skull base cancer an increase in intracranial pressure may lead to impairment of optic nerves ii due to compression of surrounding veins and capillaries causing swelling of eyeball a cancer such as an optic glioma may also impact optic nerve ii a pituitary tumour may compress optic tracts or optic chiasm of optic nerve ii leading to visual field loss a pituitary tumour may also extend into cavernous sinus compressing nerve iii trochlear nerve iv and abducens nerve vi leading to double vision and strabismus these nerves may also be affected by herniation of temporal lobes of brain through cerebri cause of trigeminal neuralgia in which one side of face is exquisitely painful is thought to be compression of nerve by an artery as nerve emerges from brain stem an acoustic particularly at junction between pons and medulla may compress facial nerve vii and vestibulocochlear nerve viii leading to hearing and sensory loss on affected side stroke occlusion of blood vessels that supply nerves or their nuclei an ischemic stroke may cause specific signs and symptoms that can localise where occlusion occurred a clot in a blood vessel draining cavernous sinus cavernous sinus thrombosis affects oculomotor iii trochlear iv branch of trigeminal nerve v1 and abducens nerve vi inflammation inflammation resulting from infection may impair function of any of cranial nerves inflammation of facial nerve vii may result in bell s palsy multiple sclerosis an inflammatory process that may produce a loss of myelin which surround cranial nerves may cause a variety of shifting symptoms affecting multiple cranial nerves other trauma to skull disease of bone such as paget s disease and injury to nerves during neurosurgery such as tumor removal are other possible causes of cranial nerve damage history graeco roman anatomist galen ad 129 210 named seven pairs of cranial nerves much later in 1664 english anatomist sir thomas willis suggested that there were actually 9 pairs of nerves finally in 1778 german anatomist samuel named 12 pairs of nerves that are generally accepted today however because many of nerves emerge from brain stem as rootlets there is continual debate as to how many nerves there actually are and how they should be grouped there is reason to consider both olfactory i and optic ii nerves to be brain tracts rather than cranial nerves further very small terminal nerve nerve n or o exists in humans but may not be functional in other animals it appears to be important to sexual receptivity based on perceptions of other animals cranial nerves are also present in other vertebrates other amniotes non amphibian tetrapods have cranial nerves similar to those of humans in fishes and amphibians accessory nerve xi and hypoglossal nerve xii do not exist with accessory nerve xi being an integral part of vagus nerve x hypoglossal nerve xii is represented by a variable number of spinal nerves emerging from vertebral segments fused into occiput these two nerves only became discrete nerves in ancestors of amniotes non amphibian tetrapods see also cranial nerve mnemonics references external links cranial nerves yale school of medicine
