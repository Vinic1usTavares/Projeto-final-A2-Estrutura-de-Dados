best known for introduction of recurring character elim garak fields said of character at time we didn t want to make him an out and out spy because then what would you do with him after episode you d have to put him in jail on bajor so we tread a pretty thin line fields had decided when creating character that station needed a cardassian on board and when no one objected to his suggestion to put him in a tailor shop that became garak s profession this was a reference to man from u n c l e which used a tailor shop as a front as fields had begun his writing career on that series andrew robinson

think we d have a much healthier industry robinson said that garak was a complicated character which required use of subtext adding that it wasn t a simple way to portray a character but when you do
