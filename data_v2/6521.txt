jtsa which he had co founded with sabato morais in 1886 in his view training american born rabbis at seminary would be a much more effective means of fighting growing strength of american reform judaism these native english speaking rabbis would appeal to younger generation far more than imported yiddish speaking ones gurock 1998 p 256 footnote 14 association of american orthodox hebrew congregations rejected morais s position and offered role to a number of leading east european orthodox rabbis all of whom turned it down they eventually narrowed field to two candidates zvi

been chosen in part for his fabulous skills as an orator his speaking style and sermons which had been so beloved in europe did not impress new york audiences according to abraham cahan of very people who drank in his words in vilna left synagogue in middle of his sermon here in october 1888 joseph made his first significant statement as chief rabbi he issued new regulations for new york s jewish poultry business in an attempt to bring it into accordance with jewish law funds for supporting agency supervising adherence to these regulations were to be raised through an increase in price of meat and chicken affected vendors and consumers however refused to pay this levy they likened it to a tax on meat in russia they despised and organized a mass meeting in january 1889 against imported rabbi joseph never succeeded in organizing kosher meat business joseph was also unable to stop those who came to hear him speak from desecrating sabbath and his yiddish sermons had no impact on younger
