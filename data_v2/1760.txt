ii in 1945 and at time closest forces were 24th infantry division of eighth united states army which was headquartered in japan division was understrength and most of its equipment was antiquated due to reductions in military spending regardless 24th infantry division was ordered into south korea thumb left alt a city square filled with soldiers and civilians smoke is in sky in background behind a

almost completely destroyed but delaying north korean forces from advancing until july 20 by that time eighth army s force of combat troops were roughly equal to north korean forces attacking region at around 70 000 for each side with new un units arriving every day replacements arrive on july 20 400 hastily assembled us army recruits arrived in okinawa aboard inexperienced soldiers were assigned to 29th infantry regiment 2nd infantry division a command that was preparing other battalions to move into korea and to relieve other units of 24th infantry division new formations now consisting mostly of soldiers who had no combat experience and grouped into two battalions were immediately sent into pusan headquarters of regiment remained behind to form a new regiment this regiment would originally be in charge of defense of okinawa but would later be rushed into korea two battalions landed in pusan on july 21 and were assigned to 19th infantry regiment 24th infantry division but they retained their designations as 1st and 3rd battalions of 29th infantry regiment instead of being given time to train and prepare to enter front lines battalions were immediately sent to regiment s sector at chinju by july 22 units were on front lines with new equipment equipment fresh from production lines was not prepared for combat despite promises from several commanders that unit would be given time to do so battle american planners believed that hadong area was under attack from elements of kpa 4th division having just received replacements following its victory at taejon however soldiers in area were actually from kpa 6th division under command of general pang ho san two divisions were coordinating to envelop un s left flank and were extremely spread out therefore only groups

pass a southern route into pusan from any advancing north korean forces hadong was seen as a significant path into chinju despite its lack of defenses north koreans in meantime advanced to hadong and captured village which was lightly defended by a group of south korean police as no military was available due to manpower shortages kpa 6th division set up in roads east of village and began sending probes and scout parties to east move was part of a larger coordinated operation by 6th division to take chinju and then masan in hopes of flanking un lines at their vulnerable southern limit thinking

an interpreter and guide for 3rd battalion on its mission he accompanied battalion with only a few of his aides battalion was forced to take several detours through konyang because of impassable roads and it was delayed in its arrival to hadong shortly before dawn troops encountered a truck of 15 south korean militia who claimed they were remains of a 400 man unit that had been wiped out by kpa forces in area mott sent his executive officer back to command post to ask moore for further instructions and moore ordered them to proceed with mission because battalion had no radio equipment it was forced to send a runner to relay this information and he returned by nightfall forcing battalion to encamp in village of west of hadong for night ambush at 08 45 on july 27 battalion moved out towards
