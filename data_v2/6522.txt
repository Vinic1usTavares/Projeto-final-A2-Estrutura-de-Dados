seventeenth round of 2010 formula one season and first korean grand prix 55 lap race was won by ferrari driver fernando alonso who started from third position lewis hamilton finished second for mclaren and alonso s teammate felipe massa was third race began behind safety car but was stopped after three laps because of a large amount of standing water on circuit after a 45 minute delay race was restarted and safety car was withdrawn after thirteen laps pole sitter sebastian vettel maintained his lead going into first corner a second safety car deployment caused by collision of mark webber and nico rosberg on lap nineteen closed up field but vettel retained lead alonso maintained second position until a botched pit stop during a third safety car period caused him to drop to third at restart on lap thirty five hamilton ran wide at first corner allowing alonso back into second place vettel s engine failed eleven laps later promoting alonso to lead which he maintained to win race victory was alonso s fifth of season result elevated him to lead of drivers championship eleven points ahead of webber who had dropped to second after failing to finish race hamilton moved into third and vettel s retirement demoted him to fourth jenson button remained in fifth position in world constructors championship mclaren reduced points deficit to red bull to twenty seven points behind with two races of season remaining ferrari was a further twenty five points adrift report background grand prix was contested by twelve teams with two drivers each teams also known as constructors were red bull mercedes mclaren ferrari renault williams force india sauber toro rosso lotus hispania and virgin tyre supplier bridgestone provided four types of tyres to race two dry compounds soft options and hard primes and wet weather compounds intermediate and full wet soft compounds were denoted by a green stripe on their side walls wet compound tyres were identified by a green line at bottom of their central groove rules of 2010 grands prix races stipulated that all cars should use both types of tyre during race unless driver used any one of two wet weather compounds each driver was limited to eleven sets of dry tyres for weekend before race red bull driver mark webber led drivers championship with 220 points he was ahead of fernando alonso and sebastian vettel who were tied for second place on 206 points lewis hamilton was in fourth with 192 points and hamilton s teammate jenson button was fifth on 189 points seventy five points were available for three remaining races which meant hamilton or button could still win title both drivers would mathematically stay in contention if alonso or vettel won race and neither mclaren driver finished in a points scoring position red bull led constructors championship with 426 points mclaren and ferrari were second and third with 381 and 334 points respectively while mercedes on 176 points and renault on 133 contended for fourth place red bull mclaren and ferrari had so far won races in previous sixteen rounds of season felipe massa twice and robert kubica had finished in second place and nico rosberg massa twice kubica once had all finished in third with three races remaining in championship and a fourteen point advantage webber said he would continue his pursuit of title i need to keep racing hard and going for victories clearly if my rivals have a rough weekend it makes it a bit harder for them and it gives me a bit more scope but i m not looking to abuse that because it can all go pear shaped very fast vettel said his season had been fraught with car problems but he remained positive about his chances i think it s normal to have ups and downs and sometimes you have more sometimes less but as i said expectation was probably to be in a position to fight for championship and i think we re in a very strong and very good position alonso urged his teammate massa to help him in his title bid and said korean grand prix could become decisive for his championship rivals he favoured hamilton to win korean grand prix with hamilton twenty eight points behind webber and with button a further three points behind his teammate mclaren s team principal martin whitmarsh said his drivers would keep their focus in season s remaining three races and produce consistent performances karun who raced for hispania in first ten races of season said red bull were favourites to win and that he thought circuit s three long straights would suit mclaren cars following increased hostilities between north korea and south korea in wake of sinking of south korean corvette in march 2010 formula one group chief executive bernie ecclestone said race would be in jeopardy if political tensions continued to escalate and it would be abandoned if north korean army crossed border revival of french grand prix at circuit de nevers magny cours was mooted as an alternative if korean grand prix was cancelled although hostilities between two nations eventually relaxed race was further threatened by delayed construction on 27 september 2010 ecclestone said he doubted circuit would be ready despite laying of tarmac a final inspection of circuit took place on 11 october federation internationale de l automobile fia safety delegate charlie whiting certified that circuit was ready on 12 october top layer of track was completed ten days before race there was not enough time for elements to remove oils and bitumen chemicals in tarmac circuit designer hermann tilke said surface would be slippery making race challenging for drivers and exciting for fans layout of track received a mostly positive response from drivers adrian sutil of force india said he felt it was a real pleasure to be racing on track and praised it for having a lot of character mercedes driver michael schumacher said asphalt improved during friday free practice sessions and that track was very demanding and tricky which provides a challenge that i like a lot kubica said although first sector was boring he felt entire track layout was ten times better than abu dhabi drivers raised concerns about entry of pit lane at turn seventeen a corner taken at kubica said it might be quite tight if someone s pitting and lotus driver jarno trulli said he was worried about someone going into back of him when he was forced to pit because his car s gears were stuck in position he also said drivers would raise point with whiting some teams modified their cars in preparation for event red bull and williams revised their brake ducts williams team changed their brake ducts at front to improve airflow inside tyres and direct duct towards their car s central section more efficiently red bull s brake ducts which had been changed for third consecutive grand prix reintroduced a small fin seen at singapore grand prix for korea two aerodynamic fins were fitted and a larger duct was introduced mclaren modified a version of their front wings first introduced in singapore team added a vertical gurney flap and an additional vertical slot at front wing endplate to improve airflow outside front tyres and increase amount of downforce and therefore grip produced by bodywork team also brought a new rear wing and tested a new revision of their f duct system that debuted at japanese grand prix in suzuka ferrari revised their diffuser with curved profiles and one large middle plate designed to improve extraction of air from bottom of f10 as in suzuka toro rosso ran an f duct system in friday practice sessions practice and qualifying sessions thumb left alt a

international circuit although he was delighted to get pole position he felt he lost time in middle sector after making a mistake vettel s teammate webber was also on front row of grid he recorded a lap time 0 076 seconds slower webber was not happy with his first set of option tyres he chose to do two more timed laps on a new set of option tyres in third session alonso qualified third he said his starting position had realised ferrari s maximum potential he also aimed to ensure that he finished race because rain had been forecast alonso had been fastest driver during most of third session until vettel set his pole position lap hamilton set first session s fastest time of 1 37 113 he almost did not challenge for pole position because he avoided making contact with wall at pit lane entry he fell to fourth overall in final part of qualifying in faster of two mercedes rosberg secured fifth place massa in slower ferrari placed sixth massa was not happy because he would start race on dirty side of grid having encountered traffic during third session button complained about lack of grip and that he could not get his tyres to optimum temperature he managed seventh position but was happy to start on clean side of grid kubica recorded eighth fastest time and struggled with oversteer which prevented him from setting a faster lap time schumacher in slower mercedes took ninth place

reprimanded by stewards thumb left upright alt a man in his mid thirties waving his left hand he is wearing a white t shirt and a dark blue hat with sunglasses on top mark webber qualified in second alongside teammate vettel hulkenberg who qualified eleventh was fastest driver not to advance into final session his best time of 1 37 620 was 1 5 seconds slower than webber s pace in second session he said eleventh place was a good position to start from despite losing rear of his car in turn twelve which caused him to abort one of his quick laps hulkenberg was followed in times by bmw sauber drivers kobayashi in twelfth and heidfeld in thirteenth followed by sutil in quickest of two force india cars petrov who qualified in fifteenth was penalised five positions on grid because he had caused an avoidable accident with hulkenberg at start of previous race at suzuka petrov was aiming for a top ten grid position to minimise effects of his grid penalty but he spun on his final timed lap after hitting a kerb he was unable to set a quicker lap time because his tyres had become dirty hence jaime alguersuari inherited 15th position ahead of his teammate sebastien buemi who opted to run one flying lap with a light fuel load for his last run of second session but made minor mistakes which cost him time vitantonio liuzzi trulli and timo glock were quickest drivers unable to advance beyond first session liuzzi complained tyre wear on his soft compound tyres was so excessive it created a large amount of oversteer for half a lap tenth row of grid was filled by heikki kovalainen

conditions were unchanged drivers reported on circuit s condition via radio and race was suspended light rain prevented resumption of grand prix for over forty five minutes until marshals and road sweeping trucks removed some of excess water and dirt on track resin on newly laid track surface had prevented water from soaking into ground rain had eased slightly during suspension teams were allowed to change set up of their cars which were largely optimised for dry weather conditions race was restarted behind safety car with drivers in positions held before suspension safety car remained

retire schumacher moved up a position as he passed button for fifth position at turn three on same lap on lap twenty eight trulli drove back to his garage to retire with a hydraulics failure that was caused by his power steering becoming heavy during safety car period vettel set a new fastest lap of race of 1 54 098 extending his lead over alonso to 3 5 seconds button who was under pressure from hulkenberg and kubica made a pit stop at end of lap twenty eight for intermediate tyres and rejoined in fifteenth place kovalainen was sent into a spin by buemi having been passed by petrov two laps

suspension and front wing damage causing him to retire incident called for race s third safety car period during safety car deployment most of drivers made pit stops for intermediate tyres alonso who was called in by ferrari when vettel changed his strategy had a pit stop that proved problematic he arrived into his pit box sideways after locking his tyres one of his mechanics could not fit his front right wheel because he dropped a wheel nut he was required to fit a spare wheel nut onto tyre causing alonso to be stationary for longer than usual he lost third place to hamilton ferrari ordered massa to reduce his car speed on his out lap to help alonso minimise effects of losing second position glock drove back to his pit box where his mechanics examined his car for damage and decided to retire him from race kubica avoided making contact with sutil when his lollipop man stopped him before he could drive away from his pit box it was second time that season kubica and sutil were involved in an incident in a pit lane kubica had made contact with sutil when latter was driving into his pit box in hungarian grand prix safety car drove into pit lane at end of thirty fourth

hulkenberg by taking inside line at third corner sutil took to inside line and passed button for twelfth on lap thirty six button was pushed wide onto run off area and fell to fifteenth position as

nine alonso set a new fastest lap and closed gap to 1 2 seconds behind vettel at start of lap thirty seven further back sutil overtook heidfeld for twelfth on following lap sutil tried to pass kobayashi on lap thirty eight at turn three but out braked himself allowing kobayashi to retake position he passed kobayashi because of his higher straight line speed but sutil braked later and slid off track rejoining in fourteenth one lap later alonso was told by his team to drive less aggressively through turns seven and eight in an effort to preserve tyre life because he was spinning his tyres under acceleration at conclusion of lap thirty nine all of drivers had made pit stops vettel was leading alonso who was followed by hamilton massa schumacher barrichello petrov hulkenberg kubica

s fastest lap of 1 50 257 on lap 42 by lap forty four darkness reduced visibility and vettel reported he could not see braking point in turn one while hamilton told his team light level was fine drivers were dazzled and blinded by gear shift lights on their steering wheels as a consequence vettel lost half of his engine capacity through turn seventeen on lap 45 and felt strong vibrations at start of forty sixth lap vettel slowed with his engine problems and alonso passed him around inside to take lead vettel then pulled into a gap at main straight wall with smoke billowing from his engine and retired sutil tried to overtake kobayashi on lap forty seven but he slid into side of sauber sutil went off track to retire with suspension damage kobayashi continued hulkenberg spun off track on lap fifty two and made a pit stop for new tyres because his engineer on pit wall told him one of his tyres had developed a slow puncture barrichello ran wide on same lap and fell to seventh behind kubica and liuzzi alonso opened a gap of fourteen seconds to hamilton who was suffering from wear on his tyres as drivers struggled for grip and crossed finish line on lap fifty five it was

hulkenberg passed alguersuari on final lap to round out points scoring positions in tenth button was last driver on lead lap with kovalainen in thirteenth hispania teammates senna and yamamoto were last of classified finishers in fourteenth and fifteenth which was team s best race finish of season post race top three drivers appeared on podium to collect their trophies and spoke to media at a later press conference alonso said grand prix was one of best races of year for ferrari team and that wet weather conditions made victory more difficult i think it s one of most tricky conditions victories i ve ever had probably because we started with very extreme conditions red flag then a couple of laps behind safety car alonso said he would not alter his driving style in final two rounds of season hamilton said finishing in second was a great result and that he was very happy he also said he lost time to other drivers in final third of lap because of braking problems massa said that despite poor visibility he endured he was happy to finish third he also said he struggled with his rear tyres which caused him to slow petrov said he had mixed feelings after race having been in seventh position before his race ending crash on lap forty one i am disappointed to end race in wall and not in points but it was encouraging to be running in top ten barrichello placed fifth before he ran wide on lap fifty two and was passed by kubica and liuzzi said i was lucky with timing of safety car and we were running in a good position right up until closing stages unfortunately i just ran out of tyre in last five laps which cost us two places in end webber said he was at fault for causing accident between himself and rosberg on lap nineteen i thought i d managed to catch it but i lost car and made contact with wall then nico hit me which wrecked his race as well it was my mistake and it wasn t my day rosberg was puzzled over incident he said i don t understand why webber didn t hit brakes it was crazy to roll back across track like that gerhard berger who raced in formula one for thirteen years courted controversy when he accused webber of crashing deliberately and claimed webber planned to take out either alonso or hamilton red bull team principal christian horner defended webber in an interview with daily telegraph saying it was absurd that webber attempted to take out another competitor and stated car suffered heavy damage with collision with wall webber later went to rosberg and apologised for crash on friday before brazilian grand prix thumb left upright alt fernando alonso pictured at 2010 malaysian grand prix fernando alonso won race and became points leader after webber s retirement vettel said red bull did more or less a perfect job in race until his retirement from an engine failure on forty sixth lap renault principal engineer fabrice lom apologised to red bull for vettel s engine failure it was later revealed by vettel that engine was not to have been used in future races had it not failed horner subsequently said red bull would not be favouring vettel or webber for drivers championship in 2011 red bull advisor helmut marko said he had considered retirement from sport after vettel and webber failed to finish because he believed red bull had lost possibility to win title in 2010 after webber and vettel retired members of mclaren and ferrari teams celebrated events sauber team principal peter sauber told blick it was very unsporting and that they were scenes that didn t please me at all button said problems with his front tyres caused him to lock up under braking he later described his race as sad button also told journalists he believed he was unable to defend drivers championship though said he would not assist hamilton unless button was mathematically ruled out buemi and sutil were summoned to stewards for roles in their respective accidents and incurred five place grid penalties for next race at interlagos sutil was fined 10 000 ps6 400 for driving in manner that was performed despite knowing of a problem with his brakes sutil said he struggled with excessive brake force which caused him to lock his tyres he was unhappy with his performance kobayashi said he saw sutil in his mirror and believed he would not complete buemi said his accident with glock was caused by him braking late and said he felt sorry for glock use of a safety car to start race had a mixed response within sport massa thanked whiting in media he said he felt whiting did an excellent job of managing situation making right decisions as to when to start race and when to bring in safety car at right moment schumacher petrov sutil and buemi also agreed with decision to start under safety car conditions hamilton said he felt length of time under safety car conditions was not good for spectators and it s not fun for drivers he additionally felt track was dry enough for a normal restart bbc commentator and former driver martin brundle said he felt race should have started earlier while button said he thought it should have been stopped before visibility deteriorated nevertheless grand prix was awarded race promoters trophy at fia gala awards held in monte carlo in december 2010 as a consequence of race alonso returned to lead of drivers championship on 231 points webber s failure to score dropped him to second eleven points behind alonso hamilton s second place finish moved him ahead of vettel with button still in fifth red bull retained led constructors championship despite not getting both cars to finish mclaren
