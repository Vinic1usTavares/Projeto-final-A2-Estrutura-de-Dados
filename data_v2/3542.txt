mindaugas c 1203 autumn 1263 was first known grand duke of lithuania and only christian king of lithuania little is known of his origins early life or rise to power he is mentioned in a 1219 treaty as an elder duke and in 1236 as leader of all lithuanians contemporary and modern sources discussing his ascent mention strategic marriages along with banishment or murder of his rivals he extended his domain into regions southeast of lithuania proper during 1230s and 1240s in 1250 or 1251 during course of internal power struggles he was baptised as a roman catholic this action enabled him to establish an alliance with livonian order a long standing antagonist of lithuanians during summer of 1253 he was crowned king of lithuania ruling between 300 000 and 400 000 subjects while his ten year reign was marked by various state building accomplishments mindaugas s conflicts with relatives and other dukes continued and samogitia western lithuania strongly resisted alliance s rule his gains in southeast were challenged by tatars he broke peace with livonian order in 1261 possibly renouncing christianity and was assassinated in 1263 by his nephew treniota and another rival duke daumantas his three immediate successors were assassinated as well disorder was not resolved until traidenis gained title of grand duke c 1270 although his reputation was unsettled during following centuries and his descendants were not notable he gained standing during 19th and 20th centuries mindaugas was only king of lithuania while most of lithuanian grand dukes from jogaila onward also reigned as kings of poland titles remained separate now generally considered founder of lithuanian state he is also now credited with stopping advance of tatars towards baltic sea establishing international recognition of lithuania and turning it towards western civilization in 1990s historian edvardas gudavicius published research supporting an exact coronation date 6 july 1253 this day is now an official national holiday in lithuania statehood day sources family and name thumb 250px baptism of mindaugas 17th century portrait contemporary written sources about mindaugas are very scarce much what is known about his reign is obtained from livonian rhymed chronicle and hypatian codex both of these chronicles were produced by enemies of lithuania and thus have anti lithuanian bias particularly hypatian codex they are also incomplete both of them lack dates and locations even for most important events for example livonian rhymed chronicle devoted 125 poetry lines to mindaugas s coronation but failed to mention either date or location other important sources are papal bulls regarding baptism and coronation of mindaugas lithuanians did not produce any surviving records themselves except for a series of acts granting lands to livonian order but their authenticity is disputed due to lack of sources some important questions regarding mindaugas and his reign cannot be answered because written sources covering era are scarce mindaugas s origins and family tree have not been conclusively established chronicles dating from 16th and 17th centuries have been discredited in this regard since they assert an ancestry from a noble family said to have originated within roman empire his year of birth sometimes given as c 1200 is at other times left as a question mark his father is mentioned in livonian rhymed chronicle as a powerful duke ein gross but is not named later chronicles give his name as dausprungas mentioned in text of a 1219 treaty is presumed to have been his brother and dausprungas sons tautvilas and his nephews he is thought to have had two sisters one married to vykintas and another to daniel of halych vykintas and his son treniota played major roles in later power struggles mindaugas had at least two wives morta and morta s sister whose name is unknown and possibly an earlier wife her existence is presumed because two children a son named vaisvilkas and an unnamed daughter married to svarn in 1255 were already leading independent lives when morta s children were still young in addition to vaisvilkas and his sister two sons ruklys and rupeikis are mentioned in written sources latter two were assassinated along with mindaugas information on his sons is limited and historians continue to discuss their number he may have had two other sons whose names were later conflated by scribes into ruklys and rupeikis in 13th century lithuania had little contact with foreign lands lithuanian names sounded obscure and unfamiliar to various chroniclers who altered them to sound more like names in their native language mindaugas s name in historic texts was recorded in various distorted forms mindowe in latin and in german and mindovg in polish and mindovg and in rus among others since rus sources provide most information about mindaugas s life they were judged most reliable by linguists reconstructing his original lithuanian name most popular rus rendition was mindovg which can quite easily and naturally be reconstructed as mindaugas or in 1909 lithuanian linguist published a research paper supporting suffix as which has since been widely accepted mindaugas is an archaic disyllabic lithuanian name used before christianization of lithuania and consists of two components min and daug its etymology may be traced to daug much wisdom or much fame rise to power thumb hillfort possibly site of voruta castle alleged capital of mindaugas lithuania was ruled during early 13th century by a number of dukes and princes presiding over various fiefdoms and tribes they were loosely bonded by commonalities of religion and tradition trade kinship joint military campaigns and presence of captured prisoners from neighboring areas western merchants and missionaries began seeking control of area during 12th century establishing city of riga latvia in 1201 their efforts in lithuania were temporarily halted by defeat at battle of saule in 1236 but armed christian orders continued to pose a threat country had also undergone incursions by mongol empire a treaty with galicia volhynia signed in 1219 is usually considered first conclusive evidence that baltic tribes in area were uniting in response to these threats treaty s signatories include twenty lithuanian dukes and one dowager duchess it specifies that five of these were elder and thus took precedence over remaining sixteen mindaugas despite his youth as well as his brother dausprungas are listed among elder dukes implying that they had inherited their titles livonian rhymed chronicle describes him as ruler of all lithuania in 1236 his path to this title is not clear ruthenian chronicles mention that he murdered or expelled several other dukes including his relatives historian s c rowell has described his rise to power as taking place through familiar processes of marriage murder and military conquest during 1230s and 1240s mindaugas strengthened and established his power in various baltic and slavic lands warfare in region intensified he battled german forces in kurland while mongols destroyed kiev in 1240 and entered poland in 1241 defeating two polish armies and burning krakow lithuanian victory in battle of saule temporarily stabilized northern front but christian orders continued to make gains along baltic coast founding city of klaipeda memel constrained in north and west mindaugas moved to east and southeast conquering navahrudak hrodna and principality of polotsk but there is no information about any battles for those cities in 1246 by chronic of he was baptized by orthodox church in navahrudak but later because of political situation he was re baptized by catholic church in about 1239 he appointed his son vaisvilkas to govern these areas then known as black ruthenia in 1248 he sent his nephews tautvilas and edivydas sons of his brother dausprungas along with vykintas duke of samogitia to conquer smolensk but they were unsuccessful his attempts to consolidate his rule in lithuania met with mixed success in 1249 an internal war erupted when he sought to seize his nephews and vykintas lands path to coronation thumb papal bull issued by pope innocent iv establishing lithuania s placement under jurisdiction of bishop of rome and discussing mindaugas s baptism and coronation tautvilas edivydas and vykintas formed a powerful coalition in opposition to mindaugas along with samogitians of western lithuania livonian order daniel of galicia tautvilas and edivydas brother in law and of volhynia princes of galicia and volhynia managed to gain control over black ruthenia disrupting vaisvilkas supremacy tautvilas strengthened his position by traveling to riga and accepting baptism by archbishop in 1250 order organized a major raid through lands of into domains of mindaugas in lithuania proper and a raid into those parts of samogitia that still supported him attacked from north and south and facing possibility of unrest elsewhere mindaugas was placed in an extremely difficult position but managed to use conflicts between livonian order and archbishop of riga to further his own interests he succeeded in bribing order master andreas von who was still angry at vykintas for defeat at battle of saule in 1236 by sending him many gifts thumb left mindaugas monument in vilnius in 1250 or 1251 mindaugas agreed to receive baptism and relinquish control over some lands in western lithuania in return for an acknowledgment by pope innocent iv as king pope welcomed a christian lithuania as a bulwark against mongol threats in turn mindaugas sought papal intervention in ongoing lithuanian conflicts with christian orders on 17 july 1251 pope signed two crucial papal bulls one ordered bishop of chelmno to crown mindaugas as king of lithuania appoint a bishop for lithuania and build a cathedral other bull specified that new bishop was to be directly subordinate to holy see rather than to archbishop of riga this autonomy was a welcome development precise date of mindaugas s baptism is not known his wife two sons and members of his court were baptized pope innocent wrote later that a multitude of mindaugas s subjects also received christianity process of coronation and establishment of christian institutions would take two years internal conflicts persisted during spring or summer of 1251 tautvilas and his remaining allies attacked mindaugas s warriors and livonian order s crossbow men in voruta castle attack failed and tautvilas forces retreated to defend themselves in castle presumed to be in samogitia vykintas died in 1251 or 1252 and tautvilas was forced to rejoin daniel of galicia kingdom of lithuania mindaugas s acts granting territories to livonian order date territory july 1253 portions of samogitia half of raseiniai and other half went to bishop christian in march 1254 half of dainava and nadruva october 1255 selonia 1257 nadruva portions of samogitia 7 august 1259 portions of dainava all of and samogitia june 1260 all of lithuania if mindaugas died without an heir 7 august 1261 all of selonia mindaugas and his wife morta were crowned during summer of 1253 bishop henry heidenreich of kulm presided over ecclesiastical ceremonies and andreas stirland conferred crown 6 july is now celebrated as statehood day lithuanian it is an official holiday in modern lithuania exact date of coronation is not known scholarship of historian edvardas gudavicius who promulgated this precise date is sometimes challenged location of coronation also remains unknown relative peace and stability prevailed for about eight years mindaugas used this opportunity to concentrate on expansion to east and to establish and organize state institutions he strengthened his influence in black ruthenia in polatsk a major center of commerce in daugava river basin and in he also negotiated a peace with galicia volhynia and married his daughter to svarn son of daniel of galicia who would later become grand duke of lithuania lithuanian relationships with western europe and holy see were reinforced in 1255 mindaugas received permission from pope alexander iv to crown his son as king of lithuania a noble court an administrative system and a diplomatic service were initiated silver long coins an index of statehood were issued he sponsored construction of a cathedral in vilnius possibly on site of today s vilnius cathedral thumb left seal of mindaugas attached to act of october 1255 could be a medieval forgery by teutonic knights immediately after his coronation mindaugas transferred some lands to livonian order portions of samogitia nadruva and dainava although his control over these western lands was tenuous there has been much discussion among historians as to whether in later years 1255 1261 mindaugas gave even more lands to order deeds might have been falsified by order case for this scenario is bolstered by fact that some of documents mention lands that were not actually under control of mindaugas and by various irregularities in treaty witnesses and seals mindaugas and his antagonist daniel reached a reconciliation in 1255 black ruthenian lands were transferred to roman daniel s son afterwards mindaugas s son vaisvilkas received baptism as a member of orthodox faith becoming a monk and later founding a convent and monastery tautvilas s antagonism was temporarily resolved when he recognized mindaugas s superiority and received polatsk as a fiefdom a direct confrontation with mongols occurred in 1258 or 1259 when berke khan sent his general to challenge lithuanian rule ordering daniel and other regional princes to participate novgorod chronicle describes following action as a defeat of lithuanians but it has also been seen as a net gain for mindaugas a single sentence in hypatian chronicle mentions mindaugas defending himself in voruta against his nephews and duke vykintas two other sources mention his castle location of voruta is not specified and this has led to considerable speculation along with archeological research concerning seat of his court at least fourteen different locations have been proposed including kernave and vilnius ongoing formal archeological digs at kernave began in 1979 after a portion of site named mindaugas throne hill fort collapsed town now hosts a major celebration on statehood day assassination and aftermath thumb 300px expansion of grand duchy of lithuania between 13th and 15th centuries livonian order used their alliance with mindaugas to gain control over samogitian lands in 1252 he approved order s construction of klaipeda castle their governance however was seen as oppressive local merchants could only conduct transactions via order approved intermediaries inheritance laws were changed and choices among marriage partners and residencies were restricted several pitched battles ensued in 1259 order lost battle of and in 1260 it lost battle of durbe first defeat encouraged a rebellion by and defeat at durbe spurred prussians into great prussian rebellion which lasted for 14 years encouraged by these developments and by his nephew treniota mindaugas broke peace with order gains he had expected from christianization had proven to be minor mindaugas may have reverted to paganism afterwards his motivation for conversion is often described by modern historians as merely strategic case for his apostasy rests largely on two near contemporary sources a 1324 assertion by pope john xxii that mindaugas had returned to error and galician volhynian chronicle chronicler writes that mindaugas continued to practice paganism making sacrifices to his gods burning corpses and conducting pagan rites in public historians have pointed to possibility of bias in this account since mindaugas had been at war with volhynia pope clement iv on other hand wrote in 1268 of mindaugas of happy memory clare memorie expressing regret at his murder in any event lithuanians were not prepared to accept christianity and mindaugas s baptism had little impact on further developments majority of population and nobility remained pagan his subjects were not required to convert cathedral he had built in vilnius was superseded by a pagan temple and all diplomatic achievements made after his coronation were lost although practice of christianity and intermarriage were well tolerated regional conflicts with order escalated alexander nevsky of novgorod tautvilas and tautvilas s son constantine agreed to form a coalition in opposition to mindaugas but their plans were unsuccessful treniota emerged as leader of samogitian resistance he led an army to now in latvia reaching estonian coast and battled masovia now in poland his goal was to encourage all conquered baltic tribes to rise up against christian orders and unite under lithuanian leadership his personal influence grew while mindaugas was concentrating on conquest of ruthenian lands dispatching a large army to bryansk treniota and mindaugas began to pursue different priorities rhymed chronicle mentions mindaugas s displeasure at fact that treniota did not create any alliances in latvia or estonia he may have come to prefer diplomacy in midst of these events mindaugas s wife morta died and he took her sister daumantas wife as his own in retaliation daumantas and treniota assassinated mindaugas and two of his sons in fall 1263 according to a late medieval tradition assassination took place in he was buried along with his horses in accordance with ancestral tradition after mindaugas s death lithuania lapsed into internal disorder three of his successors treniota his son in law svarn and his son vaisvilkas were assassinated during next seven years stability did not return until reign of traidenis designated grand duke c 1270 legacy thumb left litas commemorative coin dedicated to king mindaugas with inscription mindaugas king of lithuania mindaugas held a dubious position in lithuanian historiography until lithuanian national revival of 19th century while pagan sympathizers held him in disregard for betraying his religion christians saw his support as lukewarm he received only passing references from grand duke gediminas and was not mentioned at all by vytautas great his known family relations end with his children no historic records note any connections between his descendants and dynasty that ruled lithuania and poland until 1572 a 17th century rector of vilnius university held him responsible for troubles then being experienced by polish lithuanian commonwealth seed of internal discord among lithuanians had been sown a 20th century historian charged him with destruction of organization of lithuanian state first academic study of his life by a lithuanian scholar jonas die unter dem konig mindowe bis zum jahre 1263 was not published until 1905 in 1990s historian edvardas gudavicius published his findings
