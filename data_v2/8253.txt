something about marrying was written by co executive producer j stewart burns and directed by nancy kruse as part of sixteenth season of simpsons work on episode started in march 2004 after 2004 san francisco same sex weddings a period during february 2004 when city was issuing marriage licenses to same sex couples this served as simpsons staff s inspiration for there s something about marrying plot point where springfield tries to increase tourism by marketing towards lgbt community also had a basis in reality an example is fort lauderdale which became a popular tourist destination for gays and lesbians in mid 2000s executive producer al jean said they were interested in doing episode because they could explore various characters different positions on gay marriage while remaining neutral lisa thinks it s good for civil rights reverend of local protestant church is opposed to it other people think tourists will come to town mayor quimby wants money we don t take a position as much as explore everybody s positions he commented matt groening creator of simpsons stated that staff wanted to out patty as gay because portraying her as a love starved spinster seemed old on show there had previously been hints about patty s orientation for example in season thirteen episode jaws wired shut she is part of springfield gay pride parade s stayin in closet float though only her voice was heard and she was not seen themes and analysis episode s plotline revolves around homosexuality third time for simpsons first was season eight s homer s phobia and second was three gays of condo from season fourteen both of which won primetime emmy awards for outstanding animated program this time it centered on right for homosexuals to get married and coming out of a character in episode homer is shown as being tolerant with homosexuality whereas in homer s phobia he is portrayed as being strongly homophobic in that episode simpson family gets a new friend that homer dissociates himself from after finding out that he is gay he also fears that friend will have a negative influence on bart and decides to ensure bart s heterosexuality by taking him to do manly things such as hunting as james delingpole of daily telegraph writes it was first after homer s phobia that homer began to be portrayed as enlightened about homosexuality marge on other hand who had previously been portrayed as supportive of gay people on show is seen as disapproving of her sister s sexual orientation thumb upright coming out of ellen degeneres character in ellen led to appearance of more gay characters on television according to publications zeek a jewish journal of thought and culture and value war public opinion and politics of gay rights it was controversial lesbian outing of main character played by ellen degeneres in sitcom ellen in 1997 that paved way for patty s coming out in this episode as well as for many other gay characters on other television shows in his book queers in american popular culture jim elledge noted that unlike many episodes of simpsons that go through a situation and then everything returns to normal during ending this one does not he commented that staff of show could have made patty heterosexual again at end of episode and leave it how it was before by having her marry leslie instead they ended it in a way that could potentially be experienced as distasteful to heteronormative audience by having patty exclaim hell no i like girls to leslie s marriage proposal author also noted that it is possible simpsons staff chose patty to come out as gay instead of a male character because lesbians were traditionally considered more acceptable on television she did however not adhere to eroticized male lesbian fantasy or fit into loveable asexual guise of comedy lesbian that had previously been seen on shows such as ellen instead patty is rude crude and not ashamed of declaring her sexual preferences and this could make her unpalatable to some viewers according to elledge around episode s original broadcast in early 2005 same sex marriage question was one of hottest political issues in america it had been an especially hot topic during then recent presidential election in united states marty kaplan a professor at annenberg school for communication and radio host on air america radio commented that episode is telling those who demonize homosexuality or what these people call homosexual agenda anything from lighten up to get out of town this was not first time that an episode of show had brought up a current issue writing in an article about there s something about marrying for new york times sharon waxman said that as television s longest running situation comedy simpsons is no stranger to hot button social religious and political issues mocking wardrobe malfunctions hollywood liberals and born again christians among other targets speculation publicity and broadcast there s something about marrying was originally broadcast on february 20 2005 in united states it was reported a long time in advance of episode s airing that a major character would come out as gay during episode at comic con convention in july 2004 al jean revealed we have a show where to raise money springfield legalizes gay marriage homer becomes a minister by going on internet and filling out a form a long time character comes out of closet but i m not saying who this led to much media speculation and publicity in press for episode last such mystery simpsons storyline as bbc news called it occurred with alone again natura diddily episode in which it was announced prior to broadcast that a character would be killed in episode leading to weeks of speculation before revelation that it was maude flanders there was a widespread debate among fans of series as to who character coming out of closet would be also similar to how they years earlier debated who shot character mr burns matt groening joked at comic con convention that it s homer many fans correctly guessed that it would be one of homer s sisters in law either patty or selma while others believed it to be waylon smithers it had for a long time been hinted on show that smithers character was gay and in love with his boss mr burns however as baltimore sun writes it would have been unlikely for smithers to be outed character because it would not have been a surprise to fans and his love for his heterosexual boss would prevent him from marrying another person patty was suspected by fans and press because she had not often been seen dating men on show tabloid newspaper sun revealed already in september 2004 that character who would come out was patty though this was regarded as a rumor and jean would not confirm it bookmakers in united states and united kingdom took bets on which character would be uncovered as homosexual and if there would be a kiss featured in episode betus laid odds at four to five that it was patty while smithers had four to one odds and ned flanders fifteen to one odds a kiss was given odds of seven to five betus said gamblers made more than 900 bets on coming out on their website according to baltimore sun another betting site named com stopped taking wagers because so much money was being placed on patty jean told advocate that he thought it was an insane thing for someone to take bets on a result that can be determined by other people referring to simpsons staff and could be changed by them at last minute episode was heavily promoted and hyped with some sources calling it much anticipated and long awaited in addition to publicity about coming out of a character there s something about marrying was discussed a lot in media before its airing because of its gay marriage theme entertainment website movieweb predicted in october 2004 that episode would become controversial when it aired because of large children audience and also because it comes at a time when many states are seeking to ban same sex wedding ceremonies according to knight ridder some conservative groups growled in advance over episode but most pre broadcast publicity was directed at outing mark pinsky on other hand wrote in his book gospel according to simpsons that when announcement that an episode of show would focus on gay marriage was made it stoked a debate that few issues and few television shows could before its original airing pinsky was interviewed about episode on abc s world news tonight cnn bbc radio and more as author of a book on religion in simpsons fox network which airs simpsons chose to begin episode with a parental advisory warning stating that it contains discussions of same sex marriage and that parental discretion is advised this was a first for show which had not received parental advisories before even when dealing with themes such as drug use gambling addictions theft crime and violence a warning similar to one displayed at beginning of this episode was used in front of gay themed puppy episode of ellen series buzz there s something about marrying had received attracted a lot of viewers to its broadcast and therefore fox network chose to air it during ratings sweeps episode was watched by 10 5 million people in united states making it highest rated episode of sixteenth season of simpsons it was up by two million from season s average rating reception there s something about marrying featured first appearance of an animated same sex marriage on network television television columnist ray richmond wrote that episode was a cultural milestone for simpsons and that issue of gay marriage was mainstream to some degree but now that staff has deigned it worthy of show it is interwoven into popular culture simpsons bestowed upon something a pop culture status it never had before simply by being ripe for a joke john kenneth white author of book barack obama s america similarly called there s something about marrying a cultural barrier breaker thumb upright l brent bozell iii was critical of episode episode dealing with one of most divisive issues in american society according to new york times became a subject of controversy after its broadcast authors of marriage and family experience called it one of more controversial episodes of a frequently controversial cartoon several conservative groups and american christian conservatives thought it was promoting same sex marriage parents television council president l brent bozell iii criticized there s something about marrying for bringing up issue even though he had not seen episode himself he commented that at a time when public mood is overwhelmingly against gay marriage any show that promotes gay marriage is deliberately bucking public mood a researcher for american family association named ed vitagliano claimed presentation of same sex marriage in episode was very one sided he said that this episode proved hollywood s blatant pro homosexual bias because despite simpsons being generally kind of a wacky animated program it was not neutral on issue bozell also worried about influence episode would have on children despite parental discretion advisory at beginning commenting you ve got a show watched by millions of children do children need to have gay marriage thrust in their faces as an issue why can t we just entertain them similarly vitagliano said that many children watch simpsons and hollywood will pull out all stops to promote same sex marriage and children will be influenced by it mark washburn of knight ridder wrote that at time of episode s broadcast most americans were accustomed to seeing homosexual characters on television he said this is why patty s coming out did not become as controversial as episode s examination of same sex marriage issue which was more sensitive in country then controversy became so big that local news programs in certain cities aired segments about it in response to claims that this episode was supporting gay marriage al jean replied that we don t really take any positions for or against anything we just like to examine all sides of an issue and i think that anyone who would get their political wisdom from a cartoon might be sadly mistaken likewise mark pinsky writes in gospel according to simpsons that once episode ended it was hard to tell what stance on same sex marriage writers had and that both sides of controversy had their say voiced by various simpsons characters jean has also cited episode in defense to critics who say simpsons has lost its relevance and edginess in later years in his book simpsons an uncensored unauthorized history john ortved responded to this commenting that despite controversies episode was in fact a long winded and lame exploration of topic there s something about marrying was met with positive reception as well particularly from gay rights groups gay lesbian alliance against defamation glaad was welcoming of episode calling it a ray of light glaad executive director joan garry enjoyed seeing marge s transformation from having ambivalent feelings for her sister to then supporting her he commented that when marge learns that patty s about to marry someone who isn t really a lesbian she comes to realize that what her sister really deserves is to be in love with and married to a person who s right for her if millions of simpsons viewers came away from last night s episode with that little bit of moral truth it was time well spent afterellen com s david kennerley approved of willingness of a hit network tv show in prime time watched by children and adults to serve up such a politically charged issue rick garcia an activist of gay rights group equality illinois said to chicago tribune that episode would likely affect society in a positive way because of iconic status of show which shape s our attitudes unlike many of conservative groups kennerley noted that in show s tradition of equal opportunity lampooning message is not all pro gay irksome lesbian stereotypes abound and nelson bully suggests they legalize gay funerals and naturally reverend lovejoy shutters his church to same sex sinners according to simpsons writer mike reiss episode also had supporters among conservative groups he told encore magazine that gay people came out very much in favor of it and were happy with episode but arch conservatives and right wing christians loved episode too because they seemed to think we were making fun of gay people we really had it both ways kennerley further wrote that based on this episode simpsons is in top form it still reigns as funniest fastest paced half hour you ll see on television bill gibron of popmatters also thought episode was funny commenting that it explored often cited slippery slope of allowing matrimony to be defined outside parameters of a man and a woman with hilarious results in regards to revelation that patty was gay a v club wrote that it wasn t particularly earth shattering but that marge s initial reaction provided a good twist to episode j stewart burns received a writers guild of america award nomination in animation category for his work on there s
