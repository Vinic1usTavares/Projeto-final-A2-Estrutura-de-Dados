group 4 is a group of elements in periodic table it contains elements titanium ti zirconium zr hafnium hf and rutherfordium rf this group lies in d block of periodic table group itself has not acquired a trivial name it belongs to broader grouping of transition metals three group 4 elements that occur naturally are titanium zirconium and hafnium first three members of group share similar properties all three are hard refractory metals under standard conditions however fourth element rutherfordium rf has been synthesized in laboratory none of its isotopes have been found occurring in nature all isotopes of rutherfordium are radioactive so far no experiments in a supercollider have been conducted to synthesize next member of group either element 156 or upo element 158 and it is unlikely that they will be synthesized in near future characteristics chemistry like other groups members of this family show patterns in its electron configuration especially outermost shells resulting in trends in chemical behavior z element no of electrons shell 22 titanium 2 8 10 2 40 zirconium 2 8 18 10 2 72 hafnium 2 8 18 32 10 2 104 rutherfordium 2 8 18 32 32 10 2 most of chemistry has been observed only for first three members of group chemistry of rutherfordium is not very established and therefore rest of section deals only with titanium zirconium and hafnium all elements of group are reactive metals with a high melting point 1668 degc 1855 degc 2233 degc 2100 degc reactivity is not always obvious due to rapid formation of a stable oxide layer which prevents further reactions oxides tio2 zro2 and hfo2 are white solids with high melting points and unreactive against most acids as tetravalent transition metals all three elements form various inorganic compounds generally in oxidation state of 4 for first three metals it has been shown that they are resistant to concentrated alkalis but halogens react with them to form tetrahalides at higher temperatures all three metals react with oxygen nitrogen carbon boron sulfur and silicon because of lanthanide contraction of elements in fifth period zirconium and hafnium have nearly identical ionic radii ionic radius of is 79 picometers and that of is 78 pm this similarity results in nearly identical chemical behavior and in formation of similar chemical compounds chemistry of hafnium is so similar to that of zirconium that a separation on chemical reactions was not possible only physical properties of compounds differ melting points and boiling points of compounds and solubility in solvents are major differences in chemistry of these twin elements titanium is considerably different from other two owing to effects of lanthanide contraction physical table below is a summary of key physical

britain in year 1791 after analyzing sand he determined weakly magnetic sand to contain iron oxide and a metal oxide that he could not identify during that same year mineralogist franz joseph muller produced same metal oxide and could not identify it in 1795 chemist martin heinrich klaproth independently rediscovered metal oxide in rutile from hungarian village he identified oxide containing a new element and named it for titans of greek mythology zirconium martin heinrich klaproth discovered zirconium when analyzing zircon containing mineral in 1789 he deduced that mineral contained a new element and named it after already known zirconia however he failed to isolate newly discovered zirconium cornish chemist humphry davy also attempted to isolate this new element in 1808 through electrolysis but failed in 1824 swedish chemist jons jakob berzelius isolated an impure form of zirconium obtained by heating a mixture of potassium and potassium zirconium fluoride in an iron tube hafnium hafnium had been predicted by dmitri mendeleev in 1869 and henry moseley measured in 1914 effective nuclear charge by x ray spectroscopy to be 72 placing it between already known elements lutetium and tantalum dirk coster and georg von hevesy were first to search for new element in zirconium ores hafnium was discovered by two in 1923 in copenhagen denmark validating original 1869 prediction of mendeleev there has been some controversy surrounding discovery of hafnium and extent to which coster and hevesy were guided by bohr s prediction that hafnium would be a transition metal rather than a rare earth element while titanium and zirconium as relatively abundant elements were discovered in late 18th century it took until 1923 for hafnium to be identified this was only partly due to hafnium s relative scarcity chemical similarity between zirconium and hafnium made a separation difficult and without knowing what to look for hafnium was left undiscovered although all samples of zirconium and all of its compounds used by chemists for over two centuries contained significant amounts of hafnium rutherfordium rutherfordium was reportedly first detected in 1966 at joint institute of nuclear research at dubna then in soviet union researchers there bombarded 242pu with accelerated 22ne ions and separated reaction products by gradient after conversion to chlorides by interaction with production production of metals itself is difficult due to their reactivity formation of oxides nitrides and carbides must be avoided to yield workable metals this is normally achieved by kroll process oxides are reacted with coal and chlorine to form chlorides chlorides of metals are then reacted with magnesium yielding magnesium chloride and metals further purification is done by a chemical transport reaction developed by anton eduard van and jan hendrik de boer in a closed vessel metal reacts with iodine at temperatures above 500 degc forming metal iv iodide at a tungsten filament of nearly 2000 degc reverse reaction happens and iodine and metal are set free metal forms a solid coating on tungsten filament and iodine can react with additional metal resulting in a steady turnover m 2 i2 low temp mi4 mi4 high temp m 2 i2 occurrence right thumb heavy minerals dark in a quartz beach sand chennai india if abundance of elements in earth s crust is compared for titanium zirconium and hafnium abundance decreases with increase of atomic mass titanium is seventh most abundant metal in earth s crust and has an abundance of ppm while zirconium has an abundance of 162 ppm and hafnium has only an abundance of 3 ppm all three stable elements occur in heavy mineral sands ore deposits which are placer deposits formed most usually in beach environments by concentration due to specific gravity of mineral grains of erosion material from mafic and ultramafic rock titanium minerals are mostly and rutile and zirconium occurs in mineral zircon because of chemical similarity up to 5 of zirconium in zircon is replaced by hafnium largest producers of group 4 elements are australia south africa and canada applications titanium metal and its alloys have a wide range of applications where corrosion resistance heat stability and low density light weight are of benefit foremost use of corrosion resistant hafnium and zirconium has been in nuclear reactors zirconium has a very low and hafnium has a high thermal neutron capture cross section therefore zirconium mostly as is used as cladding of fuel rods in nuclear reactors while hafnium is used in control rods for nuclear reactors because each hafnium atom can absorb multiple neutrons smaller amounts of hafnium and zirconium are used in super alloys to improve properties of those alloys biological occurrences group 4 elements are not known to be involved in biological chemistry of any living systems they are hard refractory metals with low aqueous solubility and low availability to biosphere titanium is one of few first row d block transition metals with no known biological role rutherfordium s radioactivity would make it toxic to living cells precautions titanium is non toxic even in large doses and does not play any natural role inside human body zirconium powder can cause irritation but only contact with eyes requires medical attention osha recommendations for zirconium are 5 mg m3 time weighted average limit and a 10 mg m3 short term exposure limit only limited data exists on toxicology of hafnium references category groups periodic table
