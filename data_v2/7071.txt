thumb a white precipitate of copper i chloride suspended in a solution of ascorbic acid in a 2 dram vial thumb ir absorption spectrum of copper i chloride copper i chloride commonly called cuprous chloride is lower chloride of copper with formula cucl substance is a white solid sparingly soluble in water but very soluble in concentrated hydrochloric acid impure samples appear green due to presence of copper ii chloride cucl2 pastor antonio c 1986 method of preparing cupric ion free cuprous chloride section 2 lines 4 41 history copper i chloride was first prepared by robert boyle in mid seventeenth century from mercury ii chloride venetian and copper metal 2 cu 2 cucl hg in 1799 j l proust characterized two different chlorides of copper he prepared cucl by heating cucl2 at red heat in absence of air causing it to lose half of its combined chlorine followed by removing residual cucl2 by washing with water an acidic solution of cucl was formerly used for analysis of carbon monoxide content in gases for example in hempel s gas apparatus this application was significant during nineteenth and early twentieth centuries when coal gas was widely used for heating and lighting synthesis copper i chloride is produced industrially by direct combination of copper metal and chlorine at 450 900 degc 2 cu cl2 2 cucl copper i chloride can also be prepared by reducing copper ii chloride with sulfur dioxide or with ascorbic acid vitamin c that acts as a reducing sugar 2 cucl2 so2 2 h2o 2 cucl h2so4 2 hcl 2 cucl2 2hcl many other reducing agents can be used properties copper i chloride has cubic zincblende crystal structure at ambient conditions upon heating to 408 degc structure changes to hexagonal several other crystalline forms of cucl appear at high pressures several gpa copper i chloride is a lewis acid which is classified as soft according to hard soft acid base concept thus it tends to form stable complexes with soft lewis bases such as triphenylphosphine cucl p c6h5 3 cucl p c6h5 3 4 although cucl is insoluble in water it dissolves in aqueous solutions containing suitable donor molecules it forms complexes with halide ions for example forming h3o cucl2 with concentrated hydrochloric acid it is attacked by cn and nh3 to give corresponding complexes solutions of cucl in hcl or nh3 absorb carbon monoxide to form colourless complexes such as chloride bridged dimer cucl co 2 same hydrochloric acid solutions also react with acetylene gas to form cucl solutions of cucl react with to form explosive copper i acetylide complexes of cucl with alkenes can be prepared by reduction of cucl2 by sulfur dioxide in presence of alkene in alcohol solution complexes with such as 1 5 are particularly stable nicholls d 1973 complexes and first row transition elements macmillan press london 400px structure of cod complex of cucl in absence of other ligands its aqueous solutions are unstable with respect to disproportionation into cu and cucl2 in part for this reason samples in air assume a green coloration see photograph in upper right uses main use of copper i chloride is as a precursor to fungicide copper oxychloride for this purpose aqueous copper i chloride is generated by comproportionation and then air oxidized cu cucl2 2 cucl 4 cucl o2 2 h2o oh 4 cucl2 copper i chloride catalyzes a variety of organic reactions as discussed above its affinity for carbon monoxide in presence of aluminium chloride is exploited in copuresm process in organic synthesis cucl is used with carbon monoxide aluminium chloride and hydrogen chloride in koch

treatment of an salt with cucl leads to an aryl chloride for example 400px example sandmeyer reaction using cucl reaction has wide scope and usually gives good yields early investigators observed that

with to form gilman reagents such as ch3 which find extensive use in organic synthesis grignard reagents form similar organocopper compounds although other copper i compounds such as copper i iodide are now more often used for these types of reactions copper i chloride is still recommended in some cases bertz s h fairchild e h 1999 handbook of reagents for organic synthesis volume 1 reagents
