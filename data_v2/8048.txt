graphical effects and genesis quality audio though ign felt some elements such as several musical tracks were highlights in 2008 gamesradar wrote that knuckles chaotix was best game for 32x and was underrated though it still considered game a wasted opportunity rubber band multiplayer system was largely panned despite being acknowledged as an effort to innovate though ign admired attempt to breathe life into a series that was running out of steam and fix lopsided multiplayer of sonic 2 and sonic 3 1994 whereby tails would get lost off screen they felt physics were clunky and unorthodox

marvelous fully 3d special stages were best of sonic series overall ign described knuckles chaotix as a bad game with a good foundation and in another article concluded that game was interesting if
