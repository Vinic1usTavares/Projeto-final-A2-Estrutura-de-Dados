brill tramway also known as quainton tramway wotton tramway oxford aylesbury tramroad and metropolitan railway brill branch was a six mile 10 km rail line in aylesbury vale buckinghamshire england it was privately built in 1871 by 3rd duke of buckingham as a horse tram line to help transport goods between his lands around wotton house and national rail network lobbying from nearby village of brill led to its extension to brill and conversion to passenger use in early 1872 two locomotives were bought but line had been built for horses and thus trains travelled at an average speed of in 1883 duke of buckingham planned to upgrade route to main line standards and extend line to oxford creating shortest route between aylesbury and oxford despite backing of wealthy ferdinand de rothschild investors were deterred by costly tunnelling in 1888 a cheaper scheme was proposed in which line would be built to a lower standard and avoid tunnelling in anticipation line was named oxford aylesbury tramroad although existing line had been upgraded in 1894 extension to oxford was never built instead operation of brill tramway was taken over by london s metropolitan railway and brill became one of its two north western termini line was rebuilt in 1910 and more advanced locomotives were introduced allowing trains to run faster population of area remained low and primary income source remained carriage of goods to and from farms between 1899 and 1910 other lines were built in area providing more direct services to london and north of england brill tramway went into financial decline in 1933 metropolitan railway became metropolitan line of london transport brill tramway became part of london underground despite quainton road being from london and not underground london transport aimed to concentrate on electrification and improvement of passenger services in london and saw little possibility that routes in buckinghamshire could become viable passenger routes in 1935 brill tramway

aylesbury as terminus of two small and unconnected branch lines meanwhile north of aylesbury buckinghamshire railway was being built by sir harry verney scheme consisted of a line running southwest to northeast from oxford to bletchley and a second southeast from brackley via buckingham to join oxford bletchley line halfway along its length first section opened on 1 may 1850 and whole on 20 may 1851 buckinghamshire railway intended to extend line south to station at aylesbury but extension was not built on 6 august 1860 aylesbury and buckingham railway with 3rd duke then still marquess of chandos as chairman and sir harry verney as deputy chairman was incorporated by act of parliament to connect buckinghamshire railway now operated by lnwr to aylesbury 2nd duke ensured new route ran via quainton near his estates around wotton instead of a more direct route via pitchcott beset by financial difficulties line took over eight years to build eventually opening on 23 september 1868 new line was connected to wycombe railway s aylesbury station and joined buckinghamshire railway where oxford bletchley line and line to buckingham met a junction station was built with no nearby town

west of aylesbury and buckingham line this land was owned by winwood charity trust an operator of almshouses in quainton of which duke was a trustee duke agreed to pay an annual rent of ps12 about ps in in return for permission to run trains with consent of winwood charity route did not require parliamentary approval and construction could begin immediately duke envisaged a tramway west from quainton road railway station across his wotton estate line was intended for transport of construction materials and agricultural produce and not for passengers it would not have a junction with aylesbury and buckingham railway but would have its own station at quainton road at a right angle to a b s line a turntable at end of tramway would link to a spur from a b s line line was to run roughly southwest from quainton road to wotton near wotton underwood just west of station at wotton line split one section would run west to wood siding near brill a short stub called church siding would run northwest into wotton underwood itself terminating near parish church and a siding would run north to a coal siding near kingswood branch to kingswood was routed to pass a pond to allow horses working line to drink ralph augustus jones was appointed manager of project and construction began on 8 september 1870 twenty labourers from wotton estate who would otherwise have been unemployed following harvest were employed six days a week to build line each paid 11 s per week they carried out all construction except laying track which was by specialists lawford houghton line was built using cheapest materials and winding around hills to avoid expensive earthworks ballast was a mix of burnt clay and ash stations were crude earth banks high held in place by wooden planks as duke intended that line be worked only by horse drawn carriages line was built with longitudinal sleepers to reduce risk of horses tripping a diameter turntable was installed at quainton road to link

was distributed to poor at its opening line was unnamed although it was referred to as quainton tramway in internal correspondence extension from wotton to wood siding was complete by 17 june 1871 opening date of northern branch to kingswood is not recorded but it was not fully open in february 1873 london and north western railway began a dedicated service from quainton road with three vans a week of milk collected from wotton estate shipped to london terminus at broad street only passengers were estate employees and people accompanying livestock duke and jones intended to run no more than one train on each section of line so line was not built with passing loops or signalling when more than one horse drawn train or locomotive was in operation tramway operated a token system using colour coded staffs to ensure only one train could be on a section drivers between quainton road and wotton carried a blue staff those on west of wotton and kingswood siding a red staff on 26 august 1871 an excursion ran from wood siding to london hauled by great western railway gwr it carried around 150 people for a total of 105 passenger fares with each child counted as half an adult and was drawn by horses between wood siding and quainton road and by locomotive from quainton road to aylesbury where carriages were attached to 7 30 am gwr service via princes risborough to london arriving at 10 00 am experiment was not a success sharp overhanging branches posed a danger to passengers and had to be cut back in week before excursion day was wet and ticket sales were lower than expected return from london to quainton road was delayed in slough and excursion arrived back at wood siding at 2 00 am surveyors designing line had worked on assumption that wagons would have a load on each wheel of and had designed line accordingly as it turned out four wheeled wagons used had an average weight of and each carried of goods meaning this limit was regularly exceeded coal wagons used on line weighed each and carried of coal meaning a load on each wheel of as well as damaging track loads strained horses and soon line began to suffer with derailments particularly in wet weather on 20 october 1871 jones wrote to duke that traffic is now becoming so heavy that i would most respectfully venture to ask your grace to consider subject as to whether an engine would not be least expensive and most efficient power to work it extension to brill and conversion to steam in late 1871 residents of brill petitioned duke to extend route to brill and open a passenger service duke agreed it is likely he had already planned passenger services to brill as correspondence from early 1871 mentions passenger facilities at brill terminus in january 1872 a scheduled passenger timetable was published and line was named wotton tramway although officially named wotton tramway it was commonly known as brill tramway from time of its conversion to passenger use new terminus of brill railway station at foot of brill hill approximately north of town opened in march 1872 although it was now a passenger railway goods traffic continued to be primary purpose of line line was heavily used to ship bricks from brickworks around brill and cattle and milk from farms on wotton estate by 1875 line was carrying around of milk each year inbound delivery of linseed cake to dairy farms and of coal to area s buildings were also important line began to carry manure from london to area s farms carrying in 1872 tramway also opened a cartage business to handle onward shipment of goods and parcels unloaded at brill and wotton stations thumb right aveling and porter number 807 wotton tramway no 1 nicknamed old chainey first locomotive used on wotton tramway alt small green steam locomotive with horses unable to cope jones and duke decided to convert at least part of railway for locomotives lightly laid track with longitudinal sleepers limited them to and it was thus necessary to use lightest locomotives possible two traction engines converted for railway use were bought from aveling and porter for ps398 about ps in each they were chosen for weight and reliability and had a top speed on level of they took 95 98 minutes between brill and quainton road an average of with an unusual configuration in which a flywheel drove chains which in turn drove wheels locomotives were noisy and were nicknamed old chainey by locals first of new locomotives given serial number 807 by aveling and porter and numbered 1 by tramway was delivered to wotton station on 27 january 1872 on day of its delivery now redundant horses had been sent away nobody at wotton could operate locomotive so a horse had to be hired from aylesbury until driver arrived after delivery of second locomotive on 7 september 1872 all passenger services were drawn by locomotive except on thursdays when locomotives were replaced by horses to allow for maintenance line carried 104 passengers in january 1872 rising to 224 in april and 456 in august 1872 with steam came need for water plans to dig a well near wotton came to nothing and duke s expedient of drawing water from a pond near quainton road did not impress pond s owner by march 1872 jones recorded that party to whom pond near quainton station belongs is making complaints about our having water and i expect he will be using force to prevent our getting any a wooden water tower was built at brill station and a large water tower known as black tank was built in fork of main line and church siding while engines proved adequate they were slow on 6 february 1872 jones timed one as taking 41 minutes to travel roughly from quainton road to wotton hauling 42 tons 43 t they were also low powered and when pulling a heavy load their front wheels would lift off track duke s cost cutting led to poor maintenance of track and equipment and service was often interrupted by derailments and accidents in 1876 aylesbury and buckingham railway raised its prices for coal haulage all coal hauled on tramway needed to pass along a br from verney junction or aylesbury and jones had to raise prices to cover surcharge or keep prices stable despite loss of profits road hauled coal from bicester was already undercutting tramway and unreliable engines had given tramway a poor reputation jones kept prices fixed and absorb increased costs wrecking tramway s already declining business in 1873 3rd duke attempted to have wotton tramway recognised as a railway and william yolland inspected line in april 1873 railway regulation act 1844 defined minimum standards of travel one of which was that trains travel at an average of which aveling and porter locomotives could not manage none of stopping places had adequate station buildings and line had no signals yolland permitted line to continue as a tramway but refused to recognise it as a railway improvement and diversification right thumb an aveling and porter locomotive in operation on wotton tramway alt small locomotive hauls four coaches of various designs by mid 1870s slow locomotives and their unreliability and inability to handle heavy loads were major problems in 1874 ferdinand de rothschild bought a site near waddesdon station from john spencer churchill 7th duke of marlborough for his planned waddesdon manor jones and duke recognised that construction would increase haulage of heavy goods and that engines would not cope engineer william gordon bagnall had established locomotive firm of w g bagnall in 1875 bagnall wrote to duke offering to hire his first locomotive for trials on 18 december 1876 locomotive buckingham was delivered it entered service on 1 january 1877 mainly on steep section of line between wotton and brill although jones was unhappy with some aspects of buckingham he recognised improvement and ordered a locomotive from bagnall for ps640 about ps in wotton was delivered on 28 december 1877 and buckingham was returned to bagnall in february 1878 buckingham and wotton were more reliable than aveling and porter engines with modern locomotives on brill quainton road route kingswood branch generally remained worked by horses and occasionally by aveling and porter engines traffic rose figure for milk traffic rose from 40 000 gallons carried in 1875 to 58 000 gallons 260 000 l 70 000 us gal in 1879 and in 1877 tramway carried 20 994 tons 21 331 t of goods in early 1877 it appeared on bradshaw maps and from may 1882 bradshaw listed timetable despite frequent derailments low speed meant wotton tramway had a good safety record locomotives occasionally ran over stray sheep and on 12 september 1888 sparks from one of aveling and porter engines blew back into one of train s cattle trucks igniting straw bedding and badly burning two cows line had one serious accident in which ellen maria nickalls a servant at wotton house was struck by a locomotive near church siding and killed quoted coroner returned a verdict of accidental death absolving driver james challis passenger services jones increased scheduled passenger journeys from two to three each day in each direction with locomotives generally occupied with goods many passenger services were drawn by horse while increased passenger journeys boosted revenues tramway no longer owned enough horses and had to hire them by 1881 passenger service was losing ps11 about ps in a month although reduced use of locomotives lowered maintenance costs although reliability had improved services were still slow horse drawn passenger services took 60 70 minutes to travel between quainton road and brill locomotive hauled mixed trains with frequent stops to load and unload were timetabled at 1 to 2 hours to make same journey slower than walking jones hoped to increase passenger revenue by promoting brill as a spa chalybeate springs of dorton spa outside brill were known for supposed healing powers and a resort had been built around spa in 1830s featuring a modern pump house and eight baths set in of parkland despite redevelopment and building of modern hotels in brill dorton spa was unfashionable and by late 19th century was little used jones and spa s owners hoped queen victoria would visit during her 1890 stay at waddesdon manor and thus boost brill as a spa town although such a visit was arranged victoria changed her mind and visited spa at cheltenham instead spa traffic never materialised waddesdon manor right thumb tramway was heavily used during construction of waddesdon manor alt large two storey brick building with a number of large pointed turrets on roof in 1876 ferdinand de rothschild began work on waddesdon manor a short distance south of tramway s station at waddesdon later renamed waddesdon road top of lodge hill a landmark was levelled to provide a site and sloping drives were cut into hill to provide access to construction site transport of materials was by horse but contractors had to get enormous stone blocks up hill rothschild s contractors built a line known as winchendon branch which turned off tramway between waddesdon and westcott stations and ran south to foot of lodge hill from there a cable tram ran on narrow gauge rails up hill to a gully close to building site materials were hauled along cable tramway in tubs by a steam powered winch winchendon branch was hastily and cheaply built after one of tramway s locomotives derailed there on 5 july 1876 jones refused to allow his engines on it and from then on materials were hauled along branch by horses building of waddesdon manor generated huge business for tramway large numbers of bricks from poore s brickworks at brill were shipped by july 1877 entire output of brickworks was going to supply waddesdon manor works with 25 000 bricks a week being used additional bricks were also shipped via quainton road along with 7 000 tons 7 100 t of bath stone from corsham manor also required power and in 1883 a gasworks was built to west a siding from westcott station ran south to gasworks to carry coal waddesdon manor chose not to use tramway for supplying coal to gasworks and siding was abandoned in 1886 waddesdon manor was complete in 1889 13 years after construction began winchendon branch closed and track was removed gasworks remained operational although supplied by road until its closure during coal shortage of 1916 it was demolished shortly afterwards track of disused siding remained until at least 1916 brill brick and tile works although poore s brickworks was well established jones believed there was potential profit in duke of buckingham s capitalising on his access to a railway line by becoming directly involved in trials with brill clay in 1883 proved positive and in april 1885 jones sought estimates for machinery and labour necessary to produce 10 million bricks a year it was decided that 5 million bricks per year was a realistic figure with bricks to be manufactured in kilns between brill and wood siding stations and shipped down tramway to national network progress was slow and obstructed by local authority few records survive of brill brick and tile works as it came to be called but it was operational by 1895 jones 1974 says siding to brickworks opened with extension to brill implying that brill brick and tile works existed in early 1872 this is almost certainly incorrect no mention of sidings is made in duke of buckingham s correspondence before 1887 and no reference to brill brick and tile works exists in any source earlier than 1895 bricks used to build waddesdon manor had to be shipped by road from poore s to brill or along aylesbury and buckingham railway from further afield before being sent down tramway to site implying there was no works capable of making high numbers of bricks along tramway brill brick and tile works could not compete with larger and better connected brickworks at calvert and declined brickworks finally closed in early 20th century building was taken over by w e fenemore workshop making hay loaders before being converted into a timber yard in 1920s relations with aylesbury and buckingham railway although introduction of bagnall locomotives and traffic generated by works at waddesdon manor had boosted route s fortunes it remained in serious financial difficulty only connection with national railway network was by way of turntable at quainton road 3rd duke of buckingham chaired aylesbury and buckingham railway but its management regarded tramway as a nuisance in 1870s it charged disproportionately high fees for through traffic between tramway and main line with intention of forcing tramway out of business relations deteriorated between jones and j g rowe secretary and traffic manager of a b a b s trains at quainton road would miss connections with tramway causing milk shipped to quainton to become unsellable to extent that jones began unloading milk at waddesdon and shipping it to aylesbury by road although jones asked duke to intervene relations remained poor in 1888 rowe blocked telegraph along tramway and in one meeting jones and rowe threatened violence jones sought legal advice and was told that duke would probably win a legal action against a br a br was in such a precarious financial position that any successful legal action against them would likely have forced line through quainton road to close severing tramway s connection with national network altogether meanwhile local dairy farmers began to switch to beef and butter causing a drop in milk transport from its peak of 20 994 tons carried in 1877 goods traffic fell in each of next four years dropping to 9 139 tons 9 286 t in 1881 many of passengers using tramway continued their journey by way of a br line in 1885 5 192 passengers changed trains between a br and tramway at quainton road jones suggested that a br subsidise tramway s service to sum of ps25 about ps in per month to allow passenger services to continue but a br agreed to pay only ps5 about ps in per month by mid 1880s tramway was finding it difficult to cover operating expenses of either goods or passenger operations oxford extension schemes oxford aylesbury and metropolitan junction railway company euston railway station opened in 1837 first railway station connecting london with industrial heartlands of west midlands and lancashire railways were banned by a parliamentary commission from operating in london itself and station was built on northern boundary other termini north of london followed at paddington 1838 bishopsgate 1840 fenchurch street 1841 king s cross 1852 and st pancras 1868 all were outside built up area making them inconvenient charles pearson 1793 1862 had proposed an underground railway connecting city of london with main line rail termini in around 1840 in 1854 he commissioned first traffic survey determining that each day 200 000 walked into city 44 000 travelled by omnibus and 26 000 in private carriages a parliamentary commission backed pearson s proposal over other schemes despite concerns about vibration causing subsidence of buildings problems of compensating many thousands whose homes were destroyed during digging of tunnel and fears that tunnelling might break into hell construction began in 1860 on 9 january 1863 line opened as metropolitan railway mr world s first underground passenger railway mr grew steadily extending its own services and acquiring other local railways north and west of london in 1872 edward watkin 1819 1901 was appointed chairman a director of many railway companies he wanted to unify a string of companies to create a single line from manchester via london to an intended channel tunnel and on to france in 1873 watkin negotiated to take control of aylesbury and buckingham railway and section of former buckinghamshire railway north from verney junction to buckingham he planned to extend mr north from london to aylesbury and extend tramway southwest to oxford creating a route from london to oxford rail services between oxford and london were poor and although still roundabout scheme would have formed shortest route from london to oxford aylesbury buckingham and stratford upon avon duke of buckingham was enthusiastic and authorisation was sought from parliament parliament did not share enthusiasm and in 1875 buckinghamshire and northamptonshire union railway bill was rejected watkin did receive consent in 1881 to extend mr to aylesbury with extension to aylesbury approved duke of buckingham in march 1883 announced his own scheme to extend brill tramway to oxford turntable at quainton road would be replaced with a junction to south of existing turntable to allow through running of trains stretch from quainton road to brill would be straightened and improved to main line standards and waddesdon road and wood siding stations would close from brill line would pass in a tunnel through muswell hill to south of brill and on via boarstall before crossing from buckinghamshire into oxfordshire at stanton st john from stanton st john line would stop on outskirts of oxford at headington terminating at a station to be built in back garden of 12 high street st clement s near magdalen bridge proposal included a separate set of rails to be provided where old and new routes ran together to allow existing wotton tramway to continue to operate independently if it saw fit but given duke s involvement in new scheme it is unlikely he intended to use this option at line would have been by far shortest route between oxford and aylesbury compared with via gwr which had absorbed wycombe railway and via aylesbury and buckingham railway and lnwr act authorising scheme received royal assent on 20 august 1883 and new oxford aylesbury and metropolitan junction railway company was created including duke of buckingham ferdinand de rothschild and harry verney among its directors scheme caught attention of expansionist metropolitan railway who paid for survey despite powerful backers expensive muswell hill tunnel deterred investors ferdinand de rothschild promised to lend money in return for guarantees that rebuilt line would include a passenger station at westcott and that duke would press aylesbury and buckingham railway to open a station at nearest point to waddesdon manor waddesdon manor railway station opened on 1 january 1897 oxford aylesbury tramroad right 300px thumb railways in and around aylesbury vale 1894 proposed new route from aylesbury to oxford via brill was significantly shorter than existing route via verney junction alt despite cash from rothschild company could not raise sufficient investment to begin construction of oxford extension and had only been given a five year window by parliament in which to build it on 7 august 1888 less than two weeks before authorisation was to expire directors of oxford aylesbury and metropolitan junction railway company received royal assent for a revised and cheaper version to be called oxford aylesbury tramroad o at new scheme envisaged extension s being built to same light specifications as existing tramway to avoid expensive earthworks and tunnelling line would parallel a road out of brill despite considerable gradients involved entire route would be single track other than passing places and oxford terminus was to be in george street nearer edge of city jones was sceptical and felt that it unlikely to recoup its construction costs on 26 march 1889 3rd duke of buckingham and chandos died aged 65 a special train brought his body from london to quainton road and from quainton he was taken to stowe for service and on to family vault at wotton five carriages provided by london and north western railway carried mourners to church siding near wotton underwood s church another carried a company of royal buckinghamshire yeomanry associated with grenville family and upkeep of which had helped bankrupt second duke this second train was delayed on aylesbury and buckingham railway arriving late to burial dukedom was inherited only in male line as 3rd duke had three daughters but no son title became extinct 1st duke was also earl temple of stowe a title which descended through heirs of his relatives should male line become extinct consequently on 3rd duke s death this title with most of wotton estate passed to his nephew william temple gore langton who became 4th earl temple by this time construction of mr extension from london to aylesbury was underway and on 1 july 1891 mr absorbed aylesbury and buckingham railway sir harry verney died on 12 february 1894 and on 31 march 1894 mr took over services on a br from gwr on 1 july 1894 mr extension to aylesbury was completed giving mr a unified route from london to verney junction mr embarked on upgrading and rebuilding stations along line construction of route from brill to oxford had not begun further acts of parliament were granted in 1892 and 1894 varying route slightly and allowing electrification but no building was carried out other than surveying on 1 april 1894 proposed extension to oxford still intended o at exercised a clause of 1888 act and took over wotton tramway jones was retained as general manager and work began on upgrading line for extension rebuilding and re equipping by o at track from quainton road to

and earl temple came into use on line at around this time huddersfield had been built in 1876 and originally named prestwich earl temple was identical to huddersfield other than having a covered cab oxford aylesbury tramroad could not afford price when earl temple was delivered and earl bought it with his own money and rented it to o at in 1895 two new passenger carriages each accommodating 40 passengers were bought from bristol wagon and carriage company in 1896 huddersfield was withdrawn and in 1899 replaced with a new manning wardle locomotive named wotton no 2 at which time earl temple

opened on 1 january 1897 allowing through running between two lines with through running between lines in place in june 1899 mr inspected o at s carriages and locomotives and had serious concerns original passenger carriage began as a horse tram and was shabby internally and unsafe as part of a longer train passenger carriage from 1870s was in a poor condition 1895 bristol passenger carriages were unfit owing to their light construction eight of o at s nine goods wagons did not comply with railway clearing house standards and could not be used on other lines on 4 october 1899 mr loaned o

mynydd mawr railway replacing them with five eight wheeled carriages built in 1865 66 mr considered manning wardle locomotives unreliable and from early 1903 they were replaced by a pair of metropolitan railway d class engines although they were not sold until 1911 heavy d class locomotives damaged track and in 1910 track between quainton road and brill was relaid to mr standards using track removed from inner london mr route but considered adequate for a rural branch line following this upgrading speed limit was increased to kingswood branch was again not upgraded and still retained its 1871 track it was abandoned at end of 1915 and track removed in 1920 in 1911 brill brick and tile works closed and siding to brickworks was removed with exception of rails on level

of d class locomotives and sold them between 1916 and 1922 with much of their route close to london now electrified mr had surplus steam locomotives and two metropolitan railway a class locomotives numbers 23 built 1866 and 41 built 1869 were transferred to route built by beyer peacock and company from 1864 a class had been first locomotives owned by metropolitan in 1863 first year of operation mr had used engines loaned from gwr although most advanced locomotives regularly to work route a class predated all other rolling stock on tramway two locomotives operated for a week at a time occasionally mr substituted other similar locomotives four services per day operated taking around 40 minutes from one end to other in 1900 falling to 32 minutes by 1931 after upgrading of route and introduction of a class locomotives on 1 february 1903 jones retired and control was taken over directly by metropolitan railway jones died on 14 april 1909 surviving to see railway network in

connected to it tramway s only significant passenger markets at brill and wotton were both served by stations on new lines alt great central railway in 1893 another of edward watkin s railways manchester sheffield and lincolnshire railway had been authorised to build a new line from its existing station at annesley in nottinghamshire south to quainton road watkin had intended to run services from manchester and sheffield via quainton road and along metropolitan railway to mr s station at baker street following watkin s retirement in 1894 manchester sheffield and lincolnshire railway obtained permission for a separate station near baker street at marylebone and line was renamed great central railway gcr new line joined existing mr just north of quainton road on verney junction branch and opened to passengers on 15 march 1899 many of bricks used in building of great central railway were supplied by brill brick and tile works and shipped along tramway providing a significant revenue boost to o at great western and great central joint railway following watkin s retirement relations between great central railway and metropolitan railway deteriorated badly gcr route to london ran over mr lines from quainton road to london and to reduce reliance on shaky goodwill of mr gcr general manager william pollitt decided to create a link with great western railway to create a second route into london in 1899 great western and great central joint railway began construction of a new line commonly known as alternative route to link gwr s existing station at princes risborough to new great central line line ran from princes risborough north to meet great central at grendon underwood about north of quainton road new line was to cross tramway on a bridge immediately east of wotton station although no intersection was built between lines although lines did not connect a temporary siding was built from tramway onto embankment of new line and used for transport of construction materials and removal of spoil from works during building of new line although formally an independent company in practice line was operated as a part of great central railway new line was planned as a through route and was not intended to have any stations of its own but in 1904 it was decided to build two stations on it a new station also named wotton was built immediately to south of existing wotton station on 2 april 1906 new route opened to passengers two wotton stations were very close together and same stationmaster was responsible for both chiltern main line bicester cut off in 1910 new bicester cut off line of gwr chiltern main line opened allowing trains from london to birmingham to bypass a long curve through oxford new line was routed directly through wood siding although no interchange station was built gwr ran in a cutting beneath existing station wood siding station and its siding were rebuilt at gwr s expense between 1908 1910 to stand on a wide bridge above gwr s line new line included station named brill and ludgershall which in reality was considerably further from brill than existing brill station with opening of new routes tramway for first time suffered serious competition although further from brill than tramway s station gwr s station provided a fast and direct route to gwr s london terminus at paddington great central railway s station at wotton and other great western and great central joint railway station at akeman street provided fast and direct routes to both paddington and to great central s new london terminus at marylebone without need to change trains at quainton road in addition following end of first world war motorised road transport grew rapidly drawing passenger and goods traffic away from railways oxford aylesbury tramroad company repeatedly tried to persuade metropolitan railway to buy line outright but mr declined in july 1923 o at tried to sell line to gwr and to electric and railway finance corporation but was rebuffed by both london transport on 1 july 1933 metropolitan railway along with london s other underground railways aside from short waterloo city railway was taken into public ownership as part of newly formed london passenger transport board lptb thus despite brill and verney junction being and over two hours travel from city of london oxford aylesbury tramroad and former aylesbury and buckingham railway became parts of london underground network locomotives and carriages were repainted with london transport s johnston sans emblem by this time route from quainton road to brill was in severe decline competition from newer lines and from improving road haulage had drawn away much of tramway s custom and trains would often run without a single passenger a class locomotives were now 70 years old and track itself was poorly maintained trains once again were regularly derailing on line frank pick managing director of underground group from 1928 and chief executive of lptb aimed to move network away from freight services and to concentrate on electrification and improvement of core routes in london he saw lines beyond aylesbury via quainton road to brill and verney junction as having little future as financially viable passenger routes concluding that at least ps2 000 about ps in per year would be saved by closing brill branch on 1 june 1935 london passenger transport board gave required six months notice to oxford aylesbury tramroad company that it intended to terminate operations on tramway closure to fulfil their obligations london transport formally inspected line on 23 july 1935 inspection was carried out with great speed special train taking just 15 minutes to travel length of line from brill to quainton road inspection confirmed that closure process was to proceed last scheduled passenger service left quainton road in afternoon of 30 november 1935 hundreds of people gathered and a number of members of oxford university railway society travelled from oxford in an effort to buy last ticket accompanied by firecrackers and fog signals train ran length of line to brill where passengers posed for a photograph late that evening a two coach staff train pulled out of brill accompanied by a band playing auld lang syne and a white flag train stopped at each station along route picking up staff documents and valuables from each at 11 45 pm train arrived at quainton road greeted by hundreds of locals and railway enthusiasts at stroke of midnight rails connecting tramway to metropolitan railway main line were ceremonially severed following withdrawal of london transport services metropolitan railway s lease was voided and at midnight on 1 december 1935 railway and stations reverted

had a raised section built in 1898 to serve metropolitan railway passenger cars relaying of track had replaced longitudinal design with transverse sleepers railway had not stimulated growth in area and after over 60 years stations remained isolated buildings surrounded by farmland alt small wooden railway station with a single rail track platform is considerably taller at one end than at other aside from a small wooden building on platform only other visible building is a single farmhouse although at time of closure there was some speculation that o at would continue to operate tramway as a mineral railway with no funds and no rolling stock of its own o at was unable to operate line on 2 april 1936 entire infrastructure of stations was sold piecemeal at auction excluding houses at westcott and brill which were sold separately auction raised ps72 7s about ps in in total ward scrap metal company paid ps7 000 about ps in for rails with exception of those at quainton road which were retained as a siding with stations at wood siding and brill closed and gwr s brill and ludgershall railway station inconveniently sited gwr opened a new station on chiltern main line near to brill at dorton halt on 21 june 1937 on 5 january 1937 board of oxford aylesbury tramroad met for last time on 5 february 1937 a winding up petition was presented to high court and on 24 march 1937 mr w e fisher was appointed on 11 november 1940 fisher was formally discharged and o at officially ceased to exist after closure after closure line was largely forgotten because it had been built on private land without an act of parliament few records of it prior to oxford extension schemes exist in official archives at least some of rails remained in place in 1940 as records exist of their removal during building of raf westcott other than station buildings at westcott and quainton road almost nothing survives of tramway although much of route can still be traced by a double line of hedges former trackbed between quainton road and waddesdon road is now a public footpath known as tramway walk after death of 3rd duke of buckingham family archives including records of brill tramway
