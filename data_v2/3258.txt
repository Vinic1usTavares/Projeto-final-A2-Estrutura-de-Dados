three minutes and forty nine seconds it has been described as a midtempo pop power pop and r b song critics noticed being heavily influenced by quiet storm and dance pop style while having a disco groove as well as having a retro and slightly 80s informed vibe mitchell peters while writing billboard cover story where mars was featured called moonshine a sexed up rocker according to sheet music published at music notes recording is composed in key of a minor with a time signature in common time and a moderate groove of 104 beats per minute mars s vocals range spans from note of c4 to e5 as track progresses flanged guitar notes and moody chord progressions can be heard with cheesy flecks of synthesizer song lope is amusing simple minds like and its chorus is similar to heartbeat by don johnson a bass guitar drums and additional beats are also part of its instrumentation subject addressed in recording lyrics has led spins critic chris martins to become slightly disappointed when he realized that song was not in fact an ode to bootleg liquor but a longing for high water mark of a relationship that now seems impossible to reach despite fact that mars lyrics intoxicate in their own way brittany spanos of rolling stone found lyrics to compares a woman to distilled liquor as mars tries to recreate magic when they were together last time recording s composition brought attention due to its similarities to works of michael jackson martins of spin stated that track finds mars channeling king of pop with a markedly more reverent aplomb sam lansky of idolator concurred writing that artist is channeling 80 s pop icon michael jackson nevertheless lansky discovered a a little bit of prince in there as well but mars vocals sound eerily like jacko in his prime song has drawn comparisons to daft punk due to its disco groove with sarah rodman from boston globe calling it wistful and los angeles times mikael wood called it conflict free tune gritting with desperation mars said that primary influence for track was american musician prince critical reception song has received generally favorable reviews from critics who couldn t help to avoid comparisons between track and michael jackson s work chris martins of spin called recording stating that was something that mars might say he also wrote that track was an 80 s informed backing track sam lanksy of idolator praised track saying fortunately drinking during recording sections paid off on song since it is probably our favorite effort from mars to date tina jamias from axs com recommended watch turning point of an 80s movie and listen to moonshine perfect match having previously stated 80s are revisited in moonshine with mars taking on sounds and styles of michael jackson and madonna jason lipshut of billboard wrote that production is so buttery that listener can t help but get another sugar rush joe of same publication while reviewing mars 5 best deep cuts opined one of most eclectic songs mars has ever delivered with a retro pop feel and a slight disco vibe to it mars unleashes a dose of musical ecstasy in a mixed review jon caramanica of new york times called it melodramatic and spry
