debut with manorama six feet under in 2007 after that he read several scripts for his next project and began work on zombie film rock shaadi and spy thriller basra but both films were shelved singh said that he wanted to attempt genres that were rarely attempted in indian cinema he then chose to work on nh10 a trip gone wrong film as it would be fairly cheap to make he said idea of film was to show stark contrast between two indias something that has been creating a lot of economic and social problems he chose a female character for role of sarpanch to show role of women in upholding and dissemination of patriarchy sic and stated that film s main theme is gender some of scenarios in nh10 depicted such real life events as honour killing cases scene in which a couple are murdered by their own families was inspired by a real life case that sharma and singh came across while researching for story singh drew likenesses between nh10 love story and story of savitri and satyavan where wife fights to save her husband singh avoided scenes depicting sexual assault which he thought could become voyeuristic or inadvertently titillating his production team had self censored from showing blood in film because he thought mainstream indian audience does not have an appetite for gore title of film refers to national highway 10 which connects delhi with town of fazilka punjab in 2013 it was announced that singh would be making nh10 with freida pinto and rajkummar rao script was first offered to sharma but she declined because she was busy with other films at that time it was then offered to several other actors while she was filming for bombay velvet its director anurag kashyap told sharma that singh was trying to make nh10 she read script again and agreed to join project which was at that time without a producer sharma then decided to co produce it nh10 was sharma s first film as a producer it was made under her label clean slate films she agreed to film because story felt real to her and its story could happen to anyone she said when bad people attack you they don t see your sex i liked that about story sharma called personal struggle very relatable as she felt this could happen to anyone neil bhoopalam said he agreed to appear in film because he liked singh s earlier film manorama six feet under to prepare for role sharma underwent interval training for around three months to physically suit character with bhoopalam she also took acting workshops conducted by singh and atul mongia for characters filming principal photography for nh10 started on 17 january 2014 film was shot in gurgaon haryana and in interior of rajasthan in its second schedule singh said he chose haryana as backdrop because several incidents similar to those depicted in film had happened there a sandstorm occurred during shoot causing a halt it was extensively filmed in jodhpur rajasthan for a month in its second schedule most of night scenes were shot in rajasthan because of several problems including crowd control fog and a sandstorm while filming in haryana some local actors were hired after auditions from hisar and rohtak because budget constraints prevented hiring of a language coach producers also thought that casting locals would make characters more realistic sharma performed all stunts herself she suffered some bruises and back pain while shooting

evacuated area darshan kumar did not interact with sharma on sets because he wanted to be in character for film sharma said hearing kumar talk while filming scene in which they confront each other
