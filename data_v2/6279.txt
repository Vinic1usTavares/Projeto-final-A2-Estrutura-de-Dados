was predominantly inhabited by english speaking settlers as early as late 1730s majority of these settlers had come from pennsylvania and new jersey many of whom were either quakers or former quakers who were attracted to baptist and methodist denominations baptist affiliation baptists established oldest extant churches in hampshire county after end of american revolutionary war baptist preachers

hampshire county west virginia 1897 monroe was a minister for primitive baptists who were adherent to a strict interpretation of calvinist theology of association monroe probably established a baptist church on site of present day capon chapel where he is buried in church s cemetery however other sources claim that a baptist congregation began gathering at capon chapel site as early as 1756 thumb left upright 1 1 wooden historical marker located near west side while it claims that construction occurred in 1750s existing documentation supports a construction date of around 1852 increased settlement and arrival of other religious denominations in cacapon river valley were further facilitated following completion of northwestern turnpike in 1830s which connected parkersburg with winchester a small community began to develop near turnpike s cacapon river crossing north of capon chapel s present day location community later became town of capon bridge land on which capon chapel was built belonged to william c nixon 1789 1869 a member of virginia house of delegates nixon s mother in law elizabeth 1773 1816 was first person to be buried in church s cemetery while various sources estimate that capon chapel was built around 1750s there is no physical or documentary evidence to support this claim first documented mention of a church at capon chapel site was in march 1852 when joseph pugh allocated 88 and one half poles or approximately to three trustees david pugh another david pugh and robert pugh pugh family which was of welsh descent were early settlers in cacapon river valley and were one of families that came from wales through pennsylvania in late 17th century grant s deed told trustees to conceive a graveyard and for a house for public worship of almighty god for use of all orthodox christians and specified that land was only to be used for religious worship and for no other purpose deed further stipulated that inheritors of land had to be pugh s descendants during church s early years no protestant denomination was exclusive owner or occupant of capon chapel which indicates that church was probably utilized as a union church for worship by any christian denomination since no single denomination oversaw church during this early period few records of its early activities and construction exist later records suggest that capon chapel was used as a place of worship by baptists until late 19th or early 20th century while it remains unclear why or how church became associated with baptists its use by denomination is possibly associated with second great awakening a protestant revival movement during early to mid 19th century that gained momentum throughout united states according to december 1904 issue of baptist home mission monthly baptist little cacapon church contributed one dollar to general fund of capon chapel demonstrating that baptist community still continued to operate from or associate with church in 1904
