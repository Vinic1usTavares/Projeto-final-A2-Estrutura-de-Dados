thumb mcmahon hussein letter of 24 october 1915 george antonius who had been first to publish correspondence in full described this letter as by far most important in whole correspondence and may perhaps be regarded as most important international document in history of arab national movement is still invoked as main piece of evidence on which arabs accuse great britain of having broken faith with them mcmahon hussein correspondence is a series of letters that were exchanged during world war i in which united kingdom government agreed to recognize arab independence after war in exchange for sharif of mecca launching arab revolt against ottoman empire correspondence had a significant impact on middle eastern history during and after war and a dispute over palestine continued thereafter correspondence is composed of ten letters that were exchanged from july 1915 to march 1916 between hussein bin ali sharif of mecca and lieutenant colonel sir henry mcmahon british high commissioner to egypt area of arab independence was defined to be in limits and boundaries proposed by sherif of mecca with exception of portions of syria lying to west of districts of damascus homs hama and aleppo conflicting interpretations of this description were to cause great controversy in subsequent years one particular dispute which continues to present is extent of coastal exclusion following publication of november 1917 balfour declaration which promised a national home for jews in palestine and subsequent leaking of secret 1916 sykes picot agreement in which britain and france proposed to split and occupy parts of territory sharif and other arab leaders considered agreements made in mcmahon hussein correspondence had been violated hussein refused to ratify 1919 treaty of versailles and in response to a 1921 british proposal to sign a treaty accepting mandate system stated that he could not be expected to affix his name to a document assigning palestine to zionists and syria to foreigners a further british attempt to reach a treaty failed in 1923 24 and negotiations were suspended in march 1924 within six months british withdrew their support in favour of their central arabian ally ibn saud who proceeded to conquer hussein s kingdom correspondence haunted anglo arab relations for many decades thereafter in january 1923 unofficial excerpts were published by joseph n m jeffries in daily mail and copies of letters circulated in arab press excerpts were published in 1937 peel commission report and correspondence was published in full in george antonius s 1938 book arab awakening then officially in 1939 as cmd 5957 in 1964 further documents were declassified background initial discussions first documented discussions between uk and sherifian family took place in february 1914 five months prior to outbreak of world war i discussions were between consul general in egypt lord kitchener and abdullah bin al hussein second son of hussein bin ali sharif of mecca hussein had grown uncomfortable with newly appointed ottoman governor in his hejaz vilayet pasha reflecting on rising tensions since 1908 completion of hejaz railway which threatened to support increased ottoman centralization in region discussions culminated in a telegram sent on 1 november 1914 from kitchener who had recently been appointed as secretary of war to hussein wherein great britain would in exchange for support from arabs of hejaz guarantee independence rights and privileges of against all external foreign aggression in particular that of ottomans sharif indicated he could not break with ottomans immediately but entry of ottomans on germany s side in world war i on 11 november 1914 brought about an abrupt shift in british political interests concerning an arab revolt against ottomans according to historian david charlwood failure in gallipoli led to an increased desire on part of uk to negotiate a deal with arabs gives further background on reasoning behind shift in british thinking damascus protocol on 23 may 1915 emir faisal bin hussein third son of hussein was presented with document that became known as damascus protocol faisal was in damascus to resume talks with arab secret societies al and al ahd that he had met in march april in interim he had visited istanbul to confront grand vizier with evidence of an ottoman plot to depose his father document declared arabs would revolt in alliance with united kingdom and in return uk would recognize arab independence in an area running from 37th parallel near taurus mountains on southern border of turkey to be bounded in east by persia and persian gulf in west by mediterranean sea and in south by arabian sea letters july 1915 to march 1916 following deliberations at ta if between hussein and his sons in june 1915 during which faisal counselled caution ali argued against rebellion and abdullah advocated action and encouraged his father to enter into correspondence with sir henry mcmahon over period 14 july 1915 to 10 march 1916 ten letters five from each side were exchanged between sir henry mcmahon and sherif hussein mcmahon was in contact with british foreign secretary edward grey throughout grey was to authorise and be ultimately responsible for correspondence historians have used an excerpt from a private letter sent on 4 december 1915 by mcmahon halfway through eight month period of correspondence as evidence of possible british duplicity i do not take idea of a future strong united independent arab state too seriously conditions of arabia do not and will not for a very long time to come lend themselves to such a thing i do not for one moment go to length of imagining that present negotiations will go far to shape future form of arabia or to either establish our rights or to bind our hands in that country situation and its elements are much too nebulous for that what we have to arrive at now is to tempt arab people into right path detach them from enemy and bring them on to our side this on our part is at present largely a matter of words and to succeed we must use persuasive terms and abstain from academic haggling over conditions whether about baghdad or elsewhere ten letters are summarised in table below from letters published in full in 1939 as cmd 5957 no from to date summary 1 hussein to mcmahon 14 jul 1915 boundaries consistent with damascus protocol requested england to acknowledge independence of arab countries bounded on north by mersina and adana up to 37 degrees of latitude on which degree fall urfa mardin ibn umar up to border of persia on east by borders of persia up to gulf of basra on south by indian ocean with exception of position of aden to remain as it is on west by red sea mediterranean sea up to mersina caliphate requested england to approve of proclamation of an arab khalifate of islam other in return england to have economic preference in arab countries with other foreign privileges in arab countries being abolished both sides to agree to a mutual defense pact and to remain neutral should other party begin a conflict of aggression 2 mcmahon to hussein 30 aug 1915 confirmed british desire for independence of arabia and its inhabitants together with our approval of arab khalifate 3 hussein to mcmahon 9 sep 1915 reiterated importance of agreeing limits and boundaries such that negotiations are dependent only on your refusal or acceptance of question of limits and on your declaration of safeguarding their religion first and then rest of rights from any harm or danger 4 mcmahon to hussein 24 oct 1915 boundaries acknowledged importance of agreeing limits stating two districts of mersina and alexandretta and portions of syria lying to west of districts of damascus homs hama and aleppo cannot be said to be purely arab and should be excluded from limits demanded as for those regions lying within those frontiers wherein great britain is free to act without detriment to interests of her ally france great britain is prepared to recognise and support independence of arabs in all regions within limits demanded by sherif of mecca other promised to protect holy places provide advice and assistance on government with an understanding that only britain will play such a role stipulated an exception for vilayets of bagdad and basra allowing special administrative arrangements for britain 5 hussein to mcmahon 5 nov 1915 vilayets of mersina and adana we renounce our insistence on inclusion t wo vilayets of aleppo and beirut and their refusing exclusion since they are purely arab vilayets and there is no difference between a moslem and a christian arab iraqi vilayets noted that we might agree to leave under british troops against a suitable sum paid as compensation to arab kingdom for period of occupation other remainder of letter discusses arab apprehension over speed of any revolt in context of risk that allies were to sue for peace with ottomans 6 mcmahon to hussein 14 dec 1915 vilayets of mersina and adana acknowledged agreement vilayets of aleppo and beirut as interests of our ally france are involved in them both question will require careful consideration and a further communication on subject will be addressed to you in due course vilayet of bagdad proposed to postpone discussion other responds to apprehension on timing with confirmation that britain has no intention of concluding any peace in terms of which freedom of arab peoples from german and turkish domination does not form an essential condition 7 hussein to mcmahon 1 jan 1916 iraq proposes to agree compensation after war t he northern parts and their coasts refuses further modifications stating it is impossible to allow any derogation that gives france or any other power a span of land in those regions 8 mcmahon to hussein 25 jan 1916 acknowledged hussein s prior points 9 hussein to mcmahon 18 feb 1916 discussed initial preparations for revolt appealed to mcmahon for ps50 000 in gold plus weapons ammunition and food claiming that feisal was awaiting arrival of not less than 100 000 people for planned revolt 10 mcmahon to hussein 10 mar 1916 discussed initial preparations for revolt confirmed british agreement to requests and concluded ten letters of correspondence sharif set a tentative date for armed revolt for june 1916 and commenced tactical discussions with british high commissioner in egypt sir henry mcmahon legal status thumb right upright 0 5 minutes of paris peace conference 1919 correspondence was described by david lloyd george as treaty with arabs elie

describes correspondence as a secret treaty and references https books google com books redir esc y id focus q mcmahon secret treaties of history that includes correspondence he also argues uk government considered it to be a treaty during 1919 paris peace conference negotiations with french over disposal of ottoman territory arab revolt june 1916 to october 1918 mcmahon s promises were seen by arabs as a formal agreement between themselves and united kingdom british prime minister david lloyd george and foreign secretary arthur balfour represented agreement as a treaty during post war deliberations of council of four on this understanding arabs under command of hussein s son faisal established a military force that fought with inspiration from t e lawrence lawrence of arabia against ottoman empire during arab revolt in an intelligence memo written in january 1916 lawrence described sherif hussein s arab revolt as beneficial to us because it marches with our immediate aims break up of islamic bloc and defeat and disruption of ottoman empire and because states sharif hussein would set up to succeed turks would be harmless to ourselves arabs are even less stable than turks if properly handled they would remain in a state of political mosaic a tissue of small jealous principalities incapable of cohesion emphasis in original in june 1916 arab revolt began when an arab army moved against ottoman forces they participated in capture of aqabah and severing of hejaz railway a strategic link through arab peninsula that ran from damascus to medina meanwhile egyptian expeditionary force under command of general allenby advanced into ottoman territories of palestine and syria british advance culminated in battle of megiddo in september 1918 and capitulation of ottoman empire on 31 october 1918 arab revolt is seen by historians as first organized movement of arab nationalism it brought together arab groups with common goal to fight for independence from ottoman empire for first time much of history of arabian independence stemmed from revolt beginning with kingdom founded by hussein after war was over arab revolt had implications groups of people were classified according to whether they had fought in revolt or and their ranks in iraq a group of officers from arab revolt formed a political party of which they were head hashemite kingdom in jordan is still influenced by actions of arab leaders in revolt related commitments may 1916 to november 1918 sykes picot agreement sykes picot agreement between uk and france was negotiated from end of november 1915 until its agreement in principle on 3 january 1916 french government became aware of uk s correspondence with hussein during december 1915 but were not aware formal commitments had been made agreement was exposed in december 1917 it was made public by bolsheviks after russian revolution showing countries were planning to split and occupy parts of promised arab country hussein was satisfied by two disingenuous telegrams from sir reginald wingate who had replaced mcmahon as high commissioner of egypt assuring him british commitments to arabs were still valid and that sykes picot agreement was not a formal treaty after sykes picot agreement was published by russian government mcmahon resigned many sources contend sykes picot agreement conflicted with hussein mcmahon correspondence of 1915 1916 there were several points of difference most obvious being that persia was placed in british area and less obviously idea british and french advisors would be in control of area designated as an arab state while correspondence does not mention palestine haifa and acre were to be british and a reduced palestine area was to be internationalized balfour declaration in 1917 uk issued balfour declaration promising to support establishment of a national home for jewish people in palestine declaration and correspondence as well as sykes picot agreement are frequently considered together by historians because of potential for incompatibility between them particularly in regard to disposition of palestine according to albert hourani founder of middle east centre at st antony s college oxford argument about interpretation of these agreements is one which is impossible to end because they were intended to bear more than one interpretation hogarth message hussein asked for an explanation of balfour declaration and in january 1918 commander david hogarth head of arab bureau in cairo was dispatched to jeddah to deliver a letter that was written by sir mark sykes on behalf of uk government to hussein who was now king of hejaz hogarth message assured hussein arab race shall be given full opportunity of once again forming a nation in world and referred to freedom of existing population both economic and political according to isaiah friedman and kedourie hussein accepted balfour declaration while charles d smith said both friedman and kedourie misrepresent documents and violate scholarly standards to reach their conclusions hogarth reported that hussein would not accept an independent jewish state in palestine nor was i instructed to warn him that such a state was contemplated by great britain declaration to seven in light of existing mcmahon hussein correspondence and in wake of seemingly competing balfour declaration for zionists as well as russia s publication weeks later of older and previously secret sykes picot agreement with russia and france seven syrian notables in cairo from newly formed syrian unity party al as suri issued a memorandum requesting clarification from uk government including a guarantee of ultimate independence of arabia in response issued on 16 june 1918 declaration to seven stated that british policy was that future government of regions of ottoman empire that were occupied by allied forces in world war i should be based on consent of governed allenby s assurance to faisal on 19 october 1918 general allenby reported to uk government that he had given faisal official assurance that whatever measures might be taken during period of military administration they were purely provisional and could not be allowed to prejudice final settlement by peace conference at which no doubt arabs would have a representative i added that instructions to military governors would preclude their mixing in political affairs and that i should remove them if i found any of them contravening these orders i reminded amir faisal that allies were in honour bound to endeavour to reach a settlement in accordance with wishes of peoples concerned and urged him to place his trust whole heartedly in their good faith anglo french declaration of 1918 in anglo french declaration of 7 november 1918 two governments stated that object aimed at by france and united kingdom in prosecuting in east war let loose by ambition of germany is complete and definite emancipation of peoples so long oppressed by turks and establishment of national governments and administrations deriving their authority from initiative and free choice of indigenous populations according to civil servant eyre crowe who saw original draft of declaration we had issued a definite statement against annexation in order 1 to quiet arabs and 2 to prevent french annexing any part of syria declaration is considered by historians to have been misleading at best post war outcome 1919 to 1925 right thumb 350px emir faisal s party at versailles during paris peace conference of 1919 at centre from left to right haidar nuri as said prince faisal captain pisani behind faisal t e lawrence known as lawrence of arabia unknown captain tahsin qadri sherifian plan one day before end of war with ottomans british foreign office discussed t e lawrence s sherifian plan in which hussein s sons were proposed as puppet monarchs in syria and mesopotamia part of rationale was to satisfy a belief among british public that a debt was owed to hashemites under mcmahon correspondence of hussein s sons faisal was lawrence s clear favourite while ali was not considered a strong leader zaid was considered to be too young and abdullah was considered to be lazy mandates paris peace conference between allies to agree territorial divisions after war was held in 1919 correspondence was primarily relevant to regions that were to become palestine transjordan lebanon syria mesopotamia iraq and arabian peninsula at conference prince faisal speaking on behalf of king hussein did not ask for immediate arab independence but recommended an arab state under a british mandate on 6 january 1920 prince faisal an agreement with french prime minister georges clemenceau that acknowledged right of syrians to unite to govern themselves as an independent nation a pan syrian congress meeting in damascus declared an independent state of syria on 8 march 1920 new state included portions of syria palestine and northern mesopotamia which under sykes picot agreement had been set aside for an independent arab state or confederation of states faisal was declared head of state as king april 1920 san remo conference was hastily convened in response to faisal s declaration at conference allied supreme council granted mandates for palestine and mesopotamia to britain and those for syria and lebanon to france united kingdom and france agreed to recognize provisional independence of syria and mesopotamia provisional recognition of palestinian independence was not mentioned france had decided to govern syria directly and took action to enforce french mandate of syria before terms had been accepted by council of league of nations french intervened militarily at battle of maysalun in june 1920 deposing indigenous arab government and removing king faisal from damascus in august 1920 in palestine united kingdom appointed a high commissioner and established their own mandatory regime january 1919 faisal weizmann agreement was a short lived agreement for arab jewish cooperation on development of a jewish homeland in palestine which faisal had mistakenly understood was to be within arab kingdom faisal did treat palestine differently in his presentation to peace conference on 6 february 1919 saying palestine in consequence of its universal character be left on one side for mutual consideration of all parties concerned agreement was never implemented at same conference us secretary of state robert lansing had asked dr weizmann if jewish national home meant establishment of an autonomous jewish government head of zionist delegation had replied in negative lansing was a member of american commission to negotiate peace at paris in 1919 he said system of mandates was a device created by great powers to conceal their division of spoils of war under colour of international law if territories had been ceded directly value of former german and ottoman territories would have been applied to offset allies claims for war reparations he also said jan smuts had been author of original concept hussein s downfall in 1919 king hussein had refused to ratify treaty of versailles after february 1920 british ceased to pay subsidy to him in august 1920 five days after signing of treaty of sevres which formally recognized kingdom of hejaz curzon asked cairo to procure hussein s signature to both treaties and agreed to make a payment of ps30 000 conditional on signature hussein declined and in 1921 stated that he could not be expected to affix his name to a document assigning palestine to zionists and syria to foreigners following 1921 cairo conference lawrence was sent to try and obtain king s signature to a treaty in exchange for a proposed ps100 000 annual subsidy this attempt also failed during 1923 british again tried to settle outstanding issues with hussein this attempt also failed and hussein continued refusing to recognize any of mandates he perceived as being his domain in march 1924 having briefly considered possibility of removing offending article from treaty uk government suspended negotiations and within six months withdrew support in favour of its central arabian ally ibn saud who proceeded to conquer hussein s kingdom territorial reservations and palestine thumb districts according to mcmahon letter and their administrative category in ottoman empire mcmahon s letter to hussein dated 24 october 1915 declared britain s willingness to recognize independence of arabs subject to certain exemptions original correspondence was conducted in both english and arabic slightly differing english translations are extant correspondence was written first in english before being translated to arabic and vice versa identity of writer and translator is unclear kedourie and others assumed likeliest candidate for primary author is ronald storrs in his memoirs storrs said correspondence was prepared by husayn ruhi and then checked by storrs arab delegations to 1939 conference had objected to certain translations of text from arabic to english and committee arranged for mutually agreeable translations that would render english text free from actual error portions of syria debate debate regarding palestine arose because palestine is not explicitly mentioned in mcmahon hussein correspondence but is included within boundaries that were initially proposed by hussein mcmahon accepted boundaries of hussein subject to modification and suggested modification that portions of syria lying to west of districts of damascus homs hama and aleppo cannot be said to be purely arab and should be excluded until 1920 british government documents suggested that palestine was intended to be part of arab area their interpretation changed in 1920 leading to public disagreement between arabs and british each side producing supporting arguments for their positions based on fine details of wording and historical circumstances of correspondence jonathan schneer provides an analogy to explain central dispute over meaning presume a line extending from districts of new york new haven new london and boston excluding territory west from an imaginary coastal kingdom if by districts one means vicinity or environs that is one thing with regard to land excluded but if one means vilayets or provinces or in american instance states it is another altogether there are no states of boston new london or new haven just as there were no provinces of hama and homs but there is a state of new york just as there was a vilayet of damascus and territory to west of new york state is different from territory to west of district of new york presumably new york city and environs just as territory to west of vilayet of damascus is different from territory to west of district of damascus presumably city of damascus and its environs more than 50 years after his initial report interpreting correspondence for british foreign office arnold j toynbee published his perspectives on continuing academic debate toynbee set out logical consequences of interpreting mcmahon s districts or wilayahs as provinces rather than vicinities i first alternative mcmahon was completely ignorant of ottoman administrative geography he did not know that ottoman vilayet of aleppo extended westward to coast and he did not know that there were no ottoman vilayets of homs and hama it seems to me incredible that mcmahon can have been as ill informed as this and that he would not have taken care to inform himself correctly when he was writing a letter in which he was making very serious commitments on hmg s account ii second alternative mcmahon was properly acquainted with ottoman administrative geography and was using word wilayahs equivocally apropos of damascus he was using it to mean ottoman provinces apropos of homs and hama and aleppo he was using it to mean environs this equivocation would have been disingenuous and pointless i could not and still cannot believe that mcmahon behaved so irresponsibly without detriment to france debate in letter of 24 october english version reads we accept those limits and boundaries and in regard to those portions of territories therein in which great britain is free to act without detriment to interests of her ally france at a meeting in whitehall in december 1920 english and arabic texts of mcmahon s correspondence with sharif husein were compared as one official who was present said in arabic version sent to king husain this is so translated as to make it appear that gt britain is free to act without detriment to france in whole of limits mentioned this passage of course had been our sheet anchor it enabled us to tell french that we had reserved their rights and arabs that there were regions in which they wd have eventually to come to terms with french it is extremely awkward to have this piece of solid ground cut from under our feet i think that hmg will probably jump at opportunity of making a sort of by sending feisal to mesopotamia james barr wrote that although mcmahon had intended to reserve french interests he became a victim of his own cleverness because translator ruhi lost qualifying sense of sentence in arabic version in a cabinet analysis of diplomatic developments prepared in may 1917 hon william ormsby gore mp wrote declassified british cabinet papers include a telegram dated 18 october 1915 from sir henry mcmahon to secretary of state for foreign affairs lord grey requesting instructions uk national archives cab 24 214 cp 271 30 mcmahon described conversations with a muhammed sharif al a member of abd party who said british could satisfy demands of syrian nationalists for independence of arabia had said arabs would fight if french attempted to occupy cities of damascus homs hama and aleppo but he thought they would accept some modification of north western boundaries proposed by sherif of mecca based on these conversations mcmahon suggested language in so far as britain was free to act without detriment to interests of her present allies great britain accepts principle of independence of arabia within limits propounded by sherif of mecca lord grey authorized mcmahon to pledge areas requested by sharif subject to reserve for allies arab position arab position was that they could not refer to palestine because that lay well to south of named places in particular arabs argued vilayet province of damascus did not exist and that district sanjak of damascus only covered area surrounding city and that palestine was part of vilayet of syria a sham which was not mentioned in exchange of letters supporters of this interpretation also note that during war thousands of proclamations were dropped in all parts of palestine carrying a message from sharif hussein on one side and a message from british command on other saying that an anglo arab agreement had been arrived at securing independence of arabs british position undated memorandum

house of commons when liberals and labour socialists moved a resolution that secret treaties with allied governments should be revised since in their present form they are inconsistent with object for which this country entered war and are therefore a barrier to a democratic peace in response to growing criticism arising from seemingly contradictory commitments undertaken by united kingdom in mcmahon hussein correspondence sykes picot agreement and balfour declaration 1922 churchill white paper took position palestine had always been excluded from arab area although this directly contradicted numerous previous government documents those documents were not known to public as part of preparations for this white paper sir john of british colonial office had exchanged correspondence with mcmahon reliance was placed on a 1920 memorandum by major hubert young who had noted that in original arabic text word translated as districts in english was vilayets largest class of administrative district into which ottoman empire was divided he concluded district of damascus i e vilayet of damascus must have referred to vilayet of which damascus was capital vilayet of syria this vilayet extended southwards to gulf of aqaba but excluded most of palestine list of notable british interpretations 1916 39 showing debate s evolution source context quotation henry october 1915

definite in excluding mersina alexandretta and those districts on northern coasts of syria which cannot be said to be purely arab and where i understand that french interests have been recognised i am not aware of extent of french claims in syria nor of how far his majesty s government have agreed to recognise them hence while recognising towns of damascus hama homs and aleppo as being within

of 24th october 1915 in which we gave him assurance that hedjaz red area which we commonly call mesopotamia brown area or palestine acre haifa enclave big arab areas a and b and whole of arabian peninsula down to aden should be arab and independent palestine position is this if we deal with our commitments there is first general pledge to hussein in october 1915 under which palestine was included in areas as to which great britain pledged itself that they should be arab and independent in future united kingdom and france italy subsequently agreeing committed themselves to an international administration of palestine in consultation with russia who was an ally at that time a new feature was brought into case in november 1917 when mr balfour with authority of war cabinet issued his famous declaration to zionists that palestine should be national home of jewish people but that nothing should be done and this of course was a most important proviso to prejudice civil and religious rights of existing non jewish communities in palestine those as far as i know are only actual engagements into which we entered with regard to palestine h erle 1919 peace conference

that particular mcmahon letter shows that mcmahon a was not thinking in terms of vilayet boundaries etc and b meant as hogarth says merely to refer to syrian area where french interests were likely to be predominant and this did not come south of lebanon toynbee who went into papers was quite sure his interpretation of letter was right and i think his view was more or less accepted until young wrote his memorandum david george a talk delivered in 1921 that palestine was part of area in respect to which we undertook to recognise independence of arabs t e lawrence lawrence of arabia february 1922 first published 1926 autobiography seven pillars of wisdom widely publicized arab revolt had begun on false pretences to gain sherif s help our cabinet had offered through sir henry mcmahon to support establishment of native governments in parts of syria and mesopotamia saving interests of our ally france last modest clause concealed a treaty kept secret till too late from mcmahon and therefore from sherif by which france england and russia agreed to annex some of these promised areas and to establish their respective spheres of influence over all rest rumours of fraud reached arab ears from turkey in east persons were more trusted than institutions so arabs having tested my friendliness and sincerity under fire asked me as a free agent to endorse promises of british government i had had no previous or inner knowledge of mcmahon pledges and sykes picot treaty which were both framed by war time branches of foreign office but not being a perfect fool i could see that if we won war promises to arabs were dead paper had i been an honourable adviser i would have sent my men home and not let them risk their lives for such stuff yet arab inspiration was our main tool in winning eastern war so i assured them that england kept her word in letter and spirit in this comfort they performed their fine things but of course instead of being proud of what we did together i was continually and bitterly ashamed henry march july 1937 letter to john evelyn shuckburgh in preparation for churchill white to times it was my intention to exclude palestine from independent arabia and i hoped that i had so worded letter as to make this sufficiently clear for all practical purposes my reasons for restricting myself to specific mention of damascus hama homs and aleppo in that connection in my letter were 1 that these were places to which arabs attached vital importance and 2 that there was no place i could think of at time of sufficient importance for purposes of definition further south of above it was as fully my intention to exclude palestine as it was to exclude more northern coastal tracts of syria i feel it my duty to state and i do so definitely and emphatically that it was not intended by me in giving this pledge to king hussein to include palestine in area in which arab independence was promised i also had every reason to believe at time that fact that palestine was not included in my pledge was well understood by king hussein winston june july 1922 churchill white paper following 1921 jaffa riots house of commons response in first place it is not case as has been represented by arab delegation that during war his majesty s government gave an undertaking that an independent national government should be at once established in palestine this representation mainly rests upon a letter dated 24 october 1915 from sir henry mcmahon then his majesty s high commissioner in egypt to sharif of mecca now king hussein of kingdom of hejaz that letter is quoted as conveying promise to sherif of mecca to recognise and support independence of arabs within territories proposed by him but this promise was given subject to a reservation made in same letter which excluded from its scope among other territories portions of syria lying to west of district of damascus this reservation has always been regarded by his majesty s government as covering vilayet of beirut and independent sanjak of jerusalem whole of palestine west of jordan was thus excluded from sir henry mcmahon s pledge his majesty s government have always regarded and continue to regard palestine as excluded by these provisos from scope of their undertaking this is clear from fact to which hon member refers that in following year they concluded an agreement with french and russian governments under which palestine was to receive special treatment it would not be in public interest to publish one or all of documents comprising long and inconclusive correspondence that took place with sheriff of mecca in 1915 16 hansard pledges to arabs hc deb 11 july 1922 vol 156 5 duke of devonshire s colonial february 1923 british cabinet memorandum regarding policy in palestine question is did excluded area cover palestine or not late government maintained that it did and that intention to exclude palestine was clearly under stood both by his majesty s government and by sherif at time that correspondence took place their view is supported by fact that in following year 1916 we concluded an agreement with french and russian governments under which palestine was to receive special treatment on an international basis weak point in argument is that on strict wording of sir h mcmahon s letter natural meaning of phrase west of district of damascus has to be somewhat strained in order to cover an area lying considerably to south as well as to west of city of damascus uk national archives cab 24 159 6 17 february 1923 duke of march 1923 diary of 9th duke of devonshire chatsworth mss expect we shall have to publish papers about pledges to arabs they are quite inconsistent but luckily they were given by our predecessors edward march 1923 debate in house of lords viscount grey had been foreign secretary in 1915 when letters were written i do not propose to go into question whether engagements are inconsistent with one another but i think it is exceedingly probable that there are inconsistencies a considerable number of these engagements or some of them which have not been officially made public by government have become public through other sources whether all have become public i do not know but i seriously suggest to government that best way of clearing our honour in this matter is officially to publish whole of engagements relating to matter which we entered into during war i regarded balfour declaration with a certain degree of sentiment and sympathy it is not from any prejudice with regard to that matter that i speak but i do see that situation is an exceedingly difficult one when it is compared with pledges which undoubtedly were given to arabs it would be very desirable from point of view of honour that all these various pledges should be set out side by side and then i think most honourable thing would be to look at them fairly see what inconsistencies there are between them and having regard to nature of each pledge and date at which it was given with all facts before us consider what is fair thing to be done hansard palestine constitution hl deb 27 march 1923 vol 53 69 lord march 1923 debate in house of lords claim was made by british government to exclude from pledge of independence northern portions of syria it was described as being that territory which lay to west of a

theirs gilbert april 1923 an unofficial note given to herbert samuel described by samuel in 1937 eight years after clayton s death i can bear out statement that it was never intention that palestine should be included in general pledge given to sharif introductory words of sir henry s letter were thought at that time perhaps erroneously clearly to cover that point gilbert march 1919 memorandum 11 march 1919 lloyd george papers f 205 3 9 house of lords we are committed to three distinct policies in syria and palestine a we are bound by principles of anglo french agreement of 1916 sykes picot wherein we renounced any claim to predominant influence in syria b our agreements with king hussein have pledged us to support establishment of an arab state or confederation of states from which we cannot exclude purely arab portions of syria and palestine c we have definitely given our support to principle of a jewish home in palestine and although initial outlines of zionist programme have been greatly exceeded by proposals now laid before peace congress we are still committed to a large measure of support to zionism experience of last few months has made it clear that these three policies are incompatible lord passfield secretary of state for july 1930 memorandum to cabinet palestine mcmahon correspondence question whether palestine was included within boundaries of proposed arab state is in itself extremely complicated from an examination of mr childs s able arguments i have formed judgement that there is a fair case for saying that sir h mcmahon did not commit his majesty s government in this sense but i also have come to conclusion that there is much to be said on both sides and that matter is one for eventual judgement of historian and not one in which a simple plain and convincing statement can be made drummond shiels under secretary of state for august 1930 house of commons debate his majesty s government have been impressed by feeling shown in house of commons on various occasions and especially in debate on adjournment on 7th may with regard to correspondence which took place in 1915 16 between sir henry mcmahon and sherif husein of mecca they have therefore thought it necessary to re examine this correspondence fully in light of history of period and interpretations which have been put upon it there are still valid reasons entirely unconnected with question of palestine which render it in highest degree undesirable in public interest to publish correspondence these reasons may be expected to retain their force for many years to come there are not sufficient grounds for holding that by this correspondence his majesty s government intended to pledge themselves or did in fact pledge themselves to inclusion of palestine in projected arab state sir h mcmahon has himself denied that this was his intention ambiguous and inconclusive nature of correspondence may well however have left an impression among those who were aware of correspondence that his majesty s government had such an intention hansard palestine mcmahon correspondence hc deb 01 august 1930 vol 242 3 w j childs of british foreign october 1930 memorandum on exclusion of palestine from area assigned for arab independence by mcmahon hussein correspondence of 1915 16 interpreted palestine as being excluded from arab area interests of france so reserved in palestine must be taken as represented by origins french claim to possession of whole of palestine and therefore that general reservation of french interests is sufficient by itself to exclude palestine from arab area reginald coupland commissioner on palestine royal may 1937 explanation to foreign office regarding commission s abstention a reason why commission did not intend to pronounce upon sir h mcmahon s pledge was that in everything else their report was unanimous but that upon this point they would be unlikely to prove unanimous george william rendel head of eastern department of foreign july 1937 minute commenting on mcmahon s 23 july 1937 letter my own impression from reading correspondence has always been that it is stretching interpretation of our caveat almost to breaking point to say that we definitely did not include palestine and short answer is that if we did not want to include palestine we might have said so in terms instead of referring vaguely to areas west of damascus and to extremely shadowy arrangements with french which in any case ceased to be operative shortly afterwards it would be far better to recognise and admit that h m g made a mistake and gave flatly contradictory promises which is of course fact lord halifax foreign 1939 memorandum on palestine legal arguments likely to be advanced by arab representatives it is important to emphasise weak points in his majesty s governments case e g i fact that word district is applied not only to damascus c where reading of vilayet is at least arguable but also immediately previously to mersina and alexandretta no vilayets of these names exist and it would be difficult to argue that word districts can have two completely different meanings in space of a few lines ii fact that horns and hama were not capitals of vilayets but were both within vilayet of syria iii fact that real title of vilayet of damascus was vilayet of syria iv fact that there is no land lying west of vilayet of aleppo it may be possible to produce arguments designed to explain away some of these difficulties individually although even this does not apply in case of iv but it is hardly possible to explain them away collectively his majesty s government need not on this account abjure altogether counter argument based on meaning of word district which have been used publicly for many years and more obvious defects in which do not seem to have been noticed as yet by arab critics committee set up to consider certain march 1939 committee set up in preparation for white paper of 1939 it is beyond scope of committee to express an opinion upon proper interpretation of various statements mentioned in paragraph 19 and such an opinion could not in any case be properly expressed unless consideration had also been given to a number of other statements made during and after war in opinion of committee it is however evident from these statements that his majesty s government were not free to dispose of palestine without regard for wishes and interests of inhabitants of palestine and that these statements must all be taken into account in any attempt to estimate responsibilities which upon any interpretation of correspondence his majesty s government have incurred towards those inhabitants as a result of correspondence while some british governments occasionally stated that intent of mcmahon correspondence was not to promise palestine to hussein they have occasionally acknowledged flaws in legal terminology of mcmahon hussein correspondence that make this position problematic weak points of government s interpretation were acknowledged in a detailed memorandum by secretary of state for foreign affairs in 1939 thumb upright 0 7 right 1939 committee cmd a committee established by british in 1939 to clarify arguments said many commitments had been made during and after war and that all of them would have to be studied together arab representatives submitted a statement from sir michael mcdonnell to committee that said whatever meaning mcmahon had intended was of no legal consequence because it was his actual statements that constituted pledge from his majesty s government arab representatives also said mcmahon had been acting as an intermediary for secretary of state for foreign affairs lord grey speaking in house of lords on 27 march 1923 lord grey said he had serious doubts about validity of churchill white paper s interpretation of pledges he as foreign secretary had caused to be given to sharif hussein in 1915 arab representatives
