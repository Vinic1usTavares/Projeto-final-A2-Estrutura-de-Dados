development from previous two titles in an interview with kato he said that ninja gaiden iii needed to go into a new direction game was given more of a science fiction motif as opposed to cthulhu mythos motif in previous two titles enemies changed to look more robotic than in previous games original intent from developers was to make game easier than previous titles to create a game a normal player can enjoy however perceived popularity of difficult video games in north america caused tecmo to release game for nes with a much higher difficulty level than japanese version they also decided to place events of ninja gaiden iii between events of first two titles in order to maintain continuity they figured that it was too difficult to continue story after ninja gaiden ii dark sword of chaos so they developed plot sometime before events of ninja gaiden ii that revolved around game s main antagonist foster release and reception ninja gaiden iii ancient ship of doom received preview coverage in video gaming magazine electronic gaming monthly where it was displayed at consumer software group trade show in tokyo on march 24 25 1991 they said that ninja gaiden iii was best famicom

easy remainder of game is very difficult review praised usage and usefulness of secondary weapons ryu s new ability to hang overhead and new addition of sword power up which it said bore resemblance

small screen makes it difficult for players to see various power ups and enemies and to use secondary weapons however they praised good controls and they said sound was fine though weird and spacy videogames computer entertainment praised game for being better than arcade version that was previously ported to lynx but they were disappointed that tecmo did not port first two nes ninja gaiden titles to handheld as well electronic gaming monthly praised tecmo for a good translation of game from nes to lynx complete with good graphics controls and varied gameplay while saying that ninja gaiden iii is a game that atari lynx has been longing for despite that reviewers noted that lynx s small screen made all sprites too small for most players to see well and screen s blurring makes it frustrating for players to track character movements in a retrospective review allgame gave a mostly negative review saying that background makes it difficult to see foreground elements that players cannot see their character or what power ups they are collecting and that sound is very poor saying thirteen banshees all wailing different off key songs would only begin to approach just how bad music is a few modern video gaming websites reviewed ninja gaiden iii upon its release to virtual console in 2008 nintendo life s damien mcferran gave lackluster ratings saying that game passed under radar of many a videogame enthusiast he added that while presentation was great he pointed out flaws in silly plot inconsistently laid out level designs and frustrating difficulty in addition to five continue limit he said that many gamers would prefer previous two ninja gaiden titles over this one ign s lucas thomas appreciated improvement in ryu s ability to scale and climb on top of walls his ability to hang overhead good storyline and new items such as dragon sword power up and vacuum wave his chief criticism was game s difficulty saying that it s not rewarding kind of difficult but instead cheap annoying kind of difficult that makes you want to throw your controller at tv screen and just go read a book as with nintendo life review thomas similarly criticized inconsistent level design as well as a storyline which becomes progressively more bizarre including weird science fiction themes about bionics and clones in a retrospective of ninja gaiden series eurogamer said that ninja gaiden iii was only game in nes trilogy not to make it to europe they made similar criticisms about difficulty level saying that north american version was made more difficult than japanese version by utilizing limited continues making enemies much more powerful and removing password system present in japanese version they said story was too outlandish calling plot of which a short lived anime ninja gaiden series would loosely be based a glorious load of old bollocks while version from ninja gaiden trilogy for super nes remedied most of their criticisms they said that game added new frustrations which included slower framerates lower quality controls and omission and shuffling around of several tracks which they said is precisely sort of thing that makes die hard videogame fans apoplectic with rage soundtrack game s soundtrack composed by hiroshi miyazaki kaori and rika was not released commercially at time of game s release a formal soundtrack release was unavailable until brave wave productions 2017 vinyl box set ninja gaiden definitive soundtrack set was mastered by keiji yamagishi and featured soundtrack of entire original trilogy notes references external links
