south dakota class was a group of four fast battleships built by united states navy they were second class of battleships to be named after 40th state first were designed in 1920s and canceled under terms of washington naval treaty four ships comprised class and they were designed to same treaty standard displacement limit of as preceding and had same main battery of nine 16 45 caliber mark 6 guns in three gun turrets but were more compact and better protected ships can be visually distinguished from earlier vessels by their single funnel compared to twin funnels in north carolinas according to naval historians william garzke and robert dulin south dakota design was best treaty battleship ever built garzke and dulin p 71 construction began shortly before world war ii with fiscal year fy 1939 appropriations commissioning through summer of 1942 four ships served in both atlantic ready to intercept possible german capital ship sorties and pacific in carrier groups and shore bombardments all four ships were retired shortly after world war ii south dakota and indiana were scrapped in 1960s massachusetts and alabama were retained as museum ships development background preceding two s had been assigned to building program and in 1936 general board met to discuss two battleships to be allocated to general board argued for two more north carolinas but admiral william h standley chief of naval operations wanted ships to be of a new design that meant construction could not begin by 1938 so ships were assigned to design work started in march 1937 and draft for two battleships was formally approved by secretary of navy on 23 june more specific characteristics for two ships were ironed out and those were approved on 4 january 1938 ships were formally ordered on 4 april 1938 friedman p 281 due to deteriorating international situations in europe and asia congress authorized a further two battleships of new design for a total of four under deficiency authorization of 25 june 1938 escalator clause of second london naval treaty had been activated in u s navy so it could begin work on follow on s but congress was willing to approve only 35 000 ton battleships a number of deficiencies in preceding north carolinas were to be fixed in south dakotas these included insufficient underwater protection and turbine engines not of most recent technology north carolinas also did not have sufficient space to act as fleet flagships so lead ship of new class was designed with an extra deck on conning tower specifically for this purpose although increase in space and weight from this necessitated removal of two twin 5 in dp mounts friedman pp 281 82 design there was a great deal of debate on requirements for new battleships design board drew up a number of proposals one called for a ship with nine 16 inch 406 mm guns in three triple turrets 5 9 in thick deck armor that would have made ship immune to plunging fire out to 30 000 yards and a top speed of at least 23 knots belt armor was a much more intractable problem 16 inch gun could penetrate 13 5 inches of plate thickest in an american battleship at time even at 25 000 yards to proof ship against her own armament a characteristic known as balanced armor main belt would have to be increased to 15 5 inches which would have increased weight of vessel to prohibitive levels to mitigate this problem sloped armor was proposed it was infeasible to use inclined armor in an external belt because it would compromise stability to a dangerous degree instead an internal armor belt was constructed behind unarmored hull plates this had serious drawbacks however it complicated construction process and if armored belt was damaged external plating would have to be cut away first before belt could be repaired friedman p 282 thumb left a preliminary design of south dakota class to minimize drawbacks of inclined belt it sloped outward from keel then back in towards armored deck this meant that shells fired at relatively close range would hit upper portion of belt at an angle which maximized armor protection however effectiveness of upper portion of belt was degraded at longer ranges because plunging fire would strike it at an angle closer to perpendicular increasing their ability to penetrate armor it did reduce area that needed to be covered by armored deck which saved additional weight this enabled upper belt to be thicker which to an extent ameliorated vulnerability to plunging fire because belt was internal it provided opportunity to extend it to inner portion of double bottom which gave ship better underwater protection than north carolinas ultimately complex double incline belt armor was abandoned when it became apparent that a single slanted belt could provide similar protection and save several hundred tons of weight friedman p 283 size of hull was also a problem a longer hull generally equates to a higher top speed but requires more armor to protect it in order to keep a higher top speed on a shorter hull higher performance machinery is required since south dakota design was much shorter than preceding north carolinas 680 ft 210 m compared to 729 ft 222 m respectively new ships would need improved machinery than would otherwise have been used in shorter hulls in order to retain same speed as longer ships design initially called for a top speed of at least 22 5 knots which was deemed sufficient to keep up with opposing battleships and outrun surfaced submarines however in late 1936 cryptanalysts deciphered radio traffic from japanese navy which revealed that battleship was capable of speeds in excess of 26 knots friedman p 285 thumb right upright south dakota under construction in april 1940 to counter this it was determined a top speed of between was possible if power plant from north carolina could be reduced in size enough to fit in tighter hull of south dakota in order to do so boilers were positioned directly above turbines in same arrangement to have been used in 1916 s boilers were then rearranged several times so they were staggered with turbines eventually ending directly alongside turbines propulsion system was arranged as close together as possible and evaporators and distilling equipment were placed in machinery rooms this provided enough additional space behind armored belt to add a second plotting room friedman p 286 by this time design process had established that hull was to be between perpendiculars and incorporate single internal sloped armor belt however in case of rejection by general board naval architects produced a series of alternatives among these were longer faster ships armed with 14 inch guns in triple turrets slower ships with 14 inch guns in quadruple turrets improved versions of north carolina class and a ship of 27 knots armed with nine 16 in guns in a similar configuration to north carolinas arguments arose frequently over issue of speed commander in chief united states fleet refused to allow new ship to drop below battle force argued at least was necessary to maintain homogeneity in line of battle and president of war college maintained a fast ship was optimal but navy would continue to operate older battleships until 1950s and so a higher speed was not strictly crucially it would mean class would have been too slow to act in what would emerge as most critical role for battleships as escorts for fast carrier task forces primary 666 ft design was only plan that could meet specified requirements for speed protection and nine 16 inch guns friedman p 290 by late 1937 a proposed design was agreed on requiring only small modifications to save weight and increase fields of fire friedman p 291 berths for crew even staterooms for senior officers along with mess halls were reduced in size and ventilation ports were completely removed forcing ship to rely completely on artificial air circulation friedman p 293 this ultimate insistence on speed presaged development of next generation of battleships largest fastest and final built by u s navy iowa class specifications general characteristics south dakota class battleships were long at waterline overall and in beam design standard displacement was approximately 1 2 overweight when ships were commissioned in 1942 considerable increase in anti air armament from contract design increased standard displacement to indianas calculated value on 12 april 1942 full load displacement was when commissioned with mean draft of at this displacement at design combat displacement of mean draft was while metacentric height was addition of more anti aircraft mounts during ships service in world war ii increased full load displacement considerably towards end of war by 1945 south dakotas full load displacement was some and massachusetts reached up to at emergency load garzke and dulin pp 97 p 448 hull featured a bulbous bow triple bottom under armored citadel and skegs characteristics shared by all american fast battleships unlike preceding north carolina class and subsequent iowa class south dakotas mounted outboard propulsion shafts in skegs rather than inboard ones compared to north carolinas slightly shorter hull form resulted in improved maneuverability and vibration problems had been considerably reduced garzke and dulin p 95 armament main battery thumb right south dakota shows range of independent elevation of her main guns south dakota class battleships carried a main battery of nine 16 in 406 mm 45 caliber mark 6 guns in three three gun turrets identical to north carolina class two of these turrets were placed in a superfiring pair forward third turret was mounted aft of main superstructure these guns fired a mark 8 armor piercing ap shell at a rate of two per minute per gun guns could either use a full propellant charge of a reduced charge of or a reduced flashless charge of this provided a muzzle velocity of 2 300 feet per second 700 meters per second for ap shell with full propellant charge while reduced version provided a correspondingly lower muzzle velocity of 1 800 ft s 549 m s 130 shells were stowed for each gun which came to a total of 1 170 guns in all three turrets could elevate to 45 degrees but only i and iii turrets could depress to 2 degrees superfiring ii turret was not able to depress this enabled a maximum range of 36 900 yards or with mark 8 projectile turrets were able to train 150 degrees in both directions from centerline which enabled a wide arc of fire guns could be elevated or depressed at a rate of 12 degrees per second and turrets could train at 4 degrees per second secondary battery thumb right massachusetts 5 inch gun battery south dakota was built as a fleet flagship with an extra deck on her conning tower for extra command space so her secondary battery had sixteen 5 in 127 mm 38 caliber mark 12 guns in eight mark 28 mod 0 twin dp mounts four on either side of superstructure this was two turrets fewer than her sister ships who had ten twin dp mounts of twenty guns five on either side of ship garzke and dulin p 89 these turrets weighed 156 295 lb 70 894 kg and could depress their guns to 15 degrees and elevate them to 85 degrees guns fired a variety of different projectiles including anti aircraft aa illumination and white phosphorus wp shells at a rate of fire of 15 to 22 rounds per minute aa shells were and weighed between 54 and 55 lb 24 25 kg depending on variant illumination and white phosphorus shells were slightly smaller at 20 in 50 8 cm long illumination rounds weighed 54 4 lb 24 7 kg and wp shells were 53 lb 24 kg guns used three different charges depending on situation a full charge a full flashless charge and a reduced charge standard full charge weighed 15 2 15 5 lb 6 9 7 0 kg flashless charge was slightly heavier at 16 lb 7 3 kg and reduced charge was significantly smaller at 3 6 lb 1 6 kg both full charges provided a muzzle velocity of 2 600 ft s 790 m s in new guns but as continued fire wore down barrels muzzle velocity degraded slightly to 2 500 ft s 760 m s reduced charge s muzzle velocity was correspondingly lower at 1 200 ft s 370 m s each gun was supplied with 450 rounds and was expected to fire 4 600 shells before it was worn enough to warrant replacement at maximum effective elevation to engage surface targets 45 degrees guns could hit targets up to 17 392 yards 15 903 m away maximum height at which aircraft could be engaged was 37 200 feet 11 900 m anti aircraft battery thumb right a variety of anti aircraft weapons on board south dakota ships had a variety of anti aircraft weapons and weapons mounted changed over time initially ships were designed to mount twelve and twelve machine guns by march 1942 when south dakota was completed anti aircraft battery was modified to eight and twenty eight machine guns and sixteen 20mm oerlikon autocannon in september of that year guns were removed and number of guns reduced to 20 in their place 20mm guns were increased to 16 weapons and 16 bofors 40mm guns were added in four quadruple mounts in february 1943 guns and one 20mm gun were replaced with an additional 52 40mm guns for a total of 68 in december 1944 battery was again upgraded with 72 20mm and 72 bofors in march 1945 battery was modified for last time five 20mm were added and four 40mm removed this provided maximum number of anti aircraft guns at 145 guns other three ships followed a similar pattern of upgrades to anti aircraft armament propulsion south dakotas had eight babcock wilcox three drum express type boilers that had a steam pressure of and a temperature of steam drove four geared turbines one for each propeller shaft general electric provided turbines for south dakota and massachusetts while identical machinery for indiana and alabama were provided by westinghouse similar to north carolina class machinery was divided into four machinery spaces each with two boilers and one set of turbines in order to ensure isolation of main propulsion machinery no longitudinal bulkheads were fitted in machinery spaces this was to reduce risk of asymmetric flooding and capsizing garzke and dulin pp 94 95 vessels had four screws with two outboard screws mounted in skegs two semi balanced rudders were mounted behind two inboard screws as completed ships had all four bladed propellers but vibration tests would result in ships of class having different propeller blade arrangements throughout war massachusetts and alabama had five blades in outboard propellers and four blades inboard while indiana had three blades inboard friedman p 294 power output was while overloading permitted up to which drove ships at a design speed of displacement of vessels gradually increased over world war ii mainly due to additional light anti aircraft gun placements and greater fuel oil carriage to refuel smaller escorts by 1945 alabama achieved 27 08 knots at 42 740 tons on ships carried about of fuel oil which gave a range of at friedman p and dulin p 101 each ship had seven 1 000 kw ship service turbogenerators as well as two 200 kw emergency diesel generators total electrical power output was 7 000 kw at 450 volts alternating current garzke and dulin p 101 electronics south dakotas were able to reap benefits of developments in radar technology during world war ii by end of war ships were equipped with air and surface search radars and radar fire control when commissioned ships were equipped with sc air search radar this radar would eventually get replaced by sk and sk 2 air search radar main battery directors were fitted with mark 3 fire control radar which were replaced by mark 8 starting in 1942 this radar gave these ships a significant advantage over japanese which for most part relied on optical systems garzke and dulin p 93 mark 37 directors for secondary batteries were fitted with mark 4 radar with this system and vt fused shells secondary batteries became formidable anti air weapons as well as being capable of using against surface targets mark 4 was eventually replaced by mark 12 22 garzke and dulin pp 94 armor unlike preceding north carolina class battleships south dakotas are designed to be resistant against 16 inch shellfire protection zone against 2 240 lb projectile fired by 16 inch 45 cal guns of was to remain within treaty displacement limits belt armor was only slightly thicker while being considerably more inclined this necessitating an internal belt arrangement in order to retain adequate waterline beam for stability friedman pp 303 05 abreast of special treatment steel sts outer hull plating south dakotas internal armor belt consists of thick class a krupp cemented k c armor mounted on thick sts plate and was inclined from vertical this was equal to 17 3 inches 440 mm of vertical belt armor at 19 000 yards belt armor extended to triple bottom with a class b homogeneous krupp type lower belt and tapered from its maximum thickness of down to at lowest portion at triple bottom this feature was chosen to protect against penetration of heavy caliber gun projectiles that managed to hit ship below waterline ends of armored citadel are protected by thick traverse bulkheads horizontal deck protection is made of three layers a sts weather deck also called bomb deck a combined class b and sts second deck and a sts splinter deck over machinery spaces over magazines splinter deck is replaced with a sts third deck garzke and dulin p p 406 immune zone of side armor against 16 inch guns used by south dakotas themselves was smaller due to introduction of 2 700 lbs mark 8 super heavy shell against such a shell armor was effective only at ranges between south dakotas had considerable main battery turret protection turret face plates are class b sides are class a rear is class a and roof is class b barbettes are protected by class a armor thick along centerline and on sides secondary battery turrets and handling spaces are protected by sts conning tower is protected by thick armor underwater protection was an internal bulge that consists of four longitudinal torpedo bulkheads forming a multi layered system designed to absorb energy from an underwater explosion equivalent to 700 pounds of tnt 1 3 gj protection system was designed for torpedo bulkheads to deform and absorb energy while several compartments were liquid loaded in order to disrupt gas bubble total system depth was it was hoped that extending armor belt to triple bottom where it tapers to as one of torpedo bulkheads can help increase protection of system compared to one used by previous north carolina class however caisson tests in 1939 indicated that initial design of newer system was less effective due to rigidity of armor belt causing leakage into adjacent compartments particularly at welded joint between lower armor belt and triple bottom this resulted in several modifications including reinforcement of lower belt armor and triple bottom joint with and a subsequent alteration of system s liquid loading scheme whereas north carolinas had third and fourth outboard compartments liquid loaded south dakotas had outer two compartments filled with liquid typically fuel oil while inner two compartments are void spaces this was done to mitigate problematic effects of lower armor belt s rigidity garzke and dulin pp 92 93 100 service south dakota thumb right south dakota anchored off iceland on 24 june 1943 south dakotas keel was laid on 5 july 1939 by new york shipbuilding corporation of camden new jersey she was launched on 7 june 1941 and commissioned on 20 march 1942 she went on a shakedown cruise in june after her fitting out was complete in august september battleship voyaged from atlantic to pacific through panama canal she struck a coral reef soon after arriving in tonga islands and had to sail to pearl harbor navy yard for repairs which took about a month south dakota was then assigned to escort aircraft carrier as part of task force tf 16 joined by tf 17 soon after combined fleet now known as tf 61 was ordered to make a sweep of santa cruz islands and then move southwest to block any japanese forces approaching guadalcanal this led to battle of santa cruz where in escorting enterprise south dakota was credited with shooting down 26 japanese planes battleship was hit once by a bomb on turret i during action on 30 october 1942 south dakota and destroyer collided while latter was investigating a sonar contact with a submarine both ships were able to continue to noumea where repaired them battleship joined north carolina class battleship and four destroyers to form tf 64 ships intercepted a japanese bombardment force on night of 14 15 november and in a battle now known as second naval battle of guadalcanal they damaged cruisers and in addition to forcing battleship and destroyer to be scuttled during battle a power failure incapacitated south dakota and she received considerable topside damage 42 shells hit ship knocking out radio communications and three fire control radars along with destroying main radar set partial repairs courtesy of crew allowed south dakota to sail for new york after ship s arrival on 18 december 1942 she was given an overhaul and battle damage was completely fixed departing yard on 25 february 1943 south dakota underwent sea trials before escorting in north atlantic operations until mid april when she joined british home fleet this deployment lasted until 1 august ship then traveled to norfolk and then pacific arriving at efate on 14 september moving to fiji on 7 november she joined battleship divisions 8 and 9 which supported allied forces in battle of tarawa among other battles along with five other battleships she fired upon nauru island on 6 december 1943 29 january 1944 saw ship bombard roi namur before she moved away to protect carriers assigned to provide air support for multiple amphibious assaults on islands within kwajalein atoll south dakota provided anti aircraft support for various fast carrier task forces until june when she bombarded saipan and tinian battleship took part in so called marianas turkey shoot where more than 300 attacking japanese aircraft were shot down though she was hit by a 500 pound bomb on main deck that killed 24 and wounded 27 battleship photo index bb 57 uss south dakota for rest of world war ii south dakota operated in pacific mostly as a carrier escort only times she did not was when she received an overhaul at puget sound navy yard from july august 1944 when five tanks of gunpowder for 16 inch guns exploded on 6 may putting ship out of action until 1 june and when she bombarded okinawa 24 march 19 april kamaishi steel works on honshu 14 july and

into their turret mountings indiana was commissioned into fleet on 30 april 1942 after shakedown operations she was sent directly to solomon islands indiana arrived off guadalcanal on 9 november 1942 and replaced her sister south dakota which was in need of repairs indianas operations off guadalcanal consisted primarily of shore bombardment in support of marines fighting on island garzke and dulin p 78 in november 1943 indiana took part in invasion of tarawa alongside her sister south dakota during this operation indiana shot down her first aircraft ship also participated in invasion of marshall islands on 1 february 1944 battleship washington collided with indiana on her starboard side 13 of voids between torpedo protection system and 13 fuel tanks were flooded and longitudinal bulkheads were severely damaged starboard outboard propeller was damaged along with shaft upon which it was mounted two quad mount 40 mm guns and 9 20 mm guns were destroyed along with two of mounts for 20 mm guns garzke and dulin pp 78 82 indianas starboard catapult was torn from ship along with kingfisher float plane that had been sitting on it ship suffered a list to starboard which was corrected by flooding compartments on port side indiana sailed to majuro lagoon to be repaired enough to make voyage back to pearl harbor resulting work was largest single repair handled at pearl harbor other than battleships damaged during attack that started war garzke and dulin p 82 after indiana returned to active duty she participated in invasion of hollandia in western new guinea ship then returned to central pacific and bombarded truk and subsequently took part in operations off marianas islands on 19 june 1944 a japanese torpedo bomber attempted to attack ship but indianas anti aircraft gunners managed to destroy both aircraft and torpedo it had dropped with no damage to ship shortly thereafter a second japanese plane was shot down but a third managed to crash into ship aircraft disintegrated upon striking side armor plates and scattered pieces of plane across stern five men were injured but ship suffered only very slight damage indiana returned to puget sound naval yard for a needed overhaul work lasted until january 1945 ship returned to active duty on 24th of that month indiana took part in bombardment of iwo jima as well as in attacks on japanese home islands following shore bombardments indiana joined task force that had assembled to invade okinawa ship provided ground support fire as well as anti aircraft defense against increasing number of kamikazes that were attacking invasion fleet indiana continued in these duties until end of war in august 1945 in 1947 indiana was put into reserve fleet at puget sound she was finally struck from navy list on

gulf in october 1944 in early 1945 alabama returned for repair and refit work at puget sound naval yard work consisted primarily of improvements to her guns and radar equipment by early may ship returned to fleet operations she was tasked with providing anti aircraft support to fast carrier groups that were launching air strikes on japanese main island of kyushu in july 1945 she shelled a number of areas in japan including kamaishi on 14th hitachi on 18th and hamamatsu on 29th and 30th these turned out to be her last offensive operations of war her last duty in far east was to assist in landing of occupation forces in japan after which she departed for united states garzke and dulin p 88 thumb alabama in 2008 moored as a museum ship in mobile on 9 january 1947 alabama was placed into reserve fleet in bremerton washington where she remained until 1 june 1962 when she was removed from navy list alabama was transferred to uss alabama battleship commission which had acquired ship in order to turn her into a memorial she was towed out of bremerton on 2 july 1964 to mobile alabama where she currently resides as a museum ship main attraction of battleship memorial park conversion proposal on 26 july 1954 a conversion proposal for south dakota class ships was ordered by chairman of ship characteristics board request was made for ships speed to be increased to at least 31 knots to do so design staff decided to remove after turret and use weight and space gained to install either a set of improved steam turbines or a set of gas turbines either system would have to produce at least 256 000 shaft horsepower 190 mw minimum requirement to achieve 31 knots on south dakota hull unfortunately this would have necessitated alterations to hull form particularly in rear of ship larger propellers were also required and all four shafts would have had to have been completely rebuilt to accommodate changes estimates for project ran as high as 40 000 000 per ship and this did not include cost of reactivating ship and upgrades to its electrical and combat systems as a result conversion program was halted ships of class ship namehull no builderlaid 57 new york shipbuilding
