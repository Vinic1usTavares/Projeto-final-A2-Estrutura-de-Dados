hsu as a female hong kong narcotics agent working with kwang production shortly after living daylights was released producer albert r broccoli and writers michael g wilson and richard maibaum started discussing its successor film would retain a realistic style as well as showing darker edge of bond character for primary location producers wanted a place where series had not yet visited while china was visited after an invitation by its government idea fell through partly because 1987 film last emperor had removed some of novelty from filming in china by this stage writers had already talked about a chase sequence along great wall as well as a fight scene amongst terracotta army wilson also wrote two plot outlines about a drugs lord in golden triangle before plans fell through writers eventually decided on a setting in a tropical country while broccoli negotiated to film in mexico at estudios churubusco in mexico city in 1985 films act was passed removing eady levy resulting in foreign artists being taxed more heavily associated rising costs to eon productions meant no part of licence to kill was filmed in uk first bond film not to do so pinewood studios used in every previous bond film undertook only post production and sound re recording writing and themes initial outline of what would become licence to kill was drawn up by wilson and maibaum before pair could develop script writers guild of america wga went on strike and maibaum was unable to continue writing leaving wilson to work on script on his own although both main plot and title of licence to kill owe nothing to any of fleming novels there are elements from books that are used in storyline including a number of aspects of short story hildebrand rarity such as character milton krest novel live and let die provided material surrounding felix leiter s mauling by a shark whilst film version of book provided close similarity between main villain mr big and licence to kills main villain sanchez screenplay was not ready by time casting had begun with carey lowell being auditioned with lines from a view to a kill script initially called licence revoked was written with dalton s characterisation of bond in mind and obsession with which bond pursues sanchez on behalf of leiter and his dead wife is seen as being because of his own brutally cut short marriage dalton s darker portrayal of bond led to violence being increased and more graphic wilson compared script to akira kurosawa s yojimbo where a samurai without any attacking of villain or its cohorts only sowing seeds of distrust he manages to have villain bring himself down wilson freely admitted that idea of destruction from within aspect of plot came more from yojimbo and sergio leone s remake of that film a fistful of dollars than from fleming s use of that plot device from man with golden gun for location wilson created republic of isthmus a banana republic based on panama with pock marked sanchez bearing similarities to general manuel noriega parallels between two figures were based on noriega s political use of drug trafficking and money laundering to provide revenues for panama robert davi suggested line loyalty is more important than money which he felt was fitting to character of franz sanchez whose actions were noticed by davi to be concerned with betrayal and retaliation united artists press kits referred to film s background as being torn straight from headlines of today s newspapers and backdrop of panama was connected to medellin cartel in colombia and corruption of government officials in mexico thrown in for good measure this use of cocaine smuggling backdrop put licence to kill alongside other cinema blockbusters such as 1987 films lethal weapon beverly hills cop ii and robocop and bond was seen to be poaching on their turf with drug related revenge story casting after carey lowell was chosen to play pam bouvier she watched many of films in series for inspiration lowell had described becoming a bond girl as huge shoes to fill as she did not see herself as a glamour girl even coming to audition in jeans and a leather jacket while lowell wore a wig for scenes set in united states a scene where bouvier is given money and told by bond to go and buy some new clothes and going off and doing so also has her hair cut was added so that lowell s own short hair style could be used robert davi was cast following a suggestion by broccoli s daughter tina and screenwriter richard maibaum who had seen davi in television film terrorist on trial united states vs salim to portray sanchez davi researched colombian drug cartels and how to do a colombian accent and since he was method acting he would stay in character off set after davi read casino royale for preparation he decided to turn sanchez into a mirror image of james bond based on ian fleming s descriptions of le chiffre actor also learned scuba diving for scene where sanchez is rescued from sunken armoured car davi later helped with casting of sanchez s mistress lupe lamora by playing bond in audition talisa soto was picked from twelve candidates because davi said he would kill for her david hedison returned to play felix leiter sixteen years after playing character in live and let die hedison did not expect to return to role saying i was sure that live and let die would be my first and last and glen was reluctant to cast 61 year old actor since role included a scene parachuting hedison was only actor to play leiter twice until jeffrey wright appeared in both casino royale and quantum of solace up and coming actor benicio del toro was chosen to play sanchez s henchman dario for being laid back while menacing in a quirky sort of way according to glen wayne newton got role of professor joe butcher after sending a letter to producers expressing interest in a cameo because he always wanted to be in a bond film president of isthmus was played by pedro armendariz jr

doubled for fictional republic of isthmus locations in mexico city included biblioteca del banco de mexico for exterior of el presidente hotel and casino espanol for interior of casino de isthmus whilst teatro de la ciudad was used for its exterior villa arabesque in acapulco was used for sanchez s lavish villa and la mountain pass in tecate was used as filming site for tanker chase during

jumping from a helicopter to a plane and dalton himself being filmed atop aircraft plane towed by helicopter was a life sized model created by special effects supervisor john richardson after filming

experienced divers barefoot waterskiing was done by world champion dave reinhart with some close ups using dalton on a special rig milton krest s death used a prosthetic head which was created by john richardson s team based on a mould of anthony zerbe s face result was so gruesome that it was shortened and toned down to avoid censorship problems for climactic tanker chase producers used an entire section of a highway near mexicali which had been closed for safety reasons sixteen eighteen wheeler tankers were used some with modifications made by manufacturer at request of driving stunts arranger remy julienne most were given improvements to their engines to run faster while one model had an extra steering wheel on back of cabin so a hidden stuntman could drive while carey lowell was in front and another received extra suspension on its back so it could lift its front wheels although a rig was constructed to help a rig tilt onto its side it was not necessary as julienne was able to pull off stunt without aid of camera trickery music initially vic flick who had played lead guitar on monty norman s original 007 theme and eric clapton were asked to write and perform theme song to licence to kill and they produced a theme to match dalton s gritty performance but producers turned it down and instead gladys knight s song and performance was chosen song one of longest to ever be used in a bond film was based on horn line from goldfinger seen as an homage to film of same name which required royalty payments to original writers song gave knight her first british top ten hit since 1977 end credits feature top 10 r b hit if you asked me to sung by patti labelle john barry was not available at time due to throat surgery so soundtrack s score was composed and conducted by

competition at cinema with licence to kill released alongside lethal weapon 2 ghostbusters ii indiana jones and last crusade starring former bond sean connery and batman there were also issues with promotion of film promotional material in form of teaser posters created by bob peak based on licence revoked title and commissioned by albert broccoli had been produced but mgm decided against using them after american test screenings showed licence revoked to be a common american phrase for withdrawal of a driving licence delayed updated advertising by steven chorney in traditional style limited film s pre release screenings mgm also discarded a campaign created by advertising executive don who had worked in publicity campaign for eight previous bond films emphasising rougher content of film contemporary reviews derek malcolm in guardian was broadly approving of licence to kill liking harder edge of earlier bonds that film emulated but wishing that it was written and directed with a bit more flair malcolm praised way film attempted to tell a story rather than use one for decorative purposes of endless spectacular tropes writing in guardian s sister paper observer philip french noted that despite playful sparkle in his eyes timothy dalton s bond is serious here overall french called licence to kill an entertaining film ian christie in daily express excoriated film saying that plot was absurd but fundamentally dull a further problem being that as there isn t a coherent storyline to link stunts they eventually become tiresome hilary mantel in spectator dismissed film it is a very noisy film there is a weary and repetitive note to frenzy sex is low key and off screen but there is a smirking perverse undertow which makes film more disagreeable than a slasher movie as quoted in mckay sinclair man with golden touch how bond films conquered world 2010 london penguin p 285 david robinson writing in times observed that licence to kill will probably neither disappoint nor surprise great faithful audience but bemoaned fact that over years plots have become less ambitious robinson thought that dalton s bond has more class than previous bonds and was a warmer personality iain johnstone of sunday times pointed out that any vestiges of gentleman spy by ian fleming have now gone and in its place is a bond that is remarkably close both in deed and action to eponymous hero of batman film that was released at same time as licence to kill adam mars jones of independent gave film a mixed review pointing out that it took out some of more dated ideas from fleming novels such as imperialism he wrote that writers were trying in effect to reproduce recipe while leaving out ingredients that would now seem distasteful overall mars jones thought that james bond is more like a low tar cigarette than anything else less stimulating than throat curdling of yesteryear but still naggingly implicated in unhealthiness a feeble bad habit without kick of a vice for canadian newspaper globe and mail rick groen wrote that in licence to kill they ve excised bond from bond flicks they ve turned james into jimmy strong and silent and roll over britannia downright american resulting in a bond film that is essentially bond less summing up groen thought actually that dialogue ain t bad silence looks good on timothy dalton gary arnold of washington times wrote that a number of factors fail to prevent finished product from jamming and misfiring with disillusioning frequency arnold opined that demanding that he dalton play bond s in a transparently seething and hotheaded manner means that dalton seems to waste away on this second outing as bond overall arnold sees that there is a failure to recognize that bond productions are simply too extravagant to permit an uncompromised return to first principles critic for new york times caryn james thought dalton was first james bond with angst a moody spy for fin de siecle and that licence to kill retains its familiar effective mix of powerful villains suspiciously tantalizing women and ever wilder special effects but was impressed that dalton s glowering presence adds a darker tone james concluded that for all its clever stylish action and witty escapism licence to kill is still a little too much by book roger ebert for chicago sun times gave film 3 1 2 stars out of 4 saying stunts all look convincing and effect of closing sequence is exhilarating licence to kill is one of best of recent bonds jack kroll writing in newsweek described licence to kill as a pure rousingly entertaining action movie kroll was mixed in his appraisal of dalton calling him a fine actor who hasn t yet stamped bond with his own personality observing director john glen is busby berkeley of action flicks and his chorus line is legendary team of bond stunt persons who are at their death defying best here for time magazine richard corliss bemoaned that although truck stunts were good it was a pity nobody not writers michael g wilson and richard maibaum nor director john glen thought to give humans anything very clever to do corliss found dalton misused in film adding that for every plausible reason he looks as bored in his second bond film as sean connery did in his sixth reflective reviews opinion on licence to kill has changed with passing of time some reviews are still mixed though film review aggregator rotten tomatoes lists film with a positive 77 fresh rating from 53 reviews tom hibbert of empire gives film only two of a possible five stars observing that dalton is really quite hopeless hibbert concluded that he may look part but timothy dalton fails boots scuba gear or automobiles left him by moore and connery in 2006 ign ranked licence to kill fifteenth out of then 21 bond films claiming it is too grim and had strayed too far from bond formula norman wilner of msn considered licence to kill second worst bond film above only a view to a kill but defended dalton saying he got a raw deal actor who could have been definitive 007 had bad luck to inherit role just as series was at its weakest struggling to cope with its general creative decline and end of cold war in october 2008 time out re issued a review of licence to kill and also thought that dalton was unfortunate saying one has to feel for dalton who was never given a fair shake by either of films in

james berardinelli saw a fundamental weakness in film overemphasis on story may be a mistake because there are times when licence to kills narrative bogs down berardinelli gave film three out of a possible four stars adding licence to kill may be taut and gripping but it s not traditional bond and that as much as any other reason may explain public s rejection of this reasonably well constructed picture raymond benson author of nine bond novels said of film it boggles my mind that licence to kill is so controversial there s really more of a true ian fleming story in that script than in most of post 60s bond movies john glen has said licence to kill is among my best bond films if not best appearances in other media right thumb 160px 1989 british coronet books paperback
