album rainbow 2017 producer ryan lewis began working on lyrics and production of praying while he was on tour over a year before its release he felt that ballad would be suitable for a female artist with his wife suggesting that kesha should sing it lewis subsequently contacted singer s management and kesha later accepted offer due to her fondness for his work with macklemore particularly admiring how their discography featured a mix of fun and politically progressive songs lewis came to kesha with a rough idea for song and encouraged her to do whatever she wanted on track when she

accompanying letter posted to lena dunham s feminist blog lenny letter she wrote about meaning of track i have channeled my feelings of severe hopelessness and depression i ve overcome obstacles and i have found strength in myself even when it felt out of reach i ve found what i had thought was an unobtainable place of peace this song is about coming to feel empathy for someone else even if they hurt you or scare you it s a song about learning to be proud of person you are even during low moments when you feel alone it s also about hoping everyone even someone who hurt you can heal

lewis and is written in key of g minor with a moderately slow tempo of 74 beats per minute vox s caroline framke felt that track was a departure from dive bar party anthems which kesha has become known for song s production is minimal with kesha joined on track by violins violas strings celli distant backing vocals and drums dan weiss of billboard deemed praying s arrangement unfashionable and said song does not sound like contemporary music chorus of praying features kesha singing i hope you re somewhere praying praying i hope your soul is changing changing i hope you find your peace falling on your knees praying refrain has been described as soaring but simple by spencer kornhaber of atlantic in vein of beautiful 2002 by christina aguilera and til it happens to you 2015 by lady gaga thumb left 150px according to several critics lyrics of praying are about dr luke pictured according to kesha praying is about hoping everyone even someone who hurt you can heal song addresses a tormentor with lyrics you brought flames and you put me through hell i had to learn how to fight for myself and we both know all truth i could tell i ll just say this i wish you farewell atlantic kornhaber thought that track s message was love your enemies and displayed christlike grace further noting that kesha did not exude invulnerability on praying way she did in some of her previous songs like dinosaur 2010 similarly eve barlow of variety said that kesha pushes through her demons and possesses a remarkable level of empathy and understanding on track conversely pitchforks jillian mapes felt that song s sentiments were akin to telling person who ruined your life to take care when you really mean fuck you while billboards weiss interpreted recording as a coded threat that kesha will no longer be silenced according to tatiana of same publication while chorus aims for reconciliation with an unnamed listener there s still a flicker of anger in singer s words like in lyric when i m finished they won t even know your name guardian atlantic mtv uk and complex each reported that song was about dr luke producer whom kesha accused of sexually assaulting and emotionally abusing her in a lawsuit although song never mentions dr luke by name kornhaber felt that song s opening lyrics you almost had me fooled told me that i was nothing without you recall singer s allegation that dr luke told her you are not that pretty you are not that talented you are just lucky to have me you are nothing without me weiss of billboard found track similar to alanis morissette s you oughta know 1995 which empowered women to call out men s abuses a torch 1998 a song about a vengeful rape victim from sarge s album glass intact and rihanna s russian roulette 2009 which deals with singer s assault at hands of chris brown kesha has said that praying showcases her voice in a way her voice has never been showcased in her entire life according to sheet music published by musicnotes com her vocals on track span from d3 to f6 mapes of pitchfork noted that singer s voice on praying is less digitally manipulated than on her past material three minutes and 14 seconds into track she sings at top of her register nearly screaming in a manner reminiscent of mariah carey song s was compared to demi lovato s vocal performance on skyscraper 2011 and sia s vocal performance on alive 2015 by billboard weiss ryan dunn writing for united methodist church thought that story of jonah is woven throughout praying and that for both kesha and jonah prayer was instrumental in bringing them through distress critical reception and accolades praying received universal acclaim from music critics who positively regarded it as a departure from kesha s past work and public image and called it a great comeback maria sherman of complex thought track was more purposeful than music that made kesha famous those looking to make pop music with real resonance would be wise to look to this song and whatever kesha does next forbes hugh mcintyre labelled praying very important adding that kesha will have no trouble collecting many new fans as she enters this next phase of her career issy sampson of guardian noted that recording was to kesha s oeuvre what fighter 2002 was to aguilera s new york times jon pareles described praying as a perfectly aimed missile of revenge and career rebooting huffposts daniel welsh wrote that it was an empowering and haunting ballad which may come as something of a surprise to more casual kesha listeners who are perhaps more used to hearing her glittery songs about partying and having a good time according to matthew rozsa of salon praying is likely to be remembered as moment when ke ha became kesha that is when her overproduced image of a party girl transformed into that of a soulful artist caroline framke of vox said that as kesha embraces her pain and rage song becomes something much more intense and weird and furious and hopeful something that feels much more like kesha herself kesha s vocals and emotional delivery were also praised by reviewers eve barlow of variety commented that song would be enough to induce goosebumps in even harshest of cynics weiss of billboard similarly commended track saying it would hard for even biggest pop agnostic to not be rendered speechless by kesha s new video and song praying in a separate billboard article gil kaufman thought that song was pure ecstasy for your ear buds times raisa bruner called praying powerfully emotional adding that when she breaks out into a flawless whistle tone it pretty much seals deal this new kesha is stronger than ever both as an artist and seemingly as a human atlantic praised it for being deeply felt and said that kesha s voice is powerful here and more capable than people might expect william ferrer of seattle times said that praying was a bone chilling must listen writing that we re only one single into rainbow and i m already certain her record is going to be one of year s finest according to sampson of guardian praying is a full on chest thumping foot stamping inspirational ballad and kesha s voice sounds better than ever and it s good enough to make you forgive her for timber pitchforks jillian mapes said that song was a powerful statement of resiliency even if resulting song s familiar piano melody sounds comparatively tepid she favorably compared praying to work of adele and florence welch althea legaspi and elias leight of rolling stone similarly called track triumphant and uplifting while patrick hosken of mtv deemed it about as soul baring as anything gets tom breihan of stereogum opined that recording was grand and expansive singles jukebox rated praying as best song of 2017 writing music nods at large scale drama but rather than letting drum and piano echo into space thuds stay close to ear like kesha s singing to her own heartbeat at 60th annual grammy awards praying was nominated for best pop solo performance ref cite news url

for vintage 1960s and 1970s clothing kesha and her stylist for video samantha burkhart picked a rainbow dress for singer to wear in video despite akerlund s concerns that dress was too similar to that

visual album lemonade 2016 alt shot of a woman singing into a microphone in front of a black backdrop wearing a white dress weiss of billboard praised video highlighting it as best work kesha released in her career he found religious imagery in video reminiscent of madonna s like a prayer 1989 and clip s use of pigs similar to video for nine inch nails closer 1994 and passage of homer s odyssey where circe transforms men into swine stereogums breihan said video was a vivid surreal vision from director jonas akerlund while mtv s patrick hosken called it emotional bruner of time labelled music video as a powerful colorful and yes glitter filled celebration of overcoming further deeming it a comeback for singer huffposts daniel welsh felt that video feature s kesha s usual mix of bright colours and outlandish costumes and an important message about overcoming troublesome times and seeing light in darkness jezebel writer julianne escobedo shepherd found that clip portrayed well kesha

of alejandro jodorowsky he also felt that it marked a glorious return for kesha racked com s elana fishman praised singer s outfits in video including her rainbow gown while pareles of new york times felt they were influenced by work of lady gaga kornhaber of atlantic said clip is a high gloss technicolor pop production from one of masters of form director jonas akerlund and that it reminded him of kesha s earlier work conversely arizona republics zachary hansen opined that video s aesthetic was in stark contrast to it showing singer at her most serious maria sherman of complex complimented use of salvation mountain in video writing it s perfect backdrop for song with its bright colorful bible sic verses painted on neon adobe in colorado desert in california it s an unexpected place to find hope mirroring kesha s move from desolation to empowerment cauterucci of slate opined that clip s use of religious symbolism confuses thrust of song adding that imagery speak s to kesha s vision for her new album as a kind of rebirth vox s framke felt that video referenced beyonce s visual album lemonade 2016 multiple times framke found monologue in video similar to beyonce s pray you catch me 2016 while rainbow outfit that kesha wore reminded her of yellow dress that beyonce sported in her hold up video which was also directed by akerlund author further wrote that evoking beyonce s imagery at video s onset dilutes message making it feel more like an homage than emotional purge kesha says it is similarly strangers amber cortes criticized kesha for taking influence from beyonce s work in praying clip writing that it emulated watery imagery of video for hold up william ferrer of seattle times also found visual similar to lemonade but added there s something haunting about praying that sets it apart from lemonade it feels more ethereal more eerily uncertain than beyonce s self assured tour de force and praying is better for it live performances kesha performed praying
