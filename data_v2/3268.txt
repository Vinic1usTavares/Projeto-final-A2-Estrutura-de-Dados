borodino class battleships were a group of five pre dreadnought battleships built for imperial russian navy around end of 19th century their design was based on that of french built modified to use russian equipment first four ships were finished after start of russo japanese war of 1904 1905 and were among ships ordered to sail from baltic sea to far east to relieve pacific squadron besieged by japanese in port arthur three of these ships were sunk and one was captured by imperial japanese navy at battle of tsushima in 1905 fifth and final ship was not completed in time to participate in war and served with baltic fleet through world war i design and description thumb left 300px right elevation and deck plan as depicted in brassey s naval annual 1906 tsar nicholas ii had desired a warm water port on pacific since his accession to throne in 1894 he achieved this ambition in march 1898 when russia signed a 25 year lease for port arthur and peninsula with china japan had previously forced china to sign over port and its surrounding territory as part of treaty that concluded first sino japanese war of 1894 1895 but triple intervention of france russia and germany forced them to return port in exchange for a sizeable increase in indemnity paid by chinese japan invested much of indemnity money in expanding its fleet while russia began a major building programme for needs of far east to defend its newly acquired port that included borodino class battleships mclaughlin pp 100 103 borodinos were most numerous class of battleships ever built by russia although they were intended to be near duplicates of tsesarevich as soon as contracts were signed it became clear that they would be quite different from french built ship basic problem facing navy was that borodinos would have heavier engines and larger turrets which would require a designer to build a ship which had same speed draft guns and armor as tsesarevich but a greater displacement new design was drawn up by d v skvortsov of naval technical committee ntc he completed his new design in july august 1898 one month after original contract had been signed new concept was roughly tons heavier and slightly larger and wider than tsesarevich mclaughlin p 137 as might be expected borodinos greatly resembled tsesarevich although skvortsov added two more casemates each containing four guns one at bow and other aft these guns were added to already existing dozen 75 mm guns emplaced along sides above armor belt this caused tumblehome used on rest of hull to be deleted over twelve guns and flat sided armor was used in its place thus five borodino class battleships only had tumblehome hulls fore and aft of their 75 mm guns emplaced along their sides mclaughlin p 138 centreline bulkhead between engine and boiler rooms caused a danger of capsizing if one side flooded and their narrow belt armor became submerged when overloaded as such naval historian antony preston regarded these as some of worst battleships ever built preston pp 50 55 ships were long at waterline and long overall with a beam of and a draft of more than designed their normal displacement ranged from more than their designed displacement of they were designed for a crew of 28 officers and 754 enlisted men mclaughlin p 136 although carried 928 crewmen during battle of tsushima campbell p 187 borodino class ships were powered by two 4 cylinder triple expansion steam engines each driving one propeller shaft using steam generated by 20 belleville boilers engines were designed to reach a top speed of lead ship borodino was fitted with a copy of la seyne machinery installed in and built by franco russian works remaining four borodinos were supplied with machinery designed and built by baltic works borodinos engines were rated at and its boilers had a working pressure of machinery of her sisters was rated at and their boilers had a working pressure of other differences were that borodino was equipped with economisers for her boilers as well as three bladed screws while her sisters lacked economisers and had four bladed propellers mclaughlin pp 137 144 because ships were being prepared to go to far east shortly after completion they conducted only abbreviated sea trials only reached her designed speed during these trails despite her engines only producing engines of her sisters produced more power but they were slower during their trials at deep load they carried of coal that provided them a range of at a speed of ships were fitted with six steam driven generators with a total capacity of armament and fire control main armament of borodino class consisted of two pairs of 40 caliber 12 inch guns mounted in french style electrically powered twin gun turrets fore and aft turrets had a maximum elevation of 15deg and 60 rounds per gun were carried guns fired one shell every 90 132 seconds forczyk p 29 they fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of friedman pp 251 252 to a range of at maximum elevation forczyk p 28 secondary armament of ships consisted of a dozen 45 caliber canet model 1891 qf guns mounted in six electrically powered twin gun turrets on upper deck turrets had a maximum elevation of 15deg arc of fire and center turrets could cover 180deg each six inch gun was provided with 180 rounds their rate of fire was about 2 4 rounds per minute forczyk p 30 they fired shells that weighed with a muzzle velocity of friedman pp 260 261 they had a maximum range of approximately a number of smaller guns were carried for defense against torpedo boats these included twenty 50 calibre canet qf guns mounted in hull embrasures ships carried 300 shells for each gun they fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of to a maximum range of at an elevation of 13deg friedman p 264 borodino class ships also mounted sixteen or eighteen hotchkiss guns in superstructure mclaughlin p 142 they fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of smigielski p 160 at a rate of around 15 rounds per minute ships carried four torpedo tubes two of which were mounted above water in bow and stern while two broadside underwater tubes were located near forward 12 inch magazine four torpedoes were carried for above water tubes and six for submerged tubes they also carried 50 mines to be laid to protect their anchorage in remote areas borodino class were originally fitted with liuzhol stadiametric rangefinders that used angle between two vertical points on an enemy ship usually waterline and crow s nest to estimate range gunnery officer consulted his references to get range and calculated proper elevation and deflection required to hit target he then transmitted his commands via a geisler electro mechanical fire control transmission system to each gun or turret while fitting out these rangefinders were replaced on first four ships by two barr and stroud coincidence rangefinders that used two images that had to be superimposed to derive range telescopic sights were also installed for their guns but their crews were not trained in how to use them forczyk pp 27 28 57 waterline armor belt of borodinos consisted of krupp armor and was thick armor of their gun turrets had a maximum thickness of and their deck ranged from in thickness armored lower deck curved downwards and formed an anti torpedo bulkhead mclaughlin pp 136 137 ships ship namesake builder cost laid down

service on 15 october 1904 knyaz suvorov flagship of vice admiral zinovy rozhestvensky commander of 2nd pacific squadron and other three borodino class battleships set sail for port arthur from libau along with other vessels of squadron forczyk p 9 rozhestvensky had received numerous reports of japanese agents and torpedo boats disguised as fishing vessels before sailing and he ordered maximum alertness after coaling at skagen denmark on 7 october early on evening of following day when squadron was near dogger bank auxiliary repair ship kamchatka reported that she was under attack by torpedo boats in rain about four hours later squadron encountered british fishing trawlers working dogger bank in fog and opened fire on them at very short range pp 91 97 one trawler was sunk and at least three others were damaged several fishermen were killed and others wounded hough pp 42 44 battleships also fired upon and damaged cruisers and in confusion incident enraged british population and caused a diplomatic incident with british that nearly led to war until russia apologized and agreed to pay reparations on 29 october pleshakov pp 98 109 rozhestvensky led his ships down atlantic coast of africa rounding cape of good hope and reached island of nosy be off north west coast of madagascar on 9 january 1905 where they remained for two months while rozhestvensky finalized his coaling arrangements during this time he learned of capture of port arthur and changed his destination to vladivostok only other port controlled by russians in far east squadron sailed for camranh bay french indochina on 16 march and reached it almost a month later to await obsolete ships of 3rd pacific squadron commanded by rear admiral nikolai nebogatov latter ships reached camranh bay on 9 may and combined force sailed for vladivostok on 14 may while exact figures are not available it is probable that ships were approximately overweight as they were overloaded with coal and other supplies all of which was stored high in ships and reduced their stability extra weight also submerged their waterline armor belt and left only about of upper armor belt above waterline mclaughlin pp 141 167 battle of tsushima before battle rozhestvensky grouped four borodinos into one division and retained personal command of division oryol last ship in division fired first shots of battle of tsushima when ship s captain nikolay yung ordered her to open fire at 11 42 at a japanese cruiser that was shadowing russian formation at a range of rozhestvensky had not given any pre battle instructions to fleet covering this situation but he ordered yung to cease fire after 30 rounds had been fired without effect knyaz suvorov was lead ship in russian battle line and she opened fire at flagship of admiral togo heihachiro at 14 05 forczyk pp 56 58 mikasa and other japanese ships began to return fire about five minutes later their high explosive shells quickly set all four of borodinos on fire at 14 35 rozhestvensky and knyaz suvorovs captain were wounded by splinters that entered ship s conning tower around 14 52 another hit jammed knyaz suvorovs steering gear after a four point turn to starboard had been ordered and caused ship to make nearly a full circle before she could be steered by her engines campbell p 129 by this time knyaz suvorovs aft 12 inch gun turret had been destroyed by an explosion that blew its roof off onto quarterdeck her forward funnel had fallen down and her mainmast had been shot away mclaughlin p 169 imperator aleksandr iii and other ships of division briefly followed knyaz suvorov until it became clear that latter ship was out of control and then turned north in an effort to get behind togo s ships knyaz suvorov never regained her position in battle line and became primary target of japanese for a time around 16 00 captain of imperator alexandr iii nikolai decided to duplicate s maneuver at battle of yellow sea by charging straight for japanese battleline in an attempt to focus their attention on his ship rather than knyaz suvorov he was successful but imperator aleksandr iii was badly damaged in process borodino now assumed lead position and turned fleet to south where they temporarily managed to disengage in mist and fog forczyk pp 25 63 66 67 knyaz suvorov was badly damaged by repeated attacks after she separated from main body although she was initially in no danger of sinking russian destroyer buinyi came alongside around 17 30 and evacuated rozhestvensky and other wounded officers torpedoes fired by a number of torpedo boats ultimately caused a magazine to explode around 19 20 and knyaz suvorov capsized at about 19 30 other than 20 officers taken off by buinyi forczyk p 67 there were no survivors of 928 crew aboard when shooting between battle lines resumed around 18 00 japanese concentrated their fire upon imperator aleksandr iii and borodino imperator alexandr iii sheered out of line to port around 18 30 and capsized but did not sink until 19 07 there were no survivors borodino lasted a little while longer under concentrated japanese fire two 12 inch hits by battleship at 19 18 started a massive fire and both ship s 12 inch gun turrets were knocked out ten minutes later after togo ordered his ships to cease fire and disengage battleship fired her already loaded 12 inch guns before turning away one of these hit borodino beneath her starboard forward six inch turret and ignited ready use ammunition in turret fire spread and caused a catastrophic detonation in several magazines that blew open her hull borodino quickly capsized and sank with only one crewman from her crew of 855 being rescued campbell p pp 67 70 oryol took lead after borodino was sunk she was joined by nebogatov s second division after togo ordered japanese battleships to disengage in gathering darkness nebogatov assumed command of remains of fleet and they continued towards vladivostok ships were discovered by japanese early following morning and attacked by togo s battleships around 10 00 faster japanese ships stayed beyond range at which nebogatov s ships could effectively reply and he decided to surrender his ships at 10 30 as he could neither return fire nor close range forczyk pp 70 71 post tsushima careers right thumb iwami at anchor japanese substantially rebuilt oryol and recommissioned her in june 1907 with name of iwami jentschura jung mickel p 21 to reduce her top weight they cut down her superstructure and repositioned her guns in addition her boilers were replaced by an unknown number of japanese built miyabara boilers and rearmed her with japanese made guns these changes reduced her displacement to approximately and her crew now totaled 750 officers and crewmen mclaughlin pp 452 453 during world war i ship participated in siege of tsingtao in august november p 146 and served as flagship of japanese intervention squadron in vladivostok in 1918 when japan intervened in russian civil war preston 1972 p 193 she was used as a training ship in 1921 and disarmed in 1922 in accordance with terms of washington naval treaty sources differ as to her ultimate fate she was either sunk as a target by aircraft near miura in july 1924 or scrapped at kobe in 1924 1925 serving in baltic sea during world war i slava was largest ship of russian gulf of riga squadron that fought german high seas fleet in battle of gulf of riga in august 1915 she was lightly damaged by three hits during battle she repeatedly bombarded german positions and troops for rest of 1915 and during 1916 nekrasov pp 52 59 64 during battle of moon sound in 1917 slava was badly damaged by german dreadnought and flooding significantly increased her draft shallow channel made it impossible to escape and she was scuttled in moon sound strait between island of muhu moon and mainland staff pp 113 117 estonians scrapped her in 1935 gardiner and gray p 294 notes footnotes references external
