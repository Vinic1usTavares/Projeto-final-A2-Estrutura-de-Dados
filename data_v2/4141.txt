choreographed razzle dazzle as she played arenas and stadiums in 2009 10 he further said beyonce didn t explain she performed with costumes that made her a comic book heroine a cyborg a club hottie and a white clad vision of purity she worked her big stages with hip pumping moves and a soul diva s voice from creamy to raspy documentary quietly flaunted her consistency as a trouper in montages that segued multiple shows in small type with beyonce in same outfit making same moves while fans nationalities changed around her yet for all her superhuman pep she also came across as warmer than ms
