recorded at symphony hall in boston massachusetts with assistance of boston symphony orchestra after having recorded re edited version close encounters of third kind 1977 and some schindler s list 1993 at symphony hall previously this was third time spielberg and williams worked on a soundtrack at this location spielberg chose symphony hall as site for recording because hall gives rich warm sound off walls and ceiling and allows you to hear air which some soundstages do not allow you to do spielberg stated he chose to work with boston symphony orchestra because film deals with a company of soldiers and orchestra was an experienced company of musicians over course of a three day period in february 1998 score for film was recorded at a rate of around 100 000 an hour spielberg and williams both watched a rough cut of film to determine what scenes would have music two decided to leave music out of fighting sequences in favor of playing it over long sequences of eight to nine minutes that lack action playing of music between fighting sequences gives a moment of reflection for what happened tom hanks came to a portion of recording session and read bixby letter which appears in movie to orchestra at behest of williams this caused musicians to shuffle their feet in appreciation williams chose to use different families and types of instruments to convey and evoke certain tones within score string instruments were chosen to provide a warm sound brass instruments were utilized for solemn sections of pieces and horn instruments were used to give off a pensive tone military drums were used largely in piece entitled hymn to fallen tanglewood festival chorus provided a vocal chorus for hymn to fallen that served as a memory to those who have fallen in combat hymn to fallen and its reprise are only two tracks that feature any sort of vocals and bookend album spielberg chose to place hymn to fallen on closing credits because it will stand test of time and honor forever fallen of this war and possibly all wars and felt it showed williams sensitivity and brilliance album was released on july 21 1998 reception author emilio felt that music offered no perspective like williams scores normally do but were instead rooted in emotion classic fm believed that despite restrictions placed on williams he still managed to create a moving theme stephen thomas erlewine of allmusic agreed stating williams added sentiment wherever he could nonetheless hillel italie of associated press found soundtrack to be bland and out of place richard harrington of washington post found soundtrack created by williams to be quietly heroic full of survivalist determination and pragmatic melancholy in regard to all of williams soundtracks for spielberg films harrington believed that this soundtrack was most subtle calgary herald writers felt williams created a reflective score that is sensitive without sensationalizing subject sun s ian black compared music for flags of our fathers 2006 with that of saving private ryan stating that it was nowhere close to latter barbera of pittsburgh post gazette wrote that john williams symphonic score soars in
