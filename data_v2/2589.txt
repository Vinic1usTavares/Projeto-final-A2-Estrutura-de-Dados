lockheed have blue was code name for lockheed s proof of concept demonstrator that preceded production lockheed f 117a nighthawk stealth bomber have blue was designed by lockheed s skunk works division and tested at groom lake nevada have blue was first fixed wing aircraft whose external shape was defined by radar engineering rather than by aerospace engineering aircraft s faceted shape was designed to deflect electromagnetic waves in directions other than that of originating radar emitter greatly reducing its radar cross section two flyable vehicles were constructed but both crashed during flight test program in 1970s it became increasingly apparent to u s planners that in a military confrontation with warsaw pact forces nato aircraft would quickly suffer heavy losses this came as a result of sophisticated soviet defense networks which used surveillance radars radar guided surface to air missiles sam and anti aircraft artillery to seek and eliminate enemy aircraft consequently defense advanced research projects agency darpa started a study on low observability aircraft seeking to design and produce an operational stealth aircraft five companies were initially invited three of which bowed out early remaining two were later joined by lockheed to design aircraft skunk works design team devised a computer program to calculate radar cross sections rcs of various designs eventual design characteristically featured faceted surfaces to deflect radar waves away from a radar receiver it had highly swept wings and inward canted vertical stabilizers which led to its being nicknamed hopeless diamond first operational aircraft made its maiden flight on 1 december 1977 flight test program validated feasibility of a flyable stealth aircraft however both prototypes were lost due to mechanical problems nevertheless have blue was deemed a success paving way for first operational stealth aircraft senior trend or lockheed f 117a nighthawk design and development origins lockheed have blue was born out of a requirement to evade radar detection during vietnam war radar guided surface to air missiles sam and anti aircraft artillery aaa posed a significant threat to us aircraft as such strike aircraft during war often required support aircraft to perform combat air patrols and suppression of enemy air defenses sead crickmore 2003 p 9 1973 yom kippur war again highlighted vulnerability of aircraft to sams israeli air force lost 109 aircraft in 18 days during cold war soviet union developed an integrated defense network central to which were medium to long range surveillance radars sams and aaas would be set up around key locations to defend them from incoming enemy aircraft if loss ratio of israel during yom kippur war was experienced by nato forces during a military confrontation with warsaw pact nato aircraft numbers would be depleted within two weeks in 1974 darpa secretly requested answers from five aircraft manufacturers regarding two considerations first was about signature thresholds at which an aircraft is virtually undetectable second point was whether these companies had capability to design and manufacture such an aircraft fairchild and grumman declined to participate while general dynamics insisted on use of electronic countermeasures as a result general dynamics left discussion remaining two companies mcdonnell douglas and northrop were each awarded 100 000 for further research jenkins 1999 p 15 design effort and early testing lockheed having been absent from fighter aircraft industry for 10 years was not approached by darpa in 1974 ed martin lockheed california companies director of science and engineering became aware of research into stealth during his work at pentagon and wright patterson afb crickmore 2003 p 10 martin and ben rich who at that time had recently become skunk works president briefed clarence kelly johnson on program central intelligence agency cia gave skunk works permission to discuss with darpa stealth characteristics of a 12 m 21 and d 21 on behalf of company rich and martin formally requested permission from darpa to participate in program but agency initially refused because there were insufficient funds after much debate lockheed was allowed entry albeit without a government contract thumb kelly johnson lockheed s designer was an initial skeptic of have blue design incorrectly remarking our old d 21 drone has a lower radar cross section than that goddamn diamond alt black and white portrait photograph of gray haired man in suit posing to right a number of plaques are present on wall behind preliminary designer dick scherrer requested possible shapes upon which he could base his low radar cross section rcs design he was introduced to denys overholser who recommended an aircraft with flat surfaces overholser later recounted his discussion with when dick scherrer asked me i said well it s simple you just make it out of flat surfaces and tilt those flat surfaces over sweeping edges away from radar view angle and that way you basically cause energy to reflect away from radar crickmore 2003 p 11 scherrer subsequently drew a preliminary low rcs aircraft with faceted surfaces at same time overholser hired mathematician bill schroeder with whom he had a prior working relationship in fact it was schroeder who trained overholser on mathematics relating to stealth aircraft kenneth watson was hired as senior lead aircraft designer during next few weeks team created a computer program which could evaluate rcs of possible designs rcs prediction software was called echo 1 as tests with program proceeded it became apparent that edge calculations by program were incorrect due to diffraction in 1964 pyotr ufimtsev chief scientist of moscow institute for radio engineering published a seminal paper titled method of edge waves in physical theory of diffraction ufimtsev p ya method of edge waves in physical theory of diffraction oai mil retrieved 30 july 2011 work was translated by air force systems command s foreign technology division subsequently overholser incorporated elements of ufimtsev s work to refine software jenkins 1999 p 16 echo 1 allowed team to quickly decide which of 20 possible designs were optimal finally settling on faceted delta wing design crickmore 2003 p 12 however many within division were skeptical of shape giving rise to name hopeless diamond sweetman 2005 p 25 kelly johnson said to rich our old d 21 drone has a lower radar cross section than that goddamn diamond in may 1975 skunk works produced an internal report titled progress report no 2 high stealth conceptual studies within it was a concept study called little harvey including kelly johnson s drawing of an aircraft with smoothly blended shapes johnson advocated for use of blended shapes as best way to achieve stealth while ben rich advocated for faceted angles rich won argument with johnson a rare occurrence slattery chad secrets of skunk works air space august 2014 p 41 design effort produced a number of wooden models a 24 inch long model made of balsa wood demonstrated placement of internal structure and access doors an air space article noted model shop found it nearly impossible to make all flat surfaces come to a single point in one corner engineers later encountered same difficulty fabricating prototype on factory floor slattery p 43 for early tests of design two 1 3 scale wooden mock ups were constructed one model coated in metal foil was used to verify echo 1 s rcs calculations while other was earmarked for wind tunnel tests afterwards a model was moved to grey butte range radar testing facility in mojave desert near palmdale which allowed more accurate tests of aircraft s rcs in event aircraft s rcs level confirmed echo 1 s predictions this meant ben rich won a quarter from johnson who previously insisted that d 21 had less rcs than have blue experimental survivable testbed in summer of 1975 darpa informally invited lockheed northrop and mcdonnell douglas to develop an aircraft under name experimental survivable testbed xst jenkins 1999 p 17 mcdonnell douglas having identified thresholds at which aircraft were deemed undetectable was unable to design and produce such an aircraft crickmore 2003 p 13 phase 1 of xst would see both lockheed and northrop build full scale models to test their rcs construct flyable vehicles and wind tunnel test their designs following phase 1 a sole contractor would be selected to continue with construction and flight testing of two demonstrators as part of phase 2 northrop s and lockheed s designs were generally similar though former s submission featured more angular and flat surfaces company used software similar to echo 1 to calculate rcs of its designs jenkins 1999 p 18 on 1 november 1975 lockheed and northrop were each awarded 1 5 million contracts to proceed with phase 1 of xst aronstein and piccirillo 1997 p 29 during a four month period two companies were each required to construct full scale wooden mock ups which would then be evaluated at usaf s radar target scatter test facility at white sands new mexico to test design s radar returns lockheed erected a 187 000 specially built pole upon which model would be perched in march 1976 a lockheed model was transferred to range before being tested following month lockheed was pronounced and piccirillo 1997 pp 32 33 because northrop xst had a much lower side hemisphere rcs darpa having realized progress accumulated throughout study urged northrop team to remain together agency would later initiate battlefield surveillance aircraft experimental which evolved into tacit blue and ultimately b 2 bomber aronstein and piccirillo 1997 p 33 construction and further tests thumb right underside view of have blue skunk works now had to design construct and flight test two manned demonstrators as part of phase 2 or have blue to build demonstrators ben rich had to raise 10 4 million from lockheed management which was secured by june phase 2 encompassed three main objectives which were validation of reduced visibility in radio wave infrared and visual and reduced acoustical observability acceptable flying qualities and modeling capabilities that accurately predict low observable characteristics of an aircraft in flight construction of both have blue demonstrators used leftover tools from c 5 program final assembly of hb1001 was originally scheduled to be completed in august 1977 before being ground tested until mid october secret roll out was envisaged to occur on 23 october after which aircraft would be dismantled and transported to test area crickmore 2003 p 16 on 1 september however with hb1001 partially complete lockheed machinists went on a four month strike a group of managers took over job of assembly which was completed in six weeks with ground tests beginning on 17 october crickmore 2003 p 17 while superficially similar to later f 117 have blue prototypes were smaller aircraft about one quarter weight of f 117 with a wing sweep of 72 5deg and inward canted vertical tails inverse v tail eden 2004 p 243 aronstein hirschberg and piccirillo 1998 p 261 radar absorbent material ram developed in a lockheed laboratory was applied to aircraft s flat surfaces for windscreen special coatings were applied to give them metallic characteristics donald 2003 p 67 eden 2004 p 242 aircraft s gross weight of 9 200 12 500 lb 4 173 5 669 kg enabled aircraft to use landing gear from northrop f 5 fighter aircraft s powerplants were two general electric ge 4as from t 2c buckeye sweetman 2005 p 30 because stealth took precedence above all else aircraft was inherently unstable as a result a quadruple redundant fly by wire fbw flight control system was integrated into aircraft to give it normal flying characteristics flight control system was borrowed from f 16 aronstein hirschberg and piccirillo 1998 p 263 overwing engine inlet was covered by a low rcs grid during takeoffs when more air is needed blow in doors were constructed at upper fuselage to admit additional airflow crickmore 2003 pp 15 16 throughout one and a half months after start of ground tests hb1001 first of two demonstrators underwent tests in preparations for first flight flight instrumentation was checked first followed by a thorough shakedown of aircraft in early november two semi trailers were parked parallel to each other outside building 82 a camouflage net was thrown over top to cover demonstrator during outdoor engine runs during engine tests a local resident complained about noise but have blue retained its secrecy hb1001 received a layer of iron coat paint during weekend of 12 13 november aircraft received a camouflage scheme devised by alan brown have blues chief technical engineer scheme consisting of three colors each with three tones was used to deceive any casual onlooker from recognizing design s characteristic faceting aircraft was disassembled loaded onto a c 5 and on 16 november aircraft was flown from burbank airport since renamed bob hope airport to area 51 at groom lake nevada upon touchdown aircraft was reassembled before undergoing another round of testing prior to first flight crickmore 2003 pp 17 18 after four taxi tests hb1001 was ready for test flights crickmore 2003 p 19 operational history hb1001 hb1001 made its first flight on 1 december 1977 at hands of lockheed test pilot bill park he would fly next four sorties all chased by a t 38 piloted by major later lieutenant colonel ken dyson dyson an f 15 eagle pilot was previously approached by united states air force personnel about project in 1976 he made his first flight on hb1001 on 17 january 1978 chased by park in fact two would be only test pilots of have blue alternating between demonstrator and chase plane crickmore 2003 p 20 flight test results allowed engineers to refine fbw system at same time they verified predictions made earlier by aerodynamic engineers on aircraft s behavior flight tests proceeded fairly smoothly until 4 may 1978 when hb1001 was making its 36th flight aircraft pitched up just as it made contact with ground which forced pilot bill park to abort landing and make a second attempt impact had however been so hard that landing gear had become jammed in a semi retracted position efforts to lower gear were unsuccessful and bill park was forced to climb again and eject when his fuel ran out aircraft was destroyed on impact in vicinity of groom lake facility jenkins and landis 2008 p 232 park survived but suffered a concussion forcing him to retire from further test flights crickmore 2003 p 21 dyson who was in chase plane recounted just before touchdown airplane pitched up it seemed it slammed down on ground real hard he park raised gear on go around and when he tried to extend it on approach only one of mains and nose wheel came down all this time gas was being consumed i suggested he climb up to 10 000 feet for ejection he started climbing but engine started flaming out from lack of fuel so he ejected hb1002 at time of crash hb1002 was almost complete with lessons learned from hb1001 incorporated into aircraft including rebuilding of aft fuselage hb1002 was distinguished from prototype in having a gray paint coat it did not have flight test instrumentation boom present on hb1001 s nose as aircraft was used to test rcs returns spin recovery chute was removed and aircraft was covered in radar absorbent material it first flew on 20 july 1978 with dyson at controls who would be only pilot to fly aircraft crickmore 2003 p 22 hb1002 was lost on 11 july 1979 during aircraft s 52nd flight a hydraulic leak caused an engine fire resulting in loss of hydraulic pressure which in turn caused severe pitch oscillations pilot ejected safely and aircraft was destroyed jenkins and landis 2008 p 233 it was later discovered that an engine exhaust clamp had loosened allowing hot exhaust to migrate to right engine compartment heat built up there causing hydraulic lines to fail crickmore 2003 p 23 debris from both aircraft was secretly buried somewhere within nellis complex despite crashes have blue was considered a success donald 2003 p 72 senior trend in october 1977 just prior to phase 2 of xst competition lockheed was tasked with exploring possible operational aircraft just a month later on day hb1001 was transported to groom lake air force awarded company a contract under code name senior trend air force wanted to exploit revolutionary technologies developed during have blue program crickmore 2003 p 25 tactical air command ordered five full scale development and twenty production aircraft based on have blue demonstrators senior trend aircraft were different from their predecessors in several aspects wings exhibited less sweep to resolve a center of gravity problem discovered during tests front fuselage was shortened to give pilot a better view and vertical stabilizers were canted outwards from centerline additionally provisions were made to include two weapons bays each of which would accommodate a single laser guided bomb or b61 tactical nuclear bomb beset by early construction problems first fsd aircraft was transferred to groom lake in may 1981 inside a c 5 further problems this time with fuel leaks delayed first flight under control of harold farley aircraft took off on 18 june for its maiden flight nine months after july 1980 first flight originally envisaged first production f 117a
