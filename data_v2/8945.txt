1988 89 south west indian ocean cyclone season was an active season that featured several storms moving near or over mascarene islands or madagascar eleven tropical storms was two greater than average of which five became tropical cyclones a storm with maximum sustained winds over 10 minutes of 120 km h 75 mph or greater storms were monitored by meteo france office mfr on reunion island in an official capacity as well as american joint typhoon warning center jtwc on an unofficial base season began early with moderate tropical storm adelinina forming in early november and continued through middle of april adelinina was one of two storms to form in november other being tropical cyclone barisaona which crossed from adjacent australian basin after no activity in december there were four storms in january including most notable of season cyclone firinga storm caused ff1 billion 1989 francs 157 million 1989 usd in damage when it struck reunion tropical cyclone calasanjy also formed in month causing heavy damage when it struck western madagascar three storms formed in february second of which hanitra also crossed from australian basin this storm as well as later tropical cyclone krisy were strongest of season attaining peak 10 minute winds of 150 km h 95 mph tropical cyclone jinabo was first of three storms to form in quick succession in late march others being krisy and tropical storm lezissy jinabo originated off east coast of madagascar and dropped heavy rainfall on reunion krisy took a similar track and passed within 100 km 60 mi of rodrigues and mauritius causing heavy crop damage lastly tropical storm lezissy merged with krisy and dissipated on april 11 to end season seasonal summary during season meteo france office mfr on reunion island issued warnings in tropical cyclones within basin using satellite imagery from national oceanic and atmospheric administration agency estimated intensity through dvorak technique and warned on tropical cyclones in region from coast of africa to 90deg e south of equator at time world meteorological organization recognized mfr as a regional tropical cyclone advisory centre and would later label agency as a regional specialized meteorological center in 1993 joint typhoon warning center jtwc which is a joint united states navy united states air force task force also issued tropical cyclone warnings for southwestern indian ocean season s 11 named storms is slightly above long term average while five tropical cyclones a storm attaining maximum sustained winds of at least was same as long term average there was an ongoing la nina event in middle of season mfr considered tropical cyclone year to begin on august 1 and continue to july 31 of following year in addition to storms monitored by mfr jtwc tracked a storm in march that formed off west coast of madagascar on march 7 it moved generally to south or south southeast failing to intensify beyond 1 minute winds of 65 km h 40 mph after passing west of madagascar storm dissipated on march 11 systems moderate tropical storm adelinina intertropical convergence zone itcz over eastern indian ocean was origin of what would become tropical storm adelinina on october 30 jtwc began monitoring system to south of diego garcia and classified it as tropical cyclone 01s on november 1 on next day mfr began issuing advisories on system and quickly upgraded it to moderate tropical storm adelinina agency estimated 10 minute winds of 65 km h 40 mph as storm moved to southeast by contrast jtwc assessed that adelinina rapidly intensified into equivalent of a minimal hurricane on november 2 estimating peak 1 minute winds of 140 km h 85 mph next day without strengthening further adelinina began weakening on november 4 turning to east and later turning back to northwest track was influenced by a ridge to south adelinina completed its five day loop on november 7 as it crossed westward over its former track that day mfr re upgraded system to tropical storm status but discontinued advisories on november 8 tropical cyclone barisaona on november 5 a tropical depression formed in australian basin south of indonesia from a trough it moved slowly and erratically to west only gradually organizing on november 8 jtwc classified system as tropical cyclone 02s before entering south west indian ocean bureau of meteorology bom estimated that system reached 10 minute winds of 105 km h 65 mph however bom did not include system in its annual summary of season and at time it was considered a tropical depression in australian region on november 12 system crossed 90deg e classified as moderate tropical storm barisaona by mfr by that time storm was moving steadily to west southwest steered by a ridge to south and it attained tropical cyclone status two days later also on november 14 mfr estimated peak 10 minute winds of 135 km h 85 mph based on well defined eye barisaona briefly weakened to tropical storm status on november 15 only to regain tropical cyclone status next day on november 16 jtwc estimated peak 1 minute winds of 185 km h 115 mph a passing trough turned cyclone to southwest it gradually weakened thereafter and jtwc discontinued advisories on november 20 mfr tracked barisaona for a few more days as a ridge steered system back to north system dissipated on november 23 tropical cyclone calasanjy origins of calasanjy were from itcz in mozambique channel off northwest coast of madagascar in early january an area of disturbed weather moved southwestward at first but gradually curved to northwest on january 9 mfr classified it as a tropical disturbance but upgraded it to moderate tropical storm calasanjy on next day also on january 10 jtwc designated storm as tropical cyclone 06s by that time calasanjy was just off east coast of mozambique although it executed a tight loop to southeast spare a landfall moving along its former path storm gradually intensified jtwc upgraded it to equivalent of a minimal hurricane on january 12 and mfr upgraded calasanjy to tropical cyclone status two days later both agencies estimated peak winds of around 135 km h 85 mph later on january 14 calasanjy made landfall in western madagascar near morondava and soon after moving ashore it turned to southwest its motion changed due to a ridge to southeast it weakened to tropical depression status before re emerging into mozambique channel on january 16 becoming extratropical next day cyclone calasanjy caused heavy damage in western madagascar with a peak wind gust of 195 km h 120 mph in maintirano storm caused morondava river to increase to a flow rate of 2 702 m3 s 95 420 ft3 s with a peak height of during storm reforms enacted after previous cyclones kamisy and honorinina helped facilitate repairs following this storm tropical depression dona on january 10 a tropical disturbance formed east northeast of st brandon which is a small archipelago belonging to mauritius it originally consisted of a small weak vortex although it gradually organized system moved to southwest and quickly intensified into a tropical depression reaching peak winds of 50 km h 30 mph despite it only being a depression mauritius meteorological service named depression dona due to threat to island system turned more to south ahead of a trough passing east of st brandon and later to west of rodrigues later dona turned to southeast dissipating on january 14 without affecting land severe tropical storm edme on january 20 a tropical disturbance formed about 240 km 150 mi west of cocos islands that day jtwc classified it as tropical cyclone although it had monitored system for preceding three days nascent disturbance moved to south and gradually intensified becoming moderate tropical storm edme on january 21 on next day jtwc upgraded storm to equivalent of a minimal hurricane as edme was aided by favorable upper level conditions beneath an anticyclone on january 23 agency estimated peak 1 minute winds of 215 km h 130 mph however mfr only assessed peak 10 minute winds of 115 km h 70 mph just shy of tropical cyclone status by time of peak intensity edme had begun moving southwestward and thereafter weakened due to increasing wind shear imparted by a trough in westerlies on january 26 storm weakened to tropical depression status as it turned to south edme dissipated following day tropical cyclone firinga firinga developed on january 24 well to northeast of mauritius after initially moving to southeast it began a southwest motion that it would continue for several days during that time system intensified into moderate tropical storm firinga and jtwc upgraded it to equivalent of a minimal hurricane on january 28 early next day it intensified to tropical cyclone status reaching peak winds of 135 km h 85 mph around that time firinga passed 50 km 30 mi west of mauritius producing wind gusts shortly thereafter cyclone struck reunion still at peak intensity producing wind gusts as strong as firinga turned more to south as it weakened degenerating into a tropical disturbance on january 31 it fluctuated in intensity after turning to southeast and executing a loop to southwest dissipating on february 7 on mauritius firinga destroyed 844 homes heavy crop damage occurred on island and damage nationwide was estimated at 60 million 1989 usd one person was killed in mauritius storm dropped torrential rainfall in southern portion of reunion including 24 hour totals of at pas de and at both of which set records for locations rains caused widespread river flooding and resulted in 32 mudslides firinga isolated several towns from flooding and left power and water outages a total of 2 746 houses were damaged or destroyed leaving 6 200 people homeless damage was estimated at around ff1 billion 1989 francs 157 million 1989 usd and there were 10 deaths on island severe tropical storm gizela a tropical disturbance formed on february 16 to southeast of diego garcia it moved to west southwest intensifying into moderate tropical storm gizela on february 18 that day jtwc began classifying it as tropical cyclone 12s due to a passing trough gizela turned to south and southeast gradually strengthening on february 20 mfr estimated peak 10 minute winds of 95 km h 60 mph while jtwc upgraded it to equivalent of a minimal hurricane influenced by a ridge gizela turned back to southwest and slowly weakened while remaining far away from any landmasses on february 22 it weakened to tropical depression status while turning to south and gizela dissipated two days later tropical cyclone leon hanitra a weak low pressure area was evident in australian basin as early as february 13 between cocos islands and christmas island it meandered for several days executing a small loop before beginning a westward motion after passing south of cocos islands system intensified into a tropical storm on february 18 and was named leon on next day storm crossed into south west indian ocean whereupon mauritius meteorological service renamed it hanitra storm quickly intensified once it entered basin jtwc which designated storm as tropical cyclone 11s upgraded hanitra to equivalent of a minimal hurricane late on february 19 on february 22 agency estimated peak 1 minute winds of 230 km h 145 mph by which time hanitra had begun a steady southwest motion by contrast mfr assessed slower strengthening only upgrading it to tropical cyclone status on february 23 and estimating peak 10 minute winds of 150 km h 95 mph storm gradually accelerated to south and weakened becoming extratropical over time motion shifted to southeast on february 28 and hanitra dissipated next day moderate tropical storm iana before iana formed there was a persistent area of cloudiness across mozambique channel in late february a low pressure area originated over eastern mozambique and moved eastward over water emerging near beira on february 25 a tropical disturbance formed off west coast of southern madagascar and moved east northeastward steered by a ridge to south shortly thereafter center passed just north of europa island by next day it intensified into moderate tropical storm iana reaching peak 10 minute winds of 85 km h 50 mph late on february 26 storm made landfall in western madagascar near morombe iana weakened slightly while moving east southeastward through country emerging into indian ocean on february 27 near on next day storm weakened to tropical depression status as it curved southward iana became extratropical next day storm was not tracked by jtwc on europa island iana produced 86 km h 53 mph wind gusts while on madagascar gusts peaked at 80 km h 49 mph at morondava severe tropical storm jinabo a tropical disturbance originated just east of st brandon on march 23 initially consisting of a disorganized area of convection without a distinct center moving briskly westward it slowly organized becoming moderate tropical storm jinabo on march 25 that day jtwc classified system as tropical cyclone 19s storm turned to southwest due to a trough in region bringing it parallel to east coast of madagascar on march 26 jtwc upgraded jinabo to equivalent of a minimal hurricane and early next day mfr estimated peak 10 minute winds of 115 km h 70 mph around that time storm stalled about 110 km 70 mi east of coast of madagascar later turning to southeast due to a ridge quickly weakening jinabo was only a minimal tropical storm by march 29 on next day it turned back to south jinabo weakened to tropical depression status on march 31 and dissipated next day having become extratropical and joining westerlies storm brought gusty winds and rainfall to madagascar and reunion on former island gusts reached 107 km h 67 mph at mahanoro along coast on reunion storm drenched island for six days with a peak of at sainte rose tropical cyclone krisy about a week after jinabo formed another tropical disturbance formed in basin on march 28 south of diego garcia in its formative stages it moved erratically although generally to southwest on march 30 it intensified into moderate tropical storm krisy same day that jtwc classified it as tropical cyclone 21s due to a ridge to south krisy s track shifted to west that day before turning southward on april 1 during that time jtwc assessed that krisy intensified to equivalent of a minimal hurricane mfr upgraded storm to cyclone status on april 2 and on that day jtwc estimated peak 1 minute winds of 195 km h 120 mph on april 3 mfr estimated peak 10 minute winds of 150 km h 95 mph as cyclone turned to west southwest over next few days storm slowly weakened passing 100 km 60 mi north of rodrigues on april 5 as a moderate tropical storm on next day krisy brushed east coasts of mauritius and reunion passing just 30 km 18 mi east of former island it weakened to tropical depression status on april 7 while curving to south and later to east becoming extratropical a ridge turned remnants of krisy to north toward tropical depression lezissy and two systems merged on april 11 krisy first affected rodrigues producing 122 km h 76 mph gusts and 97 6 mm 3 84 mm of rainfall gusts reached on reunion and high waves affected island for several days however effects were worst on mauritius while passing south of island krisy produced wind gusts of 155 km h 96 mph at plaisance airport on mauritius rainfall on island reached over a 24 period on island passages of firinga and krisy decreased output of sugar crop by 20 000 tons accounting for 15 of sugar cane mostly in southeastern portion of island several other crops were affected by two cyclones resulting in a 50 decrease of banana output as krisy struck just two months after firinga residents heeded alerts and were well prepared and 800 people sought shelter there were no direct deaths although one farmer committed suicide due to threat of storm moderate tropical storm lezissy final storm of season formed on april 6 to east southeast of diego garcia while krisy was active near rodrigues that same day jtwc classified it as tropical cyclone 24s it quickly intensified into moderate tropical storm lezissy as it took a westward trajectory reaching peak winds of 85 km h 50 mph by late on april 6 influenced by a broad area of low pressure lezissy turned to southwest gradually weakening it approached former cyclone krisy and two systems merged by april 11 both losing their circulations and leaving behind a disorganized remnant low see also list of southern hemisphere tropical cyclone seasons
