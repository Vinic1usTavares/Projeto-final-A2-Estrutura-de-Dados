lloydminster hospital act repeal act this was a government bill that dissolved then existing lloydminster hospital board in preparation for an arrangement compliant with both alberta government s new system of regional health authorities and saskatchewan government s system lloydminster sits on border of alberta and saskatchewan and hospital although built and operated by alberta government sits

senate after 1997 provincial election klein appointed stelmach minister of agriculture food and rural development while he held this office his department encouraged establishment of feedlots opposition parties charged that government was not regulating these sufficiently but stelmach responded that municipalities had authority necessary to effectively regulate them on canadian wheat board controversy stelmach sided with farmers who wanted an end to federal body s monopoly on grain sales in western provinces legislatively stelmach sponsored five bills while in agriculture food and rural development portfolio all of which passed through legislature 1997 s meat inspection amendment act required meat inspectors to acquire a search warrant before entering a private dwelling but also allowed for fines to be voluntarily paid without requiring a court case retrieved on july 4 2008 it was called by liberal agriculture critic ken nicol a really good bill livestock and livestock products amendment act of same year eliminated government guarantee of livestock patrons assurance fund designed to protect cattle producers from payment defaults by livestock dealers in favour of

supported by liberals on third and final reading retrieved on 2008 07 04 in 1999 klein shifted stelmach to new infrastructure portfolio where he made traffic safety a priority increasing fines for traffic offenses sometimes by as much as 700 he also briefly aroused controversy by proposing reversing slow and fast lanes on provincial highways on grounds that this would equalize rate at which lanes broke down and therefore save on maintenance costs nothing came of proposal he established a fund for capital projects but was criticized for not doing enough to address deterioration of province s infrastructure in 2001 klein separated transportation out of infrastructure portfolio and appointed stelmach to it where new minister advocated use of public private partnerships to build ring roads around edmonton and calgary he also introduced a program of graduated driver licensing and initiated a review of traffic safety programs stelmach was re elected by his largest majority yet during 2001 election and retained transportation portfolio until 2004 when he was reassigned to position of minister of intergovernmental relations he resigned this position in 2006 in order to contest p c leadership election klein had required that ministers intending to campaign to succeed him resign from cabinet as minister stelmach kept a low profile mark lisac who was edmonton journal s provincial affairs columnist during much of stelmach s time in cabinet later recalled that stelmach never did anything that was flashy or controversial in any way and that not a thing stood out about stelmach s ministerial service this low key style earned stelmach moniker steady eddie which would follow him to premier s office 2006 leadership election stelmach was first candidate to declare his intention to run for p c leadership and picked up endorsements from nineteen members of his caucus including cabinet ministers pearl and iris evans however former provincial treasurer jim dinning had twice as many caucus endorsements despite not having held elected office since 1997 and was generally considered race s front runner stelmach ran a low profile campaign touring province in a custom painted campaign bus while most media attention was focussed on rivalry between and socially conservative ted morton according to race s rules three candidates receiving most votes on first ballot would move on to a second ballot which would use a preferential voting system to select a winner stelmach finished third on first ballot with 15 3 of vote 3 329 votes ahead of fourth place lyle oberg and 10 647 votes behind second place morton however fourth fifth and sixth place candidates oberg dave hancock and mark norris all endorsed stelmach for second ballot on this ballot he finished in first place on first count fewer than five hundred votes ahead of dinning a majority of morton s votes went to stelmach on second count and he was elected leader financing stelmach raised more than 1 1 million for his leadership campaign after his victory he revealed names of donors of 85 of this money but declined to release names of eighty supporters citing their requests for privacy these supporters had donated a total of more than 160 000 party rules did not require any disclosure and disclosures by candidates varied norris named all of his donors while morton did not reveal any stelmach s partial disclosure was deemed insufficient by opposition leaders and democracy watch whose head suggested that albertans should assume that stelmach s anonymous donors placed him in a conflict of interest until he proved otherwise stelmach also acknowledged receiving a 10 000 donation from beaver regional waste management service s commission a landfill operator owned by five municipalities in stelmach s riding while asserting that donation was legal stelmach admitted that it was clearly unethical blamed overzealous campaign volunteers for soliciting it and returned it after end of campaign in wake of leadership campaign stelmach along with oberg hancock and norris organized two 5 000 per plate dinners in january 2007 to pay campaign debts after critics argued that dinners were essentially selling access to premier and two senior ministers stelmach cancelled them premier 2008 election stelmach was sworn in as premier december 14 2006 on february 4 2008 immediately after lieutenant governor norman kwong read throne speech to open legislative session stelmach requested a dissolution of legislature with an election to follow march 3 shortly before writ was dropped a group calling itself albertans for change began to buy print and television ads that attacked stelmach for lacking a plan and portrayed him as unfit to lead province group was funded by alberta building trades council and alberta federation of labour which led to a series of ads purchased by national citizens coalition and merit contractors in which it was accused of putting your union members money where union leadership s mouths are thumb left stelmach speaking at a luncheon in april 2007 despite a campaign that was called disorganized and uninspired stelmach s progressive conservatives won 72 seats in 83 seat legislative assembly an increase from 62 that party had won in previous election and only two seats short of ralph klein s 2001 landslide political analysts attributed party s win to its ability to present stelmach as a cautious straightforward and hard working man with a plan for alberta s future voter turnout in election was 41 lowest in alberta s history and roughly a quarter of these had to swear an oath on election day after discovering they weren t on voter s list opposition politicians and media blamed stelmach s government for these problems arguing that riding level returning officers who were nominated by progressive conservative constituency associations and who were responsible for voter enumeration were not appointed early enough according to canadian broadcasting corporation about half of 83 returning officers in 2008 election had ties to p c party returning officer in stelmach s fort saskatchewan vegreville riding had donated between 500 and 1 000 to stelmach s leadership campaign alberta chief returning officer lorne gibson as one of his 182 post election recommendations to government suggested that appointment of returning officers be handled by his own non partisan office he had previously made this suggestion in 2006 but government had not acted on it he also recommended following election that his office rather than government s justice department be responsible for prosecuting election related offenses latter did not lay charges in any of 19 alleged campaign finance violations gibson brought to its attention in february 2009 gibson appeared before legislature s all party committee on legislative offices to answer questions about conduct of election there he echoed opposition claims that government and not his office was to blame for most problems shortly after committee voted 8 3 against re appointing him with all progressive conservatives on committee opposing his re appointment and all opposition mlas supporting it opposition leaders david swann and brian mason suggested that gibson was being punished for criticizing government energy and environmental policy much of stelmach s term as premier was dominated by questions related to athabasca oil sands rapid development of these reserves was fuelling alberta economy s strong growth but also raised environmental questions after winning premiership stelmach emphasized that he had no intention of taking measures that would slow down oilsands development and suggested that economy would find its own appropriate growth rate he aggressively defended alberta s oil at home and abroad and called idea that it was extracted at an unacceptably high environmental cost a myth when liberal party of canada leader stephane dion proposed a federal carbon tax to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases stelmach rejected policy on basis that it would hurt economy and would unfairly penalize western provinces instead he championed development of carbon capture technology in july 2008 stelmach announced 2 billion worth of funding for carbon capture initiatives for which he was applauded by industry groups however canadian federation of independent business called it a huge amount of money to spend on something that isn t proven and mike hudema of greenpeace suggesting that there were better environmental uses of money available thumb right stelmach has been a proponent of development of oil sands though stelmach pledged not to do anything to curb development of oilsands he did promise to review royalty rates rates paid by oil companies for privilege of extracting alberta s oil he also committed to reducing proportion of bitumen that left alberta to be upgraded out of province likening export of bitumen to scraping off top soil from farmland soon after becoming premier he commissioned alberta royalty review panel to make recommendations on province s royalty regime opposition politicians had accused government of substantially stelmach rejected many of panel s recommendations and claimed to increase royalty rates by approximately 20 25 less than recommended by panel however instead of an increase in royalties on oil and gas alberta collected 13 5 billion less from 2009 to 2014 just after 2008 election stelmach s government announced a five year royalty break worth 237 million per year to encourage development that it feared would have become uneconomical under new plan he was less decisive in increasing in province bitumen upgrading in 2008 he conceded that alberta would continue upgrading between sixty and sixty five percent of bitumen it produced for foreseeable future rather than seventy two percent target he had previously announced for 2016 this admission came in wake of his government s approval of three new pipelines designed to export bitumen in january 2008 stelmach unveiled province s made in alberta as distinct from imposed by federal government or by international treaty plan to cut carbon emissions in order to fight global warming plan called for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 14 from 2007 levels by 2050 environmental groups and opposition parties suggested that this was insufficient in light of british columbia s plan to cut emissions by 80 from 2007 levels during same period but stelmach argued that alberta s position as a supplier of oil to rest of country justified higher emissions this was followed in june by unveiling of government s campaign to ask albertans to make one simple act such as composting using reusable shopping bags and replacing incandescent light bulbs with more efficient fluorescent bulbs opponents argued that emphasis on personal responsibility by individuals did nothing to address greater environmental damage caused by development of athabasca oil sands in late april 2008 hundreds of ducks landed in a northern alberta tailings pond belonging to syncrude where most died incident was a blow to stelmach s efforts to convince world that alberta s oil sands were environmentally friendly number of ducks that died was originally reported at around 500 but in march 2009 syncrude revealed that number was in fact more than 1 600 in response to accusations from opposition and environmental groups that his government which had known actual number since summer of 2008 had participated in covering it up to save face stelmach asserted that it had refrained from making higher number public for fear of jeopardizing its investigation of whether syncrude had violated any provincial regulations in incident investigations were centred around questions of whether syncrude had immediately reported incident as required government had first heard of it from an anonymous tip though syncrude reported it several hours later and whether company had required measures in place to prevent ducks from landing on its tailings ponds it had noisemakers designed to deter waterfowl but these had not been set up at time of incident due to winter weather conditions syncrude was eventually charged with failing to have systems in place to divert waterfowl which carries a maximum fine of 800 000 partially in an effort to counter act negative publicity from oil sands related issues for example march 2009 edition of national geographic magazine contained a 20 page article portraying alberta s oil sands operations as being highly environmentally damaging in 2009 stelmach s government spent 25 million on a rebranding campaign for province among other things it replaced alberta advantage slogan that had long been in use with alberta freedom to create spirit to achieve campaign became subject of some ridicule when edmonton journal revealed that one of photos used in it was not taken in alberta but at a north sea beach in northumberland while government initially claimed that it had intentionally used a foreign image to represent alberta s engagement with world it later admitted that this was not case and that photo had been used in error stelmach responded to image which showed two children running along a beach by saying that children no matter where they are around world they are next generation and air quality water quality no matter where we live on this big globe we re all responsible and that s message we re trying to portray energy and utilities board affair and land use policy in june 2007 government mandated alberta energy and utilities board admitted that it had hired private investigators to spy on landowners who opposed construction of a major power line in area stelmach initially downplayed incident but ordered a judicial investigation once province s information and privacy commissioner initiated an investigation of his own this investigation found that eub had violated provincial law and infringed on landowners privacy while judicial investigation criticized eub s tactics as repulsive opposition parties called for dismissal of entire eub and energy minister mel knight stelmach instead opted to appoint a new eub chair thumb left activist mike hudema holding a depiction of stelmach while protesting bill 46 stelmach s government also responded with legislation entitled alberta utilities commission act bill 46 which would split eub into two parts alberta utilities commission responsible for regulating utilities and energy resources conservation board responsible for regulating oil and gas legislation was controversial as elements of eub s governing legislation that provided for public notice and consultation in event of energy construction projects were left out opposition parties and advocacy groups charged that this was an assault on both landowners rights and environment legislation ultimately passed and took effect at beginning of 2008 stelmach clashed with rural landowners again in 2009 when his government introduced land assembly project area act designed to make it easier for government to acquire large blocks of land for public purposes such as ring roads or reservoirs act allowed government to identify land that it may be interested in at some point in future and to indefinitely prohibit any development on that land that could conflict with government s purposes despite vigorous opposition from landowners and opposition parties bill passed legislature in late april fiscal policy ralph klein s major focus for much of his premiership had been elimination of provincial deficit and government ran a record 8 9 billion surplus during stelmach s first year in office alberta was in midst of a major economic expansion driven by high energy prices and major oilsands development this growth continued into 2007 2008 when government s surplus was 4 6 billion both of these surpluses were higher than expected and stelmach s government followed a policy of placing one third of unanticipated surpluses into savings and two thirds into construction projects critics including liberal mla laurie blakeman and canadian taxpayers federation charged that government was not saving enough money in anticipation of a fall in energy prices in her april 2008 budget stelmach s finance minister iris evans forecast a 1 6 billion surplus for 2008 2009 by august she had revised this prediction to 8 5 billion major reason for this change is an increase in oil prices while she had estimated in april that they would average 78 per barrel over fiscal year by august increases including a high of 147 per barrel in july have led her to make a new estimate of a 119 25 per barrel average by november prices had fallen to 55 per barrel and evans estimated a 2 billion surplus by february 2009 government of alberta appeared poised to run a 1 billion deficit in april 2009 evans released her budget for 2009 2010 in which she anticipated a 4 6 billion deficit this is largest deficit in alberta s history and its first in sixteen years government s fiscal plan includes deficits until 2012 2013 when it again anticipates a surplus stelmach s approach to this deteriorating fiscal situation part of a global recession was to invest heavily in infrastructure in an effort to stimulate economy and take advantage of low construction costs he went as far as to advocate borrowing for capital construction a departure from klein government s notoriously anti debt approach however his government was also one of only two in canada other being saskatchewan s to cut overall spending in 2009 2010 budget this approach drew ire of liberal leader david swann who supported increased government spending for economic stimulus purposes but drew support from some economists and was defended by evans on basis that capital spending was at twice per capital level of canadian average teachers pension liability during his first year in office stelmach and his education minister ron liepert concluded a deal with alberta teachers association ata in which province agreed to contribute 2 1 billion towards 6 6 billion unfunded pension liability this liability resulted from insufficient contributions to teachers pension plan during period leading up to 1992 in exchange ata agreed to a five year contract extension deal was applauded by opposition liberals and new democrats but was criticized by canadian taxpayers federation which called for a plebiscite on issue pay increases shortly after winning an increased majority in 2008 election stelmach s cabinet approved substantial raises for themselves increasing salary paid to cabinet ministers from 142 000 to 184 000 and that paid to premier from 159 450 to 213 450 increases also affect severance paid to ministers who resign or are defeated in elections under program implemented by ralph klein s government to replace previously existing pension program departing mlas receive three months pay for every year they served with level of pay based on their three highest earning years increases were attacked by canadian taxpayers federation and opposition parties but stelmach defended raises as first received by cabinet ministers in fifteen years and as being necessary to attract qualified people to politics in early 2009 in response to late 2000s recession stelmach announced that his caucus would decline an automatic 4 9 cost of living pay increase following week legislature s all party standing committee on member services extended this to all mlas by voting unanimously to freeze mla salaries for fiscal year health policy stelmach s policy on health care was highlighted by his removal of province s health care premiums effective end of 2008 critics had denounced premiums as being regressive both because they were same amount regardless of payer s income and because people with better paying jobs often had their premiums covered by their employer opposition liberal and new democratic parties had long called for their removal this elimination was announced in a throne speech immediately before dissolution of legislature for 2008 election although it was initially promised to take effect by 2012 during this campaign stelmach promised to increase capacity of alberta universities to train doctors and nurses over four years eventually resulting in graduation of 225 more doctors 350 more registered nurses and 220 licensed practical nurses after registrar of alberta college of physicians and surgeons called plan unfeasible health minister dave hancock clarified that most of increase would in fact come from immigration of foreign doctors to alberta rather than from in province training following election stelmach s new minister of health ron liepert released government s new health plan in it liepert refused to characterize problems in health care system as being result of doctor shortages and instead promised structural reforms he indicated that these may include consolidating health authorities closing rural hospitals and de listing some health services from coverage under province s public health insurance scheme in may government took first step in implementing these structural reforms by combining province s nine health authorities into one health in june 2008 three senior health officials announced that they would be leaving province s employment at expiration of their contracts in august liepert blamed their departures on better offers from other employers although new democrat leader brian mason speculated that government s health restructuring may have been to blame detractors pointed out that optics of allowing employees to depart for more money elsewhere soon after government had approved a substantial pay hike for cabinet ministers were not good as province s fiscal situation worsened in late 2008 government adapted its health policy in december liepert announced a new seniors drug plan that made drugs free for seniors making less than 21 325 but required those making more to pay as much as 7 500 for their drugs in response to protests from seniors he amended plan in april 2009 to reduce both income level at which seniors would have to start paying and amount which those seniors would have to pay liepert said that plan 10 million more expensive than one he had announced in december would see 60 of seniors pay less than they did under status quo same month stelmach s government s budget revealed changes to which medical services it would cover those de listed included chiropractic services at an annual savings of 53 million and sex change operations at an annual savings of 700 000 while canada health act requires federal government to financially penalize provinces that do not support all medically necessary procedures liepert maintained that de listed services were not medically necessary from perspective of act and said that he anticipated no trouble from federal government during 2009 h1n1 pandemic stelmach initially announced that government would make vaccine available to all albertans though vaccine shortages resulted in a limited number of clinics which experienced long lineups in response liberal leader david swann accused government of managing limited vaccine supplies poorly by not giving priority to most vulnerable groups liepert defended government s record by saying that high risk populations had been given priority but that government s policy was to turn nobody away he blamed many of problems on federal government s delivery to province of fewer doses of vaccine than promised further controversy erupted when it was revealed that hockey players on calgary flames were vaccinated with vaccine received directly from alberta health services which prompted stelmach to announce an investigation two alberta health services employees were fired as a result of investigation human rights citizenship and multiculturalism act in spring 2009 stelmach s government announced its intention to overhaul alberta human rights citizenship and multiculturalism act in 1998 s v alberta supreme court of canada had found that legislation s failure to include sexual orientation among grounds on which discrimination was prohibited violated canadian charter of rights and freedoms and had read in this protection however text of act continued not to mention sexual orientation gay rights activists and opposition politicians hoped that government s proposed changes to act would change this conservatives and libertarians including national post columnist colby cosh hoped that changes would also include removal of a section of act empowering alberta human rights commission to investigate and prosecute complaints of publications exposing a person or a class of persons to contempt believing that powers granted to commission amounted to censorship this section had been used to try to prosecute ezra levant for publishing cartoons at centre of jyllands posten muhammad cartoons controversy in his western standard magazine and to successfully prosecute red deer advocate for publishing a letter to editor entitled homosexual agenda wicked changes that were eventually tabled included enshrining of sexual orientation as protected grounds but not removal of section dealing with exposing to contempt this omission was criticized levant said that it made him deeply embarrassed as a conservative but stelmach said that his caucus was comfortable that another provision requiring that impugned section should not be deemed to interfere with free expression of opinion on any subject protected albertans against its abusive use proposal also included a section entitling parents to advance notice from schools if their children were going to be taught subject matter that deals explicitly with religion sexuality or sexual orientation and right to remove their children from such classes stelmach called this a very very fundamental right and suggested that it would allow parents to opt out of having their children learn about evolution though his education minister dave hancock argued that new wording didn t extend beyond current practice alberta teachers association president frank expressed concern that this would make teaching of science and geography in public schools very difficult and suggested that parents who did not wish to have their children exposed to evolution should home school them or send them to private school new democratic party leader brian mason suggested that changes would make alberta sound like arkansas democratic reform thumb right stelmach returned all party committees to legislative assembly of alberta where they had not existed since early in ralph klein s tenure klein s government had received criticism for reducing importance of legislature by sitting it fewer days than any other province s legislature and for directing business through standing policy committees of progressive conservative caucus these committees met in private unlike legislature s all party committees which fell almost entirely out of use during klein years in april 2007 stelmach initiated creation of four new legislative policy field committees which would include opposition representation same month his government introduced new legislation on conflicts of interest such that former cabinet ministers would have to wait one year before doing business with government or lobbying it on behalf of third parties up from six months it also created a similar cooling off period for senior bureaucrats which lasted six months however an order in council passed by stelmach s cabinet shortly before 2008 election delayed implementation of these rules until one month after election meaning that cabinet ministers who retired or lost their bids for re election would be exempt from new rules relationship with calgary critics of stelmach suggest that as a farmer from central part of province he is biased against calgary and urban alberta in general they pointed to fact that city which was considered heartland of jim dinning s support during leadership race had only three members ron liepert ron stevens and greg in his first eighteen member cabinet stelmach supporters pointed out that edmonton had only one minister dave hancock stelmach also found himself in a feud with calgary mayor dave bronconnier during his first year as premier as bronconnier accused stelmach of failing to keep a promise to city regarding infrastructure spending during his first budget several stelmach supporters suggested that mayor a liberal might be angling to take over as leader of official opposition if kevin taft fumbled during by election to fill ralph klein s calgary elbow seat p c candidate brian heninger went so far as to tell a voter he d like to choke his party s leader stelmach told media that this was sort of enthusiasm he wanted from his mlas heninger was defeated by liberal craig cheffins and in 2008 election calgary was only area of province in which stelmach lost seats on his way to an increased majority after deputy premier ron stevens resigned his calgary glenmore seat to accept a judgeship a 2009 by election elected outgoing wildrose alliance party wra leader paul hinman to replace him hinman had been wra s only mla until he lost his cardston taber warner to progressive conservative jacobs in 2008 election shortly after hinman s election polls showed that wildrose alliance under new leader danielle smith was second most popular party province wide and led conservatives 34 percent to 30 percent in calgary politics and public opinion critics at first compared stelmach to harry strom last social credit premier of province strom was regarded as honest but ineffective and lacking charisma he survived only long enough as premier to lose 1971 election soundly thus ended last long one party rule and observers asked if history would repeat with stelmach after stelmach s landslide win in 2008 election however comparisons largely ceased in late 2009 conservatives plunging popularity at polls and surge in support for right wing wildrose alliance led to speculation that stelmach would receive lukewarm support at his mandatory leadership review to be held at november 2009 progressive conservative convention klein s resignation came in wake of his receiving only 55 support at such a review and klein suggested that stelmach should resign if he received less than 70 question was whether party leaders would blame stelmach for party s decline and look for new leadership in face of stelmach s own weakening poll numbers instead stelmach met criterion set up by his critics and won 77 4 support a strong endorsement resignation on january 25 2011 stelmach announced that he would not seek re election he also promised a leadership race before next election alberta premier ed stelmach to step down globe and mail he did not specify his date of resignation at that time however he submitted his letter of resignation in june writing that he would leave office on october 1 in early hours of october 2 2011
