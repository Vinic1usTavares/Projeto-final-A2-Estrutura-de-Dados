190px thumb seventeenth amendment in national archives seventeenth amendment amendment xvii to united states constitution established popular election of united states senators by people of states amendment supersedes article i ss3 clauses 1 and 2 of constitution under which senators were elected by state legislatures it also alters procedure for filling vacancies in senate allowing for state legislatures to permit their governors to make temporary appointments until a special election can be held amendment was proposed by 62nd congress in 1912 and became part of constitution on april 8 1913 on ratification by three fourths 36 of state legislatures sitting senators were not affected by amendment s provisions until their existing terms expired so amendment took six years to fully implement transition began with two special elections in 1913 first in bioguide congress gov scripts pl index became first u s senator elected by popular vote following ratification of 17th amendment and second in maryland transition then began in earnest with november 1914 election and was complete on 4 march 1919 when senators chosen at november 1918 election took office text background original composition right thumb james wilson only member of constitutional convention who supported electing united states senate by popular vote originally under article i ss 3 clauses 1 and 2 of constitution each state legislature elected its state s senators for a six year term zywicki 1997 p 169 each state regardless of size is entitled to two senators as part of connecticut compromise between small and large states vile 2003 p 404 this contrasted with house of representatives a body elected by popular vote and was described as an uncontroversial decision at time james wilson was sole advocate of popularly electing senate but his proposal was defeated 10 1 zywicki 1994 p 1013 there were many advantages to original method of electing senators prior to constitution a federal body was one where states effectively formed nothing more than permanent treaties with citizens retaining their loyalty to their original state however under new constitution federal government was granted substantially more power than before having state legislatures elect senators reassured anti federalists that there would be some protection against federal government swallowing up of states and their powers riker 1955 p 452 and providing a check on power of federal government bybee 1997 p 516 additionally longer terms and avoidance of popular election turned senate into a body that could counter populism of house while representatives operated in a two year direct election cycle making them frequently accountable to their constituents senators could afford to take a more detached view of issues coming before congress bybee 1997 p 515 state legislatures retained theoretical right to instruct their senators to vote for or against proposals thus giving states both direct and indirect representation in federal government zywicki 1994 p 1019 senate was part of a formal bicameralism with members of senate and house responsible to completely distinct constituencies this helped defeat problem of federal government being subject to special interests zywicki 1997 p 176 members of constitutional convention considered senate to be parallel to british house of lords as an upper house containing better men of society but improved upon as they would be conscientiously chosen by upper houses of state republican legislatures for fixed terms and not merely inherited for life as in british system subject to a monarch s arbitrary expansion it was hoped that they would provide abler deliberation and greater stability than house of representatives due to senators status zywicki 1997 p 180 issues according to judge jay bybee of united states court of appeals for ninth circuit those in favor of popular elections for senators believed that two primary problems were caused by original provisions legislative corruption and electoral deadlocks bybee 1997 p 538 there was a sense that senatorial elections were bought and sold changing hands for favors and sums of money rather than because of competence of candidate between 1857 and 1900 senate investigated three elections over corruption in 1900 for example william a clark had his election voided after senate concluded that he had bought votes in montana legislature but analysts bybee and todd zywicki believe this concern was largely unfounded there was a dearth of hard information on subject bybee 1997 p 539 in more than a century of legislative elections of u s senators only ten cases were contested for allegations of impropriety zywicki 1994 p 1022 electoral deadlocks were another issue because state legislatures were charged with deciding whom to appoint as senators system relied on their ability to agree some states could not and thus delayed sending representatives to congress in a few cases system broke down to point where states completely lacked representation in senate bybee 1997 p 541 deadlocks started to become an issue in 1850s with a deadlocked indiana legislature allowing a senate seat to sit vacant for two years between 1891 and 1905 46 elections were deadlocked across 20 states in one extreme example a senate seat for delaware went unfilled from 1899 until 1903 bybee 1997 p 542 business of holding elections also caused great disruption in state legislatures with a full third of oregon house of representatives choosing not to swear oath of office in 1897 due to a dispute over an open senate seat result was that oregon s legislature was unable to pass legislation that year zywicki again argues that this was not a serious issue deadlocks were a problem but they were exception rather than norm many legislatures did not deadlock over elections at all most of those that did in 19th century were newly admitted western states which suffered from inexperienced legislatures and weak party discipline as western legislatures gained experience deadlocks became less frequent while utah suffered from deadlocks in 1897 and 1899 they became what zywicki refers to as a good teaching experience and utah never again failed to elect senators zywicki 1994 p 1024 another concern was that when deadlocks occurred state legislatures were unable to conduct their other normal business james christian ure writing in south texas law review notes that this did not in fact occur in a deadlock situation state legislatures would deal with matter by holding one vote at beginning of day then legislators would continue with their normal affairs ure 2007 p 286 eventually legislative elections held in a state s senate election years were perceived to have become so dominated by business of picking senators that state s choice for senator distracted electorate from all other pertinent issues bybee 1997 p 543 senator john h mitchell noted that senate became vital issue in all legislative campaigns with policy stances and qualifications of state legislative candidates ignored by voters who were more interested in indirect senate election to remedy this some state legislatures created advisory elections that served as de facto general elections allowing legislative campaigns to focus on local issues calls for reform thumb left william jennings bryan who campaigned for popular election of u s senators calls for a constitutional amendment regarding senate elections started in early 19th century with henry r storrs in 1826 proposing an amendment to provide for popular election similar amendments were introduced in 1829 and 1855 with most prominent proponent being andrew johnson who raised issue in 1868 and considered idea s merits so palpable that no additional explanation was necessary bybee 1997 p 536 in 1860s there was a major congressional dispute over issue with house and senate voting to veto appointment of john p stockton to senate due to his approval by a plurality of new jersey legislature rather than a majority in reaction congress passed a bill in july 1866 that required state legislatures to elect senators by an absolute majority by 1890s support for introduction of direct election for senate had substantially increased and reformers worked on two fronts on first front populist party incorporated direct election of senators into its omaha platform adopted in 1892 in 1908 oregon passed first law that based selection of u s senators on a popular vote oregon was soon followed by nebraska direct election of senators united states senate webpage origins and development institutional proponents for popular election noted that ten states already had non binding primaries for senate candidates bybee 1997 p 537 in which candidates would be voted on by public effectively serving as advisory referenda instructing state legislatures how to vote reformers campaigned for more states to introduce a similar method william randolph hearst opened a nationwide popular readership for direct election of u s senators in a 1906 series of articles using flamboyant language attacking treason of senate in his cosmopolitan magazine david graham philips one of yellow journalists whom president teddy roosevelt called described nelson aldrich of rhode island as principal traitor among scurvy lot in control of senate by theft perjury and bribes corrupting state legislatures to gain election to senate a few state legislatures began to petition congress for direct election of senators by 1893 house had two thirds vote for just such an amendment however when joint resolution reached senate it failed from neglect as it did again in 1900 1904 and 1908 each time house approved appropriate resolution and each time it died in senate macneil neil and richard a baker american senate an insider s history 2013 pp 22 23 on second national legislative front reformers worked toward a constitutional amendment which was strongly supported in house of representatives but initially opposed by senate bybee notes that state legislatures which would lose power if reforms went through were supportive of campaign by 1910 31 state legislatures had passed resolutions calling for a constitutional amendment allowing direct election and in same year ten republican senators who were opposed to reform were forced out of their seats acting as a wake up call to senate reformers included william jennings bryan while opponents counted respected figures such as elihu root and george frisbie hoar among their number root cared so strongly about issue that after passage of seventeenth amendment he refused to stand for re election to senate bryan and reformers argued for popular election through highlighting perceived flaws with existing system specifically corruption and electoral deadlocks and through arousing populist sentiment most important was populist argument that there was a need to awaken in senators a more acute sense of responsibility to people which it was felt they lacked election through state legislatures was seen as an anachronism that was out of step with wishes of american people and one that had led to senate becoming a sort of aristocratic body too far removed from people beyond their reach and with no special interest in their welfare bybee 1997 p 544 settlement of west and continuing absorption of hundreds of thousands of immigrants expanded sense of people hoar replied that people were both a less permanent and a less trusted body than state legislatures and that moving responsibility for election of senators to them would see it passing into hands of a body that lasted but a day before changing other were that renowned senators could not have been elected directly and that since a large number of senators had experience in house which was already directly elected a constitutional amendment would be pointless bybee 1997 p 545 reform was considered by opponents to threaten rights and independence of states who were sovereign entitled to have a separate branch of congress to which they could send their ambassadors this was countered by argument that a change in mode in which senators were elected would not change their responsibilities bybee 1997 p 546 senate freshman class of 1910 brought new hope to reformers fourteen of thirty newly elected senators had been elected through party primaries which amounted to popular choice in their states more than half of states had some form of primary selection for senate senate finally joined house to submit seventeenth amendment to states for ratification nearly ninety years after it first was presented to senate in 1826 macneil neil and richard a baker american senate an insider s history 2013 p 23 by 1912 239 political parties at both state and national level had pledged some form of direct election and 33 states had introduced use of direct primaries rossum 1999 p 708 twenty seven states had called for a constitutional convention on subject with 31 states needed to reach threshold arizona and new mexico each achieved statehood that year bringing total number of states to 48 and were expected to support motion alabama and wyoming already states had passed resolutions in favor of a convention without formally calling for one rossum 1999 p 710 proposal and ratification proposal in congress in 1911 house of representatives passed house joint resolution 39 proposing a constitutional amendment for direct election of senators original resolution passed by house contained following clause this so called race rider clause would have strengthened powers of states over senatorial elections and weakened those of congress by overriding congress s power to override state laws affecting manner of senatorial elections zachary clopton steven e art meaning of seventeenth amendment and a century of state defiance 107 northwestern university law review 1181 2013 pp 1191 1192 since turn of century most blacks in south and many poor whites had been disenfranchised by state legislatures passing constitutions with provisions that were discriminatory in practice this meant that their millions of population had no political representation most of south had one party states when resolution came before senate a substitute resolution one without rider was proposed by joseph l bristow of kansas it was adopted by a vote of 64 to 24 with 4 not voting nearly a year later house accepted change conference report that would become seventeenth amendment was approved by senate 42 to 36 on april 12 1912 and by house 238 to 39 with 110 not voting on may 13 1912 ratification by states thumb having been passed by congress amendment was sent to states for ratification and was

resolution adopted by legislature of state of alabama relative to ratifying seventeenth amendment to united states constitution volume 148 congressional record page permanent bound edition and page preliminary soft cover edition september 26 2002 retrieved may 10 2012 delaware july 1 2010 after rejecting amendment on march 18 1913 maryland april 1 2012 rhode island june 20 2014 utah legislature rejected amendment on february 26 1913 no action on amendment has been completed by florida at time article xvi section 19 of florida constitution provided that no convention nor legislature of this state shall act upon any amendment of constitution of united states proposed by congress to several states unless such convention or legislature shall have been elected after such amendment is submitted first legislature elected after such submission did not meet until april 5 1913 see fla const of 1885 art iii ss 2 by that time amendment had been ratified by 35 states and as noted above would be ratified by 36th state on april 8 1913 a circumstance which made any action by florida legislature unnecessary georgia kentucky mississippi south carolina virginia alaska or hawaii alaska and hawaii were not yet states at time of amendment s proposal and have never taken any official action to support or oppose amendment since achieving statehood effect seventeenth amendment altered process for electing united states senators and changed way vacancies would be filled originally constitution required state legislatures to fill senate vacancies seventeenth amendment had a dramatic impact on political composition of u s senate bybee 1997 p 552 before supreme court required one man one vote in reynolds v sims 1964 malapportionment of state legislatures was common for example rural counties and cities could be given equal weight in state legislatures enabling one rural vote to equal 200 city votes malapportioned state legislatures would have given republicans control of senate in 1916 senate elections with direct election each vote represented equally democrats retained control of senate bybee 1997 p 552 similarly he believes republican revolution of 1994 would not have happened instead democrats would have controlled 70 seats in senate to republicans 30 see bybee 1997 p 553 reputation of corrupt and arbitrary state legislatures continued to decline as senate joined house of representatives implementing popular reforms judge bybee has argued that amendment led to complete ignominy for state legislatures without buttress of a state based check on congress in decades following seventeenth amendment federal government was enabled to enact progressive measures bybee 1997 p 535 this was partially fueled by senators he wrote in northwestern university law review see bybee p 536 however argues that separation of state legislatures and senate had a beneficial effect on states as it lead state legislative campaigns to focus on local rather than national issues new deal legislation is another example of expanding federal regulation overruling state legislatures promoting their local state interests in coal oil corn and cotton rossum 1999 p 715 ure agrees saying that not only is each senator now free to ignore his state s interests senators have incentive to use their advice and consent powers to install supreme court justices who are inclined to increase federal power at expense of state sovereignty ure 2007 p 288 over first half of 20th century with a popularly elected senate confirming nominations both republican and democratic supreme court began to apply bill of rights to states overturning state laws whenever they harmed individual state citizens kochan 2003 p 1053 donald j kochan for an article in albany law review analyzed effect of seventeenth amendment on supreme court decisions over constitutionality of state legislation he found a statistically significant difference in number of cases holding state legislation unconstitutional before and after passage of seventeenth amendment with number of holdings of unconstitutionality increasing sixfold besides seventeenth amendment decline in influence of states also followed economic changes zywicki observes that interest groups of all kinds began to focus efforts on federal government as national issues could not be directed by influencing only a few state legislatures of with senators of most seniority chairing major committees he attributes rise in strength of interest groups partially to development of u s economy on an interstate national level see zywicki 1997 p 215 ure also argues that seventeenth amendment led to rise of special interest groups to fill void with citizens replacing state legislators as senate s electorate with citizens being less able to monitor actions of their senators senate became more susceptible to pressure from interest groups who in turn were more influential due to centralization of power in federal government an interest group no longer needed to lobby many state legislatures and could instead focus its efforts on federal government see ure 2007 p 293 filling vacancies seventeenth amendment says a state legislature may permit its governor to make temporary appointments which last until a special election is held to fill vacancy currently all but four states massachusetts oregon wisconsin and oklahoma permit such appointments constitution does not set out how temporary appointee is to be selected seventeenth amendment requires a governor to call a special election to fill vacancy vile 2010 p 197 first direct elections to senate oklahoma admitted to statehood in 1907 chose a senator by legislative election three times twice in 1907 when admitted and once in 1908 in 1912 oklahoma reelected robert owen by advisory popular vote oregon held primaries in 1908 in which parties would run candidates for that position and state legislature pledged to choose winner as new senator new mexico admitted to statehood in 1912 chose only its first two senators legislatively arizona admitted to statehood in 1912 chose its first two senators by advisory popular vote alaska and hawaii admitted to statehood in 1959 have never chosen a u s senator legislatively first direct elections to senate following seventeenth amendment being adopted were in maryland on november 4 1913 a class 1 special election due to a vacancy for a term ending in 1917 in alabama on may 11 1914 a class 3 special election due to a vacancy for a term ending in 1915 nationwide in 1914 all 32 class 3 senators term 1915 1921 nationwide in 1916 all 32 class 1 senators term 1917 1923 nationwide in 1918 all 32 class 2 senators term 1919 1925 court cases and interpretation controversies in trinsey v pennsylvania 1991 united states court of appeals for third circuit was faced with a situation where following death of senator john heinz of pennsylvania governor bob casey had provided for a replacement and for a special election that did not include a primary gold 1992 p 202 a voter and prospective candidate john s trinsey jr argued that lack of a primary violated seventeenth amendment and his right to vote under fourteenth amendment novakovic 1992 p 940 third circuit rejected these arguments ruling that seventeenth amendment does not require primaries novakovic 1992 p 945 another subject of analysis is whether statutes restricting authority of governors to appoint temporary replacements are constitutional vikram amar writing in hastings constitutional law quarterly claims that wyoming s requirement that its governor fill a senatorial vacancy by nominating a person of same party as person who vacated that senate seat violates seventeenth amendment amar 2008 p 728 this is based on text of seventeenth amendment which states that legislature of any state may empower executive thereof to make temporary appointments amendment only empowers legislature to delegate authority to governor and once that authority has been delegated does not permit legislature to intervene authority is to decide whether governor shall have power to appoint temporary senators not who governor may appoint amar 2008 pp 729 30 sanford levinson in his rebuttal to amar argues that rather than engaging in a textual interpretation those examining meaning of constitutional provisions should interpret them in fashion that provides most benefit and that legislatures being able to restrict gubernatorial appointment authority provides a substantial benefit to states levinson 2008 pp 718 9 reform and repeal efforts due to controversy over effects of seventeenth amendment advocates have emerged to reform or repeal amendment under president barack obama s administration in 2009 four sitting democratic senators left senate for executive branch positions barack obama president joe biden vice president hillary clinton secretary of state and ken salazar secretary of interior controversies developed about successor appointments made by illinois governor rod blagojevich and new york governor david paterson new interest was aroused in abolishing provision for senate appointment by governor accordingly senator russ feingold of wisconsin and representative david dreier of california proposed an amendment to remove this power senators john mccain and dick durbin became co sponsors as did representative john conyers tea party movement argued for repealing seventeenth amendment entirely claiming that it would protect states rights and reduce power of federal government on march 2 2016 utah legislature approved senate joint resolution no 2 asking congress to offer an amendment to united states constitution that would repeal seventeenth amendment references bibliography wendy j
