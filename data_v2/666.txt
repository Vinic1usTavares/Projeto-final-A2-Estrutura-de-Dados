themes of catching fire include survival sacrifice and conflict between interdependence and independence as reviewer margo dill noted in catching fire katniss and peeta are definitely interdependent they are both helping each other to survive as a matter of fact they want other one to survive more than they do themselves dill goes on to explain how this likely increases chances of each character dying government control is another important theme both within book and throughout entire trilogy after suppressing first rebellion capitol establishes rules in order to restrict and control citizens lives examples noted by dill include that 75th annual hunger games have new rules that cause katniss and peeta to be in danger once again more peacekeepers are placed in districts to diminish any hope that citizens started to have after last hunger games another major theme throughout trilogy is media and influence or power that popular culture has over emotions wishes and views of society other themes in book include morality obedience sacrifice redemption love and law publication history catching fire had a preliminary hardcover release date of september 8 2009 which was moved up to

recapping events from book one it doesn t disappoint when it segues into pulse pounding action readers have come to expect booklist commented on how unadorned prose provides an open window to perfect pacing and electrifying world building new york times also gave a positive review writing collins has done that rare thing she has written a sequel that improves upon first book as a reader i felt excited and even hopeful could it be that this series and its characters were actually going somewhere review also praised collins development of character of katniss plain dealer wrote very last sentence of catching fire will leave readers gasping not to mention primed for part three however not all reviews were positive same review from plain dealer expressed displeasure at how after 150 pages of romantic dithering i was tapping my foot to move on a review from entertainment weekly opined that book was weaker than first and wrote katniss pretends to be in love with her sweet natured games teammate peeta mellark but she secretly pines for brooding gale a childhood friend except why there s little distinction between two thinly imagined guys other than fact that peeta has a name collins conjures none of erotic energy that makes twilight for instance so creepily alluring in addition time magazine placed catching fire at number four on its list of top 100 fiction books of 2009
