influenced by multiple western action films including matrix music was co composed by motoi sakuraba and kohei tanaka reception of title was mixed with its gameplay receiving majority of praise gameplay right 225px thumb a battle in resonance of fate with bezel gauges system at bottom combat of resonance of fate employs tri attack battle system which involves a mixture of real time and turn based controls during each character s turn player can move around and perform actions limited by number of action points turn ends when player attacks or all action points are exhausted initiating an attack employs a charging system once a target is selected attack charges up until meter is full and attack is unleashed players can also choose to charge up attack multiple times for a more powerful attack time needed to charge depends on proximity of enemy closer enemies require less charge time but it renders player more vulnerable to attack enemies also require charge to attack and battle strategy involves interrupting their charges there are two damage types in game first is scratch damage which is only dealt by sub machine guns scratch damage accumulates quickly but cannot kill an opponent scratch damage must be converted into direct damage using pistols and grenades on an enemy with scratch damage to defeat it players are able to move around battlefield freely but they have option to create predefined paths for character to follow while moving along these paths characters gain access to hero actions which make them immune to damage and speed up charge times however use of these hero actions requires use of bezels these items are an essential element in battle and are recharged through a variety of methods such as destroying portions of an enemy s weapons and armor or killing an enemy characters using hero actions can attack while jumping in air and are also able to unleash special attacks which manifest as stylish firearm maneuvers enemies are only able to move while player s current character is moving and will usually attack only that character in addition to fueling hero actions bezels act as a safeguard to character defeat characters will not receive any direct damage as long as there is at least one bezel if there are enough bezels remaining receiving damage that would otherwise defeat character instead causes character to be knocked into air and bezel is shattered into shards that scatter across battlefield if player does not have any bezels remaining characters go into critical mode critical mode causes characters to become extremely scared leaving them unable to shoot quickly unable to use hero actions and taking direct damage from every attack four bezel shards must be collected by characters in order to restore a bezel and replenish their power and enemies can even pick up bezel shards to regenerate health and shields game ends if any character is killed and there are no intact bezels to protect them player may suspend and save game at any time upon completion of game player may start a new game plus which restarts game with certain features carried over and unlocks a harder mode with each successful completion of a new difficulty level further difficulty levels will become available in which enemy health and damage is multiplied there are ten difficulty settings in resonance of fate synopsis setting resonance of

her hand development development of resonance of fate took place over three years beginning around 2007 using codename project cobra game was developed by tri ace whose other notable games include valkyrie profile and star ocean series it was directed by takayuki suguro produced by mitsuhiro shimano and jun yoshino and programmed by yuichiro kitao and yoshiharu gotanda at start of development team decided upon key concepts a story focusing on world s fate a setting where human life was managed a limited number of characters a unified game area that was expansive while not being open world and a combat system that revolved around firearms during planning stages production time and costs were taken in account and all features were carefully planned and chosen so as little content as possible needed to be cut according to suguro game began development on xbox 360 because it was first major seventh generation console to be released and it was relatively easy to develop games on system it was ported to playstation 3 later in production a key element of gameplay is its focus on guns over swords and magic when deciding upon game s basics team wanted to create a cinematic feeling in battles if they had gone with a more traditional battle system then it would have quickly lost its cinematic quality due to prevalence of close combat likewise they wanted cinematic feel to persist throughout whole game rather than restricted to cutscenes a major challenge was to strike a balance between accessibility and difficulty when developing for a player base that might be made of up of both action game and rpg players this resulted in addition of strategy elements another wish was to create something new and fresh in rpg market when creating gameplay style team looked at action movies such as matrix and rebellion during their research despite its fast paced action game relies heavily upon strategic turn based gameplay during early development game was based on a real time system and meant for only one character to be controlled by player other two would have been handled by game s artificial intelligence ai after some testing they decided that this would create unwanted difficulties in gameplay such as characters dying off screen without player noticing or ai not directing them properly on designing battle system kitao said that his two main aims were creating something never before seen in an rpg and designing something accessible yet challenging adjustments to battle system went on all through development with some changes being made at very last minute gun customization system was originally a puzzle based system but was later converted to a diagram set up weapons were originally going to be represented in three dimensions but technical issues prevented this on whole development was a taxing one for him most difficult part about incorporating guns into system was creating a workable system that did not rely on first person and third person shooter mechanics two types of damage and various special moves in game were born from team s discussions about how three playable characters might be directed to work in unison dealing different types of attacks being able to attack while moving was inspired by a suggestion from staff members stemming from more traditional action games and scenes from hollywood action films for camera team decided to balance it between limited control during player turns and a more dynamic feel during attacks game was developed using an in house multi platform proprietary engine called aska tri ace superlative knowledge based architecture developed by a team led by gotanda engine was in development since 2005 and was used for three different games in tandem resonance of fate infinite and star ocean last hope while staff were satisfied with its performance it had to be customized for this game s specific needs engine employs multiple advanced graphics and lighting techniques including high dynamic range rendering and multiple layered shader tools to manage graphical layers and shadow effects motion blur effects were implemented using techniques similar to those of second generation cryengine creating realistic blurring during camera movement was complicated by graphical inconsistencies generated by aska s structure a separate graphics buffer system was designed to address issue environments and characters employ a relatively low number of polygons in order to free up resources to render main cast whose character models use at least four times as many polygons as models in playstation 2 era main characters faces use 40 bones for facial movement and their hair use 250 this enables more detailed facial expressions compared to doll like facial movements of earlier video game characters character hair uses additional shaders and layered textures to give it a lifelike appearance and behavior physics simulation was similar to that used for valkyrie profile 2 but improved and expanded to suit new hardware s capacity there were minor differences between graphical effects and performances of xbox 360 and playstation 3 titles shadow and blurring effects were more sophisticated on 360 estimated frame rate of 30fps was identical across both versions team managed to fit all game s content onto a single disc for both versions while keeping load times short this was due to staff not wanting players to know when they had reached halfway point prolonging sense of adventure scenario and design story and script were created by suguro and masaki norimoto and script was written by norimoto and yasushi otake for norimoto his primary challenge was taking story s themes conflicts between justice and evil nature of god and destiny which were fairly common in rpgs and put an original spin on them he did not want to create specific heroes and villains blurring lines between friend and foe and having each character following their own understandable agenda team decided upon a steampunk aesthetic over a science fiction setting as latter would necessitate an overly distant future setting it was also chosen as steampunk was a rarity in video games gun based gameplay likewise drove game to a more realistic setting zenith system was conceived as equivalent to a supercomputer from science fiction which ties into story elements surrounding zenith s control of humanity choice to make zenith an impartial machine stems from team not wanting an off screen third party force to distract player from main narrative writers decided to make zenith product of an earlier culture rather than a contemporary creation zenith system s influence over fate of its people gave rise to design motif of cogs creating a world of clockwork this motif of an inorganic force controlling humanity fits in with theme of human strength finding expression acting as a counterweight against zenith s influence overall design of basel mirrors its mechanical nature being grim and inorganic but dashes of color are present through references to city s religion to balance this out character and world designs were handled by art director kentaro kagami and artist and graphics designer masashi nakagawa leanne was first character to be envisioned before most of game s concepts had been finalized second was zephyr who was nicknamed boy of demonic possession third was vashyron who was dubbed ultimate gentleman while originally conceived as a glistening character he was reworked as a big brother figure which in turn led to scene where he and zephyr first fight rowen s early artwork depict his position as an authority figure looking down on world from zenith system according to kagami his character artwork was created in consultation with norimoto and suguro three main characters went through multiple design revisions while zephyr and vashyron were designed to reflect grim environment of basel leanne was meant to contrast against them zephyr was initially a lighter less antagonistic character due to him being younger than leanne unlike other characters vashyron s design went through a fairly smooth development process with his clothing remaining consistent through design phase leanne s clothing took a long time to finalize earlier versions of her were based on a concept of her being fashion conscious but this made her look odd next to other characters small cast was something decided upon at an early stage along with adjusting male characters to appear less feminine than others from japanese rpgs latter change was made with a western audience in mind audio music for resonance of fate was composed by motoi sakuraba and kohei tanaka sakuraba had done work on multiple titles for tri ace titles while tanaka s most notable recent work was on sakura wars series for sega their work began in 2009 two composers were asked to collaborate on resonance of fate by tri ace and sega respectively sakuraba was originally going to compose 41 tracks for game but during development number increased to 77 tanaka s contribution amounted to between 30 and 40 pieces sakuraba was told to make music in an old fashioned style with no clear leitmotifs while tanaka had great freedom one major directive was that their music tracks should contrast with each other sakuraba handled game s battle music with many of his tracks using a strong rock music element using synthesizers meant to emulate music from 1960s and 70s some of his pieces were deliberately outside his usual style using analog synthesizer and electric piano and recording resultant sound after it had been fed through leslie speakers he also worked against custom by improvising some pieces tanaka composed tracks for cutscenes town areas and title theme he was asked to focus on regal orchestra instrumentation his tracks were recorded with a group of studio musicians at hitomi memorial hall who were able to emulate impact of a full orchestra japanese voice recording for game began two years before its release in 2008 several voice actors had worked on other tri ace titles in past beyond merely being given directions for their performances actors were able to contribute to characters personalities many characters were revised based on suggestions given by their voice actors during recording cast enjoyed their experience as game gave them opportunity for a large range of performances from comedic to dramatic scenes overall production process for both actors and development staff was a positive one english voice recording began in august 2009 under supervision of sega recording took place at studios in los angeles and was overseen by shimano and suguro speaking about his view of three main actors shimano was impressed praising s range and expression for leanne and noting menville s performances as zephyr required fewer retakes than other actors release resonance of fate was first hinted at prior to april 2009 then announced as an untitled mystery rpg at beginning of month according to shimano its codename project cobra had been bandied about prior to reveal but no one had suspected anything about its true nature its official japanese title along with details such as tri ace s partnership with sega were unveiled on april 8 2009 resonance of fate marked first collaboration between tri ace and sega most of tri ace s previous games had been published by square enix reason for choice was two fold tri ace wanted a different publisher due to radical nature of their new game and sega wanted a title to break into rpg market as resonance of fate seemed unique enough to stand out in market sega agreed to take up publishing duties according to staff japanese title was originally going to be either resonance of fate or resonance of time but sega asked it to be changed to end of eternity this fell in line with a trend among many japanese games of referencing endings in their titles it was officially announced for a western release in may 2009 game debuted in japan on january 28 2010 with a march release in north america and pal regions european version came with text localization in english french german spanish and italian reception resonance of fate received mildly positive reviews according to video game review aggregator metacritic game launched in japan with 145 000 copies sold in first week across both platforms but dropped off media create s top 30 list within a month critics were most vocal in their praise of gameplay and battle system eurogamer called its innovative design one of most inspired approaches to role playing video game seen in a decade ign stated that battle system in resonance of fate is strong enough to hold everything together and added unique combat system steps up to be star of show gamespot noted that cinematography used during hero actions is so over top and exciting to watch that it makes battles a joy to take part in usgamer also lauded faster pace of combat system and its emphasis on teamwork to win battles but some reviewers noted that flow of combat in resonance of fate is initially confusing especially if you don t take optional tutorial game was runner up for rpgamer s best battle system award outside of battle system gamespot commented that world map s sparsely detailed overhead view gives impression of a board game and you need to employ a puzzle game mind set to effectively use your limited pieces to clear appropriate number of tiles it s an interesting way to open up new places to explore and it even ties in to combat critics also praised weapon customization system weapon upgrade system puts a unique spin on traditional standards although you do earn occasional new gun you spend more time enhancing your current firearm rpgamer gave game its most original award for presenting a gaming experience unlike any this past year including a unique battle system emphasizing tactical combat strategic way in which world map was opened up ability to modify almost every aspect of characters appearances and way that its story is told game was second runner up for rpgamer s best console rpg and most overlooked awards story on other hand received mixed reviews though some critics looked past these flaws gamespot wrote that story in resonance of fate is told in a drawn out stilted way that only reveals its agenda dozens of hours into your quest but what makes this story engaging even before your ultimate goal becomes clear is that characters are well developed and easy to relate to concluding that quirky story provides laughs and drama destructoid noted that resonance of fate builds its world mostly through inference and implication rather than exposition and added main plot being somewhat threadbare it never really ascends to kind of epic scale one would expect from genre rpgamer praised storytelling stating that it uses a futuristic sci fi setting as a backdrop to tell story of its main characters who are trying to survive in a futuristic world gone mad it chose game as runner up for its best script award for bringing characters to life and doing an amazing job with localization game was also runner up for rpgamer s best voice acting award critics were also divided about game s graphics and pacing destructoid stated that while detailed most environments alternate between concrete gray and brick red gamespot echoed criticism of lack of visual variety ign added that world map and dungeons are crying for more detail despite this destructoid allowed that colorful clothing helps offset game s otherwise limited palette ign disliked fact that large difficulty spikes are interjected every now and then and resonance of fate is built for those that enjoy grind in contrast gamespot reviewer liked this aspect of game you need to use every trick you have learned and a few you may not have even realized yet to tackle these treacherous monsters but there is nothing quite as sweet as toppling something that has tormented you for so long legacy an artbook titled end of eternity design works was released on june 11 2010 in japan published by enterbrain inc this 176 page artbook is divided in four chapters character enemy world view and
