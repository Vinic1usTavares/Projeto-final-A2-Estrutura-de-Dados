neary an electrical lineman in indiana who encounters and forms an obsession with unidentified flying objects steve mcqueen was spielberg s first choice although mcqueen was impressed with script he felt he was not right for role as he was unable to cry on cue dustin hoffman al pacino and gene hackman turned down part as well steven spielberg richard dreyfuss joe alves melinda dillon douglas trumbull making of close encounters of third kind 1997 columbia pictures jack nicholson turned it down because of scheduling conflicts spielberg explained when filming jaws dreyfuss talked me into casting him he listened to about 155 days worth of close encounters he even contributed ideas mcbride p 260 269 dreyfuss reflected i launched myself into a campaign to get part i would walk by steve s office and say stuff like al pacino has no sense of humor or jack nicholson is too crazy i eventually convinced him to cast me francois truffaut as claude lacombe a french government scientist in charge of ufo related activities in united states ufo expert jacques vallee served as real life model for lacombe jacques vallee dimensions 1988 page 269 gerard depardieu philippe jean louis and lino ventura were considered for role internationally renowned as a film director this was truffaut s only acting role in a film he did not direct as well as his only role in an english language film during filming truffaut used his free time to write script for man who loved women he also worked on a novel titled actor a project he abandoned mcbride p 280 289 teri garr as ronnie neary roy s wife amy irving also auditioned for role mcbride p 290 294 melinda dillon as jillian guiler teri garr wanted to portray jillian but was cast as ronnie hal ashby who worked with dillon on bound for glory 1976 suggested her for part to spielberg dillon was cast three days before filming began bob balaban as david laughlin lacombe s assistant and english french interpreter j patrick mcnamara as project leader warren as wild bill roberts blossom as farmer philip dodds as jean claude cary guffey as barry guiler jillian s son spielberg conducted a series of method acting techniques to help guffey who was cast when he was just three years old lance henriksen as robert merrill connally as team leader george as major benchley gene dynarski as ike josef sommer as larry butler carl weathers as military police production development film s origins can be traced to director steven spielberg s youth when he and his father watched a meteor shower in new jersey as a teenager spielberg completed full length science fiction film firelight many scenes from firelight would be incorporated in close encounters on a shot for shot basis mcbride p 14 68 in 1970 he wrote a short story entitled experiences about a lovers lane in a midwestern farming community and light show a group of teenagers see in night sky in late 1973 during post production on sugarland express spielberg developed a deal with columbia pictures for a science fiction film 20th century fox had previously turned down offer julia and michael phillips signed on as producers he first considered doing a documentary or a low budget feature film about people who believed in ufos spielberg decided a film that depended on state of art technology couldn t be made for 2 5 million mcbride p 227 229 borrowing a phrase from ending of thing from another world he retitled film watch skies rewriting premise concerning project blue book and pitching concept to willard huyck and gloria katz katz remembered it had flying saucers from outer space landing on robertson boulevard in west hollywood california i go steve that s worst idea i ever heard spielberg brought paul schrader to write script in december 1973 with principal photography to begin in late 1974 however spielberg started work on jaws in 1974 pushing watch skies back with financial and critical success of jaws spielberg earned a vast amount of creative control from columbia including right to make film any way he wanted schrader turned in his script which spielberg called one of most embarrassing screenplays ever professionally turned in to a major film studio or director and a terribly guilt ridden story not about ufos at all titled kingdom come script s protagonist was a 45 year old air force officer named paul van owen who worked with project blue book his job for government is to ridicule and debunk flying saucers schrader continued one day he has an encounter he goes to government threatening to blow lid off to public instead he and government spend 15 years trying to make contact spielberg and schrader experienced creative differences hiring john hill to rewrite at one point main character was a police officer spielberg found it hard to identify with men in uniform i wanted to have mr everyday regular fella spielberg rejected schrader hill script during post production on jaws reflecting that they wanted to make it like a james bond adventure david giler performed a rewrite hal barwood and matthew robbins friends of spielberg suggested plot device of a kidnapped child spielberg then began to write script song when you wish upon a star from pinocchio influenced spielberg s writing style i hung my story on mood song created way it affected me personally jerry belson and spielberg wrote shooting script together in end spielberg received solo writing credit during pre production title was changed from kingdom come to close encounters of third kind mcbride p 270 279 j allen hynek who worked with united states air force on project blue book was hired as a scientific consultant hynek felt that even though film is fiction it s based for most part on known facts of ufo mystery and it certainly catches flavor of phenomenon spielberg was under enormous pressure to make another blockbuster after jaws but he decided to make a ufo movie he put his career on line usaf and nasa declined to cooperate on film in fact nasa reportedly sent a twenty page letter to spielberg telling him that releasing film was dangerous http www ca viewtopic php t p in an interview he said i really found my faith when i heard that government was opposed to film if nasa took time to write me a 20 page letter then i knew there must be something happening http www com old site carter spielberg htm early in pre production spielberg hired film title designer dan perri to design a logotype for close encounters perri who had previously worked on exorcist 1973 and taxi driver 1976 produced a logotype in handel gothic typeface with only a script to work from delighted with result spielberg applied logo to all production stationery and crew shirts unusually in filmmaking spielberg carried enough influence to maintain creative control over film s entire branding and asked perri to design advertising campaign and title sequence for close encounters based on his logo perri later went on to design titles for a number of other major hollywood pictures including star wars 1977 raging bull 1980 and airplane 1980 filming thumb devils tower in wyoming was used as a filming location principal photography began on may 16 1976 though an associated press report in august 1975 had suggested filming would start in late 1975 spielberg did not want to do any location shooting because of his negative experience on jaws and wanted to shoot close encounters entirely on sound stages but eventually dropped idea filming took place in burbank california devils tower national monument in wyoming two abandoned world war ii airship hangars at former air force base in mobile alabama and louisville and nashville railroad depot in bay minette home where barry was abducted is located outside town of alabama roy neary s home is at

were filmed at small village of hal near 35 miles 56 km outside mumbai india close encounters of third kind making of steven spielberg s classic film ray morton 2007 applause books hangars in alabama were six times larger than biggest sound stage in world various technical and budgetary problems occurred during filming spielberg called close encounters twice as bad and twice as expensive as jaws matters worsened when columbia pictures experienced financial difficulties spielberg claimed film would cost 2 7 million to make in his original 1973 pitch to columbia although he revealed to producer julia philips that he knew budget would have to be much higher final budget came to 19 4 million columbia studio executive john remembered if we knew it was going to cost that much we wouldn t have greenlighted it because we didn t have money spielberg hired joe alves his collaborator on jaws as production designer in addition 1976 atlantic hurricane season brought tropical storms to alabama a large portion of sound stage in alabama was damaged because of a lightning strike columbia raised 7 million from three sources time inc emi and german tax shelters david 1982 2002 indecent exposure p 162 new york harpercollins cinematographer vilmos zsigmond said that during time of shooting for film spielberg got more ideas by watching movies every night which in turn extended production schedule because he was continually adding new scenes to be filmed zsigmond previously turned down chance to work on jaws in her 1991 book you ll never eat lunch in this town again producer julia phillips wrote highly profane remarks about spielberg zsigmond and truffaut because she was fired during post production due to a cocaine addiction phillips blamed it on spielberg being a perfectionist visual effects thumb visual effects miniature model on display at smithsonian s national air and space museum douglas trumbull was visual effects supervisor while carlo rambaldi designed aliens trumbull joked that visual effects budget at 3 3 million could have been used to produce an additional film his work helped lead to advances in motion control photography mother ship was designed by ralph mcquarrie and built by greg look of ship was inspired by an oil refinery spielberg saw at night in india instead of metallic hardware look used in star wars emphasis was on a more luminescent look for ufos one of ufo models was an oxygen mask with lights attached to it used because of its irregular shape as a subtle in joke dennis muren who had just finished working on star wars put a small r2 d2 model onto underside of mothership model of mothership is now on display in smithsonian institution s air and space museum udvar hazy annex at washington dulles airport in chantilly virginia since close encounters was filmed and visual effects sequences were shot on 70 mm film which has greater resolution than 35 mm film used for rest of production so that when miniature effects were combined with full sized elements through an optical printer effects footage would still appear clear and sharp despite having lost a generation s worth of visual data a test reel using computer generated imagery was created for ufos but spielberg found it would be too expensive and ineffective since cgi was in its infancy in mid 1970s small aliens in final scenes were played by fifty local six year old girls in mobile alabama that decision was requested by spielberg because he felt girls move more gracefully than boys puppetry was attempted for aliens but idea failed however rambaldi successfully used puppetry to depict two of aliens first being a marionette for tall alien that is first to be seen emerging from mothership in what was originally a test shot but eventually used in final film and an articulated puppet for alien that communicates via hand signals near end of film post production close encounters is first collaboration between film editor michael kahn and spielberg their working relationship has continued for rest of spielberg s films spielberg said that no film he has ever made since has been as hard to edit as last 25 minutes of close encounters and that he and kahn went through thousands of feet of footage to find right shots for end sequence when kahn and spielberg completed first cut of film spielberg was dissatisfied feeling there wasn t enough wow ness pick ups were commissioned but cinematographer vilmos zsigmond could not participate due to other commitments john a alonzo laszlo kovacs and douglas slocombe worked on pick ups lacombe was originally to find flight 19 hidden in amazon rainforest but idea was changed to sonoran desert spielberg also took 7 5 minutes out from preview music score for film was composed conducted and produced by john williams who had previously worked on spielberg s jaws williams wrote over 300 examples of iconic five tone motif for close encounters five tones are used by scientists to communicate with visiting spaceship as a mathematical language before spielberg chose one incorporated into film s signature theme spielberg called williams work when you wish upon a star meets science fiction incidentally williams briefly included song s signature melody in score at spielberg s behest just before roy neary turns to board mothership spielberg initially included cliff edwards original when you wish upon a star from pinocchio in closing credits but after a dallas preview where several members of audience audibly at inclusion song was dropped and replaced with williams orchestral version of it score was recorded at warner bros studios in burbank california williams was nominated for two academy awards in 1978 one for his score to star wars and one for his score to close encounters he won for star wars though he later won two grammy awards in 1979 for his close encounters score one for best original film score and one for best instrumental composition for theme from close encounters grammy award winners 1979 much like his two note jaws theme five tone motif for close encounters has since become ingrained in popular culture themes film critic charlene engel observed close encounters suggests that humankind has reached point where it is ready to enter community of cosmos while it is a computer which makes final musical conversation with alien guests possible characteristics bringing neary to make his way to devils tower have little to do with technical expertise or computer literacy these are virtues taught in schools that will be evolved in 21st century film also evokes typical science fiction archetypes and motifs film portrays new technologies as a natural and expected outcome of human development and indication of health and growth other critics found a variety of judeo christian analogies devils tower parallels mount sinai aliens as god and roy neary as moses cecil b demille s ten commandments is seen on television at neary household some found close relations between elijah and roy elijah was taken into a chariot of fire akin to roy going in ufo climbing devils tower behind faltering jillian neary exhorts jillian to keep moving and not to look back similar to lot s wife who looked back at sodom and turned into a pillar of salt spielberg explained i wanted to make close encounters a very accessible story about everyday individual who has a sighting that overturns his life and throws it into complete upheaval as he starts to become more and more obsessed with this experience roy s wife ronnie attempts to hide sunburn caused by roy s exposure to ufos and wants him to forget his encounter with them she is embarrassed and bewildered by what has happened to him and desperately wants her ordinary life back expression of his lost life is seen when he is sculpting a huge model of devils tower in his living room with his family deserting him roy s obsession with an idea implanted by an alien intelligence his construction of model and his gradual loss of contact with his wife mimic events in short story dulcie and decorum 1955 by damon knight close encounters also studies form of youth spiritual yearning barry guiler child who refers to ufos and their paraphernalia as toys although that was unscripted with child being drawn to smile by being shown toys offstage serves as a motif for childlike innocence and openness in face of unknown spielberg also compared theme of communication as highlighting that of tolerance if we can talk to aliens in close encounters of third kind he said why not with reds in cold war sleeping is final obstacle to overcome in ascent of devils tower roy jillian guiler and a third invitee larry butler climb mountain pursued by government helicopters spraying sleeping gas larry stops to rest is gassed and falls into a deep sleep in his interview with spielberg on inside actors studio james lipton suggested close encounters had another more personal theme for spielberg your father was a computer engineer your mother was a concert pianist and when spaceship lands they make music together on computer suggesting that roy neary s boarding spaceship is spielberg s wish to be reunited with his parents in a 2005 interview spielberg stated that he made close encounters when he did not have children and if he were making it today he would never have had neary leave his family and go on mother ship communication and language issues constitute additional themes as noted by andrew johnston in time out new york throughout film there are a number of scenes that anticipate themes spielberg would explore in subsequent projects but his execution of these ideas here is usually more interesting and subtle in amistad for example he devotes much time to illustrating language barrier separating africans from both their captors and their potential saviors it s an essential plot point but it s so that story gets bogged down in language problem is illustrated concisely by a quick scene in which an interpreter translates spanish into english for laughlin so he can turn around and translate it into french for lacombe since spielberg doesn t ram language problem down our throats aliens solution using music to communicate with humanity seems more elegant and natural release reception and box office film was originally to be released in summer 1977 but was pushed back to november because of various problems during production film premiered at ziegfeld theatre in new york city on november 16 1977 and played there and at cinerama dome in los

box office success grossing 116 39 million in north america and 171 7 million in foreign countries totaling 288 million worldwide it became columbia pictures most successful film at that time dvd production notes jonathan rosenbaum refers to film as best expression of spielberg s benign dreamy eyed vision a d murphy of variety gave a positive review but felt close encounters lacks warmth and humanity of george lucas star wars murphy found most of film slow paced but praised film s climax pauline kael called it a kid s film in best sense jean renoir compared spielberg s storytelling to jules verne and georges melies ray bradbury declared it greatest science fiction film ever made reissues and home media on final cut privilege spielberg was dissatisfied with film columbia pictures was experiencing financial problems and they were depending on this film to save their company i wanted to have another six months to finish off this film and release it in summer 1978 they told me they needed this film out immediately spielberg explained anyway close encounters was a huge financial success and i told them i wanted to make my own director s cut they agreed on condition that i show inside of mothership so they could have something to hang a reissue marketing campaign on i never should have shown inside of mother ship in 1979 columbia gave spielberg 1 5 million to produce what became special edition of film spielberg added seven minutes of new footage but also deleted or shortened various existing scenes by a total of ten minutes so that special edition was three

mothership close encounters of third kind special edition was released in august 1980 making a further 15 7 million accumulating a final 303 7 million box office gross roger ebert thought original

spielberg legacy shortly after film s release in late 1977 spielberg desired to do either a sequel or prequel before deciding against it he explained army s knowledge and ensuing cover up is so subterranean that it would take a creative screen story perhaps someone else making picture and giving it equal time it deserves when asked in 1990 to select a single master image that summed up his film career spielberg chose shot of barry opening his living room door to see blazing orange light from ufo that was beautiful but awful light just like fire coming through doorway barry s very small and it s a very large door and there s a lot of promise or danger outside that door in 2007 close encounters was deemed culturally historically or aesthetically significant by united states library of
