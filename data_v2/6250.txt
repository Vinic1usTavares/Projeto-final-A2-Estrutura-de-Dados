hastings line is a secondary railway line in kent and east sussex england linking with main town of and london via and although primarily carrying passengers railway serves a gypsum mine which is a source of freight traffic southeastern operates passenger trains on line and is one of their busiest lines railway was constructed by south eastern railway in early 1850s across difficult terrain of high weald supervision of building of line was lax enabling contractors to skimp on lining of tunnels these deficiencies showed up after railway had opened rectifications led to a restricted loading gauge along line requiring use of dedicated rolling stock served by steam locomotives from opening until late 1950s passenger services were then taken over by a fleet of diesel electric multiple units built to line s loading gauge diesel locomotives handled freight also built to fit loading gauge diesel electric multiple units served on line until 1986 when line was electrified and most severely affected tunnels were reduced from double track to single background south eastern railway ser completed its main line from london to dover kent in 1844 branching off rival london brighton and south coast railway s lbsc line at construction of a single line branch from modern spelling tonbridge to tunbridge wells a fashionable town where a chalybeate spring had been discovered in 1606 began in july 1844 at time parliament had not given assent for railway act of parliament enabling construction of line had its first reading in house of commons on 28april 1845 hansard website bill completed its passage through house of commons and house of lords on hansard website hansard websitehansard websitehansard website hansard website following which royal assent was granted on 31july by queen victoria engineer in charge of construction was peter w barlow and contractors were messrs hoof son in april 1845 ser decided that branch would be double track a tunnel was required after leaving tunbridge this was named somerhill tunnel after nearby mansion a mile and 54 chains 2 70 km after leaving somerhill tunnel a viaduct was required southborough viaduct stands high and has 26 arches a temporary station was built at tunbridge wells as wells tunnel was still under construction it was from tunbridge temporary station subsequently became a goods station first train comprising four locomotives and 26 carriages arrived at tunbridge wells on 19september trains from tunbridge had to reverse before starting climb to somerhill tunnel as there was no facing junction at tunbridge this situation was to remain until 1857 when a direct link was built at a cost of ps5 700 old link remained in use until 1913 ser was granted permission to build a line from ashford in kent to st leonards east sussex in 1845 lbsc reached st leonards from following year this gave lbsc a shorter route to than sers route then still under construction ser sought permission to extend their branch from tunbridge wells across high weald to reach hastings authorisation for construction of a line to hastings was obtained on 18june 1846 parliament deemed line between ashford and st leonards to be of military strategic importance therefore they stipulated that this line was to be completed before any extension was built from tunbridge wells extension into tunbridge wells opened on 25november 1846 without any public ceremony in 1847 ser unsuccessfully challenged condition that line between ashford and st leonards be completed first that line was opened in 1851 passing through hastings and making an end on junction with lbsc line from lewes construction hastings line is built over difficult forested and hilly terrain across high weald and sandstone hastings beds necessitating construction of eight tunnels between tonbridge and south coast seaside resort of hastings ser was anxious to construct line as economically as possible since it was in competition with lbsc to obtain entry into hastings and was not in a strong financial position in mid 1840s construction of line between tunbridge wells and robertsbridge was contracted to messrs hoof subcontracted to messrs h warden by march 1851 trackbed had been constructed as far as whatlington east sussex a distance of all tunnels had been completed and a single line of railway had been laid for a distance of from tunbridge wells when section from tunbridge wells to robertsbridge opened on 1september a single line of track extended a further to whatlington on section between whatlington and st leonards out of had been excavated construction of line between tunbridge wells and bopeep junction cost in excess of ps500 000 deficiencies in construction of tunnels supervision of construction was lax which enabled contractors to skimp on lining of tunnels this manifested itself in march 1855 when part of brickwork of mountfield tunnel collapsed an inspection of grove hill strawberry hill and wells tunnels revealed that they too had been constructed with too few layers of bricks grove hill tunnel had been built with just a single ring of bricks and no filling above crown of brickwork ser took contractors to court and were awarded ps3 500 in damages however rectifying situation cost company ps4 700 although contractors had charged for six rings of bricks they had only used four due to cost of tunnels this had to be rectified by addition of a further two rings of brickwork reducing width of tunnels by result of this was that loading gauge on line was restricted and special rolling stock had to be built later becoming known as restriction 0 rolling stock this problem would affect line until 1986 wadhurst tunnel collapsed in 1862 and it was discovered by ser that same situation existed there too rectification cost ps10 231 by 1877 only one train was permitted in bopeep tunnel at a time tunnel was partly widened in 1934 35 in november 1949 serious defects were discovered in tunnel single line working was put in place on 19november but tunnel had to be closed completely a week later tunnel was partially relined with cast iron segments it reopened to traffic on 1950 mountfield tunnel was underpinned in 1938 39 remaining open with single line working in operation it partially collapsed on 17november 1974 resulting in single line working until 31january 1975 line was then closed until 17march whilst track was singled through tunnel openings line was opened by ser in three main stages tunbridge tunbridge wells tunbridge wells robertsbridge and robertsbridge bopeep junction a temporary station was opened at tunbridge wells on 19september 1845 while wells tunnel was completed temporary station later became goods depot tunbridge wells later tunbridge wells central

locomotives built in 1941 to hastings line loading gauge electrification of hastings line was first considered by ser as early as 1903 lack of finance meant that no decision had been made by time world war i broke out in 1914 it was stated in 1921 that electrification was a long term aim in mid 1930s southern railway which had been formed from ser lbsc london and south western railway lswr and london chatham and dover railway lcdr in 1923 under railways act 1921 electrified a number of lines east coastway line was electrified in 1935 with a depot being built at ore east sussex in 1937 it was proposed to electrify line between and st leonards warrior square at a cost of ps1 500 000 scheme was deferred with another proposal in 1937 costing ps1 300 000 also failing to gain favour before world war ii broke out one of main reasons that electrification was not given go ahead was fact that non standard rolling stock would be required southern railway had provided line with 104 new carriages and six pullman cars between 1929 and 1934 two electric locomotives were ordered in 1937 they were built to hastings line loading gauge in october 1946 southern railway announced a programme to electrify all lines in kent and east sussex in three stages hastings line between tonbridge and bopeep junction was to be part of third stage track would have been slewed within affected tunnels with only one train normally allowed in tunnel in an emergency two trains would be allowed in tunnel at same time but restricted to standard wide stock would be used following nationalisation of railways in united kingdom under transport act 1947 southern region of british railways shelved new electrification schemes concentrating on construction of new steam locomotives in 1952 possibility of operating standard rolling stock on line had been examined operating department objected to use of single line sections through various tunnels 1930s stock was refurbished with aim of extending its service by a further ten years first two phases of southern railways electrification scheme were revived in 1955 this did not include hastings line and it was announced in 1956 that a fleet of diesel electric trains would be constructed to operate service until line was electrified at that time rolling stock built in 1930s was overdue for replacement modernisation to hastings line and introduction of diesel electric trains cost 000 of which 000 was cost of first seven trains a further thirteen trains cost ps1 178 840 electrification was finally carried out in 1980s as detailed below operators from 1845 line was operated by ser in 1899 ser and lcdr entered into a joint working partnership south eastern and chatham railway secr on 1 january 1923 railways act 1921 came into force resulting in grouping secr became part of southern railway sr on 1 january 1948 transport act 1947 came into force and sr became part of british railways with former sr lines becoming southern region british

took 105 minutes with opening of extension to robertsbridge there were three trains a day with two on sundays these were augmented by an additional train daily when extension to bopeep junction opened in 1860 there were seven up trains and six down trains daily hastings to london via taking two hours from 1861 cudworth 2 2 2 little mail class locomotives were introduced in 1876 sub wealden gypsum co built a long line from a junction south of mountfield tunnel to a gypsum mine located in great wood mountfield this line was still in operation as of 2007 bogie carriages entered service on line in 1880 in 1890 winter service was eleven trains each way of which five were fast an additional two trains daily operated between tunbridge wells and wadhurst by 1910 this had increased to twenty trains each way of which twelve were fast plus extra two wadhurst services four trains ran on sundays service was reduced during world war i but sunday services had increased to seven by 1922 by 1930s line was worked by l and l1 class 4 4 0 locomotives schools class 4 4 0s were introduced in 1930 width of these was measured across cab and measured across cylinders service was again reduced during world war ii with fourteen trains daily in 1942 of which four were fast there were seven trains on sundays as built it was envisaged that west country and battle of britain class locomotives would be able to work line forty eight locomotives of west country and 22 of battle of britain class were built with cabs that were wide and paired with tenders of same width it was subsequently decided not to work these locomotives over line locomotives from these two classes that were rebuilt gained a cab unrebuilt locomotives retained their narrow cab by 1948 service was sixteen trains of which seven were fast an additional three trains ran as far as wadhurst in 1957 service was eighteen trains daily of which nine were fast there were nine trains on sundays schools class locomotives worked line until 1957 when steam was withdrawn on hastings line diesel electric multiple units of what became british rail class 201 202 and 203 hastings diesels took over working route under british railways classes

narrow rolling stock they were delivered in six car formations including a buffet car and two units were often operated in multiple to form twelve car trains in latter years some of units were reduced to five and later still to four cars 6s units were intended to be introduced into service in june 1957 on 5april a fire at cannon street signal box disabled all signalling equipment there as a result locomotive hauled trains were banned from station a temporary signal box was commissioned on 5may and 6s units were introduced on peak services next day two units coupled together formed 06 58 and 07

service by 1988 and increasing cost of maintaining then ageing hastings diesels scheme was to cost ps23 925 000 electrification was finally completed in 1986 line was electrified using 750 v dc third rail using standard rolling stock and expedient of singling track through narrow tunnels tunnels either side of tunbridge wells central station were not singled because fact that south portal of wells tunnel and north portal of grove hill tunnel were at ends of platforms meant it was impossible to install pointwork without reducing length of platform available a speed restriction was imposed through wells tunnel parliamentary powers were sought in 1979 to bore a second grove hill tunnel but there was much opposition from local residents this and high cost caused proposal to be abandoned track in grove hill tunnel was relaid on a concrete base allowing alignment to be precisely controlled line was declared to conform to standard c1 loading gauge on 14 march first passenger carrying

times with speed restrictions in place following repairs train service was replaced by buses during closures southeastern was criticised by hastings and rye mp amber rudd over poor customer service during this period by 12 march section between wadhurst and robertsbridge had reopened with full service being restored on 31 march notes information for this route map of hastings line was compiled from various sources modern spelling of tonbridge was not adopted as official spelling until 1870 a gradient of 1 in 47 means that line climbs or descends by 1 foot in 47 feet or 1 metre in 47 metres horizontal distance this was route of line during time that tunbridge wells central goods served as a passenger station line between tunbridge and orpington did not open until 1may 1868 was reached by
