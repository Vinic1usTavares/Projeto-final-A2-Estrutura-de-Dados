dream on and rivalled grandeur of madonna tribute episode power of madonna cnn s lisa respers france deemed theatricality even better than madonna episode calling it perfect over top homage to an artist who is pretty over top herself and writing that glee just keeps getting better and better eric goldman of ign rated episode 8 3 10 for impressive and felt that there was a lot to enjoy with some very fun material mixed in with one of heaviest scenes glee has delved into bobby hankinson of houston chronicle called episode pretty great also praising o malley s acting and noting i was impressed with how visceral confrontation between kurt s dad and finn got and how writers kept language as raw as emotions a v club emily vanderwerff graded episode b she called rachel and shelby storyline very well handled another emotional story that series is mostly nailing execution of and opined chris colfer and mike o malley always good together brought out best in cory monteith who sometimes struggles with weightier stuff overall vanderwerff felt that theatricality was not as good as preceding episode but contained some well executed moments and many funny lines james poniewozik of time was pleasantly surprised by episode praising kurt finn and rachel shelby storylines however he found tina quinn and puck subplots ridiculous and jarett wieselman of new york post enjoyed episode but observed every time they write a scene where burt stands up for kurt it diminishes impact it s only first season and we ve already had a handful of these increasingly identical scenes henrik batallones of buddytv felt that theatricality was a pretty strong albeit not perfect episode deeming o malley star of show batallones criticized rachel and shelby storyline however suggesting that it was rushed and would have been better stretched out across remainder of season mary hanrahan of broadway world also felt that rachel and shelby plot was rushed calling it sloppily handled she criticized performance of bad romance additionally noting that poker face did not work in context of a mother daughter duet hanrahan commented that she was tired of themed episodes of glee concluding that episode fails on a lot of levels and has actually made episodes preceding it look better as a result kevin coll of fused film criticized selection of poker face noting that it was well done but badly matched with scene and storyline references external links theatricality at fox com theatricality at tv com category 2010 american television episodes category glee season 1 episodes category
