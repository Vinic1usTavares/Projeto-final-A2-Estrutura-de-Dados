hippocampus from greek seahorse is a major component of brain of humans and other vertebrates humans and other mammals have two hippocampi one in each side of brain hippocampus is part of limbic system and plays important roles in consolidation of information from short term memory to long term memory and in spatial memory that enables navigation hippocampus is located under cerebral cortex in allocortex and in primates it is in medial temporal lobe it contains two main interlocking parts hippocampus proper also called ammon s horn pearce 2001 and dentate gyrus in alzheimer s disease and other forms of dementia hippocampus is one of first regions of brain to suffer damage short term memory loss and disorientation are included among early symptoms damage to hippocampus can also result from oxygen starvation hypoxia encephalitis or medial temporal lobe epilepsy people with extensive bilateral hippocampal damage may experience anterograde amnesia inability to form and retain new memories since different neuronal cell types are neatly organized into layers in hippocampus it has frequently been used as a model system for studying neurophysiology form of neural plasticity known as long term potentiation ltp was initially discovered to occur in hippocampus and has often been studied in this structure ltp is widely believed to be one of main neural mechanisms by which memories are stored in brain in rodents as model organisms hippocampus has been studied extensively as part of a brain system responsible for spatial memory and navigation many neurons in rat and mouse hippocampus respond as place cells that is they fire bursts of action potentials when animal passes through a specific part of its environment hippocampal place cells interact extensively with head direction cells whose activity acts as an inertial compass and with grid cells in neighboring entorhinal cortex history of name thumb right image 1 human hippocampus and fornix left compared with a seahorse right preparation by laszlo in 1980 earliest description of ridge running along floor of temporal horn of lateral ventricle came from venetian anatomist julius caesar 1587 who likened it first to a silkworm and then to a seahorse latin hippocampus from greek horse and sea monster german anatomist duvernoy 1729 first to illustrate structure also wavered between seahorse and silkworm in 1732 term ram s horn was proposed by danish anatomist jacob winslow in 1742 surgeon de used cornu ammonis horn of ancient egyptian god amun duvernoy 2005 who was often represented as having a ram s head this has survived in abbreviated form as ca in naming subfields of hippocampus in 1672 another reference appeared with term pes hippocampi which may date back to introducing a comparison with shape of folded back forelimbs and webbed feet of mythological hippocampus a sea monster with a horse s forequarters and a fish s tail hippocampus was then described as pes hippocampi major with an adjacent bulge in occipital horn described as pes hippocampi minor and later renamed as calcar avis renaming of hippocampus as hippocampus major and calcar avis as hippocampus minor has been attributed to felix d systematising nomenclature of parts of brain in 1786 in 1779 mayer mistakenly used term hippopotamus and was followed by some other authors until karl friedrich resolved this error in 1829 in 1861 hippocampus minor became centre of a dispute over human evolution between thomas henry huxley and richard owen satirised as great hippocampus question term hippocampus minor fell from use in anatomy textbooks and was officially removed in nomina anatomica of 1895 gross 1993 today structure is just called hippocampus with term cornu ammonis surviving in names of hippocampal subfields ca1 ca4 wechsler 2004 relation to limbic system term limbic system was introduced in 1952 by paul maclean to describe set of structures that line edge of cortex latin limbus meaning border these include hippocampus cingulate cortex olfactory cortex and amygdala paul maclean later suggested that limbic structures comprise neural basis of emotion hippocampus is anatomically connected to parts of brain that are involved with emotional behavior septum hypothalamic mammillary body and anterior nuclear complex in thalamus and is generally accepted to be part of limbic system anatomy thumb right frame 260px image 2 cross section of cerebral hemisphere showing structure and location of hippocampus thumb 250px image 3 coronal section of brain of a macaque monkey showing hippocampus circled hippocampus can be seen as a ridge of gray matter tissue elevating from floor of each lateral ventricle in region of inferior or temporal horn this ridge can also be seen as an inward fold of into medial temporal lobe hippocampus can only be seen in dissections as it is concealed by parahippocampal gyrus amaral and 2006 cortex thins from six layers to three or four layers that make up hippocampus term hippocampal formation is used to refer to hippocampus proper and its related parts however there is no consensus as to what parts are included sometimes hippocampus is said to include dentate gyrus and subiculum some references include dentate gyrus and subiculum in hippocampal formation and others also include and entorhinal cortex neural layout and pathways within hippocampal formation are very similar in all mammals hippocampus including dentate gyrus has shape of a curved tube which has been compared to a seahorse and a ram s horn cornu ammonis its abbreviation ca is used in naming hippocampal subfields ca1 ca2 ca3 and ca4 it can be distinguished as an area where cortex narrows into a single layer of densely packed pyramidal neurons which curl into a tight u shape one edge of u ca4 is embedded into backward facing flexed dentate gyrus hippocampus is described as having an anterior and posterior part in primates or a ventral and dorsal part in other animals both parts are of similar composition but belong to different neural circuits moser and moser 1998 in rat two hippocampi resemble a pair of bananas joined at stems by commissure of fornix also called hippocampal commissure in primates part of hippocampus at bottom near base of temporal lobe is much broader than part at top this means that in cross section hippocampus can show a number of different shapes depending on angle and location of cut in a cross section of hippocampus including dentate gyrus several layers will be shown dentate gyrus has three layers of cells or four if hilus is included layers are from outer in molecular layer inner molecular layer granular layer and hilus ca3 in hippocampus proper has following cell layers known as strata lucidum pyramidal and oriens ca2 and ca1 also have four each of these layers and not lucidum stratum input to hippocampus from varying cortical and subcortical structures comes from entorhinal cortex via perforant path entorhinal cortex ec is strongly and reciprocally connected with many cortical and subcortical structures as well as with brainstem different thalamic nuclei from anterior and midline groups medial septal nucleus nucleus of hypothalamus and raphe nuclei and locus coeruleus of brainstem all send axons to ec so that it serves as interface between neocortex and other connections and hippocampus ec is located in parahippocampal gyrus a cortical region adjacent to hippocampus this gyrus conceals hippocampus parahippocampal gyrus also includes cortex which plays an important role in visual recognition of complex objects there is also substantial evidence that it makes a contribution to memory which can be distinguished from contribution of hippocampus it is apparent that complete amnesia occurs only when both hippocampus and are damaged eichenbaum et al 2007 circuitry thumb 300px right image 4 basic circuit of hippocampus as drawn by cajal dg dentate gyrus sub subiculum ec entorhinal cortex major input to hippocampus is through entorhinal cortex ec whereas its major output is via ca1 to subiculum kandel 2012 information reaches ca1 via two main pathways direct and indirect axons from ec which originate in layer iii are origin of direct perforant pathway and form synapses on very distal apical dendrites of ca1 neurons conversely axons originating from layer ii are origin of indirect pathway and information reaches ca1 via trisynaptic circuit in initial part of this pathway axons project through perforant pathway to granule cells of dentate gyrus first synapse from then information follows via mossy fibres to ca3 second synapse from there ca3 axons called schaffer collaterals leave deep part of cell body and loop up to apical dendrites and then extend to ca1 third synapse axons from ca1 then project back to entorhinal cortex completing circuit basket cells in ca3 receive excitatory input from pyramidal cells and then give an inhibitory feedback to pyramidal cells this recurrent inhibition is a simple feedback circuit that can dampen excitatory responses in hippocampus pyramidal cells gives a recurrent excitation which is an important mechanism found in some memory processing several other connections play important roles in hippocampal function beyond output to ec additional output pathways go to other cortical areas including prefrontal cortex a major output goes via fornix to lateral septal area and to mammillary body of hypothalamus which fornix with hippocampus hippocampus receives input from serotonin norepinephrine and dopamine systems and from nucleus of thalamus to field ca1 a very important projection comes from medial septal nucleus which sends cholinergic and gamma amino butyric acid gaba stimulating fibers gabaergic fibers to all parts of hippocampus inputs from medial septal nucleus play a key role in controlling physiological state of hippocampus destruction of this nucleus abolishes hippocampal theta rhythm and severely impairs certain types of memory winson 1978 regions thumb 260px image 5 hippocampal location and regions areas of hippocampus are shown to be functionally and anatomically distinct dorsal hippocampus dh ventral hippocampus vh and intermediate hippocampus serve different functions project with differing pathways and have varying degrees of place cells 2010 dorsal hippocampus serves for spatial memory verbal memory and learning of conceptual information using radial arm maze lesions in dh were shown to cause spatial memory impairment while vh lesions did not its projecting pathways include medial septal nucleus and nucleus et al 2004 dorsal hippocampus also has more place cells than both ventral and intermediate hippocampal regions jung et al 1994 intermediate hippocampus has overlapping characteristics with both ventral and dorsal hippocampus using anterograde tracing methods cenquizca and swanson 2007 located moderate projections to two primary olfactory cortical areas and areas of medial prefrontal cortex this region has smallest number of place cells ventral hippocampus functions in fear conditioning and affective processes cenquizca et al 2007 anagnostaras et al 2002 showed that alterations to ventral hippocampus reduced amount of information sent to amygdala by dorsal and ventral hippocampus consequently altering fear conditioning in rats anagnostaras et al 2002 historically earliest widely held hypothesis was that hippocampus is involved in olfaction this idea was cast into doubt by a series of anatomical studies that did not find any direct projections to hippocampus from olfactory bulb finger p 183 however later work did confirm that olfactory bulb does project into ventral part of lateral entorhinal cortex and field ca1 in ventral hippocampus sends axons to main olfactory bulb anterior olfactory nucleus and to primary olfactory cortex there continues to be some interest in hippocampal olfactory responses in particular role of hippocampus in memory for odors but few specialists today believe that olfaction is its primary function eichenbaum et al 2001 function theories of hippocampal functions over years three main ideas of hippocampal function have dominated literature response inhibition episodic memory and spatial cognition behavioral inhibition theory caricatured by john o keefe and lynn nadel as slam on brakes nadel et al 1975 was very popular up to 1960s it derived much of its justification from two observations first that animals with hippocampal damage tend to be hyperactive second that animals with hippocampal damage often have difficulty learning to inhibit responses that they have previously been taught especially if response requires remaining quiet as in a passive avoidance test jeffrey gray developed this line of thought into a full fledged theory of role of hippocampus in anxiety gray and mcnaughton 2000 inhibition theory is currently least popular of three best white 1999 second major line of thought relates hippocampus to memory although it had historical precursors this idea derived its main impetus from a famous report by william beecher scoville and brenda and milner 1957 describing results of surgical destruction of hippocampi in an attempt to relieve epileptic seizures in henry molaison new york times 12 06 2008 known until his death in 2008 as patient h m unexpected outcome of surgery was severe anterograde and partial retrograde amnesia molaison was unable to form new episodic memories after his surgery and could not remember any events that occurred just before his surgery but he did retain memories of events that occurred many years earlier extending back into his childhood this case attracted such widespread professional interest that molaison became most intensively studied subject in medical history squire 2009 in ensuing years other patients with similar levels of hippocampal damage and amnesia caused by accident or disease have also been studied and thousands of experiments have studied physiology of activity driven changes in synaptic connections in hippocampus there is now universal agreement that hippocampi play some sort of important role in memory however precise nature of this role remains widely debated squire and cohen 1993 thumb 314x314px rats and cognitive maps third important theory of hippocampal function relates hippocampus to space spatial theory was originally championed by o keefe and nadel who were influenced by e c tolman s theories about cognitive maps in humans and animals o keefe and his student dostrovsky in 1971 discovered neurons in rat hippocampus that appeared to them to show activity related to rat s location within its environment o keefe and dostrovsky 1971 despite skepticism from other investigators o keefe and his co workers especially lynn nadel continued to investigate this question in a line of work that eventually led to their very influential 1978 book hippocampus as a cognitive map o keefe and nadel 1978 there is now almost universal agreement that hippocampal function plays an important role in spatial coding but details are widely debated moser et al 2008 later research has focused on trying to bridge disconnect between two main views of hippocampal function as being split between memory and spatial cognition in some studies these areas have been expanded to point of near convergence in an attempt to reconcile two disparate views it is suggested that a broader view of hippocampal function is taken and seen to have a role that encompasses both organisation of experience mental mapping as per tolman s original concept in 1948 and directional behaviour seen as being involved in all areas of cognition so that function of hippocampus can be viewed as a broader system that incorporates both memory and spatial perspectives in its role that involves use of a wide scope of cognitive maps this relates to purposive behaviorism born of tolman s original goal of identifying complex cognitive mechanisms and purposes that guided behaviour it has also been proposed that spiking activity of hippocampal neurons is associated spatially and it was suggested that mechanisms of memory and planning both evolved from mechanisms of navigation and that their neuronal algorithms were basically same many studies have made use of neuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri and a functional role in approach avoidance conflict has been noted anterior hippocampus is seen to be involved in decision making under approach avoidance conflict processing it is suggested that memory spatial cognition and conflict processing functions may be seen as working together and not mutually exclusive role in memory psychologists and neuroscientists generally agree that hippocampus plays an important role in formation of new memories about experienced events episodic or autobiographical memory squire and schacter 2002 part of this function is hippocampal involvement in detection of new events places and stimuli et al 2008 some researchers regard hippocampus as part of a larger medial temporal lobe memory system responsible for general declarative memory memories that can be explicitly these would include for example memory for facts in addition to episodic memory hippocampus also encodes emotional context from amygdala this is partly why returning to a location where an emotional event occurred may evoke that emotion there is a deep emotional connection between episodic memories and places due to bilateral symmetry brain has a hippocampus in each cerebral hemisphere if damage to hippocampus occurs in only one hemisphere leaving structure intact in other hemisphere brain can retain near normal memory functioning severe damage to hippocampi in both hemispheres results in profound difficulties in forming new memories anterograde amnesia and often also affects memories formed before damage occurred retrograde amnesia although retrograde effect normally extends many years back before brain damage in some cases older memories remain this retention of older memories leads to idea that consolidation over time involves transfer of memories out of hippocampus to other parts of brain squire and schacter 2002 ch 1 experiments using transplantation of hippocampal cells in primates with neurotoxic lesions of hippocampus have shown that hippocampus is required for formation and recall but not storage of memories damage to hippocampus does not affect some types of memory such as ability to learn new skills playing a musical instrument or solving certain types of puzzles for example this fact suggests that such abilities depend on different types of memory procedural memory and different brain regions furthermore amnesic patients frequently show implicit memory for experiences even in absence of conscious knowledge for example patients asked to guess which of two faces they have seen most recently may give correct answer most of time in spite of stating that they have never seen either of faces before some researchers distinguish between conscious recollection which depends on hippocampus and familiarity which depends on portions of medial temporal lobe diana et al 2007 when rats are exposed to an intense learning event they may retain a life long memory of event even after a single training session memory of such an event appears to be first stored in hippocampus but this storage is transient much of long term storage of memory seems to take place in anterior cingulate cortex frankland pw bontempi b talton le l silva aj involvement of anterior cingulate cortex in remote

place cells recorded from ca1 layer of a rat rat ran back and forth along an elevated track stopping at each end to eat a small food reward dots indicate positions where action potentials were recorded with color indicating which neuron emitted that action potential studies on freely moving rats and mice have shown many hippocampal neurons to act as place cells that cluster in place fields and these fire bursts of action potentials when animal passes through a particular location this place related neural activity in hippocampus has also been reported in monkeys that were moved around a room whilst in a restraint chair matsumura et al 1999 however place cells may have fired in relation to where monkey was looking rather than to its actual location in room rolls and xiang 2006 over many years many studies have been carried out on place responses in rodents that have given a large amount of information place cell responses are shown by pyramidal cells in hippocampus and by granule cells in dentate gyrus other cells in smaller proportion are inhibitory interneurons and these often show place related variations in their firing rate which are much weaker there is little if any spatial topography in representation in general cells lying next to each other in hippocampus have uncorrelated spatial firing patterns place cells are typically almost silent when a rat is moving around outside place field but reach sustained rates as high as 40 hz when rat is near center neural activity sampled from 30 to 40 randomly chosen place cells carries enough information to allow a rat s location to be reconstructed with high confidence size of place fields varies in a gradient along length of hippocampus with cells at dorsal end showing smallest fields cells near center showing larger fields and cells at ventral tip showing fields that cover entire environment in some cases firing rate of hippocampal cells depends not only on place but also on direction a rat is moving destination toward which it is traveling or other task related variables smith and mizumori 2006 firing of place cells is timed in relation to local theta waves a process termed phase precession in humans cells with location specific firing patterns have been reported during a study of patients with drug resistant epilepsy they were undergoing an invasive procedure to localize source of their seizures with a view to surgical resection patients had diagnostic electrodes implanted in their hippocampus and then used a computer to move around in a virtual reality town et al 2003 similar brain imaging studies in navigation have shown hippocampus to be active a study was carried out on taxi drivers london s black cab drivers need to learn locations of a large number of places and fastest routes between them in order to pass a strict test known as knowledge in order to gain a license to operate a study showed that posterior part of hippocampus is larger in these drivers than in general public and that a positive correlation exists between length of time served as a driver and increase in volume of this part it was also found total volume of hippocampus was unchanged as increase seen in posterior part was made at expense of anterior part which showed a relative decrease in size there have been no reported adverse effects from this disparity in hippocampal proportions maguire et al 2000 another study showed opposite findings in blind individuals anterior part of right hippocampus was larger and posterior part was smaller compared with sighted individuals there are several navigational cells in brain that are either in hippocampus itself or are strongly connected to it such as speed cells present in medial entorhinal cortex together these cells form a network that serves as spatial memory first of such cells discovered in 1970s were place cells which led to idea of hippocampus acting to give a neural representation of environment in a cognitive map o keefe and nadel when hippocampus is dysfunctional orientation is affected people may have difficulty in remembering how they arrived at a location and how to proceed further getting lost is a common symptom of amnesia chiu et al 2004 studies with animals have shown that an intact hippocampus is required for initial learning and long term retention of some spatial memory tasks in particular ones that require finding way to a hidden goal morris et al 1982sutherland et al 1982sutherland et al et al 2005 other cells have been discovered since finding of place cells in rodent brain that are either in hippocampus or entorhinal cortex these have been assigned as head direction cells grid cells and boundary cells solstad et al 2008 speed cells are thought to provide input to hippocampal grid cells role in approach avoidance conflict processing approach avoidance conflict happens when a situation is presented that can either be rewarding or punishing and ensuing decision making has been associated with anxiety fmri findings from studies in approach avoidance decision making found evidence for a functional role that is not explained by either long term memory or spatial cognition overall findings showed that anterior hippocampus is sensitive to conflict and that it may be part of a larger cortical and subcortical network seen to be important in decision making in uncertain conditions a review makes reference to a number of studies that show involvement of hippocampus in conflict tasks authors suggest that a challenge is to understand how conflict processing relates to functions of spatial navigation and memory and how all of these functions need not be mutually exclusive electroencephalography thumb 300px image 7 examples of rat hippocampal eeg and ca1 neural activity in theta awake behaving and lia slow wave sleep modes each plot shows 20 seconds of data with a hippocampal eeg trace at top spike from 40 simultaneously recorded ca1 pyramidal cells in middle each raster line represents a different cell and a plot of running speed at bottom top plot represents a time period during which rat was actively searching for scattered food pellets for bottom plot rat was asleep hippocampus shows two major modes of activity each associated with a distinct pattern of neural population activity and waves of electrical activity as measured by an electroencephalogram eeg these modes are named after eeg patterns associated with them theta and large irregular activity lia main characteristics described below are for rat which is animal most extensively studied theta mode appears during states of active alert behavior especially locomotion and also during rem dreaming sleep buzsaki et al 1990 in theta mode eeg is dominated by large regular waves with a frequency range of 6 to 9 hz and main groups of hippocampal neurons pyramidal cells and granule cells show sparse population activity which means that in any short time interval great majority of cells are silent while small remaining fraction fire at relatively high rates up to 50 spikes in one second for most active of them an active cell typically stays active for half a second to a few seconds as rat behaves active cells fall silent and new cells become active but overall percentage of active cells remains more or less constant in many situations cell activity is determined largely by spatial location of animal but other behavioral variables also clearly influence it lia mode appears during slow wave non dreaming sleep and also during states of waking immobility such as resting or eating in lia mode eeg is dominated by sharp waves that are randomly timed large deflections of eeg signal lasting for 25 50 milliseconds sharp waves are frequently generated in sets with sets containing up to 5 or more individual sharp waves and lasting up to 500 ms spiking activity of neurons within hippocampus is highly correlated with sharp wave activity most neurons decrease their firing rate between sharp waves however during a sharp wave there is a dramatic increase in firing rate in up to 10 of hippocampal population these two hippocampal activity modes can be seen in primates as well as rats with exception that it has been difficult to see robust theta rhythmicity in primate hippocampus there are however qualitatively similar sharp waves and similar state dependent changes in neural population activity skaggs et al 2007 theta rhythm thumb image 8 example of a one second eeg theta wave 350px right because of its densely packed neural layers of all brain structures which generate hippocampal theta rhythm hippocampus generates some of largest eeg signals as theta waves buzsaki 2002 in some situations eeg is dominated by regular waves at 3 to 10 hz often continuing for many seconds these reflect membrane potentials and strongly modulate spiking of hippocampal neurons and synchronise across hippocampus in a travelling wave pattern 2009 trisynaptic circuit is a relay of neurotransmission in hippocampus that interacts with many brain regions from rodent studies it has been proposed that trisynaptic circuit generates hippocampal theta rhythm theta rhythmicity is very obvious in rabbits and rodents and also clearly present in cats and dogs whether theta can be seen in primates is not yet clear cantero et al 2003 in rats animals that have been most extensively studied theta is seen mainly in two conditions first when an animal is walking or in some other way actively interacting with its surroundings second during rem sleep 1969 function of theta has not yet been convincingly explained although numerous theories have been proposed buzsaki 2006 most popular hypothesis has been to relate it to learning and memory an example would be phase with which theta rhythms at time of stimulation of a neuron shape effect of that stimulation upon its synapses what is meant here is that theta rhythms may affect those aspects of learning and memory that are dependent upon synaptic plasticity huerta 1993 it is well established that lesions of medial septum central node of theta system cause severe disruptions of memory however medial septum is more than just controller of theta it is also main source of cholinergic projections to hippocampus it has not been established that septal lesions exert their effects specifically by eliminating theta rhythm kahana et al 2001 sharp waves during sleep or during resting when an animal is not engaged with its surroundings hippocampal eeg shows a pattern of irregular slow waves somewhat larger in amplitude than theta waves this pattern is occasionally interrupted by large surges called sharp waves buzsaki 1986 these events are associated with bursts of spike activity lasting 50 to 100 milliseconds in pyramidal cells of ca3 and ca1 they are also associated with short lived high frequency eeg oscillations called ripples with frequencies in range 150 to 200 hz in rats and together they are known as sharp waves and ripples sharp waves are most frequent during sleep when they occur at an average rate of around 1 per second in rats but in a very irregular temporal pattern sharp waves are less frequent during inactive waking states and are usually smaller sharp waves have also been observed in humans and monkeys in macaques sharp waves are robust but do not occur as frequently as in rats one of most interesting aspects of sharp waves is that they appear to be associated with memory wilson and mcnaughton 1994 wilson mcnaughton 1994 and numerous later studies reported that when hippocampal place cells have overlapping spatial firing fields and therefore often fire in near simultaneity they tend to show correlated activity during sleep following behavioral session this enhancement of correlation commonly known as reactivation has been found to occur mainly during sharp waves jackson et al 2006 it has been proposed that sharp waves are in fact reactivations of neural activity patterns that were memorized during behavior driven by strengthening of synaptic connections within hippocampus sutherland mcnaughton 2000 this idea forms a key component of two stage memory theory advocated by buzsaki and others which proposes that memories are stored within hippocampus during behavior and then later transferred to neocortex during sleep sharp waves in theory are seen as persistently repeated by presynaptic cells of postsynaptic cells that are suggested to drive synaptic changes in cortical targets of hippocampal output pathways buzsaki 1989 suppression of sharp waves and ripples in sleep or during immobility can interfere with memories expressed at level of behavior nonetheless newly formed ca1 place cell code can re emerge even after a sleep with abolished sharp waves and ripples in spatially non demanding tasks long term potentiation since at least time of ramon y cajal 1852 1934 psychologists have speculated that brain stores memory by altering strength of connections between neurons that are simultaneously active ramon y cajal 1894 this idea was formalized by donald hebb in 1949 hebb 1949 but for many years remained unexplained in 1973 tim bliss and terje lomo described a phenomenon in rabbit hippocampus that appeared to meet hebb s specifications a change in synaptic responsiveness induced by brief strong activation and lasting for hours or days or longer bliss lomo 1973 this phenomenon was soon referred to as long term potentiation ltp as a candidate mechanism for long term memory ltp has since been studied intensively and a great deal has been learned about it however complexity and variety of intracellular signalling cascades that can trigger ltp is acknowledged as preventing a more complete understanding bear 2004 hippocampus is a particularly favorable site for studying ltp because of its densely packed and sharply defined layers of neurons but similar types of activity dependent synaptic change have also been observed in many other brain areas cooke bliss 2006 best studied form of ltp has been seen in ca1 of hippocampus and occurs at synapses that terminate on dendritic spines and use neurotransmitter glutamate synaptic changes depend on a special type of glutamate receptor n methyl d aspartate nmda receptor a cell surface receptor which has special property of allowing calcium to enter postsynaptic spine only when presynaptic activation and postsynaptic depolarization occur at same time nakazawa et al 2004 drugs that interfere with nmda receptors block ltp and have major effects on some types of memory especially spatial memory genetically modified mice that are modified to disable ltp mechanism also generally show severe memory deficits disorders aging normal aging is associated with a gradual decline in some types of memory including episodic memory and working memory or short term memory because hippocampus is thought to play a central role in memory there has been considerable interest in possibility that age related declines could be caused by hippocampal deterioration prull et al 2000 p 105 some early studies reported substantial loss of neurons in hippocampus of elderly people but later studies using more precise techniques found only minimal differences similarly some mri studies have reported shrinkage of hippocampus in elderly people but other studies have failed to reproduce this finding there is however a reliable relationship between size of hippocampus and memory performance so that where there is age related shrinkage memory performance will be impaired prull et al 2000 p 107 there are also reports that memory tasks tend to produce less hippocampal activation in elderly than in young furthermore a randomized control trial published in 2011 found that aerobic exercise could increase size of hippocampus in adults aged 55 to 80 and also improve spatial memory erickson et al 2011 dementia age related conditions such as alzheimer s disease and other forms of dementia for which hippocampal disruption is one of earliest et al 2008 have a severe impact on many types of cognition stress hippocampus contains high levels of receptors which make it more vulnerable to long term stress than most other brain areas 2008 there is evidence that humans having experienced severe long lasting traumatic stress show atrophy of hippocampus more than of other parts of brain fu et al 2010 these effects show up in post traumatic stress disorder and they may contribute to hippocampal atrophy reported in schizophrenia and severe depression see also mri database at www org a recent study has also revealed atrophy as a result of depression but this can be stopped with anti depressants even if they are not effective in relieving other symptoms campbell macqueen 2004 chronic stress resulting in elevated levels of glucocorticoids notably of cortisol is seen to be a cause of neuronal atrophy in hippocampus this atrophy results in a smaller hippocampal volume which is also seen in cushing s syndrome higher levels of cortisol in cushing s syndrome is usually result of medications taken for other conditions neuronal loss also occurs as a result of impaired neurogenesis another factor that contributes to a smaller hippocampal volume is that of dendritic retraction where dendrites are shortened in length and reduced in number in response to increased glucocorticoids this dendritic retraction is reversible after treatment with medication to reduce cortisol in cushing s syndrome hippocampal volume is seen to be restored by as much as 10 this change is seen to be due to reforming of dendrites this dendritic restoration can also happen when stress is removed there is however evidence derived mainly from studies using rats that stress occurring shortly after birth can affect hippocampal function in ways that persist throughout life garcia segura pp 170 71 sex specific responses to stress have also been demonstrated in rat to have an effect on hippocampus chronic stress in male rat showed dendritic retraction and cell loss in ca3 region but this was not shown in female this was thought to be due to neuroprotective ovarian hormones in rats dna damage increases in hippocampus under conditions of stress epilepsy thumb 180px image 9 an eeg showing epilepsy right hippocampal seizure onset thumb right 180px image 10 an eeg showing epilepsy left hippocampal seizure onset hippocampus is one of few brain regions where new neurons are generated this process of neurogenesis is confined to dentate gyrus et al 2009 production of new neurons can be positively affected by exercise or negatively affected by epileptic seizures seizures in temporal lobe epilepsy can affect normal development of new neurons and can cause tissue damage hippocampal sclerosis is most common type of such tissue damage chang and lowenstein 2003 it is not yet clear however whether epilepsy is usually caused by hippocampal abnormalities or whether hippocampus is damaged by cumulative effects of seizures sloviter 2005 however in experimental settings where repetitive seizures are artificially induced in animals hippocampal damage is a frequent result this may be a consequence of concentration of excitable glutamate receptors in hippocampus hyperexcitability can lead to cytotoxicity and cell death it may also have something to do with hippocampus being a site where new neurons continue to be created throughout life and to abnormalities in this process schizophrenia causes of schizophrenia are not well understood but numerous abnormalities of brain structure have been reported most thoroughly investigated alterations involve cerebral cortex but effects on hippocampus have also been described many reports have found reductions in size of hippocampus in schizophrenic subjects harrison 2004 left hippocampus seems to be affected more than right changes noted have largely been accepted to be result of abnormal development it is unclear whether hippocampal alterations play any role in causing psychotic symptoms that are most important feature of schizophrenia it has been suggested that on basis of experimental work using animals hippocampal dysfunction might produce an alteration of dopamine release in basal ganglia thereby indirectly affecting integration of information in prefrontal cortex goto grace 2008 it has also been suggested that hippocampal dysfunction might account for disturbances in long term memory frequently observed boyer et al 2007 mri studies have found a smaller brain volume and larger ventricles in people with schizophrenia however researchers do not know if shrinkage is from schizophrenia or from medication hippocampus and thalamus have been shown to be reduced in volume and volume of globus pallidus is increased cortical patterns are altered and a reduction in volume and thickness of cortex particularly in frontal and temporal lobes has been noted it has further been proposed that many of changes seen are present at start of disorder which gives weight to theory that there is abnormal neurodevelopment hippocampus has been seen as central to pathology of schizophrenia both in neural and physiological effects it has been generally accepted that there is an abnormal synaptic connectivity underlying schizophrenia several lines of evidence implicate changes in synaptic organization and connectivity in and from hippocampus many studies have found dysfunction in synaptic circuitry within hippocampus and its activity on prefrontal cortex glutamatergic pathways have been seen to be largely affected subfield ca1 is seen to be least involved of other subfields and ca4 and subiculum have been reported elsewhere as being most implicated areas review concluded that pathology could be due to genetics faulty neurodevelopment or abnormal neural plasticity it was further concluded that schizophrenia is not due to any known neurodegenerative disorder oxidative dna damage is substantially increased in hippocampus of elderly patients with chronic schizophrenia transient global amnesia transient global amnesia is a dramatic sudden temporary near total loss of short term memory various causes have been hypothesized including ischemia epilepsy migraine and disturbance of cerebral venous blood flow leading to ischemia of structures such as hippocampus that are involved in memory there has been no scientific proof of any cause however diffusion weighted mri studies taken from 12 24 hours following an episode has shown there to be small dot like lesions in hippocampus these findings have suggested a possible implication of ca1 neurons made vulnerable by metabolic stress ptsd some studies shows correlation of reduced hippocampus volume and posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd a study of vietnam war combat veterans with ptsd showed a 20 reduction in volume of their hippocampus compared with veterans having suffered no such symptoms this finding was not replicated in chronic ptsd patients traumatized at an air show plane crash in 1988 ramstein germany a 2016 study strengthened theory that a smaller hippocampus increases risk for post traumatic stress disorder and a larger hippocampus increases likelihood of efficacious treatment other animals thumb image 11 drawing by camillo golgi of a hippocampus stained using silver nitrate method other mammals hippocampus has a generally similar appearance across range of mammals from monotremes such as echidna to primates such as humans west 1990 hippocampal size to body size ratio broadly increases being about twice as large for primates as for echidna it does not however increase at anywhere close to rate of neocortex to body size ratio therefore hippocampus takes up a much larger fraction of cortical mantle in rodents than in primates in adult humans volume of hippocampus on each side of brain is about 3 0 to 3 5 cm3 as compared to 320 to 420 cm3 for volume of neocortex suzuki et al 2005 there is also a general relationship between size of hippocampus and spatial memory when comparisons are made between similar species those that have a greater capacity for spatial memory tend to have larger hippocampal volumes jacobs 2003 this relationship also extends to sex differences in species where males and females show strong differences in spatial memory ability they also tend to show corresponding differences in hippocampal volume jacobs et al 1990 other vertebrates non mammalian species do not have a brain structure that looks like mammalian hippocampus but they have one that is considered homologous to it hippocampus as pointed out above is in essence part of allocortex only mammals have a fully developed cortex but structure it evolved from called pallium is present in all vertebrates even most primitive ones such as lamprey or hagfish aboitiz et al 2003 pallium is usually divided into three zones medial lateral and dorsal medial pallium forms precursor of hippocampus it does not resemble hippocampus visually because layers are not warped into an s shape or enfolded by dentate gyrus but homology is indicated by strong chemical and functional affinities there is now evidence that these hippocampal like structures are involved in spatial cognition in birds reptiles and fish rodriguez et al 2002 birds in birds correspondence is sufficiently well established that most anatomists refer to medial zone as avian hippocampus colombo and broadbent 2000 numerous species of birds have strong spatial skills in particular those that cache food there is evidence that food caching birds have a larger hippocampus than other types of birds and that damage to hippocampus causes impairments in spatial memory 2003 fish story for fish is more complex in teleost fish which make up great majority of existing species forebrain is distorted in comparison to other types of vertebrates most neuroanatomists believe that teleost forebrain is in essence everted like a sock turned inside out so that structures that lie in interior next to ventricles for most vertebrates are found on outside in teleost fish and vice versa nieuwenhuys 1982 one of consequences of this is that medial pallium hippocampal zone of a typical vertebrate is thought to correspond to lateral pallium of a typical fish several types of fish particularly goldfish have been shown experimentally to have strong spatial memory abilities even forming cognitive maps of areas they inhabit there is evidence that damage to lateral pallium impairs spatial memory et al et al 2006 it is not yet known whether medial pallium plays a similar role in even more primitive vertebrates such as sharks and rays or even lampreys and hagfish insects and molluscs some types of insects and molluscs such as octopus also have strong spatial learning and navigation abilities but these appear to work differently from mammalian spatial system so there is as yet no good reason to think that they have a common evolutionary origin nor is there sufficient similarity in brain structure to enable anything resembling a hippocampus to be identified in these species some have proposed however that insect s mushroom bodies may have a function similar to that of hippocampus et al 1998 additional
