marienbad was a 1962 polish puzzle mainframe game created by elwro engineer witold podgorski in wroclaw poland for its odra 1003 it was an adaption of logic game nim inspired by discussion in magazine przekroj of a variant of nim in 1961 film last year at marienbad l annee derniere a marienbad named marienbad by magazine podgorski programmed game for in development 1003 mainframe released in 1963 game had players opposing computer in alternating rounds of removing matches from a set with last player to take a match loser as computer always played optimal moves it was essentially unbeatable like many games in early history of video games marienbad did not spread far beyond initial location elwro did not produce or advertise game though podgorski recreated it at wojskowa akademia techniczna military university of technology in warsaw game fell into obscurity with no pictures or documentation surviving to recreate it in its original form as there is only one known odra 1003 remaining and no way of recreating game exists it is considered lost despite its simplicity it is considered possibly first polish computer or video game gameplay in nim players take turns removing at least one object from a set of objects traditionally matchsticks with goal of either being or not being player who removes last object gameplay options can be modeled mathematically in marienbads default game mode four rows of matches were generated with either one three five or seven matches within each row side that was left with last match lost computer printout showed player current layout of matches a single player could play game at a time whose turn alternated with computer s regardless of which side started game computer was almost certain to be winner as it always made perfect moves on its maximum settings game consisted of 8 000 rows containing up to 1 trillion matches requiring an hour for computer to choose its next move game did not support a video output as odra 1003 did not have a screen instead game was played via a and card perforator on which machine printed results development elwro was a polish company established in 1959 and based in based in wroclaw poland that designed and manufactured mainframe and microcomputers its first release was odra 1001 mainframe in 1960 followed by odra 1002 in 1962 and odra 1003 in 1963 witold podgorski was a recent graduate of wroclaw university of technology having majored in electronic engineering and specialized in mathematical machines having first heard about existence of electronic brains in 1955 in high school he embarked on five years of study toward automation of digital machines he completed his masters thesis at elwro where he was employed on 10 october 1961 working with odra 1001 he developed a way to manipulate computer s memory to allow content to be saved thus paving way for odra 1003 new machine used modern transistor switches that allowed for 500 operations per second and drum memory of odra 1003 program had a capacity of 40 kilobytes while working for elwro in 1961 podgorski discovered logic game nim while reading an issue in weekly magazine przekroj magazine described a two player game where players remove any number of items from one of four rows with player holding last item losing przekroj named this variant of nim as marienbad after 1960 french film last year at marienbad l annee derniere a marienbad in which characters frequently play these mathematical duels podgorski became inspired by use of game nim in film after reading about its principles while sitting in a multi hour lecture for his obligatory military study class podgorski decided to decipher marienbad algorithm and save it to a binary system which could be understood by computers podgorski would later assert that algorithm was extremely simple to implement into a computer and could be expressed in two words adding that if nobody was interested in it he would take it to grave he programmed game for first prototype of odra 1003 then in development and scheduled to be installed in board of topographic general staff of polish army in wroclaw game intended for logical duels was developed solely by podgorski by creating algorithm writing a list of instructions which were printed on sheets size of postcards and manually setting initial state of each memory cell he designed game to be unbeatable if human player made a single mistake computer would win while employees in elwro factory knew that result of game was predetermined many volunteered to play it they could not beat standard 16 match version of marienbad let alone higher settings of game legacy thumb right an odra 1003 mainframe photographed in 1974 like many games in early history of video games marienbad did not spread far beyond initial location mainframe computers were rare throughout world and primarily located in government or military institutions or large corporations so were generally unavailable for amusement purposes elwro produced only 42 odra 1003 mainframes between 1963 and 1965 elwro declined to publish or advertise game and title was mostly forgotten game did spread beyond elwro factory however after developing game podgorski became a student at wojskowa akademia techniczna military university of technology in warsaw and with assistance of fellow student bogdan set up a version of game there on an odra 1003 that was mediated by a university operator computer and therefore game could be used or played by any student but only through an operator who received intended input from player and passed information to computer as in podgorski s original game instance game was essentially unbeatable operators as a result actively discouraged players from participating university authorities supported this as they wanted to forcibly remove nasty habit of harassing computers for logic games which they believed should be used only for serious military purposes players took to holding secret meetings in front of massive computer in late evenings when operators were gone podgorski recalled that despite knowing that game was designed to always beat player many people spent many hours trying to decipher algorithm or win in later years variants of nim and marienbad were second most popular type of computer game present on polish computers after noughts and crosses since it was a relatively simple game to program who would later become two decade long host of wheel of fortune from 1970s proposed to polish television a game show where players compete against a computer in nim on a 8b minicomputer meanwhile podgorski continued to work for elwro co creating odra computers though he did not stop working on games after colleagues brought a variant of board game from egypt he became inspired to adapt it to computer this time he did not want to create an unbeatable game but included adjustable difficulty levels to create a fun experience regardless of player s expertise writing for polish bytes polskie bartlomiej kluska asserts that as only copy of odra 1003 is kept at museum of technology in warsaw in an inactive state original game of marienbad no longer exists outside of memory of players no recreations of game have been made for more modern computers and there are no known photos or documentation for how game was played or created in research paper gry jako computer games as a cultural heritage by maria garda she notes that game should be written about only in past tense as original elements have not been preserved adding that while marienbad algorithm can be recreated in a new programming environment reconstruction of physical transistors of original computer would be nearly impossible paper further compared challenges of playing this title in modern era to playing super mario bros on originally intended equipment in 50 years time marienbad is considered one of first polish video games developed almost 20 years before later candidates 1984 gasienica 1985 and 1986 and well before first well known polish game tajemnica 1993 lodz game historian bartek kluska made this assertion in his foundational book on polish video gaming industry polish bytes his research uncovered game as 24 years older than game that previously held title kluska notes however that it was preceded by i a version of tic tac toe written by department of mathematical apparatus programmer bogdan mis in 1960 for computer using a chess sized grid michal nowicki of gram pl asserted that kluska s research in contrast with previous and more imprecise polish video gaming text temu w grach once upon a time in games allows marienbad s claim as first polish computer or video game to be made with almost 100 certainty an article by retailer further asserts that marienbads simplicity and lack of video output means that term computer game is a somewhat exaggerated term to describe it much less video game garda s paper claims however that regardless of its simplicity game has importance as one of one earliest computer or video games from region although marcin of gamezilla notes that this first attempt at creating a polish computer game went largely unnoticed jacek glowacki of gry online stated that despite its obscurity it should be considered ancestor of modern polish video gaming industry and that its existence and creation are worth remembering 2018 ars
