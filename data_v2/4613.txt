sollipulli in mapuche language is an ice filled volcanic caldera and volcanic complex which lies southeast of small town of melipeuco in la araucania region chile it is part of southern volcanic zone of andes one of four volcanic belts in andes chain volcano has evolved in close contact with glacial ice it differs from many calderas in that sollipulli appears to have collapsed in a non explosive manner age of collapse is not yet known but it is presently filled with ice to thicknesses of ice drains through two glaciers in west and north of caldera sollipulli has developed on a basement formed by mesozoic and cenozoic geological formations sollipulli was active in pleistocene and holocene epochs a large plinian eruption occurred 2 960 2 780 years before present forming alpehue crater and generating a high eruption column and ignimbrite deposits last activity occurred 710 60 years before present and formed chufquen scoria cone on northern flank sollipulli is among 118 volcanoes which have been active in recent history geomorphology and geography sollipulli lies in araucania region province melipeuco commune sollipulli volcano is in western part of nevados de sollipulli mountain range which is bordered to north south and east by river valleys communes of cunco and villarrica are in area melipeuco lies northwest volcano is also part of geopark project regional sollipulli is part of southern volcanic zone of andes one of four belts of volcanoes which are found in mountain range other three are northern volcanic zone central volcanic zone both north of southern volcanic zone and austral volcanic zone south of southern volcanic zone these volcanic zones are separated by gaps where there is no volcanic activity and subduction of pacific ocean crust is shallower than in volcanically active areas about 60 volcanoes have erupted in historical time in andes and 118 additional volcanic systems show evidence of holocene eruptions there are 60 volcanoes in southern volcanic zone among these are cerro azul and cerro hudson which experienced large eruptions in 1932 and 1991 that resulted in emission of substantial volumes of ash volcanoes llaima and villarrica have been regularly active during recent history local sollipulli is a stratovolcano which has one caldera on its summit and southwest of it alpehue crater crater is draped by pyroclastic flow deposits and its rim reaches a height of rims of caldera rise above ice in caldera highest summit of sollipulli lies on southern flank of caldera and reaches an elevation of above sea level on southern and eastern side caldera is bordered by several lava domes caldera most likely was not formed by a large explosive eruption considering that no deposits from such an eruption have been found volcano is formed by lava flows lava domes scoria pillow lavas as well as pumice falls pyroclastics and other material edifice has a volume of about and covers a surface area of about radial valleys extend away from top a number of particular landforms on sollipulli formed under influence of glacial ice such as caldera structure nevados de sollipulli mountain chain west of sollipulli caldera are a chain of volcanoes which is heavily eroded they are formed by breccia and lava flows glacial action has left cirques closer to caldera they are better preserved with individual flows issuing from fissure vents this chain is one of several striking volcano alignments in southern volcanic zone regional tectonics favour magma ascent along such alignments flanks of volcano are covered by lava flows which gives them irregular contours glaciers and streams have cut valleys into slopes and smoothed lava flows two scoria cones are situated on northern flank chufquen and redondo each associated with lava flows about a dozen such craters dot flanks of volcano glaciers both main caldera and alpehue crater contain glaciers which in caldera reached a thickness of in 1992 and fills it total volume was estimated at in 1992 these glaciers feature typical ice structures such as crevasses and there may be a subglacial lake in caldera three lakes are found in caldera at its margins easterly sharkfin lake southeasterly dome lake and southwesterly alpehue lake these glaciers drain to north and northwest latter glacier flows from caldera through alpehue crater into valley of same name which is drained by rio alpehue into rio river other than caldera and crater glaciers only snow cover on sollipulli is seasonal glacier within caldera of sollipulli is shrinking its surface area decreased between 1961 and 2011 and outlet glacier retreated by process of glacier retreat is probably accelerated by ash being deposited on glacier through eruptions at neighbouring volcano puyehue cordon caulle activity at other volcanoes llaima and villarrica may have same effect in 2011 volume of glacier was melting of glacier risks generating lahars and putting water supplies in region into jeopardy geology subduction has been ongoing on western side of south america since 185 million years ago and has resulted in formation of andes and volcanic activity within range about 27 million years ago farallon plate broke up and pace of subduction increased resulting in increased volcanic activity and a temporary change in tectonic regime of southern andes sollipulli volcano developed on a basement which consists of jurassic cretaceous del formation and pliocene pleistocene nevados de sollipulli volcanics with subordinate exposures of miocene and cretaceous tertiary complex volcano sedimentary formations miocene granites are intruded into basement composition rocks erupted from sollipulli range from basalt over basaltic andesite and andesite to dacite composition has changed over evolution of volcano sometimes one type of rock is found as inclusion in another minerals contained in rocks include apatite clinopyroxene ilmenite olivine orthopyroxene plagioclase and titanomagnetite xenoliths are also found including diorite and of alpehue rocks has been explained with penetration of more primitive magma into a dacitic magma chamber which was then subject to magma mixing primitive magmas sometimes pass through flanks of edifice and form parasitic vents in these cases obsidian was obtained on sollipulli and exported over large distances it has been found as far as argentina s steppes and northern chile and is chemically and in appearance different from obsidian obtained on chaiten volcano one source has been identified at a lava dome on western side of sollipulli a route starting south of melipeuco leads up on volcano this route was used for transport of obsidian in 1980s vegetation region is forested with deciduous trees including nothofagus with laurel forests around lakes of area and woods consisting of araucaria and chilensis at altitudes exceeding in addition there are open grasslands called which were used for grazing eruption history sollipulli was active during pleistocene and holocene nevados de sollipulli are less than 1 8 million years old with argon argon dating having obtained ages of 490 000 30 000 and 312 000 20 000 years ago six separate volcanic units form edifice from oldest to youngest they are sharkfin northwest south peak alpehue and chufquen units first two may be contemporaneous to formation of caldera or they may predate it sharkfin unit was emplaced in a subglacial environment and later disrupted by faulting later units show substantial evidence of having been altered by glaciers radiometric dates have been obtained on sharkfin unit 700 000 140 000 and 350 000 90 000 years before present northwest unit 120 000 16 000 120 000 140 000 110 000 30 000 and 100 000 30 000 years before present and south and peak units 68 000 14 000 64 000 15 000 and 26 000 5 000 years before present caldera is nested within an older and eroded caldera and some parasitic cones are heavily eroded whereas others appear to be younger pyroclastic flows from alpehue have been dated to 2 960 2 780 years before present alpehue unit was emplaced during a large plinian eruption which generated a eruption column and ejected about of pumice falls layers of tephra identified in a bog of south georgia away as well as in an ice core at siple dome in antarctica and dated to about 980 bce may be a product of alpehue eruption alpehue tephra has been used as a tephrochronology tool pyroclastic flows from eruption melted caldera ice sheet forming lahars that propagated northwest away from sollipulli ignimbrites from this eruption cover surfaces of at least around sollipulli their volume has been estimated to be about they are brown to grey in colour and with exception of part of ignimbrite that is emplaced within alpehue crater eruption reached a level of 5 on volcanic explosivity index radiocarbon dating at chufquen has yielded an age of 710 60 years before present this eruption deposited ash onto caldera ice while it is absent from central parts of chufquen valley either it was removed by a later glacier advance or it landed on a glacier which later retreated eruption occurred relatively recently indicating that sollipulli is still active hazards substantial ice body in caldera means that there is a significant risk of mudflows or glacier bursts in case of renewed activity a repeat of alpehue eruption would be a regional catastrophe comparable to 1991 eruption of cerro hudson volcano chilean geological service sernageomin monitors volcano and publishes a hazard index for it towns of cunco
