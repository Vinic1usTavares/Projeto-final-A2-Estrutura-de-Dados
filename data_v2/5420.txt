ge e60 is a family of six axle c c electric locomotives made by ge transportation systems ge between 1972 and 1983 e60s were produced in several variants for both freight and passenger use in united states and mexico ge designed locomotive for use on black mesa and lake powell railroad bm lp a dedicated coal hauling route in arizona which began operation in 1973 that same year ge adapted design for high speed passenger service on amtrak s northeast corridor largest customer was ferrocarriles nacionales de mexico ndem state owned railroad in mexico which bought 39 for a new electrification project in early 1980s e60s were successful in coal hauling role they ran on bm lp for decades and remain in use on several mining railroads in western united states passenger variants failed in their intended role problems with truck design caused derailments above rendering locomotives unusable for high speed service by end of 1970s amtrak abandoned e60 in favor of emd aem 7 locomotives manufactured by electro motive division in mexico ndem s project was delayed into 1990s then scrapped after three years of use most of ndem s electric locomotives never ran and were traded back to ge for diesels some were sold to various mining railroads design thumb left alt broadside view of a boxy red white and black locomotive black mesa and lake powell railroad e60c 6003 in 2010 black mesa and lake powell railroad bm lp was a new railroad built to transport coal from black mesa mine near kayenta arizona to navajo generating station power plant at page arizona it was long and isolated from national railroad network bm lp was electrified at 50 kv 60 hz ac and was first such electrification to use this voltage in world railroad was intended to run as a conveyor belt with trains cycling between coal mine and plant to operate this conveyor belt ge transportation systems ge designed e60c though it was suitable for general mainline freight operation heavy loads of coal on bm lp drove ge s design choices on e60c ge chose a six axle c c design with wheels instead of standard wheels this was necessary because of locomotive s 85 21 gearing with this gearing a maximum speed of was possible although standard operating speed on bm lp was thyristor rectifiers step down high voltage ac to provide dc power at a much lower voltage to six traction motors one per axle locomotive is rated at with a starting tractive effort of and a continuous tractive effort of physically locomotive is long and weighs including some of ballast ge made a number of changes when it redesigned e60c for passenger use new design was lighter at and longer at a gearing of 68 38 permitted a maximum design speed of starting tractive effort was considerably lower at with a continuous rating of unlike freight locomotives passenger locomotives have to supply heat to passenger cars in 1970s amtrak operated both old style steam heated cars and new amfleet cars with head end power hep ge designed two variants to handle these use cases e60cp had steam generators while e60ch had hep generators both models had a cab and pantograph at each end reflecting varied electrification schemes on northeast corridor amtrak units could operate at three different voltages 11 kv 25 hz ac 12 5 kv 60 hz ac and 25 kv 60 hz wheels had a more standard diameter of ge revised design in early 1980s for use by ferrocarriles nacionales de mexico ndem on its new electrification project e60c 2 like passenger variants had double cabs and double pantographs they were geared at 83 20 for a maximum speed of although geared differently from e60cp ch it also used wheels locomotives are long and weigh they employ six ge traction motors tractive effort was similar to original e60c starting and continuous ndem adopted 25 kv 60 hz electrification a later buyer deseret western railway like black mesa and lake powell adopted 50 kv 60 hz ac history black mesa and lake powell railroad planned weight of a loaded coal train at black mesa and lake powell bm lp was ge intended that e60cs work in multiple three per train to handle this load bm lp ordered a total of six locomotives between 1972 1976 allowing it to operate two trains at once bm lp acquired six former ferrocarriles nacionales de mexico e60c 2s after latter discontinued electric operations in late 1990s these displaced original

1975 thumb left ex amtrak e60ma no 603 preserved at railroad museum of pennsylvania amtrak assumed control of almost all private sector intercity passenger rail service in united states on may 1 1971 with a mandate to reverse decades of decline it retained approximately 184 of 440 trains which had run day before to operate these trains amtrak inherited a fleet of 300 locomotives electric and diesel and 1190 passenger cars most of which dated from 1940s 1950s operation on electrified portion of northeast corridor was split between budd metroliner electric multiple units and prr gg1 locomotives latter were over 35 years old and restricted to amtrak faced a choice with gg1s completely rebuild fleet or replace them with a new locomotive while no united states manufacturer had a dedicated electric passenger locomotive in its catalog ge was proposing a passenger version of e60c before bm lp locomotives even entered service importing and adapting a european locomotive would require a three year lead time ge promised delivery within a year with few other options amtrak turned to ge to adapt e60c for passenger service amtrak ordered 26 e60s in 1973 15 on march 26 1973 and a further 11 on october 12 total cost of order was 18 4 million initial order was for 15 locomotives with steam generators and 11 with head end power but 9 of first type were switched to using head end power as amtrak ramped up acquisition of amfleet cars amtrak anticipated that e60 hauled amfleet trains could displace both gg1s and mechanically unreliable metroliners e60s began arriving in november 1974 they were first locomotives to carry amtrak s new phase ii livery problems soon developed as locomotives yawed sideways when accelerating stressing rails national transportation safety board investigation after a derailment at elkton maryland on february 24 1975 revealed problems with truck and bolster design federal railroad administration restricted maximum speed of e60s to while amtrak accepted locomotives and publicly expressed confidence that they would be cleared for operation it also arranged for a trial of swedish built four axle rc4 electric locomotive problems with e60 persisted into 1977 at which point amtrak developed specification for a locomotive based on rc4 design in 1977 78 amtrak ordered first of 53 emd aem 7s a twin cab b b electric locomotive produced by electro motive division as aem 7s arrived amtrak began disposing of its e60s it sold two e60chs to navajo mine railroad in 1982 a grant from urban mass transit administration enabled new jersey transit to buy ten of e60chs in 1984 for use on north jersey coast line between 1986 and 1988 those e60s that remained with amtrak were rebuilt reclassified and renumbered all e60cps had their steam generators removed and four of these had hep fitted those with hep both e60chs and converted e60cps were rebuilt and renumbered as e60ma in 600 series locomotives were regeared for a maximum speed of when e60s returned to service they were used on heavy long distance trains such as new york new orleans crescent new york florida silver service and washington d c montreal montrealer they could also be found in push pull service on keystone service trains in late 1980s new jersey transit began buying abb alp an improved version of emd aem 7 from asea brown boveri in 1990 it would acquire 32 altogether by end of 1996 e60 was off new jersey transit roster by 1998 no 958 was preserved by united railroad historical society of new jersey all amtrak e60s were retired in 2003 in april 2004
