jane and perhaps as a parody of oliver cromwell cerne giant national trust website retrieved 30 october 2012 second idea is that giant is a creation of romano british culture because giant resembles roman god hercules who was based on greek god heracles third idea is that giant is of celtic origin because it is stylistically similar to a celtic god on a skillet handle found at hod hill dorset and dated to around ad 10 to ad 51 a saxon origin was also suggested by early antiquarians who associated figure with a saxon god whose name contained some variant of element hel this god is attested in several medieval and early modern texts and was associated with cerne abbas giant by an editor of a 1789 edition of william camden s britannia and by william stukeley who indicated that locals referred to giant as helis a saxon origin is unlikely but stukeley was also first to hypothesize that figure was hercules a suggestion that has found more support modern antiquarian julian cope 1998

cuthred king of wessex thumb right lord holles a portrait from 1640s holles cerne abbas landowner has been suggested as person who ordered giant to be cut in mockery of his political adversary cromwell proponents of a 17th century origin suggest that giant was carved around time of english civil war by servants of lord of manor denzil holles and was intended as a parody of oliver cromwell cerne abbas giant at sacred destinations this theory is supported by 1774 account given by antiquarian john hutchins who also noted in a letter of 1751 that steward of manor had told him figure was a modern thing cut out in lord hollis time while holles mp for dorchester and a leader of presbyterian faction in parliament had been a key parliamentarian supporter during first english civil war he grew to personally despise cromwell and attempted to have him impeached in 1644 denzil holles 1st baron holles bcw project accessed 10 05 18 fact that there is no medieval documentary evidence of figure supports a 17th century date of origin cromwell was sometimes mockingly referred to as england s hercules by his enemies and possibility that giant parodies cromwell as hercules is further strengthened by 1996 discovery of cloak as hercules was often depicted with a cloak made from nemean lion s skin under this interpretation club has been suggested to hint at cromwell s military rule
