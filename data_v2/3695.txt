surovy was one of 18 s officially known as project 7u built for soviet navy during late 1930s although she began construction as a project 7 surovy was completed in 1941 to modified project 7u design entering service just before beginning of operation barbarossa she participated in minelaying operations and provided naval gunfire support from late june to early august engaging a german convoy without result on 21 august she was damaged by a mine during evacuation of tallinn estonia but limped back to leningrad for repairs that lasted for most of september after a month of shore bombardments during siege of leningrad destroyer participated in evacuation of hanko naval base in early november and was scuttled after being crippled by a mine during latter on 13 november design and description originally built as a gnevny class ship surovy and her sister ships were completed to modified project 7u design after joseph stalin general secretary of communist party of soviet union ordered that latter be built with their boilers arranged en echelon instead of linked as in gnevnys so that a ship could still move with one or two boilers disabled rohwer monakov p 52 balakin p 8 like gnevnys project 7u destroyers had an overall length of and a beam of but they had a reduced draft of at deep load ships were slightly overweight displacing at standard load and at deep load crew complement of storozhevoy class numbered 207 in peacetime but this increased to 271 in wartime as more personnel were needed to operate additional equipment balakin pp 30 44 yakubov worth p 101 each ship had a pair of geared steam turbines each driving one propeller rated to produce using steam from four water tube boilers which designers expected would exceed speed of project 7s because there was additional steam available some fell short of it although specific figures for most individual ships have not survived variations in fuel oil capacity meant that range of project 7us varied from at that upper figure demonstrated by storozhevoy yakubov worth pp 101 106 107 project 7u class ships mounted four b 13 guns in two pairs of superfiring single mounts fore and aft of superstructure anti aircraft defense was provided by a pair of 34 k aa guns in single mounts and three 21 k aa guns hill p 42 as well as four dk or dshk machine guns they carried six torpedo tubes in two rotating triple mounts amidships ships could also carry a maximum of 58 to 96 mines and 30 depth charges they were fitted with a set of mars hydrophones for anti submarine work although these were useless at speeds over yakubov worth pp 101 105 106 construction and career surovy was laid down at shipyard no 189 sergo ordzhonikidze in leningrad as yard number 297 on 27 october 1936 as a gnevny class destroyer with name she was relaid down as a project 7u destroyer on 1 february 1939 and launched on 5 august 1939 renamed surovy on 25 september 1940 balakin p 11 rohwer monakov p 234 ship was accepted by a state commission on 31 may 1941 and joined 5th destroyer division of baltic fleet on 18 june when soviet naval jack was raised aboard her berezhnoy p 353 when operation barbarossa german invasion of soviet union began four days later surovy was still based at kronstadt quickly relocating to tallinn she participated in minelaying operations in gulf of finland on 29 june and bombarded german positions in support of 8th army on coast of narva bay on 23 july in latter 186 main gun rounds that ship fired were credited with destroying five mortars and various structures balakin pp 71 72 during august surovy and her sister ship made two raids in gulf of riga former under flag of light forces detachment commander counter admiral valentin drozd destroyer bombarded a german battery at firing sixty 130 mm shells on 6 august and two days later fired 24 more shells at a pier in roja on return voyage she evaded two german air attacks with old destroyer she steamed to gulf of riga on 21 august to intercept a convoy of two transports with escorts that had been spotted by aerial reconnaissance surovy fired one hundred forty five 130 mm shells at one of transports and erroneously reported its sinking while escaping unscathed from german air attack as she was departing area while steaming from moonsund to tallinn on 27 august detonation of a mine in her paravanes caused a shockwave that damaged foundation of boiler no 3 and disabled other machinery platonov p 218 another mine exploded in one of her paravanes during evacuation of tallinn between 28 and 30 august but destroyer managed to reach kronstadt she was repaired at baltic shipyard in leningrad from 3 to 23 september and surovy bombarded german positions during siege of leningrad after completion of her repairs until end of october first from kronstadt roadstead and then from neva river firing a total of 450 shells destroyer her sister and smaller craft departed kronstadt for evacuation of hanko naval base on 3 november although was sunk by a mine on return voyage remaining ships evacuated 1 200 of hanko defenders to kronstadt and leningrad with destroyer minelayer ural four minesweepers six torpedo boats and submarine she departed kronstadt on 13 november to evacuate remaining garrison of hanko on what proved to be her last voyage after midnight ships ran into a minefield and early on 14 november surovy collided with stalled minesweeper t 217 collision caused a hole above her waterline latter was sealed with bedding but minutes later her paravane detonated a mine from hull knocking out power in several compartments and deforming hull this resulted in split seams enabling flooding in her boiler and turbine rooms that created an eight degree list to port after turbofans and pumps failed although crew extinguished a fire in one boiler room raised steam in another and restarted turbogenerator and diesel generator in a machine room pumps could not cope with flooding and list reached twelve degrees at 05 00 as a result her captain ordered crew to abandon ship and about twenty minutes later they had been completely transferred to a minesweeper destroyer quickly sank after explosion of her depth charges surovy was officially struck from navy list on 19 november balakin pp 71 72 citations sources further reading category storozhevoy class destroyers category 1939 ships
