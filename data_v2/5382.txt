cover version recorded by singer sandie shaw featuring smiths members marr andy rourke and mike joyce as backing musicians reached no 27 on uk singles chart background and recording morrissey and marr wrote hand in glove in january 1983 between second and third concerts smiths ever played morrissey said that after marr gave him a demo cassette of song he went home and wrote lyrics for it in span of two hours conscious of fact that it would be group s first recorded work goddard p 27 even prior to performing song live group was unanimous in opinion that hand in glove was their strongest song to date goddard p 28 smiths asked their manager joe moss to fund recording of hand in glove in late february group booked a one day recording session at strawberry studios in stockport at cost of ps250 which they produced themselves morrissey claimed in later years that he was dissatisfied with his vocal and returned a week later to re record his part day after which entire group travelled to london and convinced rough trade owner geoff travis to release record however author simon goddard noted that it was not until april 1983 that marr and bassist andy rourke visited rough trade offices on that occasion marr handed travis a cassette featuring hand in glove and a live recording of handsome devil telling travis l isten to this it s not just another tape impressed travis promised he would following monday travis called group and invited them back to london to release hand in glove as a single both parties agreed to release single as a temporary arrangement before agreeing to any long term partnership goddard p 28 29 two months after single s release smiths recorded song again during aborted sessions for their debut album with producer troy tate this version was recorded a tone lower than original in key of f minor and features a shorter introduction smiths recorded song again with producer john porter in october at manchester s pluto studios morrissey rejected this version of song due to impending deadlines version that ultimately appeared on band s first album smiths was a remix of original master recording from strawberry studios session for this version porter increased separation between marr s guitar tracks and morrissey s vocals emphasised drummer mike joyce s drum beat pushed rourke s bass back in mix and created a more dramatic opening and conclusion to song goddard p 32 composition and lyrics original recorded version of hand in glove is in key of g minor song begins with an overdub of marr playing a harmonica over rest of music simon goddard wrote that marr s use of instrument purposefully evoked very same blunt vitality of working class that ian mcdonald attributes to beatles parallel 1962 single love me do though infinitely more melancholy of backing music goddard wrote marr s redolent minor chord wash weeps with a rain soaked hopelessness while rourke contributes one of his most inspired bass patterns goddard p 31 morrissey explained that song s theme was complete loneliness going on to state it was important to me that that there d be something searingly poetic about it in a lyrical sense and yet jubilant at same time goddard described hand in glove as a bleak proclamation of doomed happiness a shattering left hook of self loathing loss and desperation years later morrissey considered song to be group s most special singer said he was particularly proud of song s second verse which included lines though we may be hidden by rags we have something they ll never have morrissey explained that verse described how i felt when i couldn t afford clothes and used to dress in rags but i didn t really feel mentally impoverished in song s lyrics morrissey referenced works by playwright shelagh delaney whom he would reference in several later songs song s line i ll probably never see you again appears in delaney s kitchen sink realism play a taste of honey and lion in love morrissey paraphrased line everything depends upon how near you stand next to me from 1974 leonard cohen song take this longing goddard conjectures that song s title was inspired by 1947 detective novel hand in glove by ngaio marsh lyrics are also quoted in coda of pretty girls make graves another song from band s first album song starts with lines hand in glove sun shines out of our behinds and then states that no it s not like any other love this one s different because it s us lyrics then state that people stare and good people laugh but we have something they ll never have song ends with repeated line i ll probably never see you again intro to song uses chords f major sus2 e major and b major verse uses chord g minor 7 f7 sus2 and e major transcription cited is transposed to e minor instead of g minor
