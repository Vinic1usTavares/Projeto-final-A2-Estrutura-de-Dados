javan rhinoceros rhinoceros sondaicus also known as sunda rhinoceros or lesser one horned rhinoceros is a very rare member of family rhinocerotidae and one of five extant rhinoceroses it belongs to same genus as indian rhinoceros and has similar mosaic armour like skin but at in length and in height it is smaller closer in size to black rhinoceros of genus its horn is usually shorter than and is smaller than those of other rhino species only adult males have horns females lack them altogether once most widespread of asian rhinoceroses javan rhinoceros ranged from islands of java and sumatra throughout southeast asia and into india and china species is critically endangered with only one known population in wild and no individuals in captivity it is possibly rarest large mammal on earth with a population of as few as 58 to 61 in ujung kulon national park at western tip of java in indonesia a second population in cat tien national park in vietnam was declared by some conservation groups to be extinct in 2011 decline of javan rhinoceros is attributed to poaching primarily for their horns which are highly valued in traditional chinese medicine fetching as much as us 30 000 per kg on black market as european presence in their range increased trophy hunting also became a serious threat loss of habitat especially as result of wars such as vietnam war in southeast asia has also contributed to species decline and hindered recovery remaining range is within one nationally protected area but rhinos are still at risk from poachers disease and loss of genetic diversity leading to inbreeding depression javan rhino can live around 30 45 years in wild it historically inhabited lowland rain forest wet grasslands and large floodplains it is mostly solitary except for courtship and offspring rearing though groups may occasionally congregate near wallows and salt licks aside from humans adults have no predators in their range javan rhino usually avoids humans scientists and conservationists rarely study animals directly due to their extreme rarity and danger of interfering with such an endangered species researchers rely on camera traps and fecal samples to gauge health and behavior consequently javan rhino is least studied of all rhino species two adult rhinos with their calves were filmed in a motion triggered video released on 28 february 2011 by wwf and indonesia s national park authority which proved it is still breeding in wild in april 2012 national parks authority released video showing 35 individual javan rhinos including mother offspring pairs and courting adults there are only 58 to 68 individuals left in wild and none in captivity after death of a male rhinoceros named samson samson died in april 2018 at 30 years of age far younger than species usual lifespan of 50 to 60 years so dna testing is being conducted to explore cause of death including possibility of inbreeding degeneration taxonomy and naming first studies of javan rhinoceros by naturalists from outside of its region took place in 1787 when two animals were shot in java skulls were sent to renowned dutch naturalist petrus camper who died in 1789 before he was able to publish his discovery that rhinos of java were a distinct species another javan rhinoceros was shot on island of sumatra by alfred who sent specimen to his stepfather georges cuvier famous french scientist cuvier recognized animal as a distinct species in 1822 and in same year it was identified by anselme gaetan desmarest as rhinoceros sondaicus it was last species of rhinoceros to be identified desmarest initially identified rhino as being from sumatra but later amended this to say his specimen was from java genus name rhinoceros which also includes indian rhinoceros is derived from ancient greek words ris which means nose and keras which means horn sondaicus is derived from sunda biogeographical region that comprises islands of sumatra java borneo and surrounding smaller islands javan rhino is also known as lesser one horned rhinoceros in contrast with greater one horned rhinoceros another name for indian rhino of three distinct subspecies only one still is known to exist r s sondaicus nominate subspecies known as indonesian javan rhinoceros once lived on java and sumatra population estimated at 63 individuals is now confined to ujung kulon national park on western tip of island of java one researcher has suggested that javan rhino on sumatra belonged to a distinct subspecies r s but this is not widely accepted r s annamiticus known as vietnamese javan rhinoceros or vietnamese rhinoceros once lived across south china vietnam cambodia laos thailand and malaysia subspecific annamiticus is derived from mountain range in southeast asia part of this subspecies range in 2006 a single population estimated at fewer than 12 remaining rhinos lived in an area of lowland forest in cat tien national park in vietnam genetic analysis suggested this subspecies and indonesian javan rhinoceros last shared a common ancestor between 300 000 and 2 million years ago last known individual of this population was shot by a poacher in 2010 r s inermis known as indian javan rhinoceros or lesser indian rhinoceros once ranged from bengal to burma but is presumed to have gone extinct before 1925 subspecific inermis means unarmed as most distinctive characteristic of this subspecies is small horns in males and evident lack of horns in females original specimen of this species was a hornless female political situation in burma has prevented an assessment of species in that country but its survival is considered unlikely evolution thumb indian rhinoceros pictured here is species most closely related to javan rhinoceros they are two members of type genus rhinoceros ancestral rhinoceroses are held to have first diverged from other perissodactyls in early eocene mitochondrial dna comparison suggests ancestors of modern rhinos split from ancestors of around 50 million years ago extant family rhinocerotidae first appeared in late eocene in eurasia and ancestors of extant rhino species dispersed from asia beginning in miocene indian and javan rhinoceros only members of genus rhinoceros first appear in fossil record in asia around 1 6 million 3 3 million years ago molecular estimates however suggest two species diverged from each other much earlier around 11 7 million years ago although belonging to type genus indian and javan rhinoceroses are not believed to be closely related to other rhino species different studies have hypothesized that they may be closely related to extinct or punjabitherium a detailed cladistic analysis of rhinocerotidae placed rhinoceros and extinct punjabitherium in a clade with sumatran rhino other studies have suggested sumatran rhinoceros is more closely related to two african species sumatran rhino may have diverged from other asian rhinos 15 million years ago or perhaps as far back as 25 9 million years ago based on mitochondrial data description thumb left captive javan rhino around 1900 javan rhino is smaller than indian rhinoceros and is close in size to black rhinoceros it is largest animal in java and second largest animal in indonesia after asian elephant length of javan rhino including its head is 2 to 4 metres 6 5 to 13 feet and it can reach a height of adults are variously reported to weigh between although a study to collect accurate measurements of animals has never been conducted and is not a priority because of their extreme conservation status no substantial size difference is seen between genders but females may be slightly bigger rhinos in vietnam appeared to be significantly smaller than those in java based on studies of photographic evidence and measurements of their footprints like indian rhino javan rhinoceros has a single horn other extant species have two horns its horn is smallest of all extant rhinos usually less than with longest recorded only only males have horns female javan rhinos are only extant rhinos that remain hornless into adulthood though they may develop a tiny bump of an inch or two in height javan rhinoceros does not appear to often use its horn for fighting but instead uses it to scrape mud away in wallows to pull down plants for eating and to open paths through thick vegetation similar to other browsing species of rhino black and sumatran javan rhino has a long pointed upper lip which helps in grabbing food its lower incisors are long and sharp when javan rhino fights it uses these teeth behind incisors two rows of six low crowned molars are used for chewing coarse plants like all rhinos javan rhino smells and hears well but has very poor vision they are estimated to live for 30 to 45 years its hairless gray or gray brown skin falls in folds to shoulder back and rump skin has a natural mosaic pattern which lends rhino an armored appearance neck folds of javan rhinoceros are smaller than those of indian rhinoceros but still form a saddle shape over shoulder because of risks of interfering with such an endangered species however javan rhinoceros is primarily studied through fecal sampling and camera traps they are rarely encountered observed or measured directly distribution and habitat thumb java s ujung kulon national park is home of all remaining javan rhinos even most optimistic estimate suggests fewer than 100 javan rhinos remain in wild they are considered one of most endangered species in world javan rhinoceros is known to survive in only one place ujung kulon national park on western tip of java animal was once widespread from assam and bengal where their range would have overlapped with both sumatran and indian rhinos eastward to myanmar thailand cambodia laos vietnam and southwards to malay peninsula and islands of sumatra java and possibly borneo javan rhino primarily inhabits dense lowland rain forests grasslands and reed beds with abundant rivers large floodplains or wet areas with many mud wallows although it historically preferred low lying areas subspecies in vietnam was pushed onto much higher ground up to 2 000 m or 6 561 ft probably because of human encroachment and poaching range of javan rhinoceros has been shrinking for at least 3 000 years starting around 1000 bc northern range of rhinoceros extended into china but began moving southward at roughly per year as human settlements increased in region it likely became locally extinct in india in first decade of 20th century javan rhino was hunted to extinction on malay peninsula by 1932 last ones on sumatra died out during world war ii they were extinct from chittagong and by middle of 20th century by end of vietnam war vietnamese rhinoceros was believed extinct across all of mainland asia local hunters and woodcutters in cambodia claim to have seen javan rhinos in cardamom mountains but surveys of area have failed to find any evidence of them in late 1980s a small population was found in cat tien area of vietnam however last individual of that population was shot in 2010 wwf 25 october 2011 inadequate protection causes javan rhino extinction in vietnam a population may have existed on island of borneo as well though these specimens could have been sumatran rhinoceros a small population of which still lives there behavior thumb a museum specimen of a juvenile r s sondaicus javan rhinoceros is a solitary animal with exception of breeding pairs and mothers with calves they sometimes congregate in small groups at salt licks and mud wallows wallowing in mud is a common behavior for all rhinos activity allows them to maintain cool body temperatures and helps prevent disease and parasite infestation javan rhinoceros does not generally dig its own mud wallows preferring to use other animals wallows or naturally occurring pits which it will use its horn to enlarge salt licks are also very important because of essential nutrients rhino receives from salt male home ranges are larger at 2 compared to female which are around 2 male territories overlap each other less than those of female it is not known if there are territorial fights males mark their territories with dung piles and by urine spraying scrapes made by feet in ground and twisted saplings also seem to be used for communication members of other rhino species have a peculiar habit of defecating in massive rhino dung piles and then scraping their back feet in dung sumatran and javan rhinos while defecating in piles do not engage in scraping this adaptation in behavior is thought to be ecological in wet forests of java and sumatra method may not be useful for spreading odors javan rhino is much less vocal than sumatran very few javan rhino vocalizations have ever been recorded adults have no known predators other than humans species particularly in vietnam is skittish and retreats into dense forests whenever humans are near though a valuable trait from a survival standpoint it has made rhinos difficult to study nevertheless when humans approach too closely javan rhino becomes aggressive and will attack stabbing with incisors of its lower jaw while thrusting upward with its head its comparatively antisocial behavior may be a recent adaptation to population stresses historical evidence suggests they like other rhinos were once more gregarious diet javan rhinoceros is herbivorous eating diverse plant species especially their shoots twigs young foliage and fallen fruit most of plants favored by species grow in sunny areas in forest clearings shrubland and other vegetation types with no large trees rhino knocks down saplings to reach its food and grabs it with its prehensile upper lip it is most adaptable feeder of all rhino species currently it is a pure browser but probably once both browsed and grazed in its historical range rhino eats an estimated of food daily like sumatran rhino it needs salt in its diet salt licks common in its historical range do not exist in ujung kulon but rhinos there have been observed drinking seawater likely for same nutritional need conservation thumb left a painting from 1861 depicts hunting of r s sondaicus main factor in continued decline of javan rhinoceros population has been poaching for horns a problem that affects all rhino species horns have been a traded commodity for more than 2 000 years in china where they are believed to have healing properties historically rhinoceros hide was used to make armor for chinese soldiers and some local tribes in vietnam believed hide could be used to make an antidote for snake venom because rhinoceros range encompasses many areas of poverty it has been difficult to convince local people not to kill a seemingly otherwise useless animal which could be sold for a large sum of money when convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora first went into effect in 1975 javan rhinoceros was placed under complete appendix 1 protection all international trade in javan rhinoceros and products derived from it is illegal surveys of rhinoceros horn black market have determined that asian rhinoceros horn fetches a price as high as 30 000 per kg three times value of african rhinoceros horn as with many types of asian and african megafauna javan rhino was relentlessly hunted by trophy and big game hunters for decades following arrival of europeans in its range rhinos being easy targets this was as severe a contributor to its decline as was poaching for its horns such was toll of big game hunting that by time rhino s plight was made known to world only javan and then unknown vietnamese populations remained loss of habitat because of agriculture has also contributed to its decline though this is no longer as significant a factor because rhinoceros only lives in one nationally protected park deteriorating habitats have hindered recovery of rhino populations that fell victim to poaching even with all conservation efforts prospects for their survival are grim because population is restricted to one small area they are very susceptible to disease and inbreeding depression conservation geneticists estimate a population of 100 rhinos would be needed to preserve genetic diversity of this conservation reliant species ujung kulon thumb a dutch hunter with a dead r s sondaicus in ujung kulon 1895 ujung kulon peninsula of java was devastated by eruption of krakatoa in 1883 javan rhinoceros recolonized peninsula after event but humans never returned in large numbers thus creating a haven for wildlife in 1931 as javan rhinoceros was on brink of extinction in sumatra government of dutch east indies declared rhino a legally protected species which it has remained ever since a census of rhinos in ujung kulon was first conducted in 1967 only 25 animals were recorded by 1980 that population had doubled and has remained steady at about 50 ever since although rhinos in ujung kulon have no natural predators they have to compete for scarce resources with wild cattle which may keep their numbers below peninsula s carrying capacity ujung kulon is managed by indonesian ministry of forestry evidence of at least four baby rhinos was discovered in 2006 most ever documented for species in march 2011 a hidden camera video was published showing adults and juveniles indicating recent matings and breeding during period from january to october 2011 cameras had captured images of 35 rhinos as of december 2011 a rhino breeding sanctuary in an area of 38 000 hectares is being finalized to help reach target of 70 to 80 javan rhinos by 2015 in april 2012 wwf and international rhino foundation added 120 video cameras to existing 40 to better monitor rhino movements and judge size of animals population a recent survey has found far fewer females than males only four females among 17 rhinos were recorded in eastern half of ujung kulon which is a potential setback in efforts to save species with ujung kulon as last resort of this species all javan rhinos are in one location an advantage over sumatran rhino which is dispersed in different unconnected areas poaching for their horns is also no longer as serious a threat as in past due to stricter international regulations on rhino horn active protection efforts by local authorities rhinos elusiveness and ujung kulon s remoteness however there are still obstacles to species recovery being concentrated in such a relatively small area makes species extremely susceptible to disease and tsunamis in 2012 asian rhino project was working out best eradication programme for palm which was blanketing park and crowding out rhinos food sources following trails of javan rhinoceros allowed in depth observation of their feeding habits in their natural habitat comparing acid insoluble ash ma content of faeces and in dry weight of food provided reliable estimates of digestibility and this method has potential for wider application in situations where total collection of faecal matter is not feasible there was a strong positive correlation between size of home range and diversity of food intake and between size of home range with numbers of wallow holes used quantity and quality of food intake were variable among rhinoceroses and over time overall energy consumption was related to size of animal while digestibility of plants consumed appeared to be influenced by individual age and habitat conditions in may 2017 director of biodiversity conservation at ministry of environment and forestry bambang announced plans to transfer rhinos to wildlife sanctuary located in west java animals will first undergo dna tests to determine lineage and risk to disease so as to avoid issues such as inbreeding or marriage kinship as of december 2018 these plans had yet to concretely materialise in december 2018 remaining javan rhino population was severely endangered by tsunami triggered by nearby volcano anak krakatau cat tien thumb head of a male r s annamiticus shot in perak on malay peninsula once widespread in southeast asia javan rhinoceros was presumed extinct in vietnam in mid 1970s at end of vietnam war combat wrought havoc on ecosystems of region through use of napalm extensive defoliation from agent orange aerial bombing use of landmines and overhunting by local poachers in 1988 assumption of subspecies extinction was challenged when a hunter shot an adult female proving species had somehow survived war in 1989 scientists surveyed vietnam s southern forests to search for evidence of other survivors fresh tracks belonging to up to 15 rhinos were found along dong nai river largely because of rhinoceros region they inhabited became part of cat tien national park in 1992 by early 2000s their population was feared to have declined past point of recovery in vietnam with some conservationists estimating as few as three to eight rhinos and possibly no males survived conservationists debated whether or not vietnamese rhinoceros had any chance of survival with some arguing that rhinos from indonesia should be introduced in an attempt to save population with others arguing that population could recover genetic analysis of dung samples collected in cat tien national park in a survey from october 2009 to march 2010 showed only a single individual javan rhinoceros remained in park in early may 2010 body of a javan rhino was found in park animal had been shot and its horn removed by poachers in october 2011 international rhino foundation confirmed javan rhinoceros was extinct in vietnam leaving only rhinos in ujung kulon in captivity a javan rhinoceros has not been exhibited in a zoo for over a century in 19th century at least four rhinos were exhibited in adelaide calcutta and london at least 22 javan rhinos have been documented as having been kept in captivity true number is possibly greater as species was sometimes confused with indian rhinoceros javan rhinoceros never fared well in captivity oldest lived to be 20 about half age that rhinos can reach in wild no records are known of a captive rhino giving birth last captive javan rhino died at adelaide zoo in australia in 1907 where species was so little known that it had been exhibited as an indian rhinoceros in culture thumb rhino tormenting damned in heaven and hell gallery at angkor wat 12th century javan rhinoceros occurred in cambodia in past and there are at least three depictions of rhinos in bas reliefs of temple at angkor wat west wing of north gallery has a relief that shows a rhino mounted by a god thought to be fire god agni rhinos are thought to be javan rhinoceros rather than somewhat similar looking one horned indian rhino on basis of on shoulder which continues along back in javan to give a saddle like appearance a depiction of rhino in east wing of south gallery shows a rhino attacking damned in panel depicting heaven and hell an architect of temple is thought to have been an indian brahmin priest named 1040 1120 ad who served king vi i as well as suryavarman ii who constructed temple it is thought that indian priest who died before construction of temple might have influenced use of tubercles on skin which are based on indian rhino while local khmer artisans carved other details of rhinos based on more familiar local javan rhino association of rhinoceros as vahana of god agni is unique to khmer culture another rhinoceros carving in centre of a circular arrangement in a column with other circles containing elephants and water buffalo is known from temple of ta prohm it has been at centre of anachronistic speculation that it might represent a stegosaur due to leaves behind it that give impression of plates threats according to world wide fund for nature wwf javan rhino is most threatened rhino species with only 58 68 remaining in ujung national park in java indonesia wwf has listed several threats faced by javan rhino that result in its designation as critically endangered one of those threats is its reduced genetic diversity because low number of existing javan rhinos results in a low amount of genetic diversity and increased inbreeding making it difficult for javan rhino to survive wwf also identifies natural disasters as another threat faced by javan rhinos because ujung national park can be affected by tsunamis or explosion of nearby volcano anak krakatau which potentially could wipe out entire javan rhino species one such eruption and tsunami in 2018 wreaked heavy damage on regency district which contains ujung kulon national park however park and its rhino population were not significantly affected a third threat identified by wwf is disease given that four javan rhinos are believed to have died from a disease transmitted to them by wild cattle another threat is habitat degradation since wwf reports that people are encroaching and developing areas near ujung national park and thus destroying last known habitat of javan rhino references external links javan rhino info and pictures on rhino resource center international rhino foundation dedicated to conservation of rhinos javan
