gia dinh changed hands in 1787 duyet began organizing and commanding his own unit and individually recruited his own enlisted men choi p 52 in 1788 tide began to turn in favour of nguyen after pigneau

victory in thi nai which was a turning point of war and heralded complete collapse of tay son in same year a close colleague tong viet phuc was killed in battle by tay son leading duyet to fly into an almost insane rage and start killing every enemy soldier he came across leading nguyen anh to rebuke him shortly thereafter nguyen anh exploited absence of most of tay son s army which was attempting to recapture quy nhon to lead his army in an attack on phu xuan capital of tay son however nguyen encountered heavy resistance from tay son forces around tu dung sea gate entrance into citadel of phu

1812 emperor gia long appointed duyet as viceroy of gia dinh at this time viceroy of gia dinh held jurisdiction not only over cochinchina southern vietnam but also over cambodia post of viceroy had significant powers although no precise description of head of gia dinh s responsibilities survives to this day rights of his northern counterpart included power to decide lawsuits and to appoint and dismiss officials at his own will it is enough only to report to court after acting at his own discretion gia long trusted duyet and his fellow southerners all of viceroy s deputies were locally bred men whereas many of those who ran north were not this allowed duyet and his entourage to develop a strong support base with grassroots population and gave them more gravitas with which to rule choi pp 48 49 he also tried to expand support base for nguyen in south by appointing newly arrived chinese refugees who had fled their homeland after fall of ming dynasty as well as former rebels and bandits to administrative posts if they were qualified and encouraging their integration into and participation in society choi pp 60 75 cooke p 86 under system of time military governors such as duyet moved

built two citadels nam vang and la liem on cambodian territory in order to maintain vietnamese jurisdiction over nation which was formally made a protectorate adding to his prestige tran trong kim pp

and he and pham dang hung another southerner were only people present as emperor died gia long decreed that duyet take command of five royal regiments choi p 58 after pacifying central vietnam duyet was reappointed to be viceroy of southern vietnam and cambodia in 1820 by emperor minh mang gia long s successor huynh minh p 131 emperor further enhanced duyet s powers by allowing him power to oversee all foreign trade coming into his area and collect taxes in cambodia and on imports and exports at his discretion this gave duyet control over vast economic resources in fertile agricultural and lumber rich region and most importantly land development southern area had only been populated by ethnic vietnamese in recent centuries and immigration clearing and development of land was rapid choi p 48 at beginning of his second period as viceroy duyet suppressed a revolt of local khmer people and enlisted ten thousand new taxpayers thereby generating a large new revenue source for court he supervised renovation of vinh te canal an important waterway in southern vietnam moreover duyet was successful in suppressing unrest and criminal activity and increasing foreign trade in southern vietnam and cambodia choi pp 69 70 duyet s works greatly stabilized and developed southern vietnam turning it into a wealthy and peaceful region choi pp 58 59 as recognition for duyet s service minh mang rewarded duyet with a belt made of jade a prestigious gift in confucian system usually given to an emperor as a tribute or by a monarch to an official to honour a great service and betrothed a princess to duyet s adopted son as a wife duyet was also involved in internal palace machinations he became involved in a bitter rivalry with general nguyen van thanh viceroy of northern vietnam and commander of center division thanh was another of gia long s leading generals duyet was assisted in this dispute by nguyen huu nghi who had been a former confidant of thanh before defecting later another soldier who had served thanh was caught mingling in duyet s military camp and was captured duyet claimed that man confessed to being sent by thanh to assassinate him on another hand duyet was mandarin who charged former crown prince canh s wife for having an incestuous relationship with her eldest son and then executed her by drowning in 1824 duyet s action effectively ended claim to vietnam s throne by prince canh s descendants according to one report however minh mang had already been informed from another quarter of affair choi byung wook a korean historian described this event as a most dramatic event illustrating le van duyet s loyalty to minh mang conflict with minh mang thumb minh mang second emperor of nguyen dynasty alt a black and white painting a clean shaven man in a traditional asian gown with a picture of a lion on his chest is seated he wears an ornamental headpiece and other dragon motifs can be seen on his clothes two subordinates in plain robes stand behind him on either side wearing simple there was a lot of tension between duyet and minh mang although gia long had enlisted european support to claim throne and allowed missionaries to function in vietnam in gratitude to pigneau buttinger pp 241 311 he ran a classical confucian administration he also expressed dismay at catholic condemnation of traditional ancestral worship a basic tenet of vietnamese culture crown prince canh had been converted by pigneau and subsequently refused to bow down to his ancestors instead desecrating a shrine with feces buttinger pp 310 262 as crown prince canh had died of smallpox during war against tay son it was assumed that canh s son would succeed gia long but in 1816 nguyen phuc dam son of gia long s second wife was appointed instead buttinger p 268 gia long chose him for his strong character and his deeply conservative aversion to westerners whereas canh s lineage had converted to catholicism and had shunned confucian traditions such as ancestor worship buttinger p 269 gia long told his son to treat europeans especially french respectfully but not to grant them any position of preponderance minh mang disliked duyet because he was one of many high ranking mandarins who opposed gia long s succession plan choi pp 56 57 duyet and many of his southern associates tended to be favourable to christianity and supported installation of nguyen phuc canh s descendants as a result duyet was held in high regard by catholic community historian mark mcleod said that as head of a region enjoying substantial autonomy le van duyet had good reason to prefer that empire be ruled after gia long s death by an immature or malleable monarch mcleod p 24 according to mcleod as duyet was not from a scholar gentry background and lacked a classical confucian education he did not place a great emphasis on tradition and was more concerned with military needs and that as a result he would be more interested in maintaining strong relations with europeans so that he could acquire weapons from them rather than worrying about social implications of westernization there was also speculation that gia long was worried that canh s 18 year old heir was too young and could have been manipulated and that he would forget his eastern roots whereas more mature minh mang aged 26 would not gia long was aware of fact that catholic clergy were opposed to installation of minh mang minh mang began to place restrictions on catholicism mcleod p 26 he enacted edicts of interdiction of catholic religion and condemned christianity as a heterodox doctrine he saw catholics as a possible source of division especially as missionaries were arriving in vietnam in ever increasing numbers mcleod p 27 because of role of westerners in war between nguyen and tay son and pigneau s role in recruiting european assistance duyet protected vietnamese catholic converts and westerners from minh mang s and confucian policies by disobeying emperor s orders choi pp 60 61 in defense of christians duyet wrote to ming mang we still have between our teeth rice which missionaries gave us when we were starving hall p 608 this came in response to an imperial edict that ordered missionaries to leave their areas of operation and move to imperial city ostensibly because palace needed translators but in reality to stop catholics from proselytizing mcleod p 28 whereas government officials in central and northern vietnam complied duyet disobeyed order and minh mang was forced to bide his time in meantime southern christians were still publicly identifying themselves as such and their beliefs without facing any obstacles from local officials choi said that from point of view of minh mang and his men land of gia dinh was thoroughly sheltered by le van duyet s prestige choi p 83 duyet s policy towards criminals and former rebels also courted conflict with minh mang in early 19th century nascent years of nguyen dynasty were plagued by incessant revolts particularly in northern and central vietnam this resulted in a large number of rebels being captured along with common criminals and bandits such people were usually internally exiled to opposite part of country so a large number ended up in southern vietnam these included many former rebels who were spared death penalty after being defeated by duyet in northern and central vietnam during his pacification campaigns in late 1810s and had sworn loyalty towards general personally choi pp 66 67 these men were sent south with their wives and children to remove them from potentially rebellious areas and to punish them but another objective was to start military colonies to help develop southern vietnam which had only recently been acquired by ethnic vietnamese choi p 67 convicts were given equipment to work on land and some were later pardoned duyet and gia long had employed surrendered tay son officers in positions of authority and this policy had continued due a shortage of manpower until minh mang came to power duyet wanted to continue this policy and wrote to minh mang for permission but was rejected emperor replied that such a policy was like releasing a monkey to climb up a tree choi pp 68 69 for minh mang placement of former convicts and rebels in positions of power was contrary to confucian system of order and debauched prestige of state whereas duyet was only concerned with practicality choi p 69 during 1820s duyet s continued cultivated of relations with immigrant chinese community that had settled in southern vietnam in large numbers brought him into conflict with minh mang general had adopted a chinese immigrant merchant as his son and gave him favours including appointing him to position of body that regulated trade japanese historian concluded that duyet and his entourage were given financial rewards and gifts from chinese merchants in return for favourable treatment by government officials choi pp 77 78 it was also pointed out that another of duyet s men was himself a businessman who had a chinese agent at time southern vietnam was producing rice in plentiful quantities but export was banned by minh mang but prices in vietnam which were lower than those overseas kept rising by 50 100 in various parts of country in five years cooke p 87 in meantime opium supply kept on increasing it was thought that chinese merchants whom duyet patronised were illegally exporting rice at higher prices and then bringing back opium during return journeys along with incoming immigrants choi pp 70 75 for his part general disagreed with prevailing view held by emperor and said that people of both races were engaging in illegal trading as well as blaming incoming immigrants personal addictions rather than chinese merchants for bringing in opium historian nola cooke said that duyet s viewpoint was more plausible and speculated that emperor s stance was borne more out of a fear of consequences of a disproportionate chinese influence on country than reality of illegal trading duyet wanted to further give tax concessions to newly arrived chinese immigrants that were deemed to be impoverished to encourage immigration and speed up development of region something that emperor was sceptical of on reasoning that it was difficult to genuinely determine who was in need and that concession system was therefore open to rorting cooke pp 86 94 choi p 79 nevertheless duyet disobeyed minh mang and tax concessions were granted because of their involvement in illegal exportation of rice and importation of opium minh mang tried to ban chinese from engaging in sea trade in 1827 but this was easily circumvented by merchants who exploited their contacts with duyet and used fraudulent registrations often under name of vietnamese wives choi p 80 it was not until duyet died that minh mang was able to crack down on fraudulent sea trade for a time duyet s attitude and stature in south forced minh mang to moderate his policies and allow preaching of christian missionaries however it also increased tension between pair and minh mang was anxious to curtail autonomy that his father had granted to duyet and southerners emperor began to slowly wind back their military powers mcleod pp 28 29 in an attempt to wear down duyet s power base by gradually removing general s close aides choi p 84 thumb 300px layout of original citadel before 1835 citadel of saigon was also called thanh bat quai citadel of eight trigrams or thanh quy citadel of tortoise because of this layout alt black and white map of layout of citadel which resembles an eight point star in 1821 minh mang sent two of his aides from central vietnam to serve as education officials in south one of objectives was that they would oversee imperial examination process and education system which would allow them to determine who would serve in government as mandarins and therefore fill southern ranks with men acceptable to court however their attempts were either blocked or circumvented by duyet s incumbent officials and they returned to capital two years later in failure choi p 51 in 1823 one of duyet s closest subordinates tran nhat vinh was indicted by one of minh mang s officials from hue who charged him with trading rice on black market and operating a brothel duyet put a stop to legal proceedings and angrily tried to turn tables calling on emperor to execute accusing official choi p 85 this ended in a stalemate but a few years later vinh was transferred to northern vietnam and later imprisoned while duyet was unable to do anything about matter in south vinh s position was taken by one of emperor s men in 1826 duyet resisted removal of a regional official by palace leading emperor to criticise him in a proclamation declaring that court appointments came under purview of hue following year duyet executed convicted criminals without informing capital leading emperor to criticise him again saying that ultimate authority to decide questions of life and death belongs to court mcleod p 29 in 1829 duyet suffered another blow when nguyen van thoai an ally whom he appointed to run cambodia for him died general nominated another subordinate to replace his colleague nguyen van xuan but minh mang overruled him and instead appointed one of his mandarins bui minh duc to post although emperor formally asked duc to cooperate with duyet minh mang then appointed duc to post of minister of board of war putting him above general in chain of command effectively making duyet irrelevant with regards to running of protectorate in 1831 just before duyet s death minh mang began to dismantle his military infrastructure and sending his component units to other parts of vietnam and sent a loyalist general nguyen van to gia dinh allowing him to dilute viceroy s power in addition no government reports could be officially approved and sent to capital until it was countersigned by civil officials sent south by emperor these moves against southern autonomy gradually increased resentment and regionalist sentiments among local population choi p 86 family and personal life le van duyet had a wife named do thi phan apart from le van khoi duyet had another adopted son named le van yen who had married princess ngoc nghien a daughter of gia long duyet was typically described as a stern hot tempered but fair man which made him both feared and respected by people choi pp 54 55 many lower level bureaucrats and military officers were loath to speak to him directly as were some higher officials choi p 54 some later accounts have portrayed his strict ways in a more negative light according to later imperial official phan thuc truc duyet sometimes fatally beat dogs and beheaded senior local officials for no reason duyet was also regarded as an eccentric he raised 30 members of montagnard hill tribes to act as servants and kept exactly 100 chickens and 100 dogs at his home whenever he returned to his official residence after an assignment he ordered a tiger and 50 dogs to march after him choi p 55 in 1825 michel duc chaigneau nephew of gia long s french military mandarin jean baptiste chaigneau visited gia dinh on a government mission and said that duyet has great talent both in battle and administration people fear him but he is heartily loved by people here because he is fair he was also famous for his love of cockfighting hat boi vietnamese classical opera and court dancing all of which were popular with common vietnamese southerner he reportedly gave a long speech praising cockfighting in a joking manner to emperor gia long and sometimes beat drum himself in order to encourage actors and actresses of hat boi troupes when they were performing for him huynh minh pp 211 212 he was also known for his patronage of goddess spirits that were popularly venerated by local southerners in folk religions in addition duyet was instructor of three dinh formalities a code of ceremonial conduct and customs that were copies of royal rituals do p 59 george finlayson a representative of british government who visited gia dinh in 1822 described duyet as a man who liked to dress plainly almost in a manner similar to his peasant constituents finlayson said that duyet has an intelligent look and may be esteemed to possess considerable activity both of mind and body his face is round and soft his features flabby and wrinkled he has no beard and bears considerable resemblance to an old woman his voice too is shrill and feminine duyet s informal manner caused him difficulties during minh mang s administration as second emperor s government was more oriented towards classical confucianism than that of his father younger mandarins regarded duyet and his southern entourage as uncultured and older military officials felt more uncomfortable in court as time went by choi p 59 gia long was also seen a direct and frank man in his dealings while minh mang was seen as being vague in expressing his thoughts to his bureaucrats this was attributed to gia long s dependence on military officers during war years which required him to be blunt and assertive whereas minh mang grew up dealing with court scholars after establishment of nguyen dynasty and was regarded as a quiet and studious monarch after a visit to capital in 1824 duyet found imperial court to be an uncomfortable surrounding and confided in a colleague duyet and fellow southern general le chat then resigned their positions but emperor rejected their offers duyet wanted a post in capital but was not given one in part of suspicions among court that general could launch a palace coup not unlike many insurrections in vietnam s past duyet was sent back to southern vietnam far from royal seat choi pp 59 60 death and legacy thumb grave of le van duyet and his wife alt a cemetery with densely packed headstones made of cement almost no grass or flora can

dinh present day ho chi minh city his tomb was called lang ong ba chieu tomb of marshal in ba chieu by local people huynh minh pp 132 133 duyet s death opened way for minh mang to apply his policies in south as viceroy s subordinates lacked influence to defy court emperor also tried to reduce duyet s followers political power by abolishing post of viceroy and putting south under his direct rule thus making duyet last holder of post soon after duyet s death minh mang s new appointees arrived and took over local administration new officials then launched an investigation and reported that duyet and his aides had engaged in corrupt and abusive practices as a result bach xuan nguyen who led investigation ordered posthumous humiliation of duyet this resulted in desecration of his tomb execution of sixteen relatives and arrests of his colleagues minh mang s attitude led duyet s adopted son khoi to break out of prison and start a revolt against emperor on 10 may 1833 huynh minh p 133 after suppressing revolt which was supported by a siamese invasion lasted three years and briefly took control of south emperor had duyet s tomb desecrated and had a stele with inscription day cho ten

present after establishment of colony of cochinchina duyet was continuously venerated despite french policies of dismantling vietnamese imperial system and its ritual customs duyet s yearly celebrations were attended by politicians of cochinchina this was allowed to continue despite a legend in southern vietnam that duyet had appeared in dreams of nguyen trung truc a fisherman who famously led a peasant army against french colonization and advised him on how to fight foreigners in 1937 thanks to donations from a number of colonial government officials and members of business elite duyet s tomb was renovated and extended under south vietnamese rule duyet was considered a great national hero and his image appeared on banknotes while prominent streets were named after him in contrast duyet was held in low regard by current vietnamese communist party government because of his role in expansion of french influence in vietnam in line with communist designation of nguyen dynasty as feudal and reactionary after fall of saigon in 1975 duyet s tomb became dilapidated because of lack of state maintenance and streets named in his honour were renamed ray louis p 351 dodd lewis p 101 this attitude remained unchanged until 2008 when current government had duyet s tomb renovated and allowed a play portraying his life to be performed publicly nevertheless duyet is widely regarded by southern vietnamese people as most important local hero choi described duyet s popularity as follows no matter whether they are indigenous vietnamese or chinese settlers buddhists or
