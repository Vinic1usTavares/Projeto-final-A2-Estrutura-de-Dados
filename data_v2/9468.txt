think for yourself is a song by english rock band beatles from their 1965 album rubber soul it was written by george harrison band s lead guitarist and together with if i needed someone marked start of his emergence as a songwriter beside john lennon and paul mccartney song s lyrics advocate independent thinking and reflect beatles move towards more sophisticated concepts in their writing at this stage of their career song has invited interpretation as both a political statement and a love song as harrison dismisses a lover or friend in a tone that some commentators liken to bob dylan s 1965 single positively 4th street among musicologists composition has been recognised as adventurous in degree of tonal ambiguity it employs across parallel major and minor keys and through its suggestion of multiple musical modes beatles recorded think for yourself in november 1965 towards end of sessions for rubber soul in a departure from convention track includes two bass guitar parts one standard and one played through a fuzzbox performed by mccartney this fuzz bass serves as a lead guitar line throughout song and marked first time that a bass guitar had been recorded using a fuzzbox device as opposed to manipulating equipment to achieve a distorted sound group overdubbed their harmony vocals during a lighthearted session that was also intended to provide material for their 1965 fan club christmas disc a snippet from this session was used in beatles 1968 animated film yellow submarine song has also appeared on 1976 compilation best of george harrison and on 1999 yellow submarine songtrack album background and inspiration in his 1980 autobiography i me mine george harrison recalls little about inspiration behind think for yourself he said that his intention was to target narrow minded thinking and identified british government as a possible source partly as a result of vagueness of his comments song has invited interpretation as both a political commentary and a statement on a failing personal relationship song reflects influence of bob dylan with whom beatles had spent time socialising in may 1965 in london and then in mid august following band s concert at shea stadium in new york just as their songs had encouraged dylan to embrace rock music dylan s work inspired beatles and particularly harrison as a nascent songwriter to address more sophisticated concepts than standard love song in addition since march that year harrison s outlook had been transformed by his and john lennon s experiences with hallucinogenic drug lsd in a 1987 interview he said that drug had revealed to him futility of band s widespread fame author george case groups think for yourself with two lennon mccartney compositions from beatles rubber soul album i m looking through you and word as examples of how band s focus had progressed from excited songs of juvenile love to adult meditations on independence estrangement and brotherhood in ringo starr s later recollection rubber soul was beatles departure record written and recorded during a period when largely through influence of marijuana we were expanding in all areas of our lives opening up to a lot of different attitudes composition musical form think for yourself has a 4 4 time signature and is set to a moderate rock beat after a two bar introduction structure comprises three combinations of verse and chorus with final chorus being repeated in full followed by what musicologist alan pollack terms a petit reprise of last phrase to close song chorus sections contrast rhythmically with verses providing a more upbeat mood song s musical key is a combination of g major and g minor pollack comments that whereas lennon and paul mccartney had regularly employed a major key and its parallel minor to provide an element of contrast in their songs harrison s composition ensures that two modes are blended so creating a form that is neither quite really major nor minor in description of musicologist dominic pedler while g major appears to be central key song s musical premise involves permanent tonic key ambiguity and restless root movement through extensive borrowing from parallel minor key g7 chord over introduction suggests a tonic key of g major and a musical mode of g mixolydian yet verse opens with a minor ii chord in roman numeral analysis which suggests a dorian mode and subsequent change to d minor then suggests a aeolian mode in which chord represents iv immediate shift to a b chord iii in g major followed by a c chord iv in g major creates further ambiguity since these chords hint at a vi vii rock run in d aeolian during chorus pedler continues anticipated tonic identifying v i d7 g7 shift is preceded by an unexpected vi e b chord in second inversion that undermines its tonal direction unusual chord progression is an example of beatles use of chords for added harmonic expression a device that harrison adopted from lennon s approach to melody musicologist walter everett describes composition as a tour de force of altered scale degrees he adds that such is ambiguity throughout its tonal quality forms perfect conspirator with text s and rhythm s hesitations and unexpected turns pollack also views composition as musically adventurous he identifies it as a curious stylistic hybrid in pop rock genre comprising blues inflected motifs within a folk based framework lyrics song s message recalls that of dylan s september 1965 single positively 4th street as harrison appears to be ending a relationship possibly with a lover lyrics adopt an accusatory stance from opening line i ve got a word or two to say about things that you do author ian inglis describes song as a withering attack in which harrison s blunt i left you far behind and dylan s curt it s not my problem from positively 4th street could be spoken by same voice harrison also incorporates dylan esque surrealism in his reference to opaque minds and in line good things that we can have if we close our eyes according to beatles biographer jonathan gould despite harrison having envisaged think for yourself as a form of social commentary contemporary listeners most likely interpreted it as a love song given limited perception afforded work of pop artists as a result gould includes composition among a new genre of anti love songs a style that was inaugurated by dylan in 1964 and later developed by rolling stones when read as a farewell to a romantic partner according to james decker an english literature academic and henry miller scholar lyrics express view that their relationship is based on a false reality whereby individual is submerged within bounds of relationship in final verse harrison urges his partner to try thinking more confident that she too will come to see emptiness in her life choices while adhering to this particular interpretation of think for yourself decker says that harrison and beatles have thus raised stakes from naive idealism of hand holding that typified love songs of period in opinion of steve of paste magazine song implores listeners to question what they re told and live a more examined conscious life author and critic kenneth womack identifies an air of superiority in harrison s lyrics in his description song represents inaugural entry with shades of don t bother me in harrison s existential philosophy later to be by eastern religion and thought about mind numbingly automatic and insensate manner in which human beings undertake their lives in world recording basic track beatles recorded think for yourself towards end of sessions for rubber soul at which point they were under pressure to meet deadline for completing album recording for song which had a working title of won t be there with you took place at emi studios now abbey road studios in london on 8 november 1965 group achieved a satisfactory basic track in one take with a line up comprising two electric guitars bass guitar and drums lennon s guitar contribution does not appear on completed recording however instead he overdubbed a keyboard part played on either a vox continental organ or an electric piano fuzz bass part thumbnail upright 110px mccartney used a rickenbacker 4001s to overdub fuzz bass which effectively serves as a lead guitar part mccartney overdubbed an additional bass part which he played through a fuzzbox effect unit known as a tone bender recording of a bass through a fuzzbox was unprecedented at time as was inclusion of both a standard bass and fuzz bass on a song gould and everett consider that beatles adoption of this effect was inspired by rolling stones 1965 hit i can t get no satisfaction on which distorted fuzz tone sound of lead guitar riff had been a key element however harrison credited phil spector s production of zip a dee doo dah by bob b soxx blue jeans a 1962 recording that after distorted lead guitar sound had been created accidentally in studio led to gibson s invention of first fuzzbox mccartney s riff dominated part serves role of a lead guitar throughout track inclusion of fuzz bass and its layering beside a standard bass part typified beatles willingness to experiment with sound on rubber soul mccartney used a rickenbacker 4001s a solid body guitar that gave his bass playing on rubber soul a more precise tone than he had been able to achieve with his usual hofner violin bass inglis comments that in its dialogue with harrison s vocal lines growling fuzz bass contributes to song s persistent mood of menace while gould describes effect as snarls of an enraged schnauzer snapping and striking at its lead vocal overdubs typical of group s sound on album song s arrangement includes three part harmonies sung in since band also had to have their annual fan club christmas disc completed at this time their producer george martin instructed studio engineers to set up a second ambient microphone and tape beatles as they rehearsed and recorded their vocal parts for track tapes captured three vocalists harrison lennon and mccartney engaging in humorous banter and often unable to remember their parts as a rare record of group at work in studio think for yourself rehearsal tape has invited comparison with beatles let it be documentary film made in january 1969 whereas that film documents a period of acrimony among band members 1965 tape shows them in author mark hertsgaard s description clearly taking joy in one another s company once vocals had been recorded successfully and then double tracked starr overdubbed tambourine and maracas contrary to martin s hopes nothing from rehearsal tape was deemed suitable for beatles 1965 christmas record in 1968 six seconds worth of harrison lennon and mccartney s a capella singing repeating line and you ve got time to rectify was used in soundtrack of yellow submarine animated film mccartney subsequently incorporated other segments from think for yourself rehearsal into his 2000 experimental album liverpool sound collage a fifteen minute edit of full tape became available unofficially in 1991 on bootleg compilation unsurpassed masters volume 7 release and reception emi s parlophone label released rubber soul on 3 december 1965 in britain with think for yourself sequenced as fifth track between nowhere man and word album was a commercial and critical success although initially some reviewers in uk were confused by band s more mature approach release also marked start of a period when other artists in an attempt to emulate beatles achievement sought to create albums as works of artistic merit with a consistently high standard of original compositions and with increasingly novel sounds among albums influenced by rubber soul was rolling stones aftermath which included fuzz toned bass parts on songs under my thumb and mother s little helper author john kruth writes that with its vitriolic tone and an edge that was unfamiliar in beatles work think for yourself was somewhat startling to many listeners in his album review for nme allen evans interpreted song s message as advice to someone who s going off rails to think for himself and rectify things and he admired track s good tempo and vocal sound record mirrors review panel opined nice song but a feeling that there s a sameness about some of melody construction ideas maybe we ll lose it later on available at rock s backpages subscription required while recognising rubber soul as another example of beatles setting trends in this world of pop krla beat highlighted wonderful sound effect created by mccartney s fuzz bass and concluded a good strong driving beat will keep this one on top melody maker said that think for yourself was among album s best tracks and also admired its double tempo sections and good chugging maraca beat michael lydon who interviewed lennon and mccartney for newsweeks laudatory feature on beatles in early 1966 quoted song s chorus in conclusion to his 1972 article for boston globe in which he reflected on passing of 1960s cultural revolution he introduced lyrics with a statement on beatles impact freedom to have a good time to boogie they showed was a practical possibility for average human i m glad i got message available at rock s backpages subscription required think for yourself was one of seven beatles tracks that capitol records included on 1976 compilation album best of george harrison released following expiration of harrison s contract with emi coinciding with release of newly restored yellow submarine film in 1999 a new mix of song was issued on beatles yellow submarine songtrack album retrospective assessment and legacy among beatles biographers tim riley considers track to be a step beyond harrison s two contributions on help with fuzz bass providing just right guttural cynicism yet he says song lacks melodic sonorities and layered texture that distinguishes guitarist s other rubber soul composition if i needed someone riley adds that think for yourself merely serves to provide contrast with lennon songs either side of it on album conversely ian macdonald finds song underrated and less ingratiating but more incisive than if i needed someone while he considers that group s performance could have been improved on macdonald admires real fervour in mccartney s vocal over choruses richie unterberger of allmusic views both tracks as evidence that harrison was developing into a fine songwriter on rubber soul a view echoed by author robert rodriguez in his review of song for allmusic thomas ward deems it one of harrison s weakest compositions he says that track offers a very dated rather patronising lyric and rather bland melody although he also recognises an ingenious chord sequence and typically a great introduction alex young of consequence of sound describes it as a vital inclusion on rubber soul as first track to show how this album is truly champion of making bitterness sound cheerful in 2010 rolling stone ranked think for yourself at number 75 in its list of 100 greatest beatles songs magazine s editors wrote that while beatles created track in obvious haste and under influence of marijuana these conditions worked to song s advantage lending it an unchained garage band feel dominic pedler cites think for yourself as an example of extent to which harrison contributed to beatles legacy as writers of pioneering original melodies he recognises song as harmonically outrageous and a maverick blueprint for left field pop rock writing in guardian on 50th anniversary of album s release bob stanley described think for yourself as cool but fierce he grouped it with norwegian wood and girl as songs that conveyed beatles new sophisticated outlook at time and decades later evoked progressive women such as edie sedgwick maureen cleave and pauline he said that same three songs were statements that ensured that rubber soul would remain fresh for another 50 years also writing in december 2015 emily mackay of nme described song as acerbic and empathetic with confused sexual politics of norwegian wood she recognised harrison s assertion of independent mindedness as a forerunner to lennon s 1968 song revolution in his 2015 book 1965 most revolutionary year in music andrew grant jackson identifies it as beatles contribution to a subgenre of protest songs that emerged in 1965 in which artists railed against oppressive conformity itself rather than political issues he views it as one of musical statements that informed by mass media hallucinogenic drugs and introduction of contraceptive pill chronicled and propelled a social reformation as old world forged its uneasy synthesis with new unterberger regrets that beatles did not attempt to play more of their material from 1965 66 era in concert before deciding to quit touring in late 1966 he identifies think for yourself and drive my car along with some of guitar based tracks on their revolver album as songs that would have worked well in a live setting yonder mountain string band have performed think for yourself featuring a bluegrass arrangement that includes banjo and mandolin they also contributed a recording of track to this bird has flown a 40th anniversary tribute to beatles rubber soul in 2005 pete shelley covered song for yellow submarine resurfaces a cd issued with july 2012 issue of mojo magazine kruth
