minneapolis is largest city by population in u s state of minnesota and county seat of hennepin county origin and growth of city was spurred by proximity of fort snelling first major united states military presence in area and by its location on saint anthony falls which provided power for sawmills and flour mills fort snelling was established in 1819 at confluence of mississippi and minnesota rivers and soldiers began using falls for waterpower when land became available for settlement two towns were founded on either side of falls saint anthony on east side and minneapolis on west side two towns later merged into one city in 1872 early development focused on sawmills but flour mills eventually became dominant industry this industrial development fueled development of railroads and banks as well as foundation of minneapolis grain exchange through innovations in milling techniques minneapolis became a world leading center of flour production earning name mill city as city grew culture developed through its churches arts institutions university of minnesota and a famous park system designed by horace cleveland and theodore wirth although sawmills and flour mills are long gone minneapolis remains a regional center in banking and industry two largest milling companies general mills and pillsbury company now merged under general mills name still remain prominent in twin

captive he arranged for their release prisoners included michel aco antoine and father louis hennepin a catholic priest and missionary on that expedition father hennepin explored falls and named them after his patron saint anthony of padua he published a book in 1683 entitled description of louisiana describing area to interested europeans as time went on he developed a tendency to exaggerate a 1691 edition of book described falls as having a drop of fifty or sixty feet when they only had a drop of hennepin may have been including nearby rapids in his estimate as current total drop in river level over series of dams is city s land was acquired by united states in a series of treaties and purchases negotiated with mdewakanton band of dakota and separately with european nations england claimed land east of mississippi and france then spain and again france claimed land west of river in 1787 land on east side of river became part of northwest territory and in 1803 west side became part of louisiana purchase both claimed by united states in 1805 zebulon pike purchased two tracts of land from dakota indians one tract was located at mouth of st croix river while a second larger tract ran from confluence of minnesota and mississippi rivers to st anthony falls with a width of nine miles 14 km east and west of river in return he distributed about 200 in trading goods and sixty gallons of liquor and promised a further payment from united states government united states senate eventually approved a payment of 2 000 fort snelling and st anthony falls thumb left fort snelling fort snelling was established in 1819 to extend united states jurisdiction over area and to allay concerns about british fur traders in area soldiers initially camped at a site on south side of minnesota river but conditions were hard there and nearly a fifth of soldiers died of scurvy in winter of 1819 1820 they later moved their camp to camp coldwater in may 1820 much of military s activity was conducted there while fort was built camp coldwater site of a cold clear flowing spring was also considered sacred by native dakota soldiers needed to supply fort so they built roads and planted vegetables wheat and hay and raised cattle they also made first weather recordings in area a lumber mill and a grist mill were built on falls in 1822 to supply fort thumb government gristmill and sawmill a settlement on east bank of mississippi near st anthony falls was envisioned in 1830s by joseph plympton who became commander of fort snelling in 1837 he made a more accurate survey of reservation lands and transmitted a map to war department delimiting about 34 000 acres 140 km2 within reservation he cleverly drew boundary line to exclude certain parts of east bank that had been part of 1805 cession to zebulon pike his plan was to stake a pre emption claim at falls however franklin steele also had plans to stake a claim on july 15 1838 word reached fort snelling that a treaty between united states and dakota and ojibwa had been ratified ceding land between st croix river and mississippi rivers steele rushed off to falls built a shanty and marked off boundary lines plympton s party arrived next morning but they were too late to claim most desirable land plympton claimed some less desirable land near steele s claim as did other settlers such as pierre joseph rondo samuel findley and baptiste turpin steele went on to build a dam at falls and built a sawmill that cut logs from rum river area dakota were hunters and gatherers and soon found themselves in debt to fur traders pressed by a whooping cough outbreak loss of buffalo deer and bear and loss of forests to logging in 1851 in treaty of traverse des sioux mdewakanton sold remaining land west of river allowing settlement in 1852 franklin steele also had a clever plan to obtain land on west side of falls he suggested to his associated colonel john h stevens that he should bargain with war department to obtain some land stevens agreed to operate a ferry service across mississippi in exchange for a claim of just above government mills government approved this bargain and stevens built his house in winter of 1849 1850 house was first permanent dwelling on west bank in area that became minneapolis a few years later amount of land controlled by fort was reduced with an order from u s president millard fillmore and rapid settlement followed village of minneapolis soon sprung up on southwest bank of river city pioneers st anthony thumb right home of ard and harriet franklin steele obtained proper title to his land he turned his energies to building a sawmill at st anthony falls he obtained financing and built a dam on east channel of river between hennepin island and nicollet island along with a sawmill equipped with two up and down saws his partner daniel a lumberman who had moved to minnesota dispatched crews up mississippi river to begin cutting lumber sawmill began cutting lumber in september 1848 in october 1848 steele enlisted ard godfrey to supervise mill at a salary of 1500 per year steele platted a townsite in 1849 and gave it name st anthony town quickly grew with workers in addition to first sawmill and several others that followed a grist mill was built in 1851 by 1855 town had approximately 3000 people and it was incorporated as a city godfrey s house built

minnesota were anxiously seeking railroad transportation but insufficient capital was available after panic of 1857 rails were finally built in minnesota in 1862 when st paul and pacific railroad built its first ten miles 16 km of track from phalen creek area in st paul to a stop just short of st anthony falls railroad continued building track from minneapolis to elk river in 1864 and to st cloud in 1866 and from minneapolis west to howard lake in 1867 and willmar in 1869 meanwhile minnesota central an early predecessor of milwaukee road built a line from minneapolis to fort snelling in 1865 railroad gradually extended to faribault owatonna and austin it crossed iowa border and met up with mcgregor western line this connection gave minneapolis rail service to milwaukee via prairie du

and power it provided between 1848 and 1887 minneapolis led nation in in 1856 mills produced 12 million board feet 28 000 m3 of lumber that total had risen to about 91 000 000 board feet 215 000 m3 in 1869 and 960 000 000 board feet 2 270 000 m3 in 1899 during peak of this activity at least 13 sawmills were operating on falls sawmills also supported related industries such as mills that planed and smoothed lumber factories that built sashes doors and windows and manufacturers of shingles and wooden buckets flour milling industry dating back to fort snelling government mill later eclipsed lumber industry in value of its finished product flour production stood at in 1860 rising to in 1869 cadwallader c washburn s imposing mill built in 1866 was six stories high and promoted as largest mill west of buffalo new york other prominent industries at falls included foundries machine shops and textile mills during this time st anthony on east side was separate from minneapolis on west side as a result of inferior management of water power st anthony found its manufacturing district declining some people and organizations started to talk about merging two cities a citizens committee recommended merging two cities in 1866 but a vote on this issue was rejected in 1867 minneapolis incorporated as a city in 1867 two cities found themselves competing with st paul which had a larger

cities were later pushed toward merger by a disaster that nearly wiped out falls geological formation of area consisted of a hard thin layer of limestone overlaying a soft sandstone formation as sandstone eroded away large blocks of limestone would fall off expansion of milling and industry at falls accelerated process of erosion if fragile limestone cap ever eroded away completely falls would turn into a rapids that would no longer provide water power this process came to a head on october 4 1869 when a tunnel under hennepin island and nicollet island collapsed and filled with water with limestone cap breached tunnel quickly created a torrent of water that blasted hennepin island and threatened to destroy falls falls were shored up quickly and over next several years falls were repaired by building a wooden apron sealing tunnel and building low dams above falls to avoid exposing limestone to weather this work was assisted by federal government and was eventually completed in 1884 federal government spent 615 000 on this effort while two cities spent 334 500 possibly as a result of bonding needed to rehabilitate falls cities of st anthony and minneapolis merged on april 9

culture and her unparalleled water power for manufacturing flour will export largely of this article our mills will turn out wheat superior in quality and appearance to any now manufactured in west by 1876 eighteen flour mills had been built on west side of river below falls first mills used traditional technology of millstones that would pulverize grain and grind as much flour as possible in one pass this system worked best for winter wheat which was sown in fall and resumed its growth in spring however harsh winter conditions of upper midwest did not lend themselves to production of winter wheat since deep frosts and lack of snow cover killed crop spring wheat which could be sown in spring and reaped in summer was a more dependable crop however conventional milling techniques did not produce a desirable product since harder husks of spring wheat kernels fractured between grindstones gluten and starch in flour could not be mixed completely either and flour would turn rancid minneapolis milling companies solved this problem by inventing purifier which made it possible to separate husks from flour earlier in milling process they also developed a gradual reduction process where grain was pulverized between a series of rollers made of porcelain iron or steel this process resulted in patent flour which commanded almost double price of bakers or clear flour which it replaced washburn mill attempted to monopolize these techniques but pillsbury and other companies lured employees away from washburn and were able to duplicate process although flour industry grew steadily one major event caused a disturbance in production of flour on may 2 1878 washburn a mill exploded when grain dust ignited explosion killed eighteen workers and destroyed one third of capacity of milling district as well as other nearby businesses and residences by end of year though seventeen mills were back in operation including rebuilt washburn a mill and others that had been completely rebuilt millers also took opportunity to rebuild with new technology such as dust collection systems largest mill on east side of river was pillsbury a mill built in 1880 1881 and designed by local architect leroy s buffington pillsbury company wanted a building that was beautiful as well as functional seven story building had stone walls six feet thick at base tapering to eighteen inches at top with improvements and additions over years it became world s largest flour mill pillsbury a mill is now a national historic landmark along with washburn a mill in 1891 northwestern consolidated milling company was formed consolidating many of smaller mills into one corporate entity between 1880 and 1930 minneapolis led nation in flour production earning it nickname mill city

was only served by a spur from st paul from chicago milwaukee st paul and pacific railroad and by fledgling st paul and pacific railroad minneapolis millers found that railroads based in milwaukee and chicago were favoring their cities by diverting wheat from minneapolis mills in response owners of several minneapolis mills chartered minneapolis and st louis railway which would connect lake superior and mississippi railroad through minneapolis to iowa border meanwhile jay cooke took control of st paul and pacific railroad in 1871 with goal of aggregating it into northern pacific railway

that he expected to share with other railroads since manitoba s mainline ran on east side of mississippi a new bridge across river was needed to reach station result was stone arch bridge completed in 1883 minneapolis union depot was opened for passenger service on april 25 1885 meanwhile milwaukee road expanded their presence in minneapolis with a short line connection from st paul to minneapolis in 1880 and through acquisition of hastings and dakota railroad which had a line going west from minneapolis to montevideo ortonville and into aberdeen south dakota they also built a large railyard

trade grain it helped farmers by ensuring that they got best prices possible for their wheat oats and corn since usual supply and demand curves were skewed by similar harvest times across region in 1883 they introduced its first futures contract for hard red spring wheat in 1947 organization was renamed minneapolis grain exchange since term chamber of commerce had become synonymous with organizations that lobbied for business and social issues flour milling industry also spurred growth of banking in minneapolis area mills required capital for investments in their plants and machinery

sought to diversify beyond flour milling by sponsoring baking contests and publishing recipes they also began developing semi prepared foods such as bisquick and prepared foods such as wheaties after 1930 flour mills gradually began to shut down buildings were either vacated or demolished railroad trestle that served mills was demolished and former mill canal and mill ruins were filled in with

it wasn t until 1950 through 1963 that united states army corps of engineers constructed two sets of locks at lower dam and at falls they also covered falls with a permanent concrete apron project also resulted in disfiguration of stone arch bridge by replacing two of arches with a steel truss rest of spirit island was also obliterated in process bigotry and corruption around early 20th century bigotry took hold in minneapolis sometimes persisting for many decades even to present time sometimes it was shorter lived in 1910 and soon copied by other developers a minneapolis developer created restrictive covenants in his deeds that were prohibitive for certain races and ethnic groups preventing minorities from owning or leasing these properties state law in 1953 and federal fair housing

long period of discussion minneapolis city council finally approved ordinance by a 21 to 3 margin on january 31 1947 ordinance created nation s first fair employment practices ordinance and established minneapolis as nation s leader in imposing fines for employment discrimination though pressure from local urban league would also limit employment opportunities for african americans

authority to not only impose fines but also prison sentences for employers who enacted job discrimination larger banks and department stores saw value in civil rights and began to hire more african americans humphrey also recognized that city police officers operating under racial and ethnic prejudice were causing urban unrest so he instructed city s police chief to have officers in minority neighborhoods keep in contact with clergy teachers business owners and other neighborhood leaders this helped to redefine issue of prejudice and got its attention as a problem that could be solved not

streetcar museum from about 200 000 in 1900 census minneapolis soared to its highest population recorded in 1950 of over 521 000 people main growth of city was in part due to an organized private streetcar system with 140 million passengers by 1920 streetcars ran down important roads extending from downtown minneapolis neighborhood residential development out of core mostly dates around turn of century as a result of this system this growth also allowed minneapolis to annex land from neighboring villages and townships which subsequently pushed incorporation of today s inner ring suburbs streetcar system was built by twin city rapid transit and operated efficiently through 1949 with a program of reinvesting their profits into system improvements however in 1949 new york investor
