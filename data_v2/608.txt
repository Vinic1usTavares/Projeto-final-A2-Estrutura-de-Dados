met with mixed response from critics robert bianco of usa today found it lacking in plot and a driving moral however felt that it was acceptable as a standalone episode one which could be enjoyed by fans and new viewers alike in contrast vicki hyman of star ledger commented that despite football centric plot episode would be hard to follow for new viewers brought in by super bowl requiring too much knowledge of previous storylines new york willa paskin felt that murphy demonstrated utter contempt for potential new audience she suggested that mckinley high football team were used as a metaphor for new viewers who could come to love glee if they embraced its musical numbers but found this insulting as team are portrayed as being ignorant and intolerant kevin fallon of atlantic found episode lacking in glee usual acerbic wit and emotional heft and criticized under use of colfer and criss highlighting a general malaise with show lisa de moraes of washington post deemed sue s boredom with cheerleading a meta reference to series itself both she and emily vanderwerff of a v club noted negatively repetition of familiar storylines such as football team vs glee club rivalry and sue s attempts to destroy club vanderwerff observed that glee keeps tossing same elements into hat and coming out with similar results as though only thing anybody s putting any effort into are musical numbers she graded episode a c calling it boring time james poniewozik also commented on repetitive premise suggesting that jocks versus geeks plot was one most likely to be accessible to new audience he found episode easily forgettable overall criticizing flat characterization but noted that even when series frustrates him he continues to love glee for not in spite of its inconsistency ign s robert canning also found long running football vs glee storyline repetitive but wrote that football players joining glee club was a welcome twist however convoluted and unrealistic he rated episode 8 10 finding it preposterously fun entertainment weekly ken tucker considered episode at once in your face and under handed very clever about its very cynicism he noted that while he had become jaded with glee he enjoyed sue sylvester shuffle summarizing that everything in this episode was chaotic and topsy turvy but you never had feeling silliness was getting away from producers it all came together rick porter of zap2it criticized katie couric s cameo for an attack made against dina lohan during her interview with sue couric lists lohan and her dog sparky as failed loser of year contenders in a previous episode glee also mocked lohan s daughter lindsay porter felt that jibe diminished couric s journalistic credibility deeming lohans easy targets however canning called couric s cameo perhaps funniest part of episode and de moraes stated that best line of episode comes when sue looks katie couric right in eye and says i hate you diane sawyer daily news soraya roberts expressed relief that writers were not gullible enough to have karofsky end episode by joining glee club amy reiter of los angeles times opined that karofsky s character development was best element of episode but found his conflicted emotions convoluted and was pleased that he was victimized by hockey team music performances murphy initially intended episode to be second of season paying tribute to a single band or artist following britney spears tribute episode britney brittany and considered covering songs by elton john prince beatles bruce springsteen or michael jackson although several artists agreed to a tribute ultimately it was decided that songs by multiple acts would be covered katy perry s california gurls was used as opening number performed as a dance routine by school cheerleading squad cheerios paying homage to perry s original music video one element features cheerleaders appearing to shoot fire from their breasts falchuk episode s director stated that sequence was included to attract male super bowl viewers who would not ordinarily watch glee rachel and puck perform a duet of lady antebellum s need you now intended to showcase merits of glee club finn leads a performance of zombies she s not there as halftime show warm up number and rival a cappella choir dalton academy warblers perform destiny s child s bills bills bills led by blaine a mash up of jackson s song thriller with heads will roll by yeah yeah yeahs was used as final number in early reports relating to episode lynch claimed that couric and morrison would perform a dance number to tea for two vincent youmans and irving caesar s song from 1925 musical no no nanette this rumor was later dispelled by murphy commentary thumb right upright katy perry was reportedly excited by performance of her song california gurls in this episode musical performances also attracted mixed commentary though perry was reportedly excited by performance of her california gurls it was poorly received by critics vanderwerff found it surprisingly weak and lifeless and fallon called it slow unfunny and quite frankly boring reiter also deemed it boring describing it as an elaborate smorgasbord without flavor and rolling stone erica futterman criticized uninspired over top choreography performance of need you now was praised by raymund flandez of wall street journal though he branded it a disastrously tactless song choice both he and jenna mullins of e online questioned likelihood of a country ballad enthusing football players toward glee club entertainment weekly breia brissey graded performance b enjoying union of puck and rachel but finding it lacking in originality she gave same grade to she s not there appreciating way song choice complemented episode s finn quinn storyline vanderwerff also received performance positively calling it one of season s better numbers and futterman felt that monteith s vocals were a perfect fit for song appreciating initially odd choreography for making performance more interesting reiter was frustrated by costuming writing that zombie makeup made choreography difficult to follow brissey s lowest grade a b went to bills bills bills though she enjoyed a cappella cover brissey found it incongruous in context opining that glee best performances are those linked to storylines allowing viewers to invest in their message several critics voiced similar complaints while enjoying song itself including mullins futterman and houston chronicle bobby hankinson tucker felt that it had more snap and vigour than final number but also disapproved of its awkward inclusion writing that it impacted negatively on episode s momentum fallon gave track an entirely positive review suggesting that it should have been episode s opening number and lauding it as surprising oozing with charm and actually kind of joyous cnn s lisa respers france embraced completely random and bizarre song choice writing that it reminded her of first season when she never knew what to expect and was often happily surprised reiter too reviewed it favorably calling it best performance of show she appreciated focus on facial expressions during performance in contrast to elaborate costuming which she felt distracted from other numbers bianco preferred intimacy of bills bills bills to thriller heads will roll which both he and hyman criticized for its overproduction and editing while bianco found final number anonymous hyman and futterman approved of performance overall particularly for makeup and costuming flandez and brissey compared it favorably to super bowl xlv halftime performances with brissey stating that mashup did jackson justice and giving it her highest grade of episode an a roberts wrote that performance lived up to pre show hype but felt that rest of episode paled in comparison vanderwerff commented favorably for few minutes that number was on screen glee was nearly everything it could be blending fun
