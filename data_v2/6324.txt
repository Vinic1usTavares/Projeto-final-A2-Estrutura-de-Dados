loyalists she added rohit s carnival like comedy coaxes some laughs but can leave you exhausted sneha said that padukone s performance outshines that of khan ronnie scheib of variety wrote shah rukh khan and deepika padukone are ill matched in this overworked comedy romance actioner shetty s need to maintain his characters romantic heroism constantly grates against his depictions of their ridiculousness simon foster of special broadcasting service gave film 2 stars out of 5 and described it as a loud lame brained romantic comedy from very broad directorial brush of rohit shetty srk s
