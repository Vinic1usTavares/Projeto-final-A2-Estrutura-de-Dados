battle of tawahin battle of mills was fought in 885 between forces of abbasid caliphate under abu l abbas ibn al muwaffaq future caliph al mu tadid and autonomous tulunid ruler of egypt and syria khumarawayh battle took place near ramlah modern israel and ended with a tulunid victory following khumarawayh s ascension to power in 884 abbasid central government decided to reassert its control over provinces ruled by him and invaded northern syria that year by early 885 conflict was proceeding favorably for abbasids forcing khumarawayh to personally take field and try to stop their advance toward egypt in battle that followed abbasid troops initially defeated tulunids and plundered khumarawayh s camp but were then ambushed by a tulunid reserve force and routed in turn as a result of battle abbasid forces were forced to withdraw from syria and tulunid control over province was reaffirmed in following year abbasid government agreed to a treaty which formally recognized khumarawayh s rule over both egypt and syria background ahmad ibn tulun a turkish soldier had managed to become governor of egypt in 868 by using country s immense wealth to raise an army of his own and exploiting instability of central abbasid government over next years he became de facto autonomous although he continued to acknowledge suzerainty of abbasid caliph for most of his reign powerless al mu tamid and to forward some tax revenue to central government ibn tulun s power made him a major rival to real power behind abbasid throne al mu tamid s brother and regent al muwaffaq latter tried in 877 to wrest egypt from ibn tulun but attempt failed spectacularly and in following year ibn tulun extended his area of control over syria up to border zone with byzantine empire in north and up to raqqa in western jazira in east immediately adjacent to abbasid metropolitan province of iraq relations between ibn tulun and al muwaffaq were further strained when al mu tamid tried to play off two men against each other to regain his own authority and independence in 882 caliph attempted to escape from his brother s control by fleeing to ibn tulun s domain but he was apprehended en route by ishaq ibn kundaj governor of jazira and mosul and was sent back to iraq this led to a formal breach in relations al muwaffaq ordered that ibn tulun be publicly cursed in mosques throughout empire and stripped of his governorships in favour of ishaq ibn kundaj while ibn tulun similarly had al muwaffaq publicly cursed declared him deposed from his position as al mu tamid s second heir and proclaimed a holy war against him when ibn tulun died in may 884 he was succeeded by his second son khumarawayh with approval of tulunid grandees but not abbasid court immediately al muwaffaq ended ongoing negotiations that he had been conducting with ibn tulun and refused to recognize khumarawayh s rule over egypt and syria a prominent tulunid general ahmad ibn muhammad al then defected to al muwaffaq and urged him to make war on young and inexperienced khumarawayh and recover latter s provinces for central government prelude abbasid invasion of syria initial abbasid invasion was led by ishaq ibn kundaj appointed as nominal governor of syria and egypt and another general muhammad ibn abu l saj after receiving encouragement from al muwaffaq who promised to send them reinforcements two commanders marched into syria in mid 884 tulunid governor of damascus soon defected to their side and they were able to take control of antioch hims and aleppo upon learning of abbasid advance khumarawayh sent troops to syria tulunid army first proceeded to damascus where they succeeded in forcing its rebel governor to flee and then advanced to shayzar on orontes onset of winter however resulted in a lull in hostilities and both sides remained in their camps to wait out season eventually reinforcements that al muwaffaq had promised arrived from iraq under command of his own son abu l abbas combined abbasid forces advanced to shayzar where tulunid army was still encamped latter was caught completely by surprise and was defeated many of egyptians were killed in fighting survivors fled to damascus but upon learning that abbasid army was headed for them they abandoned city allowing abbasids to retake it in february 885 tulunid forces continued south to ramlah in district of palestine where they wrote to khumarawayh of what had transpired khumarawayh now decided to personally lead his troops against abbasids and departed from egypt for syria at same time abu l abbas set out from damascus and headed for ramlah during which he learned of khumarawayh s arrival in syria at this point however abbasid offensive was hampered by a dispute between its commanders which was caused when abu l abbas accused ishaq ibn kundaj and ibn abu l saj of cowardice in response to this insult two generals decided to abandon campaign and left abu l abbas to face khumarawayh s forces by himself battle of tawahin two armies met at a village called at tawahin mills situated between ramlah and damascus on 5 6 april 885 although later egyptian sources like al maqrizi give date probably erroneously as 7 august khumarawayh reportedly had a significant numerical advantage thanks in part to departure of ishaq ibn kundaj and ibn abu l saj according to al kindi tulunid army numbered 70 000 while abu l abbas had only 4 000 men despite this first engagement between two armies went favorably for abbasids khumarawayh quickly lost his nerve and fled according to al tabari on back of a donkey back to egypt with part of his army believing that they had won battle abbasid troops proceeded to plunder tulunid camp with abu l abbas installing himself in khumarawayh s own tent a part of tulunid army however under sa d al aysar had remained behind and prepared to ambush abu l abbas forces once abbasids secure in their success had already laid down their arms and settled in their quarters sa d al aysar s men attacked and routed them inflicting severe casualties and killing several senior commanders abu l abbas who mistakenly thought that khumarawayh had returned to fight decided to flee with what men he had left and tulunids plundered his camp in turn aftermath thumb upright 1 2 gold dinar of khumarawayh minted in 885 6 ce and bearing names of his nominal suzerains caliph al mu tamid al mufawwad and al muwaffaq following battle abu l abbas and a very few of his men who had managed to escape made a disorganized retreat to north they first reached damascus whose inhabitants refused to allow him entry and then proceeded to tarsus near byzantine frontier after spending some time at tarsus they were ousted from city by its residents in mid 885 at which point abu l abbas decided to withdraw from syria and return to iraq khumarawayh learned of outcome of battle in egypt rejoicing upon hearing of sa d al aysar s victory he quickly sent back his forces to syria and re established his authority over it a large part of abbasid army was captured and transported to egypt where khumarawayh in a gesture aimed at reconciliation with caliphal government allowed those soldiers who wanted to return to iraq depart without ransom while offering rest opportunity to settle in egypt victorious sa d al aysar went to damascus where he rebelled against khumarawayh but was defeated and killed over next couple of years khumarawayh followed up on victory and succeeded in considerably extending his realm in late 886 he launched an offensive against jazira ishaq ibn kundaj was defeated and forced to flee and province came under tulunid sphere of influence shortly after this khumarawayh began negotiations with al muwaffaq and a treaty was signed in december 886 whereby abbasid government recognized khumarawayh as hereditary ruler in his possessions for thirty years subsequent attempts by both ishaq ibn kundaj and ibn abu l saj to retake jazira failed and ishaq ibn kundaj eventually submitted to khumarawayh in 890 al khadim governor of tarsus also declared allegiance to him thus bringing cilicia under tulunid control as well tulunid triumph was to prove ephemeral however in 893 abu l abbas now caliph succeeded in regaining jaziran provinces by treaty and after khumarawayh s death in 896 took advantage of weakness to recover northern syria and cilicia as well finally in 905 abbasids launched a campaign that rapidly brought about end of tulunid autonomy and fully re incorporated their lands into caliphate references sources category 885
