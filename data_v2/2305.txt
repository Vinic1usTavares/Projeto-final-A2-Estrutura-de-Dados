coprinellus impatiens is a species of fungus in psathyrellaceae family first described in 1821 it has been classified variously in genera psathyrella pseudocoprinus coprinarius and coprinus before molecular phylogenetics reaffirmed it as a coprinellus species in 2001 fungus is found in north america and europe where mushrooms grow on ground in deciduous forests fruit bodies have buff caps that are up to in diameter held by slender whitish stems that can be up to tall several other coprinopsis species that resemble c impatiens may be distinguished by differences in appearance habit or spore morphology taxonomy and phylogeny species was first described in 1821 as agaricus impatiens by swedish mycologist elias magnus fries in his systema mycologicum in 1886 lucien quelet transferred species to coprinarius a defunct genus now synonymous with panaeolus and then to coprinus a couple of years later in his flore de la france in 1936 robert kuhner segregated genus pseudocoprinus from coprinus including species that did not have deliquescent gills that is gills that melt into liquid and he included coprinus impatiens in this generic transfer he later changed his mind about taxonomic separation of coprinus and pseudocoprinus gillet transferred species to psathyrella in 1936 in 1938 jakob emanuel lange published new combination coprinellus impatiens despite taxonomic shuffling species was popularly known as coprinus impatiens until 2001 when a large scale phylogenetic analysis resulted in splitting of genus coprinus into several smaller genera and authors confirmed validity of generic placement in coprinellus specific epithet impatiens is derived from latin word for impatient a 2005 phylogenetics study proposed that c impatiens was sister closely related on phylogenetic tree to a large psathyrella clade and that consequently genus coprinellus was polyphyletic a later 2008 study suggested however that these results were due to an artifact of taxon sampling not enough species were analyzed to adequately represent genetic variation in genera 2008 study demonstrated that coprinellus including c impatiens was monophyletic descended from a common ancestor in their analysis c impatiens was most closely related to c c bisporus c and c description thumb left cap surface has deep narrow radially arranged grooves cap of fruit bodies is initially egg shaped then conical to convex before flattening out reaching diameters between it has deep narrow grooves reaching almost as far as center of cap surface color is a pale buff tawny or cinnamon towards center but color loses intensity when mushroom is dry flesh is whitish thin fragile and barely deliquescent auto digesting gills are initially buff then turn grayish brown they are either free from attachment to stem or adnexed meaning only a small portion of gill is attached stem is whitish very slender and more or less equal in width throughout its length or slightly thicker at base its dimensions are by thick stem surface of young specimens are pruinose appearing to be coated with a minute layer of fine white particles this eventually is sloughed off leaving a smooth or silky surface odor and taste of fruit bodies are not distinctive gills of this species do not with age or barely do so fruit bodies tend to become more fragile with age spore print is dark brown spores are smooth ellipsoid or almond shaped with a germ pore they measure 9 12 by 5 6 mm spore bearing cells basidia are four spored and spores lie on several different levels and mature at different times cheilocystidia cystidia found on gill edge are roughly spherical 20 35 mm broad or lageniform flask shaped 36 64 by 10 15 mm with apex often rather acute about 3 5 mm wide pleurocystidia cystidia found on gill face are absent in this species similar species thumb right a potential lookalike species is c disseminatus coprinellus disseminatus resembles c impatiens but may be distinguished by its slightly larger fruit body somewhat deliquescent gills and tendency to fruit in smaller groups on ground rather than on or around rotting wood also c disseminatus has smaller spores than c impatiens typically 6 6 9 7 by 4 1 5 8 mm c is similar to c disseminatus but usually grows in groups on fallen branches and has broader spores that measure 8 3 10 3 by 6 7 8 4 um c usually grows in small dense clumps has narrower spores typically 9 11 by 4 5 5 5 mm and produces smaller fruit bodies habitat and distribution coprinellus impatiens is found in north america and europe including germany poland and ukraine including northern turkey in pacific northwest region of united states it is found in oregon and idaho fruit bodies grow solitarily or rarely in small bundles on forest litter in deciduous forests especially ones dominated by beech see also list of coprinellus species references external links mushroom observer images impatiens category inedible
