thumb mark of pierre rossier s photographic studio in fribourg pierre joseph rossier 16 july 1829 22 october 1886 was a pioneering swiss photographer whose albumen photographs which include stereographs and cartes de visite comprise portraits cityscapes and landscapes he was commissioned by london firm of negretti and zambra to travel to asia and document progress of anglo french troops in second opium war and although he failed to join that military expedition he remained in asia for several years producing first commercial photographs of china philippines japan and siam now thailand he was first professional photographer in japan where he trained ueno hikoma maeda genzo horie kuwajiro as well as lesser known members of first generation of japanese photographers in switzerland he established photographic studios in fribourg and einsiedeln and he also produced images elsewhere in country rossier is an important figure in early history of photography not only because of his own images but also because of critical impact of his teaching in early days of japanese photography identity and origins until very recently little was known about rossier even his given name was a mystery in his own time he was sometimes referred to as p rossier and at other times as m rossier documents discovered in fribourg town archives finally proved that his given name was pierre and it can be assumed that m in m rossier stood for he was long thought to be from france and while he was in japan he was even referred to as an englishman he is described as french by for example yokoe 167 even union list of artist names a research database of getty research institute lists rossier m as probably british ulan however recent research has revealed that rossier was swiss born on 16 july 1829 in a small village in canton of fribourg he was fourth of ten children of a farming family of modest means at age of sixteen he became a teacher at a school in a neighbouring village but by 1855 he was issued a passport to visit france and england to work as a photographer bennett provides an interesting account of research involved in revealing rossier s identity and background most of what is now known about rossier comes from bennett s work bennett s internet article search for rossier is cited below as bennett while his books early japanese images photography in japan 1853 1912 and old japanese photographs are cited as bennett eji bennett pij and bennett ojp respectively at some point after leaving switzerland and arriving in england rossier was commissioned by firm of negretti and zambra to travel to china to photograph second opium war 1858 1860 it may be that firm considered rossier s swiss citizenship an asset for such a voyage that his country s neutrality might help him find passage aboard either british or french ships taking into account high costs and uncertainty incurred by firm and potential hazards for rossier himself this was an important commission bennett photographing in asia 300px thumb french sailors at canton 1858 stereograph albumen silver prints rossier was in hong kong in 1858 and he soon began taking

zambra published a set of fifty of rossier s views including stereographs these received favourable reviews in photographic periodicals of day in 1858 or 1859 rossier travelled to philippines where he visited and photographed taal volcano rossier was in japan by 1859 producing photographs first in nagasaki then in kanagawa yokohama and edo now tokyo he was first professional photographer to arrive in japan yokoe 167 one of photographs rossier took during summer of 1859 while in nagasaki was a portrait of philipp franz von siebold s son alexander and a group of samurai from nabeshima clan this photograph is in collection of siebold memorial museum in nagasaki himeno 22 at end of june 1860 rossier was in shanghai and it is likely that he visited city in an attempt to gain permission to accompany anglo french military expedition that had already arrived in northern china and thereby fulfill his commission to document second opium war british and french military forces were already assembling at bay and chefoo respectively in june 1860 harris 17 and it is known that rossier was in shanghai on 27 june 1860 there is a further possibility that rossier visited shanghai in order to procure photographic chemicals bennett if so he was unsuccessful both forces had already hired photographers to document mission british forces were accompanied by photographers felice beato and john papillon and french by antoine fauchery lieutenant colonel du pin and possibly also by louis legrand bennett thiriez papillon produced images taken between canton and taku forts but became ill and was evacuated before completing his mission photographs of expedition by fauchery have not been positively identified but probably include twenty four stereographs of french forces in canton shanghai tientsin and peking no evidence has been found that either du pin or legrand actually took photographs during expedition thiriez 6 7 although rossier failed even to embark on mission he had been hired to document he remained in east asia for some time longer by october 1860 rossier had returned to nagasaki where he took photographs of harbour on behalf of british consul george s morrison for which rossier was paid 70 in a letter dated 13 october 1860 morrison wrote considering that m rossier s time is specifically devoted to other purposes and that he was occupied with them for several days as he is not a tradesman here for sale of photographs i was not in a position to bargain bennett seventy dollars was a substantial sum to put it in some perspective fourteen years later henry smith munroe an american employee of japanese government was considering buying a complete set of 500 photographs by uchida kuichi that cost 250 or three quarters of munroe s monthly salary as a well paid foreign advisor dobson 20 clark fraser and osman 137 138 although rossier s photographs of japan were advertised by negretti and zambra on at least two occasions in 1860 firm did not publish them until october or november 1861 in edition of 28 may 1860 of times there appeared an advertisement for a full coloured stereograph of japanese ladies in full dress by rossier an advertisement in times 3 october 1860 referred to expected arrival of photographs from japan a case of rare and curious photographs of scenery of this interesting country and illustrative of manners and customs of japanese tribes which have been executed by a special artist sent out for purpose by enterprising firm of negretti and zambra of london bennett speculates that negretti and zambra may have delayed publishing images because of problems with quality of negatives either because they were damaged in transit or because of rossier s known difficulties in finding correct photographic chemicals in asia bennett five of rossier s views of japan appeared earlier in george smith s book ten weeks in japan in april 1861 and that july eight of rossier s japan photographs appeared in form of lithographs in henry arthur tilley s book japan and pacific bennett pij 49 an 1861 edition of illustrated london news included several engravings under collective title domestic life in china images having been taken from rossier s stereographs bennett ojp 119 one of photographs negretti and zambra had advertised in 1860 became first commercial photograph taken in japan to be published and is earliest known hand coloured japanese photograph this being photograph titled japanese ladies in full dress bennett pij 47 49 fig 45 thanks to a number of documents of time it is now certain that negretti and zambra s photographs of china and japan were taken by rossier but for many years it was thought that they might have been taken by either walter b woodbury who also had dealings with negretti and zambra but was based in batavia now jakarta or abel gower who was an amateur photographer in japan leiden university photograph collection includes a portrait allegedly of gower signed p rossier and in 1859 rossier and gower shared passage aboard hms sampson from nagasaki to edo rather than gower portrait sitter is now considered to be john macdonald a member of british legation bennett pij 45 117 fig 141 teaching photography 300px thumb view of yokohama 1859 stereograph albumen silver prints rossier first arrived in japan in 1859 at a time when early experiments in photography were being conducted in kyushu particularly in nagasaki city was centre of rangaku study of western science and it was here that physicians jan karel van den broek and j l c pompe van meerdervoort were instrumental in teaching their japanese students not only medicine but also chemistry and photography more precisely it was dutch enclave of within nagasaki harbour that provided locale for these studies with experiments in photography beginning in mid 1850s similar research began about same time in nearby satsuma han at kagoshima himeno 18 20 21 neither van den broek nor pompe van meerdervoort was an experienced photographer and their attempts to produce photographs were largely failures even with help of user s manual that accompanied camera he had imported it seems that van den broek never made a satisfactory photographic image and he decided that only an experienced photographer would be able to teach use of camera pompe van meerdervoort was hardly more successful one result of his experiments was described by matsumoto jun as a meagre black shadow himeno 21 22 nevertheless in turn they taught wet collodion process photography to keisai yoshio keisai was an uncle and teacher of photographer uchida kuichi himeno 24 25 furukawa kawano maeda genzo ueno hikoma and horie kuwajiro among others himeno 21 22 on his arrival in japan rossier presumably introduced himself as a photographer despatched to japan by negretti and zambra perhaps thereby inspiring a misconception for while he remained in country he was often referred to as an english photographer in nagasaki rossier was assisted in his work by maeda genzo who had been instructed to accompany englishman and to further learn photography matsumoto jun ordered maeda to assist rossier yet another link between matsumoto and photography dates from some point between 1857 and 1859 when he adopted 13 year old future photographer uchida kuichi bennett eji 54 with maeda and other students escorting him around city rossier took photographs of priests beggars audience of a sumo match foreign settlement and group portrait of alexander von siebold and samurai rossier believed that pompe van meerdervoort s failures in photography were due to a lack of necessary chemicals and so he provided maeda with a letter of recommendation to procure photographic apparatus and chemicals from a source in shanghai both maeda and furukawa bought lenses chemicals and albumen paper through rossier himeno 21 22 maeda and furukawa succeeded in taking a photograph with these materials on 28 october 1860 a day still commemorated in fukuoka where photograph was taken himeno 22 at this time ueno hikoma and horie kuwajiro also received photographic instruction from rossier apparently ueno had originally intended to learn not only practice of photography but also manufacture of cameras encounter with rossier seems to have convinced ueno to pursue photography as a career but he was so overwhelmed by technology of camera that he quickly dropped notion of making one himself within a few months he and horie had purchased a french camera and chemicals thereafter launching their independent photographic careers himeno 22 ueno went on to become one of most important and successful photographers in nineteenth century japan although rossier s time in japan was brief and surviving photographic legacy of his sojourn is scant he nevertheless had a lasting impact on photography in country later years and legacy thumb portrait of a siamese woman c 1861 albumen silver print in 1861 rossier was in siam where he assisted french zoologist firmin by taking ethnographic portraits for latter s scientific expedition of 1861 1862 and in 1863 negretti and zambra issued a series of 30 portraits and landscapes taken in siam that are almost certainly work of rossier in february 1862 rossier was again in shanghai where he sold his cameras and other photographic equipment before embarking for europe equipment listed in advertisement include a patent mahogany folding camera a ross portrait lens and a ross landscape lens all in a portable case a portable mahogany tripod a travelling case with all necessary apparatus a large fresh supply of chemicals just received from london and two practical works on photography bennett pij 49 during his time in asia it is possible that rossier photographed in india negretti and zambra issued a series of views of india at about same time as rossier s china views rossier returned to switzerland in early 1862 and in october 1865 married catharine barbe 1843 1867 couple had a son christophe marie pierre joseph who was born on 30 july 1866 catharine died on 4 april 1867 rossier maintained a photographic studio in fribourg until at least 1876 and he also had a studio in einsiedeln during 1860s and 1870s he produced a number of stereographs and cartes de visite comprising portraits and views of fribourg einsiedeln and other places in switzerland an 1871 advertisement in french language fribourg newspaper offered photographs by rossier of religious paintings by artist melchior paul von bennett ojp 120 in 1872 rossier applied for a passport to travel to france where he may have produced photographs at some point between 1871 and 1884 he married again his second wife marie virginie was employed as a household servant by landlords of his studio they had a son joseph louis who was born in paris on 16 march 1884 and who went on to own a cafe in vevey switzerland he died in 1927 pierre rossier died in paris some time between 1883 and 1898 examples of rossier s views of switzerland are held in several institutions and private collections in that country rossier took first commercial photographs of china and japan and they are now quite rare he complained at times of adverse effects of climate on his photographic chemicals and some of his negatives may have been damaged en route to london from asia though his surviving images are scarce his importance to early history of photography in asia is great before his arrival in japan in 1859 japanese students of photography had struggled to produce satisfactory images but rossier s experience instruction and contacts with suppliers of photographic materials were extremely helpful in development of an autonomous photographic tradition in japan notes references bennett terry early japanese
