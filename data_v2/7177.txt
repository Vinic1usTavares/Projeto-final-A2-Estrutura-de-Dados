lavochkin la 7 was a piston engined single seat soviet fighter aircraft developed during world war ii by lavochkin design bureau it was a development and refinement of lavochkin la 5 and last in a family of aircraft that had begun with lagg 1 in 1938 its first flight was in early 1944 and it entered service with soviet air forces later in year a small batch of la 7s was given to czechoslovak air force following year but it was otherwise not exported armed with two or three cannon it had a top speed of la 7 was felt by its pilots to be at least equal of any german piston engined fighter it was phased out in 1947 by soviet air force but served until 1950 with czechoslovak air force la 5 7 vs fw 190 eastern front 1942 45 p 78 design and development by 1943 la 5 had become a mainstay of soviet air forces yet both its head designer semyon lavochkin as well as engineers at central institute felt that it could be improved upon tsagi refined earlier studies of aerodynamic improvements to la 5 airframe in mid 1943 and modified la 5fn c n 39210206 to evaluate changes these included complete sealing of engine cowling rearrangement of wing center section to accommodate oil cooler and relocation of engine air intake from top of cowling to bottom to improve pilot s view gordon 2003 p 65 aircraft was evaluated between december 1943 and february 1944 and proved to have exceptional performance using same engine as standard la 5fn c n 39210206 had a top speed of at a height of some faster than production la 5fn it took 5 2 minutes to climb to it was faster at low to medium altitudes than la 5 that used more powerful prototype shvetsov m 71 engine gordon 2003 pp 65 126 lavochkin had been monitoring improvements and began construction in january 1944 of an improved version of la 5 that incorporated them as well as lighter but stronger metal wing spars to save weight la 5 as well as its predecessors had been built mostly of wood to conserve strategic materials such as aircraft alloys with soviet strategists now confident that supplies of these alloys were unlikely to become a problem lavochkin was now able to replace some wooden parts with alloy components in addition lavochkin made a number of other changes that differed from c n 39210206 engine air intake was moved from bottom of engine cowling to wing roots wing fuselage fillets were streamlined each engine cylinder was provided with its own exhaust pipe engine cowling covers were reduced in number a was added to cockpit gordon 2003 pp 65 66 longer shock struts were fitted for main landing gear while that for tail wheel was shortened an improved pb 1b v gunsight was installed and a new vish 4 propeller was fitted gunston p 165 three prototype b 20 autocannon were mounted in engine cowling firing through propeller arming 1944 standard setter as modified aircraft was designated etalon only made nine test flights in february and march 1944 before testing had to be suspended after two engine failures but quickly proved itself to be near equal of c n 39210206 it was lighter than earlier aircraft which allowed etalon to other aircraft 4 45 minutes against 5 2 minutes climb to 5 000 meters however it was slower at sea level but only slower at flight tests validated lavochkin s modifications and it was ordered into production under designation of la 7 although b 20 cannon were not yet ready for production and production la 7 retained two 20 mm shvak cannon armament of la 5 gordon 2003 pp 66 126 thumb left la 7 with shvetsov ash 82fn engine five la 7s were built in march by factory nr 381 in moscow and three of these were accepted by air force that same month moscow factory was fastest to complete transition over to la 7 production and last la 5fn was built there in may 1944 zavod nr 21 in gorky was considerably slower to make change as it did not exhaust its stock of wooden la 5 wings until october quality of early production aircraft was significantly less than etalon due to issues with engine incomplete sealing of cowling and fuselage and defective propellers one such aircraft was tested after these problems had been fixed by flight research institute and proved to be only slower than etalon at altitude aircraft from both factories were evaluated in september by air force scientific test institute and problems persisted as aircraft could only reach at a height of and had a time to altitude of 5 1 minutes to 5 000 meters gordon 2003 pp 66 69 126 combat trials began in mid september 1944 and were generally very positive however four aircraft were lost to engine failures and engines suffered from numerous lesser problems despite its satisfactory service in la 5fn one cause was lower position of engine air intakes in wing roots of la 7 which caused engine to ingest sand and dust one batch of flawed wings was built and caused six accidents four of them fatal in october which caused fighter to be grounded until cause was determined to be a defect in wing spar gordon 2008 p 239 production of first aircraft fitted with three b 20 cannon began in january 1945 when 74 were delivered these aircraft were heavier than those aircraft with two shvak guns but level speed was slightly improved over original aircraft however time to climb to 5000 meters increased by two tenths of a second over older model more than 2000 aircraft were delivered before war s end most by zavod nr 21 a total of 5 753 aircraft had been built by zavod nr 21 nr 381 and nr 99 in ulan gordon 2008 pp 239 240 when production ended in early 1946 operational history thumb a la 7 of czech air force on display at prague aviation museum kbely 63rd guard fighter aviation corps began combat trials of la 7 in mid september 1944 in support of 1st baltic front thirty aircraft were provided for trials which lasted one month during this time new fighters made 462 individual sorties and claimed 55 aerial victories while losing four aircraft in combat four other la 7s were lost to non combat causes mostly related to engine problems a total of three pilots were killed during trials to all causes one regimental commander colonel ye a hero of soviet union commented la 7 exhibited unquestionable advantages over german aircraft in multiple air combats in addition to fighter tasks photo reconnaissance and bombing were undertaken with success aircraft surpasses la 5fn in speed manoeuvrability and especially in landing characteristics it requires changes in its armament and urgent fixing of its engine twin shvak armament inherited from la 5 was no longer powerful enough to bring down later more heavily armored german fighters especially focke wulf fw 190 in a single burst even when soviet pilots opened fire at ranges of only 156th fighter air corps of 4th air army was next unit to receive la 7 in october 1944 at one point during month they had fourteen aircraft simultaneously unserviceable with engine failures by 1 january 1945 there were 398 la 7s in front line service of which 107 were unserviceable by 9 may 1945 this had increased to 967 aircraft of which only 169 were unserviceable for invasion of japanese manchuria 313 la 7s were assigned and only 28 of these were unserviceable on 9 august 1945 la 7 was flown by top soviet ace of war ivan kozhedub kozhedub nicknamed ivan terrible a three time hero of soviet union scored his last 17 air victories in 1945 in la 7 numbered 27 which is now preserved in central air force museum at monino on outskirts of moscow one fighter regiment of 1st czechoslovak composite aviation division was later equipped with la 7 after participating in slovak national uprising of august october 1944 with la 5fn a total of 56 aircraft were delivered and equipped 1st and 2nd fighter regiments bulk of aircraft however were delivered in 1945 and saw no combat during war p 43 it remained in service with czechoslovaks until 1950 and was designated postwar by them as s 97 one of these aircraft survives in prague aviation museum kbely gordon 2003 p 84 despite reports to contrary no la 7s were ever sold or transferred to people s republic of china or north korea such reports arose from misidentification by western pilots of la 9s or la 11s that were given to those countries gordon 2014 pp 76 265 british test pilot eric brown was given chance to fly an la 7 at former erprobungsstelle luftwaffe aircraft test station on baltic coast shortly after german surrender in may 1945 he described handling and performance as quite superb but armament and sights were below par wooden construction would have withstood little combat punishment and instrumentation was appallingly basic brown captain eric 2007 wings on my sleeve phoenix orion books pp 121 22 production of la 7 amounted to 5 753 aircraft plus 584 la 7uti trainers it is uncertain if these la are included in overall production total those aircraft still in service after end of war were given nato reporting name fin follow up model la 9 despite its outward similarity was a completely new design gordon 2008 p 242 tactical significance la 7 ended superiority in vertical maneuverability that messerschmitt bf 109g had previously enjoyed over other soviet fighters gordon 2003 p 76 furthermore it was fast enough at low altitudes to catch albeit with some difficulties focke wulf fw 190 fighter bombers that attacked soviet units on frontlines and immediately returned to german controlled airspace at full speed yakovlev yak 3 and yakovlev yak with klimov vk 107 engine lacked a large enough margin of speed to overtake german raiders 115 la 7s were lost in air combat only half number of yak 3s according to vvs ka records only 3 la 7s were actually shot down in air combat in all of 1944 and a merely 10 fall victim to anti aircraft fire with a further 23 due to non combat cause losses to air combat in 1945 stands at 79 in total with 115 overall however aircraft that went missing not returning or lost to wear are not included e g 24 additional la 7s went missing in 1944 however total vvs ka record loss may not give a true picture of combat losses as combat losses were often claimed as non combat losses either to conceal losses or for propaganda purposes lavochkin fighters of second world war pp 133 36 190 91 variants la one aircraft used to evaluate tk 3 in july 1944 in hopes of improving high altitude
