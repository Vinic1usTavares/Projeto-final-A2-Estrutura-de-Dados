2012 writing and recording with election special cooder wanted to write an album with direct lyrics and encourage urgency in listeners during us presidential election of 2012 he felt that election season was time of decision in this country most critical time in history of country when asked about concerns over preaching to choir cooder said in an interview for los angeles times i thought i should have a record that says this here record is for you during election time rather than be vague and poetic let s just call this what it is that way i may get people s attention that s idea cooder drew on music he grew up listening to such as depression era songs and sought to appropriate contemporary subject matter to them when writing album he also touched on occupy movement which he felt optimistic about saying that there s a sign of something those people are having conversations and conversations become issues and issues become talked about pretty soon rest of world picks up on it even politicians cooder s displeasure with republican party and its financial supporters particularly koch brothers also inspired his songwriting he found party to be insanely dangerous to barack obama s presidency and us and said of them in an interview for guardian in case anybody thinks michele bachmann or sarah palin are clowns because they or don t know their history or they say silly things that s just an act and it s a useful act everything is a distraction from core truths which are first of all that corporations have taken over country he viewed that his songs for album provide a more convenient alternative for citizens who do not research politicians saying that i don t write books and give speeches but with a four minute song you can use allegory and other means to suggest a different point of view it s like looking around corner and that s what songs are good at sometimes they hit you with a new thought assuming that people will listen cooder recorded most of election special at drive by studios living room of engineer martin pradler s house in north hollywood sessions also took place at studios in chatsworth california pradler later mixed and mastered album at both recording locations album was produced entirely by cooder he performed most of album himself playing bass guitar and mandolin his son joachim contributed on drums and session musician arnold mcculler sung harmony vocals on song take your hands off it at drive by studios cooder recorded songs in a series of unrehearsed single take performances which he felt helped him channel songs respective characters more efficiently he later said of his approach to developing songs way i think these songs can work is if you don t ponder over it too hard because tunes wanna have a spontaneous combustion effect what i want to do is get a certain attitude in voice and i can only do that once by take two i m startin to think about it by take three i m startin to map it out it s gone it s spoiled y see so i need to get through this fast he first recorded song wall street part of town in november 2011 on june 7 2012 album s release was announced for a date in august intended to be a

predecessor as most topical albums cooder has recorded while bud scoppa of uncut asserted that he has never before made an album as immediate as election special because of immediate and cleverly written narratives less impressed was christgau who wrote in msn music that protest songs in general are hard to nail even in moment and felt that some of album s songs just don t twist screw tight enough he nonetheless gave cooder extra credit for both preaching to converted and doing his damnedest to rally holier than thou q was more critical of cooder s means of conveying his message fine

and playing from his bleeding heart on election special results make one wish that he d pass both his mic and his guitar back to his brain geoff cowart from musicomh found its message and music to be weak and cooder to be overly preachy commenting that despite some first class guitar playing tunes come off second best to partisan grudge match track listing all songs were written and produced by ry
