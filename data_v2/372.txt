edward creutz january 23 1913 june 27 2009 was an american physicist who worked on manhattan project at metallurgical laboratory and los alamos laboratory during world war ii after war he became a professor of physics at carnegie institute of technology he was vice president of research at general atomics from 1955 to 1970 he published over 65 papers on botany physics mathematics metallurgy and science policy and held 18 patents relating to nuclear energy a graduate of university of wisconsin madison creutz helped princeton university build its first cyclotron during world war ii he worked on nuclear reactor design under eugene wigner at metallurgical laboratory designing cooling system for first water cooled reactors he led a group that studied metallurgy of uranium and other elements used in reactor designs in october 1944 he moved to los alamos laboratory where he became a group leader after war ended creutz accepted an offer to come to carnegie institute of technology where he became head of its physics department and its nuclear research center in 1948 in 1955 he returned to los alamos to evaluate its thermonuclear fusion program for atomic energy commission while there he accepted an offer to become vice president for research and development and director of its john jay hopkins laboratory for pure and applied science at general atomics under his leadership general atomics developed triga a nuclear reactor for universities and laboratories creutz served as an assistant director of national science foundation from 1970 to 1977 and then as director of bernice pauahi bishop museum in honolulu where he took particular interest in museum s preparation of a manual of flowering plants of hawaii early life edward chester creutz was born on january 23 1913 in beaver dam wisconsin son of lester creutz a high school history teacher and grace smith creutz a general science teacher he had two older brothers john and jim and a younger sister edith family moved to eau claire wisconsin in 1916 monroe wisconsin in 1920 and to janesville wisconsin in 1927 he played a number of musical instruments including mandolin ukulele and trombone he played in school bands at janesville high school and monroe high school at janesville he played tenor banjo in a dance orchestra called rosie s and timpani with school orchestra at monroe he also played left guard on american football teams at janesville and monroe he expressed an interest in chemistry biology geology and photography after graduating from janesville high school in 1929 he took a job as a bookkeeper at a local bank in 1932 his brother john who had graduated from university of wisconsin madison with a degree in electrical engineering persuaded him to go to college as well john suggested that if you aren t sure what part of science you want take physics because that s basic to all of them creutz later recalled that this was best advice he ever got he entered university of wisconsin and studied mathematics and physics money was scarce during great depression especially after his father died in 1935 to pay his bills creutz worked as a dishwasher and short order cook and took a job taking care of physics laboratory equipment in 1936 his senior year he taught physics laboratory classes creutz encountered several members of faculty at university of wisconsin including julian mack ragnar rollefson raymond herb eugene wigner and gregory breit mack gave creutz a research project to do in his junior year creutz remained at wisconsin as a graduate student after receiving his bachelor of science b s degree in 1936 working for herb upgrading departmental van de graaff generator from 300 to 600 kev with this done question became what to do with it and breit suggested that it had previously been observed that high energy gamma rays were produced when lithium was bombarded with protons at 440 kev creutz therefore wrote his 1939 doctor of philosophy ph d thesis on resonance scattering of protons by lithium under breit s supervision creutz married lela rollefson a mathematics student at wisconsin and sister of ragnar rollefson on september 13 1937 couple had three children two sons michael and carl and a daughter ann jo wigner moved to princeton university in 1938 and soon after creutz received an offer as well princeton had been given a magnet by university of california which had been used to build an 8 mev cyclotron they wanted creutz to help get it operational he later recalled but it was bohr who electrified audience with his news from europe of discovery by lise meitner and otto frisch of nuclear fission physicists rushed to confirm results creutz built an ionization chamber and a linear amplifier out of radio vacuum tubes coffee cans and motorcycle batteries and with this apparatus physicists at princeton were able to confirm results world war ii in early years of world war ii between 1939 and 1941 wigner led princeton group in a series of experiments involving uranium and two tons of graphite as a neutron moderator in early 1942 arthur compton concentrated manhattan project s various teams working on plutonium and nuclear reactor design including wigner s team from princeton at metallurgical laboratory at university of chicago name was a codename creutz was first to conduct actual metallurgy research and he hired its first metallurgist to work with him wigner led theoretical group that included creutz leo ohlinger alvin m weinberg katharine way and gale young group s task was to design reactors that would convert uranium into plutonium at time reactors existed only on paper and no reactor had yet gone critical in july 1942 wigner chose a conservative 100 mw design with a graphite neutron moderator and water cooling choice of water as a coolant was controversial at time because water was known to absorb neutrons thereby reducing efficiency of reactor but wigner was confident that his group s calculations were correct and that water would work while technical difficulties involved in using helium or liquid metal as a coolant would delay project working seven days a week group designed reactors between september 1942 and january 1943 creutz studied corrosion of metals in a water cooled system and designed cooling system in 1959 a patent for reactor design would be issued in name of creutz ohlinger weinberg wigner and young as a group leader at metallurgical laboratory creutz conducted studies of uranium and how it could be extruded into rods his group looked into process of corrosion in metals in contact with fast flowing liquids processes for fabricating aluminium and uranium with it it also investigated forging of beryllium and preparation of thorium frederick seitz and alvin weinberg later reckoned that activities of creutz and his group may have reduced time taken to produce plutonium by up to two years discovery of spontaneous fission in reactor bred plutonium due to contamination by plutonium 240 led wigner to propose switching to breeding uranium 233 from thorium but challenge was met by los alamos laboratory developing an implosion type nuclear weapon design in october 1944 creutz moved to los alamos where he became a group leader responsible for explosive lens design verification and preliminary testing difficulties encountered in testing lenses led to construction of a special test area in pajarito canyon and creutz became responsible for testing there as part of preparation for trinity nuclear test creutz conducted a test detonation at pajarito canyon without nuclear material this test brought bad news it seemed to indicate that trinity test would fail hans bethe worked through night to assess results and was able to report that results were consistent with a perfect explosion later life thumb right apetahia raiateensis a rare flower found only on raiatea in french polynesia creutz published a paper on it in 1966 after war ended in 1945 creutz accepted an offer from seitz to come to carnegie institute of technology as an associate professor and help create a nuclear physics group there creutz in turn recruited a number of young physicists who had worked with him at princeton and on manhattan project in chicago and los alamos including martyn foss jack fox roger sutton and sergio debenedetti together with funding from office of naval research they built a 450 mev synchrotron at nuclear research center near pennsylvania for a time this put them at forefront of research into nuclear physics allowing physicists there to study recently discovered pi meson and mu meson a visiting scholar gilberto bernardini created first photographic emulsion of a meson creutz became a professor head of physics department and head of nuclear research center at carnegie institute of technology in 1948 he was also a member of executive board at argonne national laboratory from 1946 to 1958 and a consultant at oak ridge national laboratory from 1946 to 1958 in addition to his work on nuclear physics he cultivated flowers and orchids at his home he published eight papers on floral species and named three varieties of violets after his children one 1966 paper published in new york botanical garden journal was on apetahia raiateensis a rare flower found only on island of raiatea in french polynesia he travelled to polynesia many times and translated grammar of tahitian language from french into english his family served as hosts for a time to two young people from tahiti and samoa in 1955 and 1956 creutz spent a year at los alamos evaluating its thermonuclear fusion program for atomic energy commission while there he was approached by frederic de hoffmann who recruited him to join general atomics division of general dynamics he moved to la jolla california as its vice president for research and development and was concurrently director of its john jay hopkins laboratory for pure and applied science from 1955 to 1967 he was also a member of advisory panel on general science at department of defense from 1959 to 1963 thumb left triga is world s most popular research reactor under his leadership general atomics developed triga a small reactor for universities and laboratories triga used uranium zirconium hydride fuel which has a large prompt negative fuel temperature coefficient of reactivity as temperature of core increases reactivity rapidly decreases it is thus highly unlikely though not completely impossible for a nuclear meltdown to occur due to its safety and reliability which allows it to be installed in densely populated areas and its ability to still generate high energy for brief periods which is particularly useful for research it became world s most popular research reactor and general atomics sold 66 in 24 countries high temperature gas cooled reactor htgr was less successful and only two htgr power reactors were built both in united states a 40 mw demonstration unit at peach bottom nuclear generating station in pennsylvania operated successfully but a larger 300 mw unit at fort st vrain generating station in colorado encountered technical problems general atomics also conducted research into thermonuclear energy including means of magnetically confining plasma between 1962 and 1974 creutz published six papers on subject in 1970 president richard nixon appointed creutz as assistant director for research of national science foundation he became assistant director for mathematical and sciences in 1975 and was acting deputy director from 1976 to 1977 1970s energy crisis raised national profile of energy issues and creutz served on a panel that produced a study called nation s energy future his wife lela died of cancer in 1972 in 1974 he married elisabeth who worked for national science board two of them enjoyed locating and photographing rare orchids his appointment at national science foundation ended in 1977 and creutz became director of bernice pauahi bishop museum in honolulu he took particular interest in museum s work preparing a two volume manual of flowering plants of hawaii which was published in 1999 he expanded programs for education and outreach and secured funding for two new buildings he retired in 1987 and returned to his home in rancho santa fe california and died there on june 27 2009 documentaries to mars by a
