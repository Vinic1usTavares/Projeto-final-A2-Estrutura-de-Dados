manchester mark 1 was one of earliest stored program computers developed at victoria university of manchester from manchester baby operational in june 1948 it was also called manchester automatic digital machine or work began in august 1948 and first version was operational by april 1949 a program written to search for mersenne primes ran error free for nine hours on night of 16 17 june 1949 machine s successful operation was widely reported in british press which used phrase electronic brain in describing it to their readers that description provoked a reaction from head of university of manchester s department of neurosurgery start of a long running debate as to whether an electronic computer could ever be truly creative mark 1 was to provide a computing resource within university to allow researchers to gain experience in practical use of computers but it very quickly also became a prototype on which design of ferranti s commercial version could be based development ceased at end of 1949 and machine was scrapped towards end of 1950 replaced in february 1951 by a ferranti mark 1 world s first commercially available general purpose electronic computer computer is especially historically significant because of its pioneering inclusion of index registers an innovation which made it easier for a program to read sequentially through an array of words in memory thirty four patents resulted from machine s development and many of ideas behind its design were incorporated in subsequent commercial products such as and 702 as well as ferranti mark 1 chief designers frederic c williams and tom kilburn concluded from their experiences with mark 1 that computers would be used more in scientific roles than in pure mathematics in 1951 they started development work on meg mark 1 s successor which would include a floating point unit background in 1936 mathematician alan turing published a definition of a theoretical universal computing machine a computer which held its program on tape along with data being worked on turing proved that such a machine was capable of solving any conceivable mathematical problem for which an algorithm could be written during 1940s turing and others such as konrad zuse developed idea of using computer s own memory to hold both program and data instead of tape but it was mathematician john von neumann who became widely credited with defining that stored program computer architecture on which manchester mark 1 was based practical construction of a von neumann computer depended on availability of a suitable memory device university of manchester s baby world s first electronic stored program computer had successfully demonstrated practicality of stored program approach and of williams tube an early form of computer memory based on a standard cathode ray tube crt by running its first program on 21 june 1948 early electronic computers were generally programmed by being rewired or via plugs and patch panels there was no separate program stored in memory as in a modern computer it could take several days to reprogram eniac for instance stored program computers were also being developed by other researchers notably national physical laboratory s pilot ace cambridge university s edsac and us army s baby and mark 1 differed primarily in their use of williams tubes as memory devices instead of mercury delay lines from about august 1948 baby was intensively developed as a prototype for manchester mark 1 initially with aim of providing university with a more realistic computing facility in october 1948 uk government chief scientist ben lockspeiser was given a demonstration of prototype mark 1 while on a visit to university of manchester lockspeiser was so impressed by what he saw that he immediately initiated a government contract with local firm of ferranti to make a commercial version of machine ferranti mark 1 in his letter to company dated 26 october 1948 lockspeiser authorised company to proceed on lines we discussed namely to construct an electronic calculating machine to instructions of professor f c williams from that point on development of mark 1 had additional purpose of supplying ferranti with a design on which to base their commercial machine government s contract with ferranti ran for five years from november 1948 and involved an estimated ps35 000 per year equivalent to ps per year in development and design thumb 300px right functional schematic showing williams tubes in green tube c holds current instruction and its address a is accumulator m is used

tootill to develop mark 1 they were joined by two research students d b g edwards and g e thomas work began in earnest in august 1948 project soon had dual purpose of supplying ferranti with a working design on which they could base a commercial machine ferranti mark 1 and of building a computer that would allow researchers to gain experience of how such a machine could be used in practice first of two versions of manchester mark 1 known as intermediary version was operational by april 1949 however this first version lacked features such as instructions necessary to programmatically transfer data between main store and its newly developed magnetic backing store which had to be done by halting machine and manually initiating transfer these missing features were incorporated in final specification version which was fully working by october 1949 machine contained 4 050 valves and had a power consumption of 25 kilowatts reprint of paper published in communications of acm january 1978 21 1 to increase reliability purpose built crts made by gec were used in machine instead of standard devices used in baby baby s 32 bit word length was increased to 40 bits each word could hold either one 40 bit number or two 20 bit program instructions main store initially consisted of two double density williams tubes each holding two arrays of 32 x 40 bit words known as pages backed up by a magnetic drum capable of storing an additional 32 pages capacity was increased in final specification version to eight pages of main store on four williams tubes and 128 magnetic drum pages of backing store diameter drum reprint of kilburn tom 1949 university of manchester universal high speed digital computing machine nature 164 initially known as a magnetic wheel contained a series of parallel magnetic tracks around its surface each with its own read write head each track held 2 560 bits corresponding to two pages bits one revolution of drum took 30 milliseconds during which time both pages could be transferred to crt main memory although actual data transfer time depended on latency time it took for a page to arrive under read write head writing pages to drum took about twice as long as reading drum s rotational speed was synchronised to main central processor clock which allowed for additional drums to be added data was recorded onto drum using a phase modulation technique still known today as manchester coding machine s instruction set was increased from 7 of baby to 26 initially including multiplication done in hardware this increased to 30 instructions in final specification version ten bits of each word were allocated to hold instruction code standard instruction time was 1 8 milliseconds but multiplication was much slower depending on size of machine s most significant innovation is generally considered to be its incorporation of index registers commonplace on modern computers baby had included two registers implemented as williams tubes accumulator a and program counter c as a and c had already been assigned tube holding two index registers originally known as b lines was given name b contents of registers could be used to modify program instructions allowing convenient iteration through an array of numbers stored in memory mark 1 also had a fourth tube m to hold multiplicand and multiplier for a multiplication operation programming thumb right section of punched tape showing how one 40 bit word was encoded as eight 5 bit characters of 20 bits allocated for each program instruction 10 were used to hold instruction code which allowed for 1 024 210 different instructions machine had 26 initially increasing to 30 when function codes to programmatically control data transfer between magnetic drum and cathode ray tube crt main store were added on intermediary version programs were input by key switches and output was displayed as a series of dots and dashes on a cathode ray tube known as output device just as on baby from which mark 1 had been developed however final specification machine completed in october 1949 benefitted from addition of a teleprinter with a five hole paper tape reader and punch mathematician alan turing who had been appointed to nominal post of deputy director of computing machine laboratory at university of manchester in september 1948 devised a base 32 encoding scheme based on standard ita2 5 bit teleprinter code which allowed programs and data to be written to and read from paper tape ita2 system maps each of possible 32 binary values that can be represented in 5 bits 25 to a single character thus 10010 represents d 10001 represents z and so forth turing changed only a few of standard for instance 00000 and 01000 which mean no effect and in teleprinter code were represented by characters and respectively binary zero represented by forward slash was most common character in programs and data leading to sequences written as one early user suggested that turing s choice of a forward slash was a subconscious choice on his part a representation of rain seen through a dirty window reflecting manchester s famously dismal weather because mark 1 had a 40 bit word length eight 5 bit teleprinter characters were required to encode each word thus for example binary word 10001 10010 10100 10001 10110 would be represented on paper tape as contents of any word in store could also be set via teleprinter s keyboard and output onto its printer machine worked internally in binary but it was able to carry out necessary decimal to binary and binary to decimal conversions for its input and output respectively there was no assembly language defined for mark 1 programs had to be written and submitted in binary form encoded as eight 5 bit characters for each 40 bit word programmers were encouraged to memorize modified ita2 coding scheme to make their job easier data was read and written from punch under program control mark 1 had no system of hardware interrupts program continued after a read or write operation had been initiated until another input output instruction was encountered at which point machine waited for first to complete mark 1 had no operating system its only system software was a few basic routines for input and output as in baby from which it was developed and in contrast to established mathematical convention machine s storage was arranged with least significant digits to left thus a one was represented in five bits as 10000 rather than more conventional negative numbers were represented using two s complement as most computers still do today in that representation value of most significant bit denotes sign of a number positive numbers have a zero in that position and negative numbers a one thus range of numbers that could be held in each 40 bit word was 239 to 239 1 decimal 549 755 813 888 to 549 755 813 887 first programs first realistic program to be run on mark 1 was a search for mersenne primes in early april 1949 which ran error free for nine hours on night of 16 17 june 1949 algorithm was specified by max newman head of mathematics department at university of manchester and program was written by kilburn and tootill alan turing later wrote an optimised version of program dubbed mersenne express manchester mark 1 continued to do useful mathematical work until 1950 including an investigation of riemann hypothesis and calculations in optics later developments tootill was temporarily transferred from university of manchester to ferranti in august 1949 to continue work on ferranti mark 1 s design and spent four months working with company manchester mark 1 was dismantled and scrapped in august 1950 replaced a few months later by first ferranti mark 1 world s first commercially available general purpose computer between 1946 and 1949 average size of design team working on mark 1 and its predecessor baby had been about four people during that time 34 patents were taken out based on team s work either by ministry of supply or by its successor national research development corporation in july 1949 ibm invited williams to united states on an all expenses paid trip to discuss mark 1 s design company subsequently licensed several of patented ideas developed for machine including williams tube in design of its own 701 and 702 computers most significant design legacy of manchester mark 1 was perhaps its incorporation of index registers patent for which was taken out in names of williams kilburn tootill and newman kilburn and williams concluded that computers would be used more in scientific roles than pure maths and decided to develop a new machine that would include a floating point unit work began in 1951 and resulting machine which ran its first program in may 1954 was known as meg or machine it was smaller and simpler than mark 1 and much faster for maths problems ferranti produced a version of meg with williams tubes replaced by more reliable core memory marketed as ferranti mercury cultural impact successful operation of manchester mark 1 and its predecessor baby was widely reported in british press which used phrase electronic brain to describe machines lord louis mountbatten had earlier introduced that term in a speech delivered to british institution of radio engineers on 31 october 1946 in which he speculated about how primitive computers then available might evolve excitement surrounding reporting in 1949 of what was first recognisably modern computer provoked a reaction unexpected by its developers sir geoffrey jefferson professor of neurosurgery at university of manchester on being asked to deliver lister oration on 9 june 1949 chose mind of mechanical man as his subject his purpose was to debunk manchester project in his address he said times reported on jefferson s speech following day adding that jefferson forecast that day would never dawn when gracious rooms of royal society would be converted into garages to house these new fellows this was interpreted as a deliberate slight to newman who had secured a grant from society to continue work of manchester team in response newman wrote a follow up article for times in which he claimed that there was a close analogy between structure of mark 1 and human brain his article included an interview with turing who added see also history of computing
