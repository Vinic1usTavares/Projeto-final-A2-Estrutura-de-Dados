raids took place in late 9th and early 10th century rus undertook first large scale expedition in 913 having arrived on 500 ships they pillaged in gorgan region in territory of present day iran and more to west in gilan and mazandaran taking slaves and goods on their return northern raiders were attacked and defeated by khazars in volga delta and those who escaped were killed by local tribes on middle volga during their next expedition in 943 rus captured bardha a capital of arran in modern day republic of azerbaijan rus stayed there for several months killing many inhabitants of city and amassing substantial plunder it was only an outbreak of dysentery among rus that forced them to depart with their spoils sviatoslav prince of kiev commanded next attack which destroyed khazar state in

century norsemen settled in northwestern russia where they established a settlement called slavic ladoga about south of volkhov river entry into lake ladoga from there they began trading with byzantine empire along dnieper trade route and with muslim lands around caspian sea along volga trade route brondsted 1965 pp 64 65 in late 9th century ibn khordadbeh described rus buying goods from khazars in market areas on lower volga and selling them on markets of caspian towns logan 1992 p 200 these merchants brought furs honey and slaves small groups of rus even went on camels as far as baghdad to sell their goods their european slaves interpreted for them thomas s noonan suggested that rus reached baghdad as early as 800 this argument is supported by finding of sassanid arab and arabo sassanid dirham coins dated no later than 804 805 at peterhof near saint petersburg noonan 1987 1991 in ibn khordadbeh s account rus are described as a kind of saqaliba a term usually used to refer to slavs and anti normanist scholars have interpreted this passage as indicative of rus being slavs rather than scandinavians in interpretation of normanist scholars word saqaliba was also frequently applied to all fair haired ruddy complexioned populations of central eastern and northeastern europe so ibn khordadbeh s language is ambiguous here rus encyclopaedia of islam first caspian raid of rus occurred sometime in reign of hasan ibn zaid ruler of tabaristan between 864 and 884 rus sailed into caspian sea and unsuccessfully attacked its eastern shore at abaskun abaskun first recorded by ptolemy as was documented in arab sources as most famous port of sea it was situated within three days journey from gorgan southern part of caspian sea was known as sea of abaskun see b n 1898 1960 caspian compilation of records about eastern europe online version this raid was probably on a very small scale second raid took place in 909 or about rus raids comes largely from muslim sources which use islamic calendar because years of islamic calendar do not map exactly to years of gregorian calendar an event dated to a certain year of islamic calendar may have occurred in either of two consecutive years of gregorian calendar and was likewise aimed at abaskun just like previous attack this expedition was a minor one with only sixteen ships participating in it third minor raid

through country of khazars in order to secure a peaceful passage through land of khazars rus promised khazars half of their spoils they sailed down dnieper river into black sea then into sea of azov then up don river past khazar city of sarkel and then by a portage reached volga which led them into caspian sea rus attacked in gorgan region around abaskun as well as tabaristan pillaging

as well as by some christians apparently with acquiescence of khazar ruler according to al masudi those who escaped were finished off by burtas and volga bulgars raid of 943 second large scale campaign is dated to 943 when igor was supreme leader of rus according to primary chronicle during 943 expedition rus rowed up kura river deep into caucasus defeated forces of bin muhammad bardha a encyclopaedia of islam and captured bardha a capital of arran rus allowed local people to retain their religion in exchange for recognition of their overlordship it is possible that rus intended to settle permanently there logan 1992 pp 201 202 rus encyclopaedia of islam according to ibn miskawaih local people broke peace by stone throwing and other abuse directed against rus who then demanded that inhabitants evacuate city this ultimatum was rejected and rus began killing people and holding many for ransom slaughter was briefly interrupted for negotiations which soon broke down logan 1992 pp 201 202 rus stayed in bardha a for several months according to yaqut they stayed for a whole year bardha a encyclopaedia of islam using it as a base for plundering adjacent areas and amassed substantial spoils vernadsky 1959 p 269 city was saved only by an outbreak of dysentery among rus logan 1992 p 202 ibn miskawaih writes that rus indulged excessively in fruit of which there are numerous sorts there this produced an epidemic among them and their numbers began thereby to be reduced encouraged by epidemic among rus muslims approached city rus their chief riding on a donkey made an unsuccessful sally after which they lost 700 warriors but evaded encirclement and retreated to bardha a fortress where they were besieged by muslims exhausted by disease and siege rus left by night fortress in which they had established their quarters carrying on their backs all they could of their treasure gems and fine raiment boys and girls as they wanted and made for kura river where ships in which they had issued from their home were in readiness with their crews and 300 russes whom they had been supporting with portions of their booty muslims then exhumed from rus graves weapons that had been buried beside warriors george vernadsky proposed that oleg of novgorod was donkey riding chief of rus who attacked bardha a vernadsky identified oleg with helgu a figure mentioned in schechter letter according to that document helgu went to persia by boat and died there after a failed attack on constantinople in 941 vernadsky 1959 p 270 see also e g zuckerman 257 268 christian 341 345 on other hand lev gumilev drawing on name of rus leader as recorded in arabian sources hypothesizes that this leader was sveneld a varangian chieftain whose wealth was noted in primary chronicle under 945 kievan chronicle mentions that fabulous richness of sveneld s troops incited such envy of igor s warriors that they attempted to levy tribute from drevlians for second time in one month drevlians revolted and killed igor in 944 or 945 gumilev suggests that while engaged in his successful caspian expedition sveneld did not take part in igor s unfortunate raid on constantinople which ended ignominiously this scenario also explains glaring absence of sveneld s name from igor s treaty with byzantium 944 as preserved in primary chronicle destruction of khazaria right thumb site of khazar fortress at sarkel sacked by sviatoslav c 965 aerial photo from excavations conducted by mikhail artamonov in 1930s sources are not clear about roots of conflict between khazaria and rus so several possibilities have been suggested rus had an interest in removing khazar hold on volga trade route because khazars collected duties from goods transported by volga byzantine incitement also apparently played a role khazars were allies of byzantines until reign of romanus i who persecuted jews of his empire according to schechter letter khazar ruler joseph responded to persecution of jews by doing away with many christians and romanus retaliated by inciting oleg of novgorod called helgu in letter against khazaria conflict may also have been spurred by khazars decision to close passage down volga in response to raid of 943 in khazar correspondence written around 950 960 khazar ruler joseph reported his role as defender of muslim polities of caspian region against rus incursions i have to wage war with them rus for if i would give them any chance at all they would lay waste whole land of muslims as far as baghdad khazar encyclopaedia of islam earlier conflict between muslim elements of khazar army and rus marauders in c 912 may have contributed to this arrangement and hostility of rus against khazaria christian 1999 p 296 in 965 sviatoslav i of kiev finally went to war against khazaria he employed oghuz and pecheneg mercenaries in this campaign perhaps to counter khazars superior cavalry christian 1999 p 298 pletneva 1990 p 18 sviatoslav destroyed khazar city of sarkel around 965 and possibly sacked but did not occupy khazar city of kerch on crimea christian 1999 p 298 he subsequently probably in 968 or 969 destroyed khazar capital of atil see generally christian 1999 pp 297 298 dunlop 1954 artamonov proposed that sack of sarkel came after destruction of atil artamonov 1962 p 428 a visitor to atil wrote soon after sviatoslav s campaign rus attacked and no grape or raisin remained not a leaf on a branch ibn hawqal is only author who reports sack of after which rus departed for rum and al andaluz ibn also wrote that rus are ones who of old went to andalus and then to earlier attack on muslim spain by a nation of majus muslim name for zoroastrians and occasionally other pagans is mentioned by al masudi rus encyclopaedia of islam sviatoslav s campaign brought prosperity and independence of khazaria to an abrupt end destruction of khazar imperial power paved way for kievan rus to dominate north south trade routes through steppe and across black sea routes that formerly had been a major source of revenue for khazars moreover sviatoslav s campaigns led to increased slavic settlement in region of culture greatly changing demographics and culture of transitional area between forest and steppe later expeditions right thumb 200px runestone commemorates scandinavians who died in expedition of ingvar far travelled in 987 maymun emir of derbent asked rus to help him against local chiefs rus many of whom appear to have been professional soldiers arrived on 18 ships uncertain of their reception they sent only one ship to reconnoitre situation when its crew were massacred by local population rus went on to loot city of in 989 this same maymun is reported to have refused demand of a local preacher to turn over his rus mercenaries to him for either conversion to islam or death in ensuing struggle maymun was driven from city and forced to surrender rus soldiers but he returned in 992 in 1030 rus raided region of shirvan ruler of ganja then paid them much money to help suppress a revolt in beylagan afterwards rus returned home according to one source in november 1031 rus returned but were defeated near baku and expelled year of 1032 saw another rus raid into shirvan they were joined by alans and sarir local muslims defeated rus in 1033 it is unclear to which rus grouping these raiders belonged pritsak suggests that they operated out of a base near terek estuary and had their principal home in pritsak also speculated that rus operating from caspian basin shortly thereafter lent support to oghuz in a power struggle in khwarezm in 1042 ingvar far travelled led an unsuccessful large viking attack against persia with a fleet of 200 ships around 15 20 thousand men legendary saga saga describes last expedition of vikings into caspian dated to 1041 and possibly connected with georgian byzantine battle of in which a varangian force participated around same time in saga much legend is conflated with historical facts this expedition was launched from sweden by ingvar far travelled who went down volga into land of saracens serkland in norse there are no less than twenty six ingvar runestones twenty three of them being in lake malaren region of uppland in sweden referring to swedish warriors who went out with ingvar on his expedition to saracen lands an expedition whose purpose was probably to reopen old trade routes now that bulgars and khazars no longer proved obstacles a stone to ingvar s brother indicates that he went east for gold but that he died in saracen land afterwards no attempts were made by norsemen to reopen route between baltic and caspian seas khaqani tells about invasion of shirvan in 1173 or 1174 in his odes khaqani names rus and khazars rus and alans rus and sarir as invaders peter golden argued that rus mentioned by khaqani were volga pirates who came in 73 ships yevgeni and vladimir minorsky thought invasion was initiated by ruler of bek bars b muzaffar according to minorsky initiative of bek bars was independent of kiev and he must have used bands of free lances who were roaming in south as a prototype of future cossacks minorsky 1945 pp 557 558 i turned to
