new dinosaurs an alternative evolution is a 1988 speculative evolution book written by scottish geologist dougal dixon and illustrated by several illustrators including amanda barlow peter barrett john butler jeane colville anthony duke andy farmer lee gibbons steve holden philip hood martin sean milne denys ovenden and joyce book also features a foreword by desmond morris new dinosaurs explores a hypothetical alternate earth complete with animals and ecosystems where cretaceous paleogene extinction event never occurred leaving non avian dinosaurs and other mesozoic animals an additional 65 million years to evolve and adapt over course of cenozoic to present day new dinosaurs is dixon s second work on speculative evolution following after man 1981 which explored animals of a hypothetical world 50 million years in future where humanity had gone extinct after man used a fictional setting and hypothetical animals to explain natural processes behind evolution whilst new dinosaurs uses its own fictional setting and hypothetical wildlife to explain concept of zoogeography and biogeographic realms it was followed by another speculative evolution work by dixon in 1990 man after man which focused on climate change over next few million years through eyes of future human species genetically engineered to adapt to it some of dougal dixon s hypothetical dinosaurs bear a coincidental resemblance to dinosaurs that were discovered after book s publication as a general example many of dixon s fictional dinosaurs are depicted with feathers something that was not yet widely accepted when book was written summary left thumb new dinosaurs utilizes imagined present day descendants of cretaceous animals to explain biogeographic realms new dinosaurs explores an imagined alternate version of present day earth as dixon imagines it would have been if cretaceous paleogene extinction event had never occurred as in dixon s previous work after man ecology and evolutionary theory are applied to create believable creatures all of which have their own binomial names and text describing their behaviour and interactions with other contemporary animals most of these animals represent surviving dinosaurs pterosaurs and plesiosaurs which dixon discusses through biogeographic realms divisions of earth s land surface based on distributional patterns of animals and other lifeforms in total about sixty animals are described in book about half of amount featured in after man with examples including a widespread group of tree climbing coelurosaurian theropods called huge striding and terrestrial pterosaurs such as giraffe like lank colonial pachycephalosaurs descendants of mesozoic hadrosaurs called adapted to a new lifestyle on grass covered plains of north america amphibious hypsilophodonts flamingo like coelurosaurs and iguanodonts capable of jumping like kangaroos in far north large migratory birds such as tromble with legs almost like tree trunks roam land in terms of predators coelurosaurs dominate in terms of number and diversity often having unique adaptations for instance apex predator of south american pampas coelurosaurian has evolved huge cutting teeth to allow it to prey upon large sauropods pampas is also home to last of tyrannosaurids large scavenging gourmand there are also various dromaeosaurids including jinx adapted to mimic larger herbivorous dinosaurs through scent and appearance world s oceans are home to various pterosaurs such as seagull like and penguin like forms there is also a massive whale like pliosaur that feeds exclusively on plankton kraken an enormous ammonite uses specialized tentacles to entangle and sting anything that comes near it development following success of his previous speculative evolution book after man in 1981 dixon realized that there was a market for popular level books which use fictional examples and settings to explain actual factual scientific processes after man had explained process of evolution by creating a complex hypothetical future ecosystem new dinosaurs was instead aimed at creating a book on zoogeography a subject general public was quite unfamiliar with by using a fictional world in which non avian dinosaurs had not gone extinct to explain process dinosaurs and other animals in new dinosaurs were heavily influenced by paleontology of its time ideas of dinosaur renaissance replacing older ideas of dinosaurs as dumb and slow creatures with active agile and bird like animals are heavily used in book dixon extrapolated on ideas of paleontologists such as robert bakker and gregory s paul when creating his creatures and also used patterns seen in actual evolutionary history of dinosaurs and pushing them to an extreme such as with creation of gourmand an armless and massive scavenger descended from tyrannosaurids reception like its predecessor after man new dinosaurs garnered positive reviews from critics william f allman writing for u s news and world report praised fact that dixon had extrapolated his designs from real dinosaur ancestors and concluded that although whimsical at times most dinosaur researchers would agree with book insofar that had asteroid that brought their extinction not hit planet dinosaurs would probably dominate planet to this day reviews in smithsonian school library journal and booklist were also positive with reviewers calling book an alternative history of world and a quintessential what if book for dinosaur enthusiasts many of animals featured in book were criticized by paleontologists and science writers particularly in that so many of animals are entirely convergent with actual modern day animals in this capacity lank a four legged terrestrial and grazing pterosaur derived from cretaceous family azhdarchidae has been seen by some writers as perhaps worst offender in a 1990 review of book researcher gregory s paul called creature perhaps worst beast in book and unbelievable pointing out that he thought it was infeasible that pterosaurs would evolve into giraffe like animals before more dominant and already terrestrial dinosaurs in 1992 researcher david unwin echoed same sentiment viewing four legged and grass eating pterosaurs as highly unlikely in 2008 british paleontologist and science writer darren naish offered a more redeeming look at animal pointing out that if pterosaurs were to become terrestrial azhdarchids were most likely group to do so and that azhdarchids would have used a gait similar to that of giraffes when walking paul unwin and naish all pointed out that sheer diversity seen in pterosaurs within book is somewhat unlikely as group was low in diversity at point of cretaceous paleogene extinction event azhdarchids being only living group paul even went on to state that he considered pterosaurs surviving into cenozoic doubtful even if extinction event had not happened legacy many of hypothetical animals created for new dinosaurs ended up resembling actual mesozoic creatures that have since been discovered many of hypothetical dinosaurs featured in book are covered in fuzzy integument which in modern times have been discovered in dinosaurs of most groups tree climbing are similar to actual tree climbing small theropods such as microraptor described in 2000 and large terrestrial pterosaurs such as aforementioned lank resemble some animals in actual pterosaur group azhdarchidae peter jackson s 2005 film king kong featured a complete ecosystem populated with descendants of mesozoic animals designers of these animals weta workshop were inspired by dixon s works in particular new dinosaurs recreating eighth wonder making of king kong dvd universal 2006 in 2008 new dinosaurs was adapted into a japanese manga series by
