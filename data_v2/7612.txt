from october 29 1910 it states willie stone is only six years old but he yearns to be a fireman he is much impressed with parade of firemen he sees in his hometown so much so in fact that he basely deserts his sister on streets to follow smoke eaters but willie is only a little boy and despite his enthusiasm he is soon weary and footsore his plight added to his tears attracts attention of a kindly fireman who is driving with his engine back to quarters lad s discomfort is soon forgotten for fireman gives him a ride back to engine house there willie gravely applies to captain for a position on uniformed force and is jokingly accepted but he does not see humor in it and follows other men to where he takes part in their sports but in midst of happiest day of his life an alarm is sounded and firemen hastily slide down pole to their duty new fireman however is not kind to be deserted grabbing helmet insignia of his office he follows others but it is too late to go to fire he arrives in time to hold them up on their way back but is captured by his weeping sister he does not wish to leave his command but his friend fireman jack allen finally induces him to go on promise that he jack will call later perhaps one reason jack is so accommodating is because he likes his sister jack pays ardent court to her and flame of their affection s resists all of young willie s efforts to put it out he didn t really mean to try but he assuredly poured cold water on jack for it was in line of what he regarded as his duty cast marie eline as willie stone william garwood as jack allen unconfirmed mignon anderson as willie stone s sister unconfirmed in december 1912 a notice in monroe news star announced showing of this film and also gave key roles of players though credits cannot be confirmed thanhouser kid marie eline william garwood and mignon anderson were given as featured players this would indicate that garwood played jack allen and sister was played by anderson if information is accurate production writer of scenario is unknown but it was most likely lloyd lonergan he was an experienced newspaperman employed by new york evening world while writing
