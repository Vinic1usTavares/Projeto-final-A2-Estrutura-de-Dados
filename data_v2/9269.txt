to vast stores of medical information enabled individuals seeking to gain sympathy by relating a series of harrowing medical or psychological problems that defy comprehension to misuse groups communication forums specializing in medical or psychological recovery were established to give lay users support in navigating often confusing and frustrating medical processes and bureaucracy communities often formed on those forums with goal of sharing information to help other members medical websites also became common giving lay users access to literature in a way that was accessible to those without specific medical training as internet communication grew in popularity users began to forgo doctors and hospitals often consulted for medical advice frequenting virtual communities that have experience with a medical problem feldman notes is easier than going through physical pain or illness that would be necessary before visiting a doctor to get attention sought by pretending to be gravely ill internet users can gain sympathy from a group whose sole reason for existence is support health care professionals with their limited time greater medical knowledge and tendency to be more skeptical in their diagnoses may be less likely to provide that support shreve jenn june 6 2001 they think they feel your pain wired com retrieved on july 28 2009 behavior patterns people who

websites or textbooks is often duplicated or discussed in great detail length and severity of purported physical ailments conflicts with user behavior feldman uses example of someone posting in considerable detail about being in septic shock when such a possibility is extremely unlikely symptoms of ailments may be exaggerated as they correspond to a user s misunderstanding of nature of an illness grave situations and increasingly critical prognoses are interspersed with miraculous recoveries a user s posts eventually reveal contradictory information or claims that are implausible for example other users of a forum may find that a user has been divulging contradictory information about occurrence or length of hospital visits when attention and sympathy decreases to focus on other members of group a user may announce that other dire events have transpired including illness or death of a close family member when faced with insufficient expressions of attention or sympathy a forum member claims this as a cause that symptoms worsen or do not improve a user resists contact beyond internet such as by telephone or personal visit often claiming bizarre reasons for not being able to accept such contact further emergencies are described with inappropriate happiness designed to garner immediate reactions posts of other forum members exhibit identical writing styles spelling errors and language idiosyncrasies suggesting that user has created fictitious identities to move conversation in their direction causes feldman has admitted in several interviews that he has been victim of people who email him to explain psychiatric symptoms only to divulge eventually that they created it all to fool a doctor for prolonged cases he states impetus for such behavior is longing for nurturing sympathy care and concern that they feel unable to get in appropriate ways and that admiration of forum members is a strong motivator to continue as manipulation is integral to most cases need to control others to feel as if perpetrator is in control of his or her own life is apparent as is pre existence of underlying personality disorders many people who present factitious disorders crave sympathy and support because it was notably absent in childhood in a story published in village voice in 2001 a woman recovering from factitious disorder remembered her drive to create
