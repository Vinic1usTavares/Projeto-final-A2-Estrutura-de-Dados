402 history predecessor highways left thumb upright map of central southern michigan in 1919 showing route of m 29 alt map first major overland transportation corridors in future state of michigan were indian trails none of these followed path of modern i 69 however state trunkline highway system was created on may 13 1913 by an act of michigan legislature at time none of system s divisions corresponded to modern i 69 either in 1919 michigan state highway department mshd was required to signpost highway system for first time and state became second after wisconsin to do so at time two different highways followed sections of modern i 69 corridor original m 29 ran from indiana state line north to charlotte and turned northeasterly to lansing second highway was m 21 from flint east to goodells a community west of port huron highway was extended to port huron by 1924 on november 11 1926 united states numbered highway system was approved by american association of state highway officials aasho and new us 27 replaced m 29 from state line northward to lansing by end of next year m 78 was extended from charlotte north and east of lansing to a junction with m 47 near pittsburg north of modern i 69 section of m 78 north of lansing was changed in 1929 segment from dewitt to pittsburg was redesignated m 104 and m 78 was rerouted along a more southerly path through east lansing to haslett by 1936 m 78 was extended from haslett all way into flint to end at m 21 first span of blue water bridge opened between port huron and point edward ontario in 1938 interstate highway era thumb right upright 1958 planning map for michigan s interstate highways alt map first planning maps from 1947 for what later became interstate highway system did not include a highway along i 69 s route instead a highway further west connecting south bend indiana with kalamazoo was included this alternative highway was maintained on 1955 plan for national system of interstate and defense highways and numbered i 67 in august 1957 by june 1958 this freeway had been shifted further east and renumbered i 69 connecting indianapolis indiana with marshall no connections north and east to lansing flint or port huron were planned as part of interstate highway system around same time a section of m 146 near port huron was converted into an approach freeway for blue water bridge by middle of 1960 first section of freeway along m 78 was opened in lennon area next year freeway had been extended as far southwest as durand from end at lennon also in 1961 mshd had proposed that section of us 27 south of lansing be built as an electronic highway under a bid through general motors testing for such a roadway was ultimately done at ohio state university instead thumb left 450px 1957 map

december 12 1962 i 96 was completed around lansing area and m 78 was rerouted to follow it a year later i 496 was partially opened through lansing area and m 78 was routed to follow it as well former route through downtown was redesignated business m 78 bus m 78 around same time i 94 was extended along blue water bridge approach freeway first freeway segment of m 21 on east end was built from wadhams to port huron in 1966 next year m 78 s freeway was extended eastward to i 75 us 10 us 23 in flint on october 11 1967 first segment of i 69 us 27 was scheduled to open between indiana state line and tekonsha by end of year freeway extended north to i 94 northwest of marshall mshd requested additional interstate highway mileage in 1968 under federal aid highway act of 1968 including an extension of i 69 from marshall to port huron this extension was approved as far as i 75 us 23 in flint on december 13 1968 a discontinuous section of m 78 freeway east of flint was completed in 1969 same year i 475 was named david dunbar buick freeway after founder of buick motor company in flint same legislation house concurrent resolution 22 of 1969 named m 78 freeway through flint for louis chevrolet in 1970 i 496 freeway was completed and bus m 78 designation was removed through lansing a freeway segment between flint and lapeer opened in 1971 m 21 was routed down m 13 to new freeway where it joined m 78 designation from m 13 east section of m 21 formerly between m 13 and bus m 54 was redesignated m 56 m 78 designation was replaced by i 69 in 1973 after a temporary i 69 temp i 69 designation was extended northward from charlotte through lansing to perry on september 4 of that year i 69 s designation was officially extended by congress to end at i 475 on east side of flint this extension and all subsequent ones was of non chargeable mileage or segments not financed through interstate highway fund in 1980 a flint area politician wanted to dedicate a highway after united auto workers uaw as a result david dunbar buick freeway name was moved off i 475 and applied to i 69 in flint american association of state highway and transportation officials aashto approved extension of i 69 designation eastward in 1983 so it would terminate at international boundary at port huron this approval was contingent on construction of roadway to interstate highway standards and other appropriate approvals at federal government level remaining segment of freeway connecting lapeer with wadhams opened in 1984 as i 69 and several additional changes were made to highway system at same time m 21 was shortened to flint and replaced m 56 through city former route of m 21 in port huron became bl i 69 and remainder of that highway was turned back to local control i 69 designation was officially extended once more under congressional legislation on february 10 1987 this last extension designated i 69 all way to i 94 in port huron to reflect 1984 openings another segment of freeway opened in 1987 in clinton county between us 127 near dewitt and temp i 69 near bath this section was connected to existing freeway at perry in 1991 final segment of i 69 to be completed was located southwest of lansing it opened on october 17 1992 when ribbon was cut by governor john engler this segment marked last in state to complete michigan s portion of interstate highway system at time it was completed i 69 was concurrent with us 27 from state line north to dewitt area exit 87 and then concurrent with us 127 to exit 89 before running alone to port huron since completion a second span of blue water bridge between port huron and point edward opened in july 1997 st johns bypass on us 27 opened on august 31 1998 us 27 was extended along i 69 about to connect to bypass and us 127 was
