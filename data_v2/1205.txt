lewis it became first aircraft to drop an atomic bomb bomb code named little boy was targeted at city of hiroshima japan and caused near complete destruction of city enola gay participated in second atomic attack as weather reconnaissance aircraft for primary target of kokura clouds and drifting smoke resulted in a secondary target nagasaki being bombed instead after war enola gay returned to united states where it was operated from roswell army air field new mexico in may 1946 it was flown to kwajalein for operation crossroads nuclear tests in pacific but was not chosen to make test drop at bikini atoll later that year it was transferred to smithsonian institution and spent many years parked at air bases exposed to weather and souvenir hunters before being disassembled and transported to smithsonian s storage facility at suitland maryland in 1961 in 1980s veterans groups engaged in a call for smithsonian to put aircraft on display leading to an acrimonious debate about exhibiting aircraft without a proper historical context cockpit and nose section of aircraft were exhibited at national air and space museum nasm in downtown washington d c for bombing s 50th anniversary in 1995

now known as offutt air force base bomber was one of 15 initial examples of b 29s built to silverplate specification 65 of these eventually being completed during and after world war ii giving them primary ability to function as nuclear weapon delivery aircraft these modifications included an extensively modified bomb bay with pneumatic doors and british bomb attachment and release systems

base at wendover army air field utah on 14 june 1945 thirteen days later aircraft left wendover for guam where it received a bomb bay modification and flew to north field tinian on 6 july it was initially given victor squadron assigned identification number 12 but on 1 august was given circle r tail markings of 6th bombardment group as a security measure and had its victor number changed to 82 to avoid misidentification with actual 6th bombardment group aircraft during july bomber made eight practice or training flights and flew two missions on 24 and 26 july to drop pumpkin bombs on industrial targets at kobe and nagoya enola gay was used on 31 july on a rehearsal flight for actual mission partially assembled little boy gun type fission weapon l 11 weighing was contained inside a x x wooden crate that was secured to deck of unlike six uranium 235 target discs which were later flown to tinian on three separate aircraft arriving 28 and 29 july assembled projectile with nine

preparation for first atomic mission tibbets assumed command of aircraft and named it after his mother enola gay tibbets who in turn had been named for heroine of a novel when it came to selecting a name for plane tibbets later recalled that name was painted on aircraft on 5 august by allan l karl an enlisted man in 509th regularly assigned aircraft commander robert lewis was unhappy to be displaced by tibbets for this important mission and became furious when he arrived at aircraft on morning of 6 august to see it painted with now famous nose art hiroshima was primary target of first nuclear bombing mission on 6 august with kokura and nagasaki as alternative targets enola gay piloted by tibbets took off from north field in northern mariana islands about six hours flight time from japan accompanied by two other b 29s great artiste carrying instrumentation and a then nameless aircraft later called necessary evil commanded by captain george marquardt to take photographs director

risks during takeoff his assistant second lieutenant morris r jeppson removed safety devices 30 minutes before reaching target area release at 08 15 hiroshima time went as planned and little boy took 43 seconds to fall from aircraft flying at to predetermined detonation height about above city enola gay traveled before it felt shock waves from blast although buffeted by shock neither enola gay nor great artiste was damaged detonation created a blast equivalent to u 235 weapon was considered very inefficient with only 1 7 of its fissile material reacting radius of total destruction was about one mile 1 6 km with resulting fires across americans estimated that of city were destroyed japanese officials determined that 69 of hiroshima s buildings were destroyed and another 6 7 damaged some 70

including journalists and photographers had gathered to watch planes return tibbets was first to disembark and was presented with distinguished service cross on spot nagasaki mission hiroshima mission was followed by another atomic strike originally scheduled for 11 august it was brought forward by two days to 9 august owing to a forecast of bad weather this time a fat man nuclear weapon was carried by b 29 bockscar piloted by major charles w sweeney enola gay flown by captain george marquardt s crew b 10 was weather reconnaissance aircraft for kokura primary target enola gay reported clear skies over kokura but by time bockscar arrived city was obscured by smoke from fires from conventional bombing of yahata by 224 b 29s day before after three unsuccessful passes bockscar diverted to its secondary target nagasaki where it dropped its bomb in contrast to hiroshima mission nagasaki mission has been described as tactically botched although mission did meet its objectives crew

smithsonian storage facility at suitland 1987 on 6 november 1945 lewis flew enola gay back to united states arriving at 509th s new base at roswell army air field new mexico on 8 november on 29 april 1946 enola gay left roswell as part of operation crossroads nuclear weapons tests in pacific it flew to kwajalein atoll on 1 may it was not chosen to make test drop at bikini atoll and left kwajalein on 1 july date of test reaching fairfield suisun army air field california next day decision was made to preserve enola gay and on 24 july 1946 aircraft was flown to davis monthan air force base tucson arizona in preparation for storage on 30 august 1946 title to aircraft was transferred to smithsonian institution and enola gay was removed from usaaf inventory from 1946 to 1961 enola gay was put into temporary storage at a number of locations it was at davis monthan from 1 september 1946 until 3 july 1949 when it was flown to orchard place air field park ridge illinois by tibbets for acceptance by smithsonian it was moved to air force base texas on 12 january 1952 and then to andrews air force base maryland on 2 december 1953 because smithsonian had no storage space for aircraft it was hoped that air force would guard plane but lacking hangar space it was left outdoors on a remote part of air base exposed to elements souvenir hunters broke in and removed parts insects and birds then gained access to aircraft paul e garber of smithsonian institution became concerned about enola gays condition and on 10 august 1960 smithsonian staff began dismantling aircraft components were transported to smithsonian storage facility at suitland maryland on 21 july 1961 enola gay remained at suitland for many years by early 1980s two veterans of 509th don and his former navigator in 509th frank b stewart began lobbying for aircraft to be restored and put on display they enlisted tibbets and senator barry goldwater in their campaign in 1983 walter j boyne a former b 52 pilot with strategic air command became director of national air and space museum and he made enola gays restoration a priority looking at aircraft tibbets recalled was a sad meeting my fond memories and i don t mean dropping of bomb were numerous occasions i flew airplane i pushed it very very hard and it never failed me it was probably most beautiful piece of machinery that any pilot ever flew restoration of bomber began on 5 december 1984 at paul e garber preservation restoration and storage facility in suitland silver hill maryland propellers that were used on bombing mission were later shipped to texas a m university one of these propellers was trimmed to for use in university s oran w nicks low speed wind tunnel lightweight aluminum variable pitch propeller is powered by a 1 250 kva electric motor providing a wind speed up to two engines were rebuilt at garber and two at san diego air space museum some parts and instruments had been removed and could not be located replacements were found or fabricated and marked so that future curators could distinguish them from original components restoration exhibition controversy thumb under cockpit window of enola gay while in storage gay became center of a controversy at smithsonian institution when museum planned to put its fuselage on public display in 1995 as part of an exhibit commemorating 50th anniversary of atomic bombing of hiroshima exhibit crossroads end of world war ii atomic bomb and cold war was drafted by smithsonian s national air and space museum staff and arranged around restored enola gay critics of planned exhibit especially those of american legion and air force association charged that exhibit focused too much attention on japanese casualties inflicted by nuclear bomb rather than on motives for bombing or discussion of bomb s role in ending conflict with japan exhibit brought to national attention many long standing academic and political issues related to retrospective views of bombings after attempts to revise exhibit to meet satisfaction of competing interest groups exhibit was canceled on 30 january 1995 martin o director of national air and space museum was compelled to resign over controversy he later reflected that forward fuselage went on display on 28 june 1995 on 2 july 1995 three people were arrested for throwing ash and human blood on aircraft s fuselage following an earlier incident in which a protester had thrown red paint over gallery s carpeting exhibition closed on 18 may 1998 and fuselage was returned to garber facility for final restoration complete restoration and display restoration work began in 1984 and would eventually require 300 000 staff hours while fuselage was on display from 1995 to 1998 work continued on remaining unrestored components aircraft was shipped in pieces to national air and space museum s steven f udvar hazy center in chantilly virginia from march june 2003 with fuselage and wings reunited for first time since 1960 on 10 april 2003 and assembly completed on 8 august 2003 aircraft has been on display at udvar hazy center since museum annex opened on 15 december 2003 as a result of earlier controversy signage around aircraft provided only same succinct technical data as is provided for other aircraft in museum without discussion of controversial issues it read thumb enola gay nose port side at steven f udvar hazy center display of enola gay without reference to historical context of world war ii cold war or development and deployment of nuclear weapons aroused controversy a petition from a group calling themselves committee for a national discussion of nuclear history and current policy bemoaned display of enola gay as a technological achievement which it described as an extraordinary callousness toward victims indifference to deep divisions among american citizens about propriety of these actions and disregard for feelings of most of world s peoples it attracted signatures from notable figures including historian gar
