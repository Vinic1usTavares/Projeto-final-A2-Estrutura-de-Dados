slade s case or slade v morley was a case in english contract law that ran from 1596 to 1602 under medieval common law claims seeking repayment of a debt or other matters could only be pursued through a writ of debt in court of common pleas a problematic and archaic process by 1558 lawyers had succeeded in creating another method enforced by court of king s bench through action of assumpsit which was technically for deceit legal fiction used was that by failing to pay after promising to do so a defendant had committed deceit and was liable to plaintiff conservative common pleas through appellate court court of exchequer chamber began to overrule decisions made by king s bench on assumpsit causing friction between courts in slade s case a case under assumpsit which was brought between judges of common pleas and king s bench was transferred to court of exchequer chamber where king s bench judges were allowed to vote case dragged on for five years with judgment finally being delivered in 1602 by chief justice of king s bench john popham popham ruled that assumpsit claims were valid a decision called a watershed moment in english law with archaic and outdated principles being overwritten by modern and effective assumpsit which soon became main cause of action in contract cases this is also seen as an example of judicial legislation with courts making a revolutionary decision parliament had failed to make background under medieval common law there was only one way to resolve a dispute seeking repayment of money or other contract matters a writ of debt which only court of common pleas could hear this was archaic did not work against executors of a will and involved precise pleading a minor flaw in documents put to court could see case thrown out by middle of 16th century lawyers had attempted to devise an alternative using action of assumpsit which was technically a type of trespass due to deceit argument was based on idea that there was an inherent promise in a contract to pay money and that by failing to pay defendant had deceived plaintiff by 1558 lawyers had succeeded with court of king s bench agreeing to hear cases under this piece of legal fiction judges of common pleas however a more traditional group rejected this argument and only accepted cases where an actual promise had been made in addition to contract action of assumpsit had several advantages over a writ of debt plaintiff could count on always having a jury while in writs of debt defendant could rely on wager of law where he produced twelve people to swear he did not owe plaintiff money and had case dismissed in addition it worked for executory agreements not just normal contracts in 1585 a new form of court of exchequer chamber was set up an appellate court where common pleas judges held a majority and regularly began to reverse king s bench judgments which were based on assumpsit this and conflict between king s bench and common pleas as a whole was problematic a plaintiff at assizes could not be sure which sort of judge his case would come before lending uncertainty to law boyer suggests that in this environment chief justice of king s bench john popham deliberately provoked common pleas to resolve matter and did so through slade s case facts john slade was a grain merchant who claimed that humphrey morley had agreed to buy a crop of wheat and rye from him paying ps16 and had reneged on agreement he brought case before assizes in 1596 where it was heard by two judges one of common pleas and one of king s bench it was heard under assumpsit and jury found that morley indeed owed slade money before a judgment could be issued popham had case transferred to an older version of court of exchequer chamber which sitting in serjeant s inn allowed king s bench judges to sit edward coke was counsel for slade arguing that king s bench had power to hear assumpsit actions along with laurence tanfield while francis bacon and john doddridge represented morley quality of legal argument was high bacon was a skillful subtle intellect capable of distinguishing precedent brought up by coke while doddridge a member of society of antiquaries knew records even better than coke did coke rather than directly confronting opposing counsel made a twofold argument firstly that fact that king s bench had been allowed to hear assumpsit actions for so long meant that it was acceptable based on institutional inertia and second that on subject of assumpsit being used for breaches of promise that original agreement included an implied promise to make payment case continued for five years at one point judges let matter continue for three years because they could not reach a decision eventually in november 1602 popham issued a judgment on behalf of court which stated firstly that every contract executory implies in itself a promise or assumpsit secondly that although upon such a contract an action of debt lies plaintiff may well have an action in case upon assumpsit coke in his report of case published in 1604 reports that judgment was unanimous while more modern commentators such as boyer assert that it was narrow most likely 6 to 5 with dividing line being between king s bench judges and common pleas judgment lord popham cj held that slade could sue and was successful he said following 1602 4 co rep 91a significance impact of case was immediate and overwhelming ibbetson considers slade s case to be a watershed moment in which archaic and conservative form of law was overwritten by a modern more efficient method assumpsit became dominant form of contract cases with door opened wide to plaintiffs boyer suggests this was perhaps too wide in his commentaries on laws of england william blackstone explained that this was reason why statute of frauds was subsequently passed in 1677 case is particularly notable as an example of judicial legislation with judges significantly modernising law and moving it forward in a way parliament had not considered as a side impact coke s arguments were first to define consideration conservative outlook of common pleas soon changed after death of edmund anderson more activist francis gawdy became chief justice of common pleas and other common pleas judges many of whom were uncertain but had followed anderson s lead in case changed their mind
