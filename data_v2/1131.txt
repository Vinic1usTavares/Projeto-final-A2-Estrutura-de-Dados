west midlands regional league is an english association football competition for semi professional and amateur teams based in west midlands county shropshire herefordshire worcestershire and southern staffordshire it has three divisions highest of which is premier division which sits at step 6 of national league system or tenth level of overall english football league system league was formed in 1889 as birmingham district league to cater for teams in birmingham and surrounding area but soon became established as one of strongest leagues outside football league itself with teams from as far afield as bristol and wales taking part after second world war it absorbed rival birmingham combination to become firmly established as leading league in area but a gradual decline in its status began in late 1950s and it now operates at a much lower level than in its heyday league currently acts as a feeder to midland football league premier division to which one team is promoted to each season approximately fifty teams compete in league each season with new members regularly joining from a number of lower more local leagues history early years in late 1880s birmingham and surrounding region boasted many of country s strongest football teams six of region s leading clubs joined first two national leagues set up in england football league and football alliance but there were still many teams in area keen to participate in league play on 31 may 1889 a meeting took place at birmingham s grand hotel with view to forming a birmingham district league a total of 17 clubs were invited but only 13 attended of which 12 were selected to form new league to commence play in 1889 90 season one club which sent a representative to meeting but was not invited to take part in league for unknown reasons was worcester rovers 12 clubs competing in league s inaugural season were aston victoria great bridge unity hednesford town ironbridge kidderminster harriers kidderminster olympic langley green victoria oldbury town smethwick carriage works unity gas department wellington st george s and willenhall pickwick although kidderminster olympic topped final table no championship was awarded as a number of fixtures had not been completed this situation was to be repeated in each of subsequent two seasons in both of which brierley hill alliance who had joined league for its second season topped table but did not win title early years of league also saw new teams joining and existing ones dropping out almost every season but once league s structure settled down it came to be regarded as one of strongest leagues outside football league itself rivalled only by southern league and midland league despite league s name in years prior to first world war it came to include teams from as far afield as bristol wrexham and crewe as well as including reserve teams of local football league clubs a number of clubs which had enjoyed success in birmingham combination also joined league which was seen as a step up to a better standard of football league s large coverage area began to create problems in 1930s however as many clubs found long and costly journeys to away matches difficult and began to drop out in favour of playing in leagues which covered smaller areas in 1938 bangor city worcester city wellington town and reserve teams of cardiff city and wrexham all resigned from league reducing numbers so much that instead of usual format organising committee decided to run two separate competitions each lasting for half of 1938 39 season first named keys cup and second league cup by time competitive football was abandoned in 1939 due to outbreak of second world war rival birmingham combination which had not chosen to accept teams from such a wide area had consolidated and come to be regarded as region s top league post war years although league lost further clubs to combination which was quicker to restart after war within a few years league had regained its position of pre eminence in region increasing to almost twice its pre war size during 1952 53 season league s committee proposed a merger of two competitions but combination rejected idea whereupon combination s six best teams all resigned and joined league combination s committee then attempted to re open merger talks but having just bolstered its ranks with six new members league was not interested a year later all of combination s 14 remaining clubs with exception of west bromwich albion s a third team left to join league which effectively absorbed its former rival 40 member clubs were split into northern and southern divisions which a year later were re arranged into divisions one and two with promotion and relegation taking place between two at end of 1957 58 season burton albion and nuneaton borough left to join an expanding southern league followed a year later by hinckley athletic in an attempt to consolidate league decided to expel all remaining reserve teams reducing to a single division of 22 clubs four years later it changed its name to west midlands regional league to more accurately reflect its catchment area which now included very few teams from birmingham or its immediate environs for 1965 66 season league was able to revert to a two division structure when it rebranded its existing single division premier division and added a new division one by 1976 a steady flow of teams joining from smaller regional leagues led to division one being split into divisions one a and one b revised a year later to divisions one and two modern era thumb right action from 2006 as now defunct wyrley rangers take on gornal athletic alliance premier league was formed in 1979 pushing regional league further down english football league system successful regional league clubs such as bilston town hednesford town and halesowen town began applying to and being accepted into southern league reducing regional league to status of a feeder league although their departures continued to be offset by a flow of new members from lower level leagues reflecting demographics of west midlands area a number of british asian teams joined league including sikh hunters england s first ever all sikh team at same time catchment areas of regional league and midland football combination were increasingly converging and by early 1990s standard of play and geographical coverage of two competitions were considered to be almost identical a new competition was formed in 1994 to cater for best clubs previously split across two leagues and thus regional league lost ten of its member clubs to midland football alliance further reducing its own status reduction in numbers forced league to revert to a two division structure but within two seasons numbers had grown again to extent that division one was split into divisions one north and one south for 1996 97 season a format retained until 2004 when two division ones were re organised into division one and division two although league now operates at a level much below that which it occupied in its heyday it continues to survive and holds distinction jointly with northern league of being second oldest football league in existence behind only football league itself structure league currently has no title sponsor previously it has been sponsored by sport italia wolverhampton based express star newspaper and black country brewery banks s some of teams in lower two divisions are reserve teams of clubs playing at a higher level each division is contested on a double round robin basis with each team playing each of other teams in division once at home and once away three points are awarded for a win increased from two with effect from 1988 89 season one for a draw and zero for a defeat goal difference is used to separate teams on same points having replaced goal average at start of 1978 79 season from 1994 95 to 2013 14 seasons regional league along with midland football combination served as one of two official feeders to midland football alliance highest placed team which met alliance s entry requirements was promoted to alliance and one or more teams were relegated into regional league from alliance depending on number of clubs remaining in each league in 2014 alliance and combination merged to form midland league and regional league now acts as a feeder to top division of that league prior to 2006 07 season regional league s top division was defined as a step 7 league within national league system even though it fed into alliance which was graded as step 5 in 2006 regional league was re graded by football association as a step 6 league teams in top two divisions are eligible to take part in fa cup and fa vase as long as their grounds meet required standards since reg organisation in 1994 regional league has accepted applications for membership from successful teams in smaller local leagues within its catchment area leagues whose clubs have joined regional league include shropshire county league herefordshire league wolverhampton combination and kidderminster district league several ambitious local sunday league teams have also switched to saturday play and entered league bewdley town bromyard town and ellesmere rangers have all joined from county leagues since 1994 and subsequently gone on to gain promotion to premier division regional league teams could also theoretically be relegated to local leagues but in practice this almost never happens only teams in recent history to drop down to a county league have been leominster town kington town and hinton who dropped down to herefordshire league in 2004 2006 and 2007 respectively although all three clubs resigned voluntarily in favour of playing in a more local league as opposed to being relegated due to finishing at bottom of table attendance at one time league attracted large crowds for matches with 3 000 spectators watching a match between coventry city and shrewsbury town in 1899 by early 1960s despite league s decline in status kidderminster harriers were still able to attract crowds of around 1 000 fans for home matches in modern era however crowds are much smaller in 1993 94 season averaged around 100 fans for home games and several of team s away matches drew crowds of less than 40 attendance figures are not currently published for league fixtures however in fa vase in 2005 06 season home attendances for regional league teams averaged around 50 with only wellington s match against alvechurch of then existent midland alliance drawing over 100 spectators current
