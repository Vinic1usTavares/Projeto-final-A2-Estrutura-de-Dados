coinage act of 1873 or mint act of 1873 17 stat 424 was a general revision of laws relating to mint of united states in abolishing right of holders of silver bullion to have their metal struck into fully legal tender dollar coins it ended bimetallism in united states placing nation firmly on gold standard because of this act became contentious in later years and was denounced by some as crime of 73 by 1869 mint act of 1837 was deemed outdated and treasury secretary george boutwell had deputy comptroller of currency john jay knox undertake a draft of a revised law which was introduced into congress by ohio senator john sherman due to high price of silver little of that metal was presented at mint but knox and others foresaw that development of comstock lode and other rich silver mining areas would lower price causing large quantities of silver dollars to be struck and gold standard to be endangered during almost three years bill was pending before congress it was rarely mentioned that it would end bimetallism though this was not concealed congressmen instead debated other provisions legislation in addition to ending production of silver dollar abolished three low denomination coins bill became act of february 12 1873 with signature of president ulysses s grant when silver prices dropped in 1876 producers sought to have their bullion struck at mint only to learn that this was no longer possible matter became a major political controversy that lasted remainder of century pitting those who valued deflationary gold standard against those who believed free coinage of silver to be necessary for economic prosperity accusations were made that passage of act had been secured through corruption though there is little evidence of this gold standard was explicitly enacted into law in 1900 and was completely abandoned by u s in 1971 background mint act of 1792 established mint of united states mint in its first decades only coined gold and silver in response to deposits of that metal by citizens returning bullion to depositor in form of coins either gold or silver could be presented for conversion into currency as both metals were a legal tender a dollar was equal to both a legally defined weight of silver and another legally defined quantity of gold having a currency be defined in terms of two different metals is called bimetallism such a system may experience instability as price of gold and silver on world market changes and this took place in first decades after 1792 as relative values of gold and silver in europe changed at that time gold or silver u s coins were rarely seen in nation as they were heavily exported because of such shifts most pieces in circulation were foreign in origin in 1834 congress made a dollar worth slightly less thus lightening u s gold and silver coins known collectively as specie making them uneconomical to export and they were seen more often in commerce within u s with this greater circulation congress re examined existing statutes relating to mint and found many provisions to be obsolete it enacted mint act of 1837 a thorough revision of statutes relating to mint new provisions included establishment of a bullion fund allowing depositors to be paid without waiting for their metal to go through coining process ratio of value between equivalent weights of gold and silver was adjusted slightly allowing coins of both metals to circulate within u s thumb left 450px under an 1853 act depositors could no longer have their metal struck into half dollars when silver prices rose relative to gold as a reaction to california gold rush silver coinage was worth more than face value and rapidly flowed overseas for melting despite vocal opposition led by tennessee representative and future president andrew johnson precious metal content of smaller silver coins was reduced in 1853 allowing them to circulate until then depositors of silver could choose to have their bullion struck into silver coins of any denomination of five cents or above act of 1853 lightened silver coins from half dime to half dollar and eliminated right of depositor to have silver struck into those denominations depositors could still choose to have silver struck into dollar coins but since there was more than a dollar s worth of silver in a dollar coin it was more profitable to sell bullion to manufacturers and jewelers so long as silver prices remained high this effectively placed united states on gold standard although mint rarely received deposits of silver for striking into coins after 1853 it purchased silver bullion using new lightweight silver coins at above market prices this was illegal as congress had ordered that new lightweight coins only be purchasable using gold a provision intended to limit quantities sold to actual demand as silver pieces had a legal tender limit of 5 if excessive numbers were circulated they might choke commerce this in fact occurred and merchants and bankers complained that legal tender limit was causing them to have to sell accumulations at a discount to brokers glut was replaced with a shortage when most federal coins were hoarded amid economic chaos of civil war slowest to vanish was base metal cent which only had value because government said it did and at that time confidence in government was shaken eventually it too vanished from circulation and commanded a premium for change a variety of makeshifts replaced vanished coins such as fractional currency and merchant s tokens beginning in 1864 congress began to authorize base metal coins that would not be hoarded it reduced weight of cent causing it to be made of bronze and also required a two cent piece of same metal following year saw initiation of three cent nickel and in 1866 five cent nickel today simply known as nickel began production two cent piece initially popular saw declining mintages as public preferred smaller more convenient nickel coins greenbacks which were backed by neither silver nor gold but by credit of united states and which were necessitated by vast wartime expenditures had helped to finance war in late 1860s politicians disagreed about how quickly to have government resume paying out gold and silver in payment of its obligations treasury secretary hugh mcculloch felt best way to return to that practice was to withdraw greenbacks as quickly as possible and he did so until stopped by congress which felt his stand was hurting economy more and more silver was being mined in far west falls in price of metal made option of depositing silver at mint in exchange for coin more attractive and mintages of silver dollar rose considerably in late 1860s and into 1870s silver dollar was fully legal tender and some officials worried that increased deposits would cause silver to drive gold from circulation as predicted by gresham s law endangering gold standard as it had been two decades since much silver was regularly deposited for striking into coins fact that united states had been on a bimetallic standard since 1792 was often forgotten gold standard was seen as only possible choice and many people assumed that united states was on that standard which had been adopted by strong nations like united kingdom 1816 and german empire 1871 inception thumb upright john jay knox photographed by mathew brady losses of nearly 250 000 at san francisco mint had concerned treasury and in 1866 mccullough sent john jay knox a treasury employee on a special investigatory mission knox found that in transferring bullion between various officers of that mint had led to inconsistent sets of accounts but due to lack of receipts kept it was not possible to pinpoint who was to blame in 1869 knox by then deputy comptroller of currency was sent by mccullough s successor george boutwell to investigate other mint facilities discovering severe irregularities and large government losses at new york assay office knox again discovered a dearth of proper accounting procedures and that officials there had trouble finding a copy of mint s regulations in 1867 an international monetary conference was held in paris to discuss how to have gold coins of various countries struck to a common standard slight adjustments to british gold sovereign and to five dollar gold piece or half eagle would make each equal to 25 francs and it was proposed that british and americans make those changes while france began striking a 25 franc piece none of this ever came to fruition but in january 1868 ohio senator john sherman introduced legislation to place united states formally on gold standard to eliminate silver as a legal tender and to implement recommendations of conference knox in his 1866 report had recommended a thorough revision of laws pertaining to mint and in january 1870 secretary boutwell instructed him to prepare a draft in this knox had assistance of former mint director henry linderman who then held a roving commission for treasury department linderman would in 1873 become first director of bureau of mint knox completed a draft bill intended to repeal many antiquated legal provisions and to rewrite others he proposed to eliminate standard silver dollar he proposed a lightweight silver dollar that would have a low legal tender limit move office of director of mint from philadelphia to washington eliminate mint s charge to strike gold bullion then 5 percent and abolish office of treasurer at mints and assay offices transferring its functions to superintendent in drafting bill knox consulted with a number of former mint officers besides linderman such as former directors james ross snowden and robert m patterson as well as former philadelphia mint chief coiner franklin peale mint director james pollard submitted bill to congress on april 25 1870 consideration and passage thumb senator john sherman shepherded bill through congress sherman introduced bill on april 28 1870 and it was referred to senate finance committee of which he was chairman he did not seek its passage in that session of congress as lawmakers were busy with other financial legislation bill attracted next to no newspaper attention throughout period of almost three years it was under consideration though monetary experts and others watched its progress closely on january 9 1871 sherman brought bill to senate floor for debate that it abolished silver dollar and thus bimetallism was not discussed as senators focused on omission of coinage charge fee for mint s services in converting bullion to money this was of importance to senate especially members from far west because it affected what mining companies and refiners an important economic interest could get for their product sherman offered an amendment to retain coinage charge but it was attacked by western senators as an unjust tax on miners and refiners of gold and amendment was defeated 26 23 on january 10 bill passed senate 36 14 with sherman voting against his own bill it was then sent to house of representatives and referred to committee on coinage weights and measures from which it was briefly brought forth on february 25 by pennsylvania s william d kelley chairman before being recommitted to committee bill was not considered by house during remainder of 41st congress which expired on march 3 1871 and senate passed bill died with it kelley reintroduced bill in house when congress reconvened in december 1871 chairman kelley was from philadelphia and was influenced by industrialist joseph wharton who owned a nickel refinery in nearby camden new jersey from which mint purchased without competitive bidding much of metal for three cent and five cent base metal coins bill at that time proposed that cent then made of bronze be made of nickel alloy as well when it was debated on january 9 1872 wharton s interest was an immediate target kelley was quizzed by new york representative clarkson potter who called bill this pennsylvania contrivance which would give a monopoly to gentleman in pennsylvania wharton another new yorker dwight townsend moved to scuttle bill in disgust over how long it was taking to pass his motion on voice vote would have succeeded but there was no quorum and it failed on a roll call vote on january 10 missouri congressman james r mccormick who represented nickel producers in his home state introduced an amendment for competitive bidding for nickel purchases by mint rather than accede to mccormick s amendment kelley sent bill back to committee when bill was brought back to house floor on april 9 1872 it was managed by massachusetts representative samuel hooper chairman of house committee on banking and currency he went through bill section by section and stated bill would place united states on gold standard in ensuing debate other representatives including potter and kelley showed their understanding of that bill now provided for competitive nickel bidding but was again withdrawn this time by hooper after kelley accused potter of trying to benefit new york bullion merchants this fracas caused other new yorkers to oppose bill on may 27 hooper presented a substitute bill which he got passed 110 13 without it even being read among changes that house made to knox s bill were a slight increase in weight of subsidiary silver coins dime quarter dollar and half dollar making a dollar in them weigh bill then awaited congress reconvening in december early in that month secretary boutwell issued his annual report calling for passage of legislation on 16th bill was referred to sherman s committee it emerged without plan to make cent from copper nickel and with lightweight silver dollar replaced with a trade dollar intended for commerce in far east having limited legal tender status in u s bill was reported back to senate on january 7 1873 it was debated there on 17th one topic of discussion was bill s requirement that an eagle appear on larger u s coins linderman had requested an amendment to require that gold and silver coins bear a statement of their weight and fineness which would mean sacrificing eagle california s eugene casserly opposed amendment which was sponsored by sherman stating it will hardly be possible to think of a half dollar or a quarter dollar as being such a coin without eagle upon it eagle was saved when amendment failed 24 in favor and 26 against casserly was less successful with an amendment to remove entirely reduced coinage charge of 2 percent which failed sherman moved bill along as quickly as he could and it passed without a recorded vote house initially refused to agree to trade dollar representatives of both houses led by sherman and potter met in a conference committee and house acceded to senate amendment for trade dollar bill passed both houses without further debate and was signed by president ulysses s grant on february 12 1873 at no point in its almost three year journey through legislative process did bill provide for retention of standard silver dollar into which depositors could have their bullion coined intent of bill s authors thumb left 450px standard silver dollar was abolished by coinage act of 1873 when several years after its passage 1873 law became a political issue some of those involved in enacting it including sherman and linderman stated that there had been no intent to end bimetallism in elimination of authority for private citizens to have silver bullion coined into dollars they argued that 1853 legislation had ended practice of having bullion struck into smaller denomination coins 1873 act simply rectified an omission and eliminated a coin with a low mintage that did not circulate they were not always consistent in their denials boutwell wrote in his memoirs that in 1873 i had come to believe that it was wise for every nation to recognize establish and maintain gold standard hence it was that i determined to abandon idea of a double i e bimetallic standard within a few years idea that omission of silver dollar from coinage act had not been with intent to place united states on gold standard became establishment position part of this was in reaction against conspiracy theories that were circulating about crime of 73 as advocates of bimetallism called act this was accepted by many historians well into 20th century neil carothers in his 1930 history of small denomination u s currency wrote that many others have demonstrated that this was not a corrupt or surreptitious action by enemies of silver elimination of standard silver dollar was simply in interests of clarifying coinage law not one party to passage of law of 1873 recognized significance of abolition of legally existing double standard according to historian allen weinstein silver s demonetization according to traditional account came as an unplanned if fortunate by product of a complex and largely technical revision of mint laws in coinage act of 1873 economist milton friedman wrote what is not open to question is that standard silver dollar was omitted from list of coins to be minted intentionally in full knowledge of likely consequences and in belief that those consequences were desirable he cited walter t k nugent s 1968 book money and american society 1865 1880 knox and linderman were both personally familiar with mining conditions in far west they knew that amount of bullion produced was only going to increase and would likely drop price of silver below level 1 per troy ounce at which metal in a silver dollar was worth more as bullion than as money in his explanatory statement accompanying his draft bill knox explained discontinuance of silver dollar would mean united states was no longer a bimetallic nation boutwell in his 1872 annual report urged congress to end coinage of silver from private deposits lest government take a loss from paying out gold in exchange for silver dollars and ultimately having to melt them when they could not be circulated according to nugent were knox linderman boutwell sherman and others aware of what they were doing when they planned to drop silver dollar it is inconceivable that they were not knox s statement was explicit but did they urge it because they feared a drop in silver prices no one made an explicit statement to that effect but it was undoubtedly case provisions bureau of mint duties of officers 12 thumb right text of coinage act of 1873 director of mint had always been located at philadelphia mint with other mints and assay offices governed by superintendents of whom director was in charge 1873 act moved office to washington where director supervised new bureau of mint and remained in charge of all mints and assay offices mint director required appointment by president and confirmation by senate and served a term of five years unless removed by president henceforth philadelphia mint would be under immediate control of a superintendent like other mints act also formally made bureau part of department of treasury mint of united states had originally reported directly to president but over time legislation had made it subject to control by treasury secretary little change was made to officers of mints other than adding a superintendent for philadelphia pollock would be first incumbent and abolishing office of treasurer at each facility in addition to superintendent each mint had as officers assayer melter and refiner and coiner each was required to post a bond to indemnify government against losses during their tenure of office and each was responsible for part of coining process philadelphia also had an engraver sometimes chief engraver responsible for preparing coinage dies and designs though director of mint could with agreement of treasury secretary hire outside artists to design coins provision allowing for hiring of outside artists was inserted at suggestion of former director patterson act set salaries and bonding requirements for officers and required them to be appointed by president and confirmed by senate as was case under both 1792 and 1837 acts it also set forth procedures for appointment of an acting officer or director of mint in case of incumbent s temporary absence coins and deposit of bullion 39 sections 14 to 16 of act set forth coins authorized to be struck by mint bureau this is part of act that would later prove contentious as it omitted standard silver dollar since 1853 only coin into which depositors of silver bullion could have their metal struck it did allow for a trade dollar of higher weight than old coin that depositors could have their silver made into but legal tender of this and all silver coins was limited to 5 old silver dollar had an unlimited legal tender all gold coins had unlimited legal tender and act made provision for redemption of gold coin abraded below normal weight at full value if twenty years or more old and if still containing 99 5 percent or more of authorized weight lightweight gold coin that did not meet these qualifications would have loss in value fall upon depositor also eliminated by 1873 act were two cent piece three cent silver and half dime although first two coins circulated little half dime was still being heavily struck by san francisco mint for use in far west where paper money was disfavored coins authorized by 1873 act were cent three cent nickel five cent nickel dime quarter half dollar trade dollar gold dollar quarter eagle three dollar piece half eagle eagle and double eagle act prescribed specifications of each coin no change was made to bronze composition of cent dime quarter and half dollar were made slightly heavier so that a dollar in these coins would weigh in a nod to metric system five cent nickel already weighed it required that obverse of each american coin be emblematic of liberty and that an eagle must appear on reverse except for small diameter cent three cent nickel five cent nickel dime gold dollar and three dollar piece on which an eagle could not appear it required use of country s name on reverse and of e pluribus unum somewhere on coin it allowed motto in god we trust to appear on american coinage continuing permission granted in act of march 3 1865 which had authorized three cent nickel 1873 law allowed for redemption of current or obsolete base metal coinage by treasury when presented in lots of 20 or more continuing a provision enacted in 1871 further provisions in this part of act allowed depositors of silver bullion to receive their metal back in form of bars or in trade dollars it forbade deposit of silver for striking into other coins but allowed mint for two years to purchase silver bullion with silver coins at philadelphia and at new york assay office this practice although illegal under 1853 act had long been permitted by mint directors testing and assay commission 50 thumb 450px medal by chief engraver william barber struck for 1873 assay commission casket on reverse honors philadelphia mint assayer jacob eckfeldt who had recently died annual assay commission met at philadelphia mint in most years from 1797 to 1980 when it was abolished consisting of government officials and members of public it tested gold and silver coins issued by mint to ensure they met standards 1837 act had designated judge of united states district court for eastern district of pennsylvania united states attorney for that district and collector of port of philadelphia as members ex officio of assay commission coinage act of 1873 kept judge as a member but omitted other two substituting comptroller of currency and assayer of new york assay office under 1837 act president was allowed to appoint members of public each year and this continued under new legislation 1873 law also prescribed a detailed procedure for taking samples from each delivery by that mint s coiner sealing them in envelopes and transmitting them to philadelphia where assay commission met each february this part of coinage act also provided as to how coiner should settle accounts for internal testing of coins outside auspices of assay commission and continued bullion fund allowing depositors of gold or silver to receive coins or other payment without having to wait for actual metal they had deposited to go through coining process mints were required to have a set of weights conforming to official weight weighing one troy pound purchased by u s minister in london in 1827 and to have ones at philadelphia tested in presence of assay commission each year criminal offenses and miscellaneous provisions 67 sections 51 to 53 regulated matters that had proved controversial in past decades section 51 required all obverse dies containing date on most denominations to be destroyed at conclusion of each year under director snowden in 1850s mint had rare early dated coins to sell or exchange with collectors medals of a national nature could be struck at philadelphia under section 52 but private medals were forbidden until 1854 year in which he was fired by president franklin pierce peale had conducted a controversial medals business on premises of philadelphia mint section 53 required bureau s profits from seigniorage to be deposited in treasury and forbade mint from paying expenses or salaries from that money under director patterson retired 1851 mint had retained such earnings and spent them without congressional oversight assay offices were regulated by sections 54 through 60 under control of director of mint each office would be governed in a manner similar to mints with a superintendent in charge and two subordinate officers an assayer and a melter and refiner sections 61 to 64 forbade counterfeiting intentional lightening of coins to secure metal and other offenses and prescribed punishments for them section 65 is a transition provision setting an april 1 1873 effective date as well as providing that current director of mint pollock would become superintendent at philadelphia and occupants of office of treasurer at each mint abolished by legislation would become assistant treasurers of united states section 66 names each mint and assay office and section 67 names legislation as coinage act of one thousand eight hundred and seventy three aftermath later reaction abolition of half dime still circulating in far west led to shortages of small change there congress tried to address this with unpopular twenty cent piece which was struck for circulation only in 1875 and 1876 and was rejected by public for its similarity to quarter dollar western united states was not fully supplied with small change until mint began striking cents there in 1908 and five cent nickels in 1912 trade dollar struck principally to compete with mexican dollars in far east trade failed to gain full acceptance in orient many were returned to or never left united states as they could be purchased at a discount they were popular among employers who placed them in workers pay packets in 1876 congress revoked even limited legal tender status they enjoyed in 1878 mint stopped striking them except for collectors and even that limited issue ceased after 1885 in 1887 congress allowed a six month window during which they could be redeemed for other currency provided they had not been by asian merchants thumb left 450px trade dollar intended for use in far east became controversial when circulated in u s as friedman noted if price of silver had remained high exclusion of silver dollar from 1873 act would have been irrelevant by 1874 effect of new mines in far west and sale of silver in germany following its demonetization there combined to force price of silver down silver producers had not been aware of statutory change and only learned of it when they sought to present silver at mints for coining according to numismatic historian don taxay an agitation followed during which several pious congressmen feigned ignorance of repeal maintaining it had been worked into mint bill surreptitiously one delaware manufacturer wrote to his senator thomas f bayard in 1878 at beginning i was totally ignorant of all that related to silver question so much in fact that i find now like almost everyone else not excluding congressmen i did not know silver had been demonetized a severe depression panic of 1873 began in same year as passage of act and persisted for much of decade many in united states came to believe gold standard too rigid to deal with economic hard times like those and sought to restore bimetallism inflation caused by such a policy would enable debtors to repay what they owed more easily price of silver continued to fall silver in a dollar in new metric weight subsidiary silver coins was worth only 75 by mid 1876 though price recovered some after that in early 1875 congress passed a bill for resumption of specie payments that is in gold and silver coin effective in 1879 friedman stated that had it not been for 1873 act resumption would have been on effective basis of a silver standard which he viewed as a good thing allowing for more economic stability and almost surely would have avoided downturn of early 1890s known as panic of 1893 thumb right gold standard triumphant a caricature from puck magazine 1900 support for bimetallism grew in 1870s and resulted in passage of bland allison act of february 28 1878 over veto of president rutherford b hayes this legislation required treasury to purchase millions of dollars worth of silver bullion each month and coin it into silver dollars denomination was restored as a legal tender except when gold was specified by law or private contract renewed support for silver led to passage of sherman silver purchase act of 1890 greatly increasing silver purchases and requiring treasury to pay for them in banknotes that could be redeemed for gold over next three years 132 000 000 in gold was withdrawn from treasury and amid another depression president grover cleveland secured repeal of silver purchase act free silver movement reached its height with 1896 campaign of former nebraska representative william jennings bryan who won democratic nomination for president after his cross of gold speech which decried gold standard electrified 1896 democratic national convention bryan was defeated in election by former ohio governor william mckinley and in 1900 congress passed gold standard act placing that standard into law gold standard was departed from for many purposes by president franklin delano roosevelt s new deal administration and completely ended by president richard nixon in 1971 crime of 73 thumb right 450px arrows by date of this half dollar show that it is one made after coinage act increased its weight to 12 5 grams atlanta constitution on april 1 1873 reported passage of coinage act it noted abolition of two cent piece and authorization of trade dollar but did not mention ending of standard silver dollar there was no widespread objection to 1873 act until 1876 several factors combined to bring forth protest then tight money policies by treasury in preparation for resumption of specie payments a more precipitous drop in price of silver than had hitherto been case and widespread use of trade dollars after their rejection in chinese market at same time comstock lode and other western mining areas were producing record amounts of silver with a depression still ongoing silver began to be seen as a means of inflating currency and stimulating economy beginning in march 1876 former newspaper editor george weston published letters asserting that bimetallism was mandated by constitution and questioning how coinage act had passed sympathetic newspapers began to suggest that legislation had been enacted through corruption for benefit of wealthy capitalists on august 5 1876 missouri congressman richard p bland soon to be known as silver dick told house of representatives act of february 12 1873 was a fraud because its title gave no clue to real intent of act record shows that act was stealthily passed without reconsideration and without debate in 1878 congressman kelley who had introduced bill into house stated i was ignorant of fact it would silver dollar often blamed by those who deemed act a crime was british financial writer ernest seyd who had given advice as to text of bill as attested by congressman hooper on house floor in 1872 seyd according to this theory was agent of a group of british holders of american bonds who had sent seyd to america with ps100 000 then about 550 000 to bribe congressmen into silver kelley denied this had taken place but story stuck and became a common belief in silver movement in 1890 seyd s corrupt involvement was asserted on floor of house of representatives by arkansas s thomas c mcrae seyd was in fact an ardent who strongly objected to american demonetization of silver he had submitted at hooper s request an analysis of bill in course of which he advocated retaining silver dollar as a legal tender earliest use of phrase crime of 1873 in congressional debate was by colorado senator henry m teller who on july 10 1890 stated fight for free coinage of silver is on and it will stay on too till will of people shall be heard in enactment of a law that shall put silver back where it belongs and where it would have been but for blunder or crime of 1873 act had long been referred to as a crime without exact phrase being used in one 1889
