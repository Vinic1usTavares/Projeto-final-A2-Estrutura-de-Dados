agustawestland aw101 is a medium lift helicopter used in both military and civil applications first flown in 1987 it was developed by a joint venture between westland helicopters in united kingdom and agusta in italy in response to national requirements for a modern naval utility helicopter several operators including armed forces of britain denmark norway and portugal use name merlin for their aw101 aircraft it is manufactured at factories in yeovil england and italy licensed assembly work has also taken place in japan and united states prior to 2007 aircraft had been marketed under designation eh101 original designation was in fact ehi 01 from name given to anglo italian joint venture european helicopter industries but a transcription error changed this to eh101 and designation stuck in 2000 westland helicopters and agusta merged to form agustawestland leading to type s current designation aw101 entered into service in 1999 and has since replaced several older helicopter types such as sikorsky sea king performing roles such as medium sized transport anti submarine warfare and ship based utility operations royal canadian air force rcaf operates a variant of aw101 designated ch 149 cormorant in air sea rescue role another variant designated vh 71 kestrel was being developed to serve in us presidential transport fleet before program was cancelled civil operators also use aw101s in roles such as passenger and vip transportation type has been deployed to active combat theatres such as in support of coalition forces during iraq war and war in afghanistan development origins in 1977 uk ministry of defence issued a requirement for an anti submarine warfare asw helicopter to replace royal navy s westland sea kings which were becoming inadequate in face of advances in soviet submarine technology westland helicopters put together a proposal designated wg 34 for a three engined helicopter of similar dimensions to sea king wg 34 was to feature more autonomy and a greater range than its predecessor at same time italian navy marina militare was also considering replacement of its fleet of sea kings which had been built by italian company agusta westland and agusta soon began talks regarding joint development of a successor helicopter agusta and westland finalised an agreement to work on project together and formed a jointly owned new company eh industries limited ehi to pursue development and marketing of new helicopter to potential operators on 12 june 1981 uk government confirmed its participation in project allocated an initial budget of ps20 million to develop nine pre series examples aeronautica difesa no 14 dec 1987 p 34 a major agreement which secured funding for majority of eh101 s development program was signed by both british and italian governments in 1984 at 1985 paris air show agusta showed a mock up of a utility version of new helicopter leading to a more generalised design that could be customised to meet needs of various civilian or military customers first prototype flew on 9 october 1987 in 1987 canada selected eh101 to replace their sea kings in anti submarine warfare and search and rescue roles
