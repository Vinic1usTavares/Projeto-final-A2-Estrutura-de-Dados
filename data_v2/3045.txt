included diner in his list of 11 best new restaurants in portland writing billing itself as a finer diner this old school space feels a bit like diner in twin peaks there s a magazine and candy counter in one corner that no one seems to touch just quick enough service that once you start questioning whether or not you ll get another cup of coffee one arrives plus a menu full of classics all in all it s one of only places you can go in downtown and feel like you re transported somewhere else entirely portland mercury andrea wrote dime store is its own thing a great place to grab lemony eggs benedict and a water avenue coffee on a sunday without a massive line sure there s vintage milk bottles as water pitchers hound dog blasting from speakers and a big old 1950s vibe going on but you re not going to feel like some in a retro themed chain here there s no life changing or avant garde cooking happening at dime store you won t see coffee mayo and duck bologna like vitaly paley s crew puts out at penny diner you won t find greasy hash browns available at actual old school diners but that s kind of point dime store is a sweet slice of nostalgia with just right nod to current dining realities in 2015 oregonian included diner s dime burger as one of five burger classics in its list of city s 100 best cheap eats newspaper later included dime store in its list of top 10
