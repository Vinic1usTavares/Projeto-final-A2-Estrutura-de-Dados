toast at wedding breakfast archduchess zita soon conceived a son and otto was born 20 november 1912 seven more children would follow in next decade wife of heir to austrian throne at this time archduke charles was in his twenties and did not expect to become emperor for some time especially while franz ferdinand remained in good health this changed on 28 june 1914 when heir and his wife sophie were assassinated in sarajevo by bosnian serb nationalists charles and zita received news by telegram that day she said of her husband though it was a beautiful day i saw his face go white in sun in war that followed charles was promoted to general in austrian army taking command of 20th corps for an offensive in tyrol war was personally difficult for zita as several of her brothers fought on opposing sides in conflict prince felix and prince rene had joined austrian army while prince sixtus and prince xavier lived in france before war and enlisted in belgian army also her country of birth italy joined war against austria in 1915 and so rumours of italian zita began to be muttered even as late as 1917 german ambassador in vienna count otto wedel would write to berlin saying empress is descended from an italian princely house people do not entirely trust italian and her brood of relatives at franz joseph s request zita and her children left their residence at and moved into a suite of rooms at schonbrunn palace here zita spent many hours with old emperor on both formal and informal occasions where franz joseph confided in her his fears for future emperor franz

zita and crown prince otto photograph on occasion of their coronation budapest 1916 charles and zita were crowned in budapest on 30 december 1916 following coronation there was a banquet but after that festivities ended as emperor and empress thought it wrong to have prolonged celebrations during a time of war at beginning of reign charles was more often than not away from vienna so he had a telephone line installed from baden where charles s military headquarters were located to hofburg he called zita several times a day whenever they were separated zita had some influence on her husband and would discreetly attend audiences with prime minister or military briefings and she had a special interest in social policy however military matters were sole domain of charles energetic and strong willed zita accompanied her husband to provinces and to front as well as occupying herself with charitable works and hospital visits to war wounded sixtus affair by spring of 1917 war was dragging on towards its fourth year and zita s brother sixtus of bourbon parma a serving officer in belgian army was a main mover behind a plan for austria hungary to make a separate peace with france charles initiated contact with sixtus through contacts in neutral switzerland and zita wrote a letter inviting him to vienna zita s mother maria antonia delivered letter in person sixtus arrived with conditions for talks which had been agreed with french restoration to france of alsace lorraine annexed by germany after franco prussian war in 1870 restoration of independence of belgium independence for kingdom of serbia and handover of constantinople to russia charles agreed in principle to first three points and wrote a letter to sixtus dated 25 march 1917 which sent secret and unofficial message to president of france that i will use all means and all my personal influence this attempt at dynastic diplomacy eventually foundered germany refused to negotiate over alsace lorraine and seeing a russian collapse on horizon was loath to give up war sixtus continued his efforts even meeting lloyd george in london about italy s territorial demands on austria in treaty of london of 1915 but prime minister could not persuade his generals that britain should make peace with austria zita managed a personal achievement during this time by stopping german plans to send airplanes to bomb home of king and queen of belgium on their name days in april 1918 after german russian treaty of brest litovsk austrian foreign minister count ottokar czernin made a speech attacking incoming french prime minister georges clemenceau as being main obstacle to a peace favouring central powers clemenceau was incensed and after seeing emperor charles s letter of 24 march 1917 had it published for a while life of sixtus appeared to be in danger and there were even fears that germany might occupy austria czernin persuaded charles to send a word of honour to austria s allies saying that sixtus had not been authorised to show letter to french government that belgium had not been mentioned and that clemenceau had lied about mentioning of alsace czernin had actually been in contact with german embassy throughout whole crisis and attempted to persuade emperor to step down because of affair after failing to do so czernin resigned as foreign minister end of empire by this time war was closing in on embattled emperor a union of czech deputies had already sworn an oath to a new czechoslovak state independent of habsburg empire on 13 april 1918 prestige of german army had taken a severe blow at battle of amiens and on 25 september 1918 her brother in law king ferdinand i of bulgaria broke away from his allies in central powers and sued for peace independently zita was with charles when he received telegram of bulgaria s collapse she remembered it made it even more urgent to start peace talks with western powers while there was still something to talk about on 16 october emperor issued a people s manifesto proposing empire be restructured on federal lines with each nationality gaining its own state instead each nation broke away and empire effectively dissolved leaving behind their children at charles and zita travelled to schonbrunn palace by this time ministers had been appointed by new state of german austria and by 11 november together with emperor s spokesmen they prepared a manifesto for charles to sign zita at first glance mistook it for an abdication and made her famous statement charles gave his permission for document to be published and he his family and remnants of his court departed for royal shooting lodge at eckartsau close to borders with hungary and slovakia republic of german austria was proclaimed next day exile thumb 260px charles and zita with their children in exile at switzerland 1921 after a difficult few months at eckartsau imperial family received aid from an unexpected source prince sixtus had met king george v and appealed to him to help habsburgs george was reportedly moved by request it being only months since his imperial relatives in russia had been executed by revolutionaries and promised we will immediately do what is necessary several british army officers were sent to help charles most notably lieutenant colonel edward lisle strutt who was a grandson of lord belper and a former student at university of innsbruck on 19 march 1919 orders were received from war office to get emperor out of austria without delay with some difficulty strutt managed to arrange a train to switzerland enabling emperor to leave country with dignity without having to abdicate charles zita their children and their household left eckartsau on 24 march escorted by a detachment of british soldiers from honourable artillery company under command of strutt hungary and exile in madeira thumb 260px children in 1920s family s first home in exile was wartegg castle in rorschach switzerland a property owned by bourbon however swiss authorities worried about implication of habsburgs living near austrian border compelled them to move to western part of country next month therefore found them moving to villa prangins near lake geneva where they resumed a quiet family life this abruptly ended in march 1920 when after a period of instability in hungary miklos horthy was elected regent charles was still technically king as charles iv but horthy sent an emissary to prangins advising him not to go to hungary until situation had calmed after trianon treaty horthy s ambition soon grew charles became concerned and requested help of colonel strutt to get him into hungary charles twice attempted to regain control once in march 1921 and again in october 1921 both attempts failed despite zita s staunch support she insisted on travelling with him on final dramatic train journey to budapest charles and zita temporarily resided at castle tata home of count esterhazy until a suitable permanent exile could be found malta was mooted as a possibility but was declined by lord curzon and french territory was ruled out given possibility of zita s brothers intriguing on charles s behalf eventually portuguese island of madeira was chosen on 31 october 1921 former imperial couple were taken by rail from to baja where royal navy monitor hms glowworm was waiting they finally arrived at funchal on 19 november their children were being looked after at wartegg castle in switzerland by charles s step grandmother maria theresa although zita managed to see them in zurich when her son robert needed an operation for

eight months pregnant helped nurse them all charles weakened and died on 1 april his last words to his wife being i love you so much after his funeral a witness said of zita this woman really is to be

family sought to move to belgian village of near brussels where they were closer to several members of their family zita continued her political lobbying on behalf of habsburg family even sounding out links with mussolini s italy there was even a possibility of a habsburg restoration under austrian chancellors engelbert and kurt schuschnigg with crown prince otto visiting austria numerous times
