feature guitarist audley freed lions was recorded in new york city in january and february of that year and was produced by don was bass guitar duties were shared by rich robinson and was as greg rzab had left band and was not replaced until tour that followed release of album album debuted on billboard 200 at its peak position of 20 selling more than 53 000 copies in its first week lions received mixed reviews although overall sound of album generally garnered praise a frequent complaint was lack of memorable songs critics who rated lions lowest considered it a poor imitation of band s influences such as led zeppelin band supported lions with two north american tours one with oasis co headlining and a short tour of europe and japan in between soundboard recordings of several concerts were available for download to those who owned album following tour band went on hiatus until 2005 background black crowes began writing songs for follow up to their 1999 album by your side as free agents having left columbia records through a loophole in their contract decision to leave was driven by columbia s promotion of by your side according to band member rich robinson that record was destined to fail because columbia executives just said it s not going to do well it s no use wasting time or money band also was frustrated by label s request for albums sounding similar to their first 1990 s shake your money maker in late 1999 lead vocalist chris robinson began a relationship with kate hudson which would influence subtly lyrics on lions pair met at a friday night party in manhattan which led to a saturday stroll through central park and a sunday move in their wedding at aspen colorado ranch of kurt russell and kate s mother goldie hawn followed on 2000 before 2000 tour with jimmy page bassist sven pipien was fired after arriving late for a performance and missing return flight rich said it was not enough to warrant termination but pipien s defensiveness when confronted about incident was too much to handle greg rzab and andy hess were considered as replacements band chose rzab because he had more touring experience than hess rzab however departed before recording of lions in mid 2000 band signed with richard branson s v2 records rich explained cool thing about v2 reason that we chose them is that they told us you guys go make record you want to make then give it to us and we ll sell it that s what we needed to hear freedom v2 afforded through its hands off approach influenced not only music but album title as well according to chris lions is a symbol that stands for fierce feeling and freedom that music allows you writing and production chris robinson granted that experience of playing led zeppelin songs with jimmy page influenced lions but not on a song by song basis led zeppelin s music is very dramatic and very dynamic that s something we ve attempted to do with our style also i think it definitely affected how we make our music funk and r b were bigger influences than on past albums and miracle to me was influenced by nick drake chris claimed kate hudson s influence on his lyrics was subtle more so than a literal reference to her it s vantage point from where i m writing it s reasons that i m singing and it s feeling that is an influence far greater than literal influence he did grant however that soul singing and miracle to me were written with hudson in mind and explained that album s track order roughly follows a path from confusion to clarity that mirrored his own producer don was said of chris i realized he was taking on something that was significant he was writing about becoming a man there s a lot of old man young man symbolism that s a self conversation i don t know that anyone has actually chronicled being 33 years old as well as this album heated discussions during writing of lions were rare owing to robinson brothers usual method in which rich writes music and chris writes lyrics soul singing was only song to cause disagreement i d written this part where although vocals changed music stayed same throughout i thought we should add something or just not finish it but chris thought it was already a song and a good one so we talked about that one for a while rich recalled black crowes had previously sent was demos to interest him in producing by your side but was believed demos were good enough to be album columbia records disagreed with was assessment however leading to kevin shirley s hiring with complete artistic control under v2 records band was free to hire was for lions recording took place in january and at montana rehearsal studios and theater 99 recording in new york city recording sessions progressed as smoothly as writing only come on caused conflict between band and was rich acknowledged we must have recorded come on about five times in different ways then was just took it away with him and came back with this different mix which impressed band leading to its inclusion on album band ultimately was satisfied by recording experience finding that was was devoted to helping realize their vision for album rather than imposing his own sessions were recorded on tape and pro tools simultaneously band ultimately chose to use tape version as they preferred its sound quality most songs were recorded live with band members playing together in one room and microphones set up to capture overall sound rather than that of individual instruments was felt this approach best approximated feel of a black crowes concert later noting that lions songs debuted at a private show in sounded exactly like record most of recordings that comprise album were recorded during preproduction purpose of which was to test arrangements w e didn t think we were recording record and it turned out to be great said rich audley freed played guitar on only three tracks because rich did not want meat of song which is riff to get lost in a wall of sound though rich brought his entire collection of guitars and a number of amplifiers he mostly recorded with a 1954 fender esquire through a harry joyce amp to achieve a resonator like tone on soul singing he used a james metal bodied electric since andy hess did not join black crowes until above private show band did not have a bassist during recording sessions rich thus played bass on most tracks on lay it all on me however rich played piano leaving bass guitar duties to don was a total of twenty songs were recorded during lions sessions of seven cut from album four were mixed and mastered for potential release three last time again love is now and appeared as b sides and other pretty gurl song circulates on a bootleg recording promotion and release soon after lions sessions v2 records threw a completion party at bank in new york city at which black crowes performed four songs from new album five songs from their catalog and a cover of fleetwood mac s oh well band then played scattered dates in u s

which are available as streaming media on band s official website critical reception media reviews of lions were mixed numerous writers detected a led zeppelin influence which was praised by some but panned by others and attributed it to black crowes recent tour with jimmy page dave mckenna writing for washington post compared steve gorman s drumming to that of john bonham and found analogs to specific guitar and keyboard tones in led zeppelin albums nigel williamson of times found similarities in chris robinson s voice on come on to that of robert plant and wrote that song could almost be a led zeppelin ii cast off other reviewers noted similarities to aerosmith howard cohen of miami herald called lickin best aerosmith single that band hasn t recorded in years perceived lack of originality though turned off some critics herald suns andrew inferred black crowes are unaware it s no longer 70s and after one listen to lions it s clear someone should tell them everett true of playlouder concurred writing it s blindingly obvious crowes are imitators and always will be though elysa gardner writing for usa today recognized band exhibit an energy and dexterity that compensate at least somewhat for their lack of invention many reviewers praised sound of lions but felt songs were weak writing for dotmusic john mulvey highlighted gutsy no messing sound but appreciated cosmic friend for being as impressively mad as you d hope too beginning like beatles psychedelia taking in massive brazilian drumming and a touch of pedal steel before coalescing into furious heavy rock stephen thomas erlewine of allmusic described lions as a powerful textured hard rock record that covers a lot of ground surging from powerful riffs to gospel choruses and funkier than expected riffs though he also complained that songs can seem incomplete critics disagreed on which songs were lacking though losing my mind and young man old man were called highlights by jane stevenson of toronto sun though elsewhere former was called woeful and latter a freddie s dead vamp that should have been skipped lyrics of lions were another target for critics mark beaumont of nme stated that eloquence ends at come awn come awn everyone chorus of come on and stephen thompson of a v club bemoaned that hoary tropes abound concert tours shortly after release of lions black crowes and oasis with opening band spacehog embarked on a co headlining tour of north american theaters and amphitheaters black crowes had previously met liam and noel gallagher and hit it off so we called them and asked them if they were interested in touring together and so they were like yeah we d love to said rich black crowes performed last each night and their seventy five minute set always included numerous songs from lions members of oasis typically would join them for an encore cover such as lucifer sam can t you hear me knocking or road runner black crowes followed tour with one off dates and festivals across
