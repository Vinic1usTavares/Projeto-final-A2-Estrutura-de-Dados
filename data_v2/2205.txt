twelfth siege of gibraltar was fought between september 1704 and may 1705 during war of spanish succession it followed capture in august 1704 of fortified town of gibraltar at southern tip of spain by an anglo dutch naval force led by sir george rooke and prince george of hesse darmstadt members of grand alliance holy roman empire england netherlands pro habsburg spain portugal and savoy had allied to prevent unification of french and spanish thrones by supporting claim of habsburg pretender archduke charles vi of austria as charles iii of spain they were opposed by rival claimant bourbon philip duke of anjou ruling as philip v of spain and his patron and ally louis xiv of france war began in northern europe and was largely contained there until 1703 when portugal joined confederate powers from then english naval attentions were focused on mounting a campaign in mediterranean to distract french navy and disrupt french and bourbon spanish shipping or capture a port for use as a naval base capture of gibraltar was outcome of that initial stage of mediterranean campaign at start of siege gibraltar was garrisoned by around 2 000 dutch english austrian and pro habsburg spanish troops facing a besieging force of up to 8 000 french pro bourbon spanish and irish troops defenders were able to hold off numerically superior besieging force through exploiting gibraltar s geography and small town s fortifications though they were frequently short of manpower and ammunition besiegers were undermined by disputes between french and spanish officers and terrible conditions in their trenches and bastions which led to outbreaks of epidemic disease and undermined morale sea power proved crucial as french navy sought unsuccessfully to prevent grand alliance shipping in fresh troops ammunition and food three naval battles were fought during siege two of which were clear defeats for french and last of which resulted in siege being abandoned as hopeless after nine months of fruitless shelling outcome was disastrous for french and bourbon spanish side which was said to have lost 10 000 men against only 400 for grand alliance background loss of gibraltar in august 1704 posed a strategic threat to rule of bourbon claimant to spanish throne philip v of spain it was not only as a later spanish writer put it first town in spain to be dismembered from domination of king philip and forced to recognise charles hills p 178 but it also potentially had great value as an entry point for grand alliance armies its possibilities were recognised immediately by alliance forces leader prince george of hesse darmstadt who told charles in a letter of september 1704 that gibraltar was a door through which to enter spain an army landed at gibraltar could advance rapidly along coast to cadiz supported by naval forces and capture major port from there it was a relatively short distance to seville where habsburg claimant charles could be proclaimed king following which alliance could march to madrid and finish war gibraltar itself had been largely emptied of its population most of whom left town after its capture and had moved to temporary accommodation elsewhere in campo de gibraltar only a few dozen spaniards and a small community of neutral genoese remained jackson p 101 town was garrisoned by a motley assortment of alliance forces consisting of around 2 000 british and dutch marines 60 gunners and several hundred spanish mostly catalans followers of charles of austria hills p 183 4 they were supported by sir george rooke s anglo dutch fleet consisting of 51 ships of line operating in strait of gibraltar alliance had two significant disadvantages limited supplies and a pressing need for their ships which had already been at sea for six months to be repaired and reprovisioned as soon as gibraltar was captured alliance set about preparing for a bourbon counter attack alliance fleet sailed a short distance across strait to in morocco where it took on fresh water on 22 august a french fleet was sighted in strait but began to withdraw after being spotted rooke caught up with french off malaga on 24 august and attacked in a bid to prevent french from slipping past him and attacking gibraltar two fleets were evenly matched but french ships were faster and had more ammunition than confederates jackson pp 101 2 they did not manage to make this advantage count however and battle of velez malaga was effectively fought to a draw no ships were sunk but both fleets took very heavy casualties with around 3 000 killed or wounded on each side including french commander anglo dutch fleet was hampered by a shortage of shot and gunpowder much of which had already been used in bombarding gibraltar during operation to capture it and sir george byng s squadron was forced to pull back when it ran out of ammunition alexander p 55 rest of fleet was dangerously low on ammunition but fortunately for confederates french withdrew following day leaving anglo dutch fleet to limp back to gibraltar hills p 180 having dealt with french naval threat rooke left as many men guns and supplies at gibraltar as he could before sailing for home he split off part of his fleet leaving admiral sir john leake with 18 ships to patrol strait and portuguese coast spanish had already mobilised their forces and at start of september marquis of villadarias captain general of andalusia arrived in vicinity of gibraltar with an army of 4 000 men villadarias planned to increase his force to 12 000 consisting of 9 000 spaniards and 3 000 frenchmen two crowns force was also supplemented by many of civilian refugees from gibraltar jackson p 103 siege hesse set about improving gibraltar s defences to make it as difficult as possible for enemy to mount a frontal attack town is set on western side of a rocky peninsula connected to spanish mainland by a narrow sandy isthmus north side of rock of gibraltar presents a vertical cliff only access to town was via a narrow strip only about wide which was blocked by heavily fortified curtain wall known as muralla de san bernardo later grand battery jackson p 105 prince sought to reduce this strip even further by flooding it forcing any attackers to use a narrow path between rock and inundated area or to advance along narrow shoreline he set up cannon in five batteries along north side of gibraltar on old mole to provide flanking fire from west on baluarte de san pablo later north bastion and on landport curtain walls to provide direct fire onto isthmus on baluarte de san pedro later hesse s demi bastion to provide flanking fire from east and in a round tower on a clifftop spur overlooking isthmus later site of forbes batteries from where fire could be directed onto enemy troops on far side of inundated area a bomb ship was also installed off old mole carrying a heavy mortar to provide additional flanking fire from west jackson p 106 center thumb 600px northern approach to gibraltar as seen in 1567 view would have been substantially same in 1704 although hesse was confident that he would be able to hold gibraltar against numerically superior franco spanish force he was undermined by political disputes between habsburg and english commanders there was widespread resentment among english marines that they had not been allowed to return with rooke s fleet there was a particularly poisonous relationship between english colonel of marines edward fox and irish colonel henry nugent whom hesse had appointed as governor of gibraltar two men had fought on opposite sides during irish campaign of william iii protestant fox had gone on to serve queen anne while catholic nugent had joined service of charles of austria hills p 182 hesse wrote that fox was furious at being under my orders and at not being allowed to leave for england his respect for governor i have appointed is even less there is confusion everywhere orders are not carried out and officers are first to make trouble hills p 181 right thumb prince george of hesse darmstadt who commanded garrison of gibraltar during siege besieging french and spanish forces were reinforced on 4 october when 19 french warships great and small of line of battle hills p 186 escorted troop ships carrying 3 000 men with heavy guns and supplies of ammunition to a landing point near ruined roman town of at head of bay of gibraltar this brought number of soldiers under villadarias s command to some 7 000 which hesse estimated consisted of eight spanish and six french battalions of foot plus nine cavalry squadrons most of french ships left on 24 october to surprise of defenders though six remained behind to blockade gibraltar after reinforcements had settled in spanish began digging siege lines and trenches towards confederate positions first attack came on 26 october when spanish guns opened fire on confederate defences around round tower causing considerable damage a french force carried out a simultaneous raid of gibraltar s harbour burning bomb ship villadarias then carried out a heavy bombardment of san pablo bastion using 27 guns and 16 mortars which managed to breach it hills p 187 among casualties were two feuding colonels fox and nugent who were killed on successive days jackson p 107 at same time an epidemic disease broke out among gibraltar garrison reducing their effective numbers to about 1 300 men position of garrison looked increasingly precarious hesse sent a message to admiral leake at lisbon requesting his urgent assistance after appearance of french ships in bay after receiving message on 21 october leake set sail at once bringing more supplies for defenders in meantime hesse had to deal with an internal threat a plot by some habsburg spanish officers aided by some clergymen and british officers to betray garrison he wrote to charles in mid october to inform archduke of what had happened charles wrote back advising hesse to carry out a court martial with independent judges to avoid any suspicion of prejudice as accused were habsburg subjects a court martial consisting of british and dutch officers who did not owe allegiance to charles was convened to adjudicate case british officers who were implicated in plot appear to have been sent back to england their fate is not recorded gonzalez was convicted and on 23 february 1705 being guilty of high treason he was shot in face of whole garrison assault on east side left thumb sheer east side of rock of gibraltar which was scaled by a bourbon spanish force on 11 november 1704 to carry out an unsuccessful surprise attack bourbon spanish meanwhile were planning to carry out a surprise attack simon susarte a spanish who had fled gibraltar after its capture by rooke a few months earlier told villadarias that there was a secret route by which east side of rock of gibraltar could be scaled it required a climb of around of which upper section was near vertical but was passable with use of rope and ladders via great sand dune as east side was considered virtually impregnable only west side was fortified if rock could be climbed from east an attacker could evade fortifications and descend directly into town route was reconnoitred and found to be passable by a lightly armed force villadarias decided to send a force of 2 000 men nearly a third of his entire army divided into two groups an initial force of 500 to seize heights at night followed by a further 1 500 following daybreak first 500 set off at dusk on 11 november led by a colonel figueroa and guided by simon susarte they made it to top of rock reaching its southernmost peak near where o hara s battery stands today and descended part way down west side where they sheltered overnight in st michael s cave at daybreak they climbed philip ii wall which extends up west side of rock and killed english sentries in lookout point at middle hill a drummer boy bringing food to lookout saw invaders and raised alarm hills p 187 8 right thumb route over rock of gibraltar by unsuccessful bourbon surprise attack hesse had anticipated some kind of attack from rear and had kept a mobile force in reserve to guard against such an eventuality it was formed by an english company and two spanish companies a regular company under captain francisco de sandoval and a catalan company of miquelets under jaume burguy numbering 300 men all of them led by hesse s brother heinrich de la penya i parell feliu anales de vol iii barcelona juan pablo marti 1709 pp 526 527 this reserve immediately responded and engaged spanish bourbons at middle hill although bourbons had advantage of height they were effectively trapped against precipice of rock and only had three rounds of ammunition each as a result of travelling light they had not come prepared for a pitched battle spanish habsburg force led by captain burguy made up of miquelets and regulars marched ahead and dislodged spanish bourbon grenadiers from top of hill at same time sandoval with his remaining regulars and miquelets charged upon bulk of assaulting force from one flank while heinrich von hesse attacked from other side around a hundred of bourbon force including their colonel were captured hundreds more were killed either by defending fire or by falling off rock while attempting to flee only a few including simon susarte made it back to bourbon lines english subsequently ensured that there would be no repeat of this episode by blasting away path used by spanish other 1 500 members of spanish force did not even set off to support attack because after first 500 had left admiral leake s squadron was sighted entering bay with 20 ships in subsequent naval engagement six french frigates were destroyed and a seventh ship was captured intact villadarias had apparently intended to carry out a multi pronged attack but leake s timely arrival meant that it fell apart french naval support for an assault on moles evaporated and a frontal assault via isthmus reinforced with 1 500 men originally earmarked for climb on eastern side failed entirely hesse s relief at leake s timely arrival was evident in letter that he sent admiral after battle thanking him for turning up just as enemy were attacking us that very night of your entrance in many places at once with a great number of men hills p 188 9 leake had not brought many supplies to gibraltar but provided what he could and loaned hesse fleet s skilled manpower of which confederate garrison was desperately short a labour force of some 500 men was assembled from ships companies and was put to work repairing fortifications remounting guns dislodged by spanish fire and hauling cannon up rock to increase fire being directed onto spanish batteries hills p 190 one of those involved captain willis played such a prominent role that track he used was renamed and is still known as willis road and he also gave his name to willis battery now princess royal s battery magazine and guard jackson p 108 siege settled down into a routine of bombardment and counter bombardment this proved increasingly trying for defenders who were running short of manpower ammunition and supplies captain joseph bennett an engineer whom leake had brought with him helped to bolster fortifications but earned wrath of some in garrison who felt that gibraltar should be abandoned he wrote to a friend on 6 december to tell him that many officers had a design to quit place and blow up works but i always opposed them and mentioned garrison could be kept with number of 900 men we had and no more as i believe you will have an account of some was for cuting sic my throat and others for cuting sic off my ears c kenyon p 121 many members of garrison tried to sneak aboard leake s ships to escape siege situation was precarious and was only worsened when a storm damaged many of leake s ships on 4 5 december by this time garrison was critically short of medicines and supplies many were sick or injured and too few remained to carry out repairs to shell damaged fortifications only 1 300 were healthy enough to man defences their living conditions were increasingly grim their shoes had worn out and many men wore makeshift sandals made from hay and straw sayer pp 139 140 reinforcements right thumb marshal de tesse who made an unsuccessful attempt to rescue siege at start of 1705 a few days later leake received news that a convoy of 20 transport ships carrying supplies and reinforcements was on its way from lisbon escorted by four men of war adverse winds and currents meant that he was unable to sail to assist it against a french naval force that had left cadiz and he was forced to wait to see if convoy would reach its destination on 18 december nine of transports reached bay accompanied by two men of war with another seven arriving on 20 december four were missing having been intercepted by french three of them had been sunk or captured while last one eventually made it to gibraltar at end of december they brought with them 2 200 men from grenadier guards donegal s foot and barrymore s foot plus some dutch troops guns and supplies of powder tools and food further reinforcements arrived between 16 18 january with gibraltar safe for moment leake left for lisbon on 3 january with sick and wounded members of garrison aboard his ships jackson p 109 bourbon spanish and french land force continued to bombard gibraltar inflicting further damage on town s somewhat weak fortifications but were unable to make any progress against reinforced garrison they were being vigorously opposed with counter bombardments which killed many of their number and by sallies two of which were carried out successfully by confederates on 23 and 31 december relations steadily worsened between spanish and french components of besieging force a trend that was exacerbated by lack of progress they were making appalling conditions they were enduring in open and steady stream of casualties being caused by counter bombardment and outbreaks of epidemic disease weather too was terrible with storms and heavy rain making life a misery by new year of 1705 besieging force was disintegrating and had dropped in numbers from around 7 000 men to only 4 000 remainder having either become casualties or simply deserting jackson p 110 situation was sufficiently alarming that king louis xiv of france despatched marshal rene de de tesse along with 4 500 french and irish reinforcements to recover situation villadarias however was determined to make one more effort to take gibraltar before tesse arrived on 7 february he sent 1 500 french spanish and irish troops to seize round tower an outlying fortification on cliff face above present laguna estate attackers captured tower but a confederate counter attack drove them out leaving 200 of them dead spanish accused french of fleeing battlefield and leaving their flank unprotected jackson p 111 left thumb baron de pointis fleet defeated in bay of gibraltar 20 march 1705 tesse arrived in mid february but was appalled to find how badly siege was being run his criticism of spanish officers led some to quit siege in face of what they saw as his insults their morale improved somewhat when admiral bernard baron de pointis sailed into bay on 26 february with a force of 18 men of war from cadiz gibraltar s garrison immediately went on alert expecting a landing at south end of peninsula but this did not materialise reason soon became clear leake had returned with a combined english dutch and portuguese force of 35 ships in subsequent battle in strait of gibraltar french lost five of their ships including pointis flagship and pointis himself was fatally wounded leake s fleet sailed into bay on 31 march bringing with it fresh troops from mountjoy s grenadiers and units of portuguese army hesse rejoiced at admiral s arrival leake s arrival was final stroke as french abandoned siege as hopeless following an order from louis xiv on 12 april alexander p 64 tesse wrote bitterly to king to blame spanish telling him that we have failed before gibraltar for want of method and planning ill fate of your vessels was due to lack of competence at madrid with french having gone home villadarias resumed command and began to convert siege into a blockade by pulling back from isthmus and removing his cannon on 2 may an alliance scouting party found that spanish trenches had been abandoned later that day hesse accompanied a demolition party to destroy bourbon spanish works but some members of party ventured out too far and were captured or killed by spanish cavalry following day a larger party protected by grenadiers resumed work of demolishing spanish batteries without further opposition
