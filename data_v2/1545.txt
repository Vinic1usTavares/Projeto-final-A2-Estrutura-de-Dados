sms gneisenau was an armored cruiser of german kaiserliche marine imperial navy part of two ship named for earlier screw corvette of same name ship was laid down in june 1904 at ag weser shipyard in bremen launched in june 1906 and commissioned in march 1908 she was armed with a main battery of eight guns a significant increase in firepower over earlier german armored cruisers and she had a top speed of gneisenau initially served with german fleet in i scouting group though her service there was limited owing to development of battlecruiser which less powerful armored cruisers could not effectively combat accordingly gneisenau was assigned to german east asia squadron where she joined her sister ship two cruisers formed core of squadron which included several light cruisers over next four years gneisenau patrolled germany s colonial possessions in asia and pacific ocean she also toured foreign ports to show flag and monitored events in china during xinhai revolution in 1911 following outbreak of world war i in july 1914 east asia squadron crossed pacific to western coast of south america stopping for gneisenau and scharnhorst to attack french polynesia in bombardment of papeete in september after arriving off coast of chile east asia squadron encountered and defeated a british squadron at battle of coronel during action gneisenau disabled british armored cruiser which was then sunk by german cruiser defeat prompted british admiralty to detach two battlecruisers to hunt down and destroy spee s squadron which they accomplished at battle of falkland islands on 8 december 1914 gneisenau was sunk with heavy loss of life though 187 of her crew were rescued by british design thumb left line drawing of scharnhorst class two scharnhorst class cruisers were ordered as part of naval construction program laid out in second naval law of 1900 which called for a force of fourteen armored cruisers ships marked a significant increase in combat power over predecessors of being more heavily armed and armored these improvements were made to allow for and gneisenau to fight in line of battle should need arise a capability requested by general department gneisenau was long overall and had a beam of a draft of ship displaced normally and at full load gneisenaus crew consisted of 38 officers and 726 enlisted men ship was powered by three triple expansion steam engines with steam provided by eighteen coal fired water tube boilers her propulsion system was rated to produce for a top speed of she had a cruising radius of at a speed of gneisenaus primary armament consisted of eight sk l 40 guns four in twin gun turrets one fore and one aft of main superstructure on centerline and remaining four mounted in single casemates secondary armament included six sk l 40 guns also in individual casemates defense against torpedo boats was provided by a battery of eighteen sk l 35 guns mounted in casemates she was also equipped with four submerged torpedo

an armored deck that was thick with heavier armor protecting ship s engine and boiler rooms and ammunition magazines centerline gun turrets had thick sides while wing turrets received 15 cm of armor protection casemate secondary battery was protected by a strake of armor that was thick service history thumb left gneisenau 1909 gneisenau was first member of class to be ordered on 8 june 1904 she was laid down at ag weser shipyard in bremen on 28 december under yard number 144 a lengthy strike by shipyard workers delayed construction of vessel allowing scharnhorst to be launched first and thus be lead ship of class gneisenau was launched on 14 june 1906 and at launching ceremony she was christened gneisenau in honor of earlier steam corvette by general alfred von schlieffen chief of general staff ship then moved to wilhelmshaven for fitting out after which she was commissioned into fleet on 6 march 1908 sea trials followed from 26 march to mid july after which ship joined i scouting group reconnaissance squadron of high seas fleet on 12 july during this period kapitan zur see kzs captain at sea franz von hipper served as ship s first commanding officer while serving in i scouting group gneisenau participated in normal peacetime training routine with fleet she took part in a major fleet cruise in atlantic ocean immediately after completing trials in company with battleship squadrons of high seas fleet prince heinrich had pressed for such a cruise previous year arguing that it would prepare fleet for overseas operations and would break up monotony of training in german waters though tensions with britain over developing anglo german naval arms race were high fleet departed kiel on 17 july passed through kaiser wilhelm canal to north sea and continued to atlantic fleet returned to germany on 13 august autumn maneuvers followed from 27 august to 12 september after which hipper was replaced by kzs konrad year 1909 followed a similar pattern with two more atlantic cruises first in february and march and second in july and august latter voyage included a visit to spain later in year gneisenau and light cruiser escorted kaiser wilhelm ii aboard his yacht hohenzollern on a visit to tsar nicholas ii of russia off coast of finland gneisenau won kaiser s schiesspreis shooting prize for excellent shooting among armored cruisers for 1908 1909 training year following year passed uneventfully for gneisenau with only event of note being a fleet cruise to norway in july on 8 september ship was reassigned to east asia squadron and kzs ludolf von uslar took command of ship for deployment by that time british royal navy had begun commissioning their new battlecruisers which significantly outclassed older armored cruisers like gneisenau but german command decided that ship could still be used to strengthen germany s colonial cruiser squadron east asia squadron thumb illustration of gneisenau with a torpedo boat alongside on 10 november gneisenau departed wilhelmshaven bound for germany s kiautschou bay concession in china she stopped in malaga spain while en route for a ceremony commemorating men killed when her namesake corvette had been wrecked there on 16 december 1900 she then passed through mediterranean sea transited suez canal and while crossing indian ocean stopped in colombo ceylon there she embarked crown prince wilhelm on 11 december who was on a tour of british india at time gneisenau carried him to bombay where he left ship after resuming voyage to east asia gneisenau rendezvoused with light cruiser and made stops in singapore hong kong amoy before arriving in tsingtao german squadron s home port on 14 march 1911 there she rendezvoused with her sister scharnhorst squadron flagship on 7 april gneisenau carried new ambassador to japan arthur graf rex from taku to yokohama where she met scharnhorst krosigk uslar and scharnhorsts captain met with emperor meiji gneisenau thereafter went on a tour of japanese and siberian waters but she was sent back to tsingtao during agadir crisis to prepare for a potential conflict in september squadron commander konteradmiral kadm rear admiral gunther von krosigk shifted his flag to gneisenau while scharnhorst was in dry dock for periodic maintenance on 10 october xinhai revolution against qing dynasty broke out which caused a great deal of tension among europeans in country who recalled attacks on foreigners during boxer rebellion of 1900 1901 rest of east asia squadron was placed on alert to protect german interests and additional troops were sent to protect german consulate but feared attacks on europeans did not materialize and so east asia squadron was not needed by late november scharnhorst was back in service and krosigk returned to ship gneisenau won schiesspreis again for 1910 1911 training year gneisenau went into dry dock in tsingtao for her annual repair in first quarter of 1912 on 13 april ships embarked on a month long cruise to japanese waters returning to tsingtao on 13 may in june kzs willi relieved uslar as gneisenaus commander over course of 1 4 august gneisenau steamed to pusan korea to pull hapag steamship free after it ran aground she then escorted steamer to nagasaki at end of year gneisenau lay at shanghai in early december krosigk was replaced by kadm maximilian von spee who took scharnhorst and gneisenau on a tour of southwest pacific including stops in amoy singapore and batavia cruise continued into early 1913 and two cruisers arrived back in tsingtao on 2 march 1913 ship won schiesspreis for 1912 1913 year in april 1913 gneisenau and scharnhorst went to japan so spee and ships commanders could meet with new emperor taisho vessels then returned to tsingtao where they remained for seven weeks in late june two cruisers began a cruise through germany s colonial possessions in central pacific while in rabaul on 21 july spee received word of further unrest in china which prompted his return to wusong roadstead outside shanghai by 30 july gneisenau thereafter patrolled in yellow sea and visited port arthur in october after situation calmed spee was able to take his ships on a short cruise to japan which began on 11 november scharnhorst and rest of squadron returned to shanghai on 29 november before she departed for another trip to southwest asia stops included siam sumatra north borneo and manila in philippines in june 1914 kzs maerker took command of ship shortly thereafter spee embarked on a cruise to german new guinea gneisenau rendezvoused with scharnhorst in nagasaki japan where

west coast of united states where leipzig had just replaced her and emden was still in tsingtao on 6 august 1914 scharnhorst gneisenau supply ship titania and japanese collier fukoku maru were still in ponape spee had issued orders to recall light cruisers which had been dispersed on cruises around pacific nurnberg joined spee that day after which spee moved his ships to pagan island in northern mariana islands a german possession in central pacific all available colliers supply ships and passenger liners were ordered to meet east asia squadron in pagan and emden joined squadron there on 12 august auxiliary cruiser joined spee s ships there as well four cruisers accompanied by prinz eitel friedrich and several colliers then departed central pacific bound for chile on 13 august commodore karl von muller captain of emden persuaded spee to detach his ship as a commerce raider on 14 august east asia squadron departed pagan for enewetak atoll in marshall islands ships again coaled after their arrival on 20 august to keep german high command informed on 8 september spee detached nurnberg to honolulu to send word through neutral countries nurnberg returned with news of allied capture of german samoa which had taken place on 29 august scharnhorst and gneisenau sailed to apia to investigate situation spee had hoped to catch a british or australian warship by surprise but upon his arrival on 14 september he found no warships in harbor on 22 september scharnhorst and rest of east asia squadron arrived at french colony of papeete germans attacked colony and in ensuing battle of papeete they sank french gunboat zelee ships came under fire from french shore batteries but were undamaged fear of mines in harbor prevented spee from seizing coal in harbor by 12 october gneisenau and rest of squadron had reached easter island there they were joined by light cruisers and leipzig which had sailed from american waters on 12 and 14 october respectively leipzig also brought three more colliers with her after a week in area ships departed for chile on evening of 26 october gneisenau and rest of squadron steamed out of mas a fuera chile and headed eastward arriving in valparaiso on 30 october on 1 november spee learned from prinz eitel friedrich that british light cruiser had been anchored in coronel previous day so he turned towards port to try to catch her alone battle of coronel thumb ship movements during battle of coronel british ships are shown in red german ships are shown in blue alt british and german fleets converged from south and north respectively two british ships split off to escape british had scant resources to oppose german squadron off coast of south america rear admiral christopher cradock commanded armored cruisers and glasgow and converted armed merchant cruiser flotilla was reinforced by elderly pre dreadnought battleship and armored cruiser latter however did not arrive until after battle of coronel canopus was left behind by cradock who probably felt her slow speed would prevent him from bringing german ships to battle east asia squadron arrived off coronel on afternoon of 1 november to spee s surprise he encountered good hope monmouth and otranto in addition to glasgow canopus was still some behind with british colliers at 16 17 glasgow spotted german ships cradock formed a line of battle with good hope in lead followed by monmouth glasgow and otranto in rear spee decided to hold off engaging until sun had set more at which point british ships would be silhouetted by sun while his own ships would be obscured against coast behind them spee turned his ships on a course nearly parallel to cradock s ships slowly closing range cradock realized uselessness of otranto in line of battle and detached her heavy seas made working casemate guns in both sides armored cruisers difficult by 18 07 distance between two squadrons had fallen to and at 18 37 spee ordered his ships to open fire by which time range had dropped to each ship engaged their opposite in british line gneisenaus target being monmouth gneisenau struck monmouth with her third salvo one shell hitting her forward turret blowing roof off and starting a fire gneisenau fired primarily armor piercing shells and scored numerous hits knocking out many of monmouths guns by 18 50 monmouth had been badly damaged by gneisenau and she fell out of line gneisenau therefore joined scharnhorst in battling good hope at around that time gneisenau received a hit that struck her rear turret but did not penetrate armor instead exploding outside and setting fire to life jackets stored there though crew quickly suppressed blaze at same time nurnberg closed to point blank range of monmouth and poured shells into her at 19 23 good hopes guns fell silent following two large explosions german gunners ceased fire shortly thereafter good hope disappeared into darkness spee ordered his light cruisers to close with his battered opponents and finish them off with torpedoes while he took scharnhorst and gneisenau further south to get out of way glasgow was forced to abandon monmouth after 19 20 when german light cruisers approached before fleeing south and meeting with canopus a squall prevented germans from discovering monmouth but she eventually capsized and sank at 20 18 more than 1 600 men were killed in sinking of two armored cruisers including cradock german losses were negligible gneisenau had been hit four times but was not significantly damaged and suffered only two crewmen lightly injured however german ships had expended over 40 percent of their ammunition supply voyage to falklands thumb german squadron leaving valparaiso on 3 november after battle scharnhorst and gneisenau in lead and nurnberg following in middle distance are chilean cruisers esmeralda o higgins and blanco and old battleship capitan prat alt a group of large warships steaming slowly off a city after battle spee took his ships north to valparaiso since chile was neutral only three ships could enter port at a time spee took scharnhorst gneisenau and nurnberg in first on morning of 3 november leaving dresden and leipzig with colliers at mas a fuera there spee s ships could take on coal while he conferred with admiralty staff in germany to determine strength of remaining british forces in region ships remained in port for only 24 hours in accordance with neutrality restrictions and arrived at mas a fuera on 6 november where they took on more coal from captured british and french steamers on 10 november dresden and leipzig were detached for a stop in valparaiso and five days later spee took rest of squadron south to st quentin bay in gulf of penas on 18 november dresden and leipzig met spee while en route and squadron reached st quentin bay three days later there they took on more coal since voyage around cape horn would be a long one and it was unclear when they would have another opportunity to coal once word of defeat reached london royal navy set to organizing a force to hunt down and destroy east asia squadron to this end powerful battlecruisers and were detached from grand fleet and placed under command of vice admiral doveton sturdee two ships left devonport on 10 november and while en route to falkland islands they were joined by armored cruisers and light cruisers and glasgow and otranto force of eight ships reached falklands by 7 december where they immediately coaled in meantime spee s ships departed st quentin bay on 26 november and rounded cape horn on 2 december they captured canadian barque drummuir which had a cargo of of good quality cardiff coal leipzig took ship under tow and following day ships stopped off picton island crews transferred coal from drummuir to squadron s colliers on morning of 6 december spee held a conference with ship commanders aboard scharnhorst to determine their next course of action germans had received numerous fragmentary and contradictory reports of british reinforcements in region spee and two other captains favored an attack on falklands while three other commanders including maerker argued that it would be better to bypass islands and attack british shipping off argentina spee s opinion carried day and squadron departed for falklands at 12 00 battle of falkland islands thumb map showing movements of both squadrons alt german ships approached islands from south before turning back to south to try to escape but each ship was chased down and sunk save one gneisenau and nurnberg were delegated for attack they approached falklands following morning with intention of destroying wireless transmitter there observers aboard gneisenau spotted smoke rising from port stanley but assumed it was british burning their coal stocks to prevent germans from seizing them as they closed on harbor shells from canopus which had been beached as a guard ship began to fall around german ships lookouts on german ships spotted large tripod masts of battlecruisers though these were initially believed to be from battlecruiser reports of several enemy warships combined with fire from canopus prompted spee to break off attack germans took a southeasterly course at after having reformed by 10 45 spee formed his line with gneisenau and nurnberg ahead scharnhorst in center and dresden and leipzig astern fast battlecruisers quickly got up steam and sailed out of harbor to pursue east asia squadron spee realized his armored cruisers could not escape much faster battlecruisers and ordered three light cruisers to attempt to break away while he turned about and allowed british battlecruisers to engage outgunned scharnhorst and gneisenau meanwhile sturdee detached his cruisers to pursue german light cruisers invincible opened fire at scharnhorst while inflexible attacked gneisenau and spee ordered his two armored cruisers to similarly engage their opposites spee had taken lee position wind kept his ships swept of smoke which improved visibility for his gunners this forced sturdee into windward position and its corresponding worse visibility gneisenau quickly scored two hits on her opponent in response to these hits sturdee attempted to widen distance by turning two points to north both sides checked their fire for time being gneisenau had been hit twice during this stage of battle first shell striking aft funnel killing and wounding several men with shell splinters second shell damaged some of ship s cutters and penetrated into some cabins amidships shell fragments from a near miss penetrated into one of magazines for 8 8 cm guns forcing it to be flooded to prevent a fire spee counteracted this maneuver by turning rapidly to south which significantly widened range and temporarily raised possibility of escaping by nightfall maneuver forced sturdee to turn south as well and pursue at high speed given speed advantage and clear weather german hope to escape proved to be short lived nevertheless maneuver allowed spee to turn back north bringing scharnhorst and gneisenau close enough to engage with their secondary 15 cm guns their shooting was so effective that it forced british to haul away a second time after resuming battle british gunfire became more accurate and as british were firing at very long range shells approached plunging fire which allowed them to penetrate thin deck armor rather than thicker belt gneisenau took several hits during this phase including a pair of underwater hits that began to flood boiler rooms 1 and 3 thumb left scharnhorst rolls over and sinks while gneisenau continues to fight sturdee then turned to port in an attempt to take leeward position but spee countered turn to retain his favorable position maneuvering did however reverse order of ships so gneisenau now engaged invincible during reversal gneisenau became temporarily obscured by smoke so british ships concentrated their fire on scharnhorst which suffered severe damage during this phase of action spee and maerker exchanged a series of signals to determine state of each others vessels spee concluded exchange with a signal noting that maerker was correct to have opposed attack on falklands at 15 30 gneisenau received a major hit that penetrated to her starboard engine room and disabled that engine leaving her with just two operational screws another hit at 15 45 knocked over her forward funnel and at 16 00 her number 4 boiler room was disabled at 16 00 spee ordered gneisenau to attempt to escape while he reversed course and attempted to launch torpedoes at his pursuers damage to ship s engine and boiler rooms had reduced her speed to however and so ship continued to fight on gneisenau nevertheless could not evade british fire and at around same time her bridge was hit two more hits followed at 16 15 one of which passed completely through ship without detonating and other exploding in main dressing station killing most of wounded crew there at 16 17 scharnhorst finally capsized to port and sank british their attention now focused on gneisenau made no attempt to rescue crew by this time carnarvon joined fray and contributed her guns to bombardment as range fell to heavy fire from surviving german guns forced british to turn away again widening range to thumb hms inflexible picking up german sailors from gneisenau after battle during final phase of battle gneisenau ran out of ammunition and resorted to firing inert training rounds one of these struck invincible three more shells struck gneisenau at around 17 15 two of them underwater on starboard side and other on a starboard casemate former hits caused serious flooding but third had little effect as gun crew had already been killed by an earlier hit and casemate was already on fire several more hits followed and by 17 30 gneisenau was a burning wreck she had a severe list to starboard and smoke poured from ship which came to a stop at 17 35 maerker ordered crew to set scuttling charges and gather on deck as ship was unable to continue fighting forward gun turret fired a final shell despite maerker s instructions prompting a return shot from inflexible that struck forward dressing station killing many wounded men there at 17 42 scuttling charges detonated and forward torpedo crew launched a torpedo to clear tube and hasten flooding ship slowly rolled over and sank but not before allowing some 200 of survivors time to escape of these men many died quickly from exposure in water a total of 598 men of her crew were killed in engagement though boats from invincible picked up 187 men from gneisenau including her executive officer korvettenkapitan corvette captain hans highest ranking german officer to survive and source of german records of battle leipzig and nurnberg were also sunk only dresden managed to escape but she was eventually tracked to juan fernandez island and sunk complete destruction of squadron killed some 2 200 german sailors and officers
