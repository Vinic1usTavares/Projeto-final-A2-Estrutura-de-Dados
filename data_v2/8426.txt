calls giles paramedics arrive and work on joyce and she revives paramedics declare it a miracle in ambulance and joyce buffy and dawn rejoice in hospital revealed to be a fantasy of buffy s scene

her and finds her in morgue being attacked by vampire as buffy fights and kills vampire sheet falls from joyce s face looking at her mother s body dawn asks where she went as she reaches out to touch her cheek production and writing from start of writing buffy series joss whedon asserted that it would never have a very special episode as in contemporary series beverly hills 90210 wonder years or party of five where core cast of characters addresses a single issue aids drug abuse or alcoholism for example and resolve all problems at end wilcox pp 17 18 whedon was not interested in finding a life affirming lesson for body rather he wanted to capture isolation and boredom involved in minutes and hours after finding a loved one has died whedon joss 2008 buffy vampire slayer complete fifth season dvd commentary for episode body dvd 20th century fox what he termed black ashes in your mouth numbness of death he did not intend to resolve any religious or existential questions about end of life but wanted to examine process in which a person becomes a mere body stevenson p 162 whedon s mother a teacher also died of a cerebral aneurysm and he drew on his own experiences and those of friends and other writers in constructing episode he tried to achieve an unlovely physicality in body to portray upsetting minutiae involved in attempting to comprehend what is incomprehensible small details became significant to protect her dignity buffy pulls hem of joyce s skirt down after it rode up when she attempted cpr camera focuses on a breeze through wind chimes while buffy vomits to emphasize buffy s isolation scene has no exterior establishing shots of house opening sequence of body was also closing scene of previous episode i was made to love you this is only episode in series that was first aired without a previously on buffy lead in christmas dinner scene was used both to contrast stark reality of rest of episode and to avoid having credits appear over beginning scenes where buffy is trying to revive her mother episode is presented in four acts each beginning in total silence and with a close up shot of joyce s pale staring face shooting first act was difficult for gellar buffy whedon shot scene where she finds her mother as one long take showing her move through house and calling paramedics about seven times rest of scenes in act were shot in sequence at end giles arrives and also attempts to revive joyce but buffy blurts we re not supposed to move body both gellar and trachtenberg dawn were raised by single women and gellar later spoke about experience of acting something that was very real and close to her stating you try to separate it as best you can and at same time it adds that extra layer sullivan brian ford march 21 2008 live at paley festival buffy vampire slayer reunion futon critic retrieved on june 14 2010 as soon as scene was finished with gellar at a fever pitch they restarted it where she comes in door happily which whedon regretted for emotional range gellar was required to endure kristine sutherland joyce was informed during third season that her character would be killed off which she accepted because she intended to spend time in europe she is absent from most of fourth season because she was traveling buffy vampire slayer complete fifth season season overview featurette 2008 dvd 20th century fox she reported that atmosphere on set of body was strange and tense because she had been a regular character through series and she was suddenly playing a corpse she found part difficult to play not only for stillness but getting into make up and lying on morgue table with other bodies buffy vampire slayer complete fifth season natural causes featurette 2008 dvd 20th century fox most difficult scene for whedon to film was willow panicking in her dormitory room her obsession about what to wear to visit buffy was inspired by whedon s own experiences when he was at a loss for what tie to wear for a friend s funeral he praised alyson hannigan s acting saying that she was able to be consistently emotional in every take and make him and crew cry every time whedon acknowledged his difficulty speaking on dvd commentary while watching hannigan in scene whedon s rejection of very special episode format impelled him to address physicality of willow and tara s relationship within body before this episode they had held hands and danced on screen but they had not kissed a genre of television specials dealing with female homosexuality developed as lesbian kiss episode in 1990s where a female character kissed another female but no relationship is further explored whedon set out to acknowledge willow s and tara s affection without making it primary focus of show for attempting this he received resistance from airing network wb whedon informed them that kiss between willow and tara was not negotiable kaveney pp 78 79 according to whedon conversation about kiss was approached by network executives who were concerned with number of gay relationships on network whedon countered that kiss was true to character and said he would quit show if network forbade it it was only time during series he threatened to do so when willow and tara first met in fourth season writers did not intend relationship to be romantic but actors had such chemistry that two episodes later whedon and writing team took alyson hannigan and amber benson aside to inform them where it would go byrnes lyndsey june 8 2010 an interview with amber benson afterellen com retrieved on june 13 2010 for rest of season sexual relationship between willow and tara was represented metaphorically by witchcraft and none of wb executives realized it in end whedon praised way wb handled display of affection in body saying they raised an eyebrow but they ve been great i give wb props when it came to characters first kiss what i want to show is real affection and body turned out to be perfect place to put it in to network s credit they not only aired it but they did not advertise it i thought that was pretty classy whedon joss may 21 2001 interview hollywood reporter 368 19 p s8 stephen tropiano in prime time closet a history of gays and lesbians on tv writes that this approach was truly groundbreaking no long speech no huge discovery like willow we re made to feel as if her love for tara is most natural thing in world tropiano calls it a simple kiss a quiet simple moment two lovers kissing just like lovers do tropiano p 184 audiences reacted more emotionally than whedon expected to emma caulfield s performance anya s blunt innocence was similar to a plot twist as viewers did not expect depth of sensitivity that she portrayed in her monologue which whedon considers heart of experience and critic noel murray reiterates as whole point of episode in bolded capital letters xander s punching wall and hurting his hand served to give four in this scene something to concentrate on to redirect their helplessness which was another facet of physicality of dealing with crisis whedon used another long tracking shot from joyce s face in morgue following doctor down hall to speak with buffy and scoobies to cement reality of their being so close in proximity as opposed to cutting shots to give possibility that it was part of another set located somewhere else vampire that attacks dawn in morgue was a touch many viewers took to be out of place for episode this scene contrasts more fantasy related deaths common in series with joyce s realistic death stevenson p 206 furthermore similar to xander s parking ticket and sounds of life outside buffy s house in sunnydale vampires are a normal experience and it was intended to show that life for buffy continues stafford p 268 themes grief in nikki stafford s analysis reactions of buffy dawn xander willow anya and tara represent stages of elisabeth kubler ross five stages of grief in different parts joss whedon stated on dvd commentary how surprised he was at response from viewers who wrote to say that episode allowed them to accept death of a close family member even if they had not acknowledged it for months or years joyce s death was first by natural causes in series in psychology of joss whedon two academic psychologists identify source of buffy s strength as her mother paired with giles mentorship joyce did not know all along that buffy was a slayer and had difficulty accepting what her daughter was called to do she was nonetheless always attentive and available when buffy s confidence was shaken and both joyce s and giles devotion to her gave her self assurance to wield her power to its full potential davidson p 69 joyce served as a parent figure to all of buffy s friends whose home lives were often unstable or thus making her death more poignant to all of them willow mentions her parents several times throughout series but her father is never seen her mother is portrayed only once in gingerbread at first as an academic so preoccupied with her career that she is unable to communicate with willow and then with joyce under spell of a demon and in throes of moral panic attempting to burn her own daughter at stake for being involved in witchcraft stafford pp 198 199 xander s parents are described by him and those who have been to his house as alcoholic and verbally abusive even anya severely wanting in social graces has lost someone she admires and trusts giles also grieves for loss of a friend and in one episode when adults fall under a spell making them retreat into an adolescent state a lover kaveney p 6 lorna jowett in sex and slayer writes that joyce represents stability and normality for scoobies her death destroys illusion that normal life is trouble free it is just as challenging as encountering supernatural forces jowett pp 182 183 finding her mother s body buffy at first denies what she sees to point of imagining alternate realities whedon stated that these mini dream sequences were like documentaries people who find their loved ones dead are desperate to imagine a different better outcome and they create fantasies that cause much more pain when they are forced to return to harshness of reality later in hospital buffy imagines what she might have been able to do to save joyce although doctor tells her there was nothing to be done willow and xander express anger and helplessness anya new to mortality and human connections is childlike in her innocence and questions xander s anger and anya s confusion allow them to be mothered somewhat by willow who needs to take care of someone dawn is deeply in denial unable to understand that woman she thought she had known all her life was gone tara who has gone through ordeal before represents acceptance phase soothing and helping others to work through what they are experiencing buffy toward end also begins to see acceptance when she tells dawn that body in morgue is not their mother joyce is gone episode also emphasizes another theme of season buffy s response to forces that she cannot fight throughout season she encounters much more powerful goddess glory but joyce s death leaves her feeling most helpless in joyce s death there is no evil force to combat she simply dies and buffy with all her power is ill equipped to grasp enormity of her situation davidson p 74 in her shock buffy retreats to a childlike state of confusion calling to her mother when she does not answer mom mom mommy emma caulfield was also given direction for her voice to rise to a childlike pitch at end of her speech to give same effect according to buffy scholar rhonda wilcox themes of maturation and facing adult responsibilities begin with departure of buffy s boyfriend riley finn six episodes before and crystallize in preceding episode in which buffy realizes she does not need a boyfriend to be fulfilled at end of that episode she is confronted with joyce s death which is fully explored in body facing responsibilities became major theme of sixth season wilcox p 178 one critic writes drastic as it was killing off joyce was logical way to bring buffy and dawn closer together sever buffy s last ties to girlhood and emphasize buffy s inability to accept limits of her power a recurring theme this season reality whedon uses several disorienting effects to heighten reality of situations in episode to point that they seem surreal long opening shot of buffy coming home and finding joyce was filmed with one hand held camera in constant movement as she walks through house to phone and back to her mother again buttons on buffy s phone are abnormally large an effect that whedon added because he experienced it when his mother died buffy is so bewildered by paramedic telling her that joyce is dead that she can only focus on his mouth in an attempt to understand what he is saying camera uses her perspective and only bottom part of paramedic s face is in view instead of a normal over shoulder view buffy is shot at same height as paramedic s shoulder barely squeezed into frame as if to portray her according to whedon as trapped by reality wilcox p 182 kristine sutherland stated that script was amazing specifically at capturing detachment it s not something you can process i mean mortality is just not part of your vocabulary when you re that age in hospital as buffy listens to doctor confirm how joyce died doctor says something but words i have to lie to you to make you feel better are spoken as though according to cinema scholar katy stevens buffy constructs what she believes to be an truth her culpability in her mother s death in same scene dawn is shot with a hand held camera that drifts giving her a slightly unreal moment as she struggles to believe unlike what buffy already knows that her mother s body is down hall on a steel table scene with buffy and tara sitting in waiting room was noted by rhonda wilcox for its reality in showing gellar as ragged and distinctly unglamorous particularly because she had been presented in a specific way to attract male viewers and was a spokeswoman for maybelline while buffy aired buffy sits with circles under her eyes unflattering hair and slumped posture next to tara who had been criticized for being too heavy despite her body type being more typical of women her age thumb 275px left small details in sounds are made significant in this scene as buffy after being told that her mother is dead vomits on floor and stands at her back door where life in her neighborhood carries on alt a video from episode in beginning a woman drops to her knees and vomits before rising and slowly walking though a house to a door which she opens angle shifts and woman s clammy face is seen as she looks outside foremost of disorienting effects to critics and scholars is whedon s use of sound and silence while buffy performs cpr she cracks one of joyce s ribs with a startling snap after buffy vomits on floor she stands in back doorway listening to life carrying on children playing someone practicing a trumpet and birds singing long pauses between dialogue create gaps that turn awkward as characters try to think of what to say made especially notable in a series famous for its rapid banter attinello et al pp 103 104 transition between christmas dinner scene and living room scene is abrupt and sound of buffy and joyce shouting because they dropped a pie on floor carries over into silence of joyce s lifeless face and buffy standing alone in living room this effect is also used when shifting between buffy s alternate version of her mother being good as new in hospital and paramedics trying to revive her in car on way to willow s dormitory anya is shot by a camera mounted on front bumper separated from audience by windshield xander driving faces other way neither of them speak and only sound of car can be heard wilcox pp 180 181 joyce millman at salon com writes of sound issues effect was almost bergmanesque in its spooky stillness and long spacey pauses in conversation as characters struggled to articulate their feelings exaggerated sense of time elongating and standing still katy stevens notes that dialogue in body was recorded with microphones very close to actors making variations in their voices cracks rises and whispers more prominent to audience to close distance between actors and viewer conversely scene in which dawn is told of joyce s death was shot through a large classroom window muffling dawn s emotional reaction to isolate buffy and dawn from class and audience several moments of silence follow this scene attinello et al pp 87 88 192 whedon shot conversation up close several times filming over shoulder and reaction shots but eventually went with a more distanced point of view michelle trachtenberg later said of this effect obviously you know in end result there was no sound and i thought that was actually one of most brilliant ideas he s ever had because it allows everyone to sort of attach their own emotional plug into whatever might have happened in your life i think it allowed audience to really connect with dawn for first time presenting episode without music was whedon s way of denying audience any comfort forcing them to discern their own meanings from characters actions and words as two musicologists write about this absence without music s acoustic balm all our empathetic attention is on characters and their state of bewilderment music would provide a conceptualization and a catharsis but a catharsis at this point would in some measure trivialize loss attinello et al p 75 television critic gareth mclean writes that this decision is a move that makes it more courageous than for instance er there were no soaring strings or plaintive piano to trigger an emotional response instead soundtrack took in ambient noises of wind chimes doors squeaking footsteps on carpets conversations were stilted and awkward but spaces in between always mattered reception critics praised episode and have continued to count it as one of finest episodes of television ever broadcast david bianculli in new york daily news
