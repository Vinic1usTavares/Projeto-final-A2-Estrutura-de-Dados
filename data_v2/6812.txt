unfairly early life and education rieko kodama was born in yokosuka kanagawa japan in may 1963 she enjoyed playing arcade games as a child in high school kodama was interested in designing advertising materials after entering college she felt indecisive between pursuing studies in art or archaeology since she carried an interest in egyptology in her indecisiveness she failed out of all her classes she remembered her original interest in advertising and decided to dedicate herself fully to her art passion enrolling in an advertising design program at a trade school translation archived she soon grew an interest in graphic design and wanted to pursue doing her own work rather than trumpeting works of others as in advertising business video game industry caught her attention as an emerging field home game consoles were still new famicom was just released and most of industry was still in arcade field industry piqued kodama s curiosity as she rarely went to arcades and felt her unfamiliarity with medium would make it a good way to challenge herself career early work kodama was hired by sega in 1984 through one of her colleagues who was already employed there she originally thought she was going to be working on advertising and graphic design but after seeing game development department she felt that would be fun as well she soon learned how to create graphics from yoshiki kawasaki sprite artist behind 1984 translation archived her first job was as character designer for arcade game champion boxing 1984 she continued to work on other arcade games such as sega ninja 1984 because development times were short and sega was low on design staff kodama would sometimes work on five to six games at once she did art for alex kidd in miracle world 1986 for master system was deeply involved with arcade and master system versions of quartet 1986 and created art for master system port of fantasy zone ii tears of opa opa 1987 kodama would get small requests to design assets for other projects on a daily basis such as dragon from miracle warriors seal of dark lord 1987 and an enemy for sg 1000 port for black onyx 1987 kodama also served as editor for a japanese sega newsletter sega players enjoy club spec kodama credited herself as phoenix rie or some close variation in many of her early works this was because at time sega did not allow developers to place their real names in their games pseudonym is based on a manga character phantasy star with popularity of enix s dragon quest role playing game rpg series on famicom in mid 1980s sega formed a team of several people to develop a competing rpg for master system titled phantasy star 1987 kodama served as main artist for game designing characters 2d environments battle screen backgrounds non playable characters and other details star wars is one of kodama s favorite film series and was a significant inspiration for her when designing artwork for phantasy star she enjoyed way star wars took elements from japanese and asian culture and infused it with a science fiction setting following this notion she gave science fiction world of phantasy star a western folklore feel and gave characters medieval clothes one of key design philosophies for phantasy star was to do things differently from existing rpgs particularly dragon quest series which she believed was too simple and pure of a fantasy world one such challenge to differentiate phantasy star was to create a female hero female protagonist alis and another character lutz were designed by kodama other characters as well as game s monsters were designed by other people in original story drafts lutz was written as intersex and could become either male or female later in game she thought this was interesting so chose to give lutz an androgynous appearance in final game in this game and later phantasy star games kodama enjoyed creating a cast of characters uniting for a common purpose regardless of gender species or home planet phantasy star was a critical and commercial success and a benchmark title for both industry and rpg genre in later years kodama continued her work on phantasy star series she again led graphic design for phantasy star ii 1989 and later directed phantasy star iv end of millennium 1993 she helped during planning stages of phantasy star iii generations of doom 1990 she also supervised development of two phantasy star collection compilations as well as remakes of phantasy star and phantasy star ii for playstation 2 later work beyond working on phantasy star series during mega drive

sonic hedgehog 1991 and sonic 2 1992 after her success in directing phantasy star iv she directed magic knight rayearth 1995 an rpg for sega saturn based on manga series of same name she was involved in all aspects of game including sales and marketing kodama soon became a producer at sega s overworks division and led development of skies of arcadia a critically acclaimed rpg released for dreamcast in 2000 as her first 3d rpg kodama felt her freedom of expression had expanded project began because her team wanted to create a completely 3d rpg for sega saturn project was moved to dreamcast when content became too large for saturn to process according to kodama a defining element during development was to not rely on advanced graphics and particularly cgi movies that were popular in games at time which kodama felt took control away from player kodama has stated that skies of arcadia along with phantasy star series were her favorite projects she worked on in mid 2000s kodama served as producer on brain training edutainment games for nintendo ds and playstation portable most recently she has led production of 7th dragon series series includes 7th dragon for nintendo

one of first female video game developers next level called her one of first female video game artists and nintendo power dubbed her first lady of rpgs because of this recognition she is often asked for her opinion about role of women as video game developers and consumers and representation of women in video games kodama believes that women are gradually taking a greater interest in gaming she has observed that more girls are growing up around games and thus are more willing to purchase them or enter industry when older in particular she believes girls that enjoy rpgs will have a greater desire to work in industry she also thinks it s more common for japanese women to enter field than other women because young girls enjoy games there more than in other countries in 2010 she felt there were more female gamers in japan due to increase in games centered around cooking and fashion while kodama does not design her games strictly for a female audience she avoids including elements that treat women unfairly she claims that many games glorify violence and war which attracts male players overwhelmingly so companies should be mindful and include elements that appeal to both genders if they want a larger female player base over time she has found that there are more strong willed women in games for female audiences when making female characters herself she desires to make characters both genders can relate to however since majority of gamers are still male and nature of rpgs is to make player feel as if they are character she understands why many companies gravitate to male heroes kodama received pioneer award for 2018 game developers choice awards for her long career as a graphic artist director and producer on numerous sega titles ceremony was held at 2019 game developers conference in march 2019 although kodama no longer draws art assets directly for her games she does paint and make and accessories in her free time she is also a fan of dungeons dragons and
