uss salamaua cve 96 was a of united states navy she was named after invasion of salamaua a strategically important village in new guinea theater during world war ii and one of main targets of salamaua lae campaign she served with distinction during war notably being damaged in early 1945 by a kamikaze aircraft during invasion of lingayen gulf killing 15 crewmen and injuring 88 post war ship helped repatriate servicemen to united states as part of operation magic carpet before being decommissioned and struck in 1946 and ultimately being broken up in 1947 design and description thumb left a profile of design of which was shared with all casablanca class escort carriers salamaua was a casablanca class escort carrier designed specifically to be mass produced using prefabricated sections in order to replace heavy early war losses fifty of these escort carriers were built making them most numerous type of aircraft carrier ever built standardized with her sister ships she was long overall had a beam of and a draft of she displaced normally with a full load she had a long hangar deck a long flight deck she was powered with two uniflow reciprocating steam engines which provided driving two shafts enabling her to make ship had a cruising range of assuming that she traveled at a constant speed of her compact size necessitated installment of an aircraft catapult at her bow end and there were two aircraft elevators to facilitate movement of aircraft between flight and hangar deck one on fore another on aft one 38 caliber dual purpose gun was mounted on stern and she was equipped with sixteen bofors anti aircraft guns in twin mounts as well as twelve oerlikon cannons which were used in an anti aircraft capability by end of war casablanca class carriers had been modified to carry 30 20 mm cannons as a response to increasing casualties due to kamikaze attacks anti aircraft guns were mounted around perimeter of deck casablanca class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft but they sometimes went over or under this number for example during invasion of lingayen gulf salamaua carried 14 fm 2 fighters and 10 tbm 3 torpedo bombers for a total of 24 aircraft however during salamauas anti submarine sweeps in closing stages of war she carried 18 fm 2 fighters 2 fm 2p variant fighters and 12 tbm 3e variant torpedo bombers for a total of 32 aircraft while she was transporting aircraft in a non combat role she could accommodate up to 50 aircraft provided her flight deck was also used for storage construction escort carrier was laid down on 4 february 1944 under a maritime commission contract mc hull 1133 by kaiser shipbuilding company vancouver washington when she was ordered in 1942 she was expected to possess name anguilla bay as part of us navy s policy of naming escort carriers after bays and sounds on 6 november 1943 before she was laid down she was renamed to salamaua as part of a new policy which named escort carriers after sites of naval or land engagements she was launched on 22 april 1944 sponsored by mrs w j mullins transferred to united states navy and commissioned on 26 may 1944 captain joseph irwin taylor jr in command and with

she arrived on 4 september on 26 september she received her combat aircraft contingent vc 87 at naval base san diego on 30 september she left san diego with to conduct flight exercises returning on 7 october on 16 october she once again sailed west from san diego as part of task unit 19 15 1 under command of rear admiral calvin t durgin along with her fellow sister ships and she paused at pearl harbor on 23 october and arrived at ulithi on 5 november a tropical disturbance delayed departure until 10 november when she set off for leyte gulf pausing at kossol roads to replenish fuel she departed on 13 november and from 14 november to 23 november she furnished air screening for convoys in leyte gulf area without major incident on 23 november a mitsubishi g4m bomber managed to get through screen strafing carriers without much ill effect before being shot down she then proceeded to admiralty islands to prepare for invasion of luzon as part of carrier division 29 under command of rear admiral durgin en route destroyers and detected a potential submarine on 26 november and dropped depth charges she along with her task group arrived at seeadler harbor on 27 november she stayed at anchor until 16 december when she left to engage in training exercises at huon gulf on 21 december she returned to seeadler harbor to make final preparations for planned invasion of lingayen gulf lingayen gulf she departed seeadler harbor on afternoon of 27 december and moved north to a massive escort carrier formation at kossol roads on 30 december on 1 january 1945 task group left for luzon passing leyte on 3 january following day 4 january 1945 her task group was engaged by kamikazes on afternoon of 4 january 1945 she was transiting sulu sea to west of philippines at 17 00 approximately 15 japanese planes were picked up on radar west of task group and approaching quickly these planes split into two groups one group heading towards rear of task group whilst other continued on its course towards center although fighters from carrier group were scrambled false radar signals hampered their efforts to intercept resulting in shooting down of just one japanese plane during early stages of attack one kamikaze made for salamaua but it was discouraged by heavy anti aircraft fire changing course instead to make for lunga point before being shot down later that day she witnessed sinking of which was scuttled following a devastating kamikaze strike on 5 january her task group was harried by more kamikazes and two planes were shot down by salamauas anti aircraft gunners kamikazes did succeed in damaging cruiser however on 6 january she arrived off entrance to lingayen gulf her planes began blasting enemy positions ashore and providing air cover for approaching allied ships on 9 january they provided air cover for troops landing on assault beaches then continued that support until 13 january when she was forced to retire in days prior to 13 january fueling operations for task group had been underway which was complicated significantly by rough seas which snapped hoses on 13 january 1945 task group relocated to west of lingayen gulf where fueling recommenced at 9 00 in morning salamaua was waiting to be refueled by an oiler task group had launched combat air patrols to screen carriers with one group of aircraft at and another at however visibility was limited due to heavy cloud cover hovering above ground and there was no indication of enemy activity in area at 8 58 a japanese kamikaze plane emerging from cloud cover unexpectedly dove almost vertically towards salamauas flight deck speed of its descent as well as task group being on low alert meant that kamikaze was able to carry out its attack unmolested by anti aircraft fire carrying two bombs it penetrated deep into lower decks leaving a by gaping hole in flight deck and lighting a fire in lower bulkheads that caused a pillar of smoke to rise from hole admiral durgin querying salamaua as to origin of smoke received a reply that something just went through our flight deck one of bombs detonated near tank tops just above bilge narrowly missing bomb stowage compartment blast sent debris from engine and fuselage rocketing onto flight deck collapsing a number of bulkheads additionally it sparked multiple fires throughout flight deck hangar deck and engine room inside hangar deck aircraft were being readied for a strike and existence of armed munitions made situation tenuous second bomb failed to explode and was ejected through starboard side of ship at waterline near engine leaving a hole about wide through which seawater rushed in there was immediate loss of power communications and steering throughout ship aft engine room was breached and flooded rendering starboard engine albeit flooding extinguished engine room blaze several fires were kindled but most of blazes were quickly put under control with exception of a major fire within hangar deck which was fed by gasoline saturated debris from flight deck fighting fire was further complicated by loss of water main pressure along aft of ship and by detonation of hydrostatic fuses and various other ammunition after 30 minutes blaze was contained after a fight which first then prevented detonation of more munitions a more pressing concern was flooding which an entire day of pumping could not alleviate this resulted in entire starboard engine being submerged leading to ship acquiring an 8deg list to starboard attack on salamaua was last successful kamikaze attack in philippines campaign there were more kamikazes which followed up in 10 minutes after attack on salamaua but japanese had lost element of surprise one plane dove towards but was engaged by heavy anti aircraft fire including from salamaua and it veered towards before being destroyed by a proximity fuzed 5 inch shell another two planes tried to strike salamaua one passing above her port quarter before crashing into sea and another one detonating in midair as it approached her astern throughout this ordeal she was able to keep up with her task group using her port engine fifteen men were killed and 88 injured by attack at 19 25 she broke away from her task group to limp away for leyte accompanied by destroyers and along with tug okinawa salamaua limped into leyte still hampered significantly by flooding on 14 january there injured were unloaded worst of wreckage was cleaned up and flooding was partially controlled after repairs she set off for seeadler harbor arriving on 2 february for repairs on floating dry dock where her aircraft contingent and crew were disembarked on 5 february she left for pearl harbor accompanied by also damaged by a kamikaze she arrived on 17 february where she unloaded unnecessary ammunition and departed on 19 february bound for san francisco arriving on 26 february she was put in a queue for repairs repairs began on 3 march and on 21 april she moved

group on 26 may to support land operations on okinawa but on 3 june she was ordered to join task group 30 8 a logistics support group alongside and typhoon and anti submarine operations she arrived at her post on 4 june but next day typhoon connie passed directly over third fleet on morning of 5 june task group was refueling but weather deteriorated to render it impossible by noon reports of a typhoon to south led captain joseph i taylor to order as many aircraft as possible to be sheltered within hangar bay her limited carrying capabilities forced some aircraft to be stored on flight deck where they were bolted down onto tarmac by late afternoon task group was being buffeted by tropical storm force winds and at 3 30 5 june hurricane force winds were reported steering control was lost by 3 35 as massive waves pounded ship a fore 40 mm gun and aircraft handling boom was carted away by waves flight deck was partially detached at extreme fore damaging aircraft catapult and some bulkheads on flight deck an avenger tore loose from its restraints spinning wildly across wrecking all of aircraft anchored onto flight deck and killing a crewman by time task force emerged from typhoon 46 planes had been destroyed mostly on salamaua and bougainville salamauas flight deck had been rendered inoperative and she arrived at guam on 10 june to undergo repairs thumb view within
