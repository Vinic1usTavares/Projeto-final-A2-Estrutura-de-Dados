purchase of former brownlow hill workhouse site in 1930 sir edwin lutyens 1869 1944 was commissioned to provide a design which would be an appropriate response to giles gilbert scott designed neo gothic anglican cathedral then being built further along hope street lutyens design was intended to create a massive structure that would have become second largest church in world it would have had world s largest dome with a diameter of compared to diameter on st peter s basilica in vatican city building work based on lutyens design began on whit monday 5 june 1933 being paid for mostly by contributions of working class catholics of burgeoning industrial port in 1941 restrictions of world war ii wartime and a rising cost from ps3 million to ps27 million ps in forced construction to stop in 1956 work recommenced on crypt which was finished in 1958 thereafter lutyens design for cathedral was considered too costly and was abandoned with only crypt complete restored architectural model of lutyens cathedral is on display at museum of liverpool scott s reduced design after ambitious design by lutyens fell through adrian gilbert scott brother of sir giles gilbert scott architect of anglican cathedral was commissioned in 1953 to work on a smaller cathedral design with a ps4 million budget ps in he proposed a scaled down version of lutyens building retaining massive dome scott s plans were criticised and building did not go ahead gibberd s design present cathedral was designed by sir frederick gibberd 1908 84 construction began in october 1962 and less than five years later on feast of pentecost 14 may 1967 completed cathedral was consecrated soon after its opening it began to exhibit architectural flaws this led cathedral authorities to sue frederick gibberd for ps1 3 million on five counts two most serious being leaks in aluminium roof and defects in mosaic tiles which had begun to come away from concrete ribs design has been described by stephen bayley as a thin and brittle take on an oscar niemeyer original in brasilia though pevsner notes that resemblance is only superficial architecture concept competition to design cathedral was held in 1959 requirement was first for a congregation of 3 000 which was later reduced to 2 000 to be able to see altar in order that they could be more involved in celebration of mass and second for lutyens crypt to be incorporated in structure gibberd achieved these requirements by designing a circular building with altar at its centre and by transforming roof of crypt into an elevated platform with cathedral standing at one end construction contract was let to taylor woodrow thumb left 250px cathedral at dusk exterior cathedral is built in concrete with a portland stone cladding and an aluminium covering
