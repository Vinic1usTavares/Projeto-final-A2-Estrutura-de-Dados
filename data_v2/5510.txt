influential example of rts video games warcraft iii was a commercial success shipping 4 4 million copies to retail stores selling over a million within a month gameplay warcraft iii takes place on a map of varying size such as large plains and fields with terrain features like rivers mountains seas or cliffs map is initially hidden from view and only becomes visible through exploration areas no longer in sight range of an allied unit or building are covered with fog of war meaning that while terrain remains visible changes such as enemy troop movements and building construction are not during a game players must establish settlements to gain resources defend against others and train units to explore map and fight computer controlled foes there are three main resources that are managed in warcraft iii gold lumber and food first two are required to construct units and buildings while food restricts maximum number of units that can be possessed at same time additionally a new upkeep system means that producing units over certain amounts will decrease amount of gold one can earn compelling players to focus on playing with a limited number of units to avoid penalties left thumb a screenshot of single player campaign showing orc hero thrall approaching a quest marker and full game interface game displays units and buildings as well as environment from a classical top down perspective with a slight angle that can only be zoomed and rotated slightly game features a fixed interface in bottom of screen that displays a mini map information about currently selected unit or group of units and possible actions for this unit or building if multiple units are selected game automatically groups them by type allowing all units of same type to be given special commands like using their skills a small top bar displays current time of day as well as currently owned resources and current upkeep level top left corner displays a portrait of player s hero es for quick access if worker units have no jobs to do their icons are displayed in bottom left corner for easy assignment warcraft iii features four playable factions human alliance a coalition of humans dwarves and high elves and orcish horde composed of orcs trolls and minotaur inspired tauren return from previous games while undead scourge and night elves were added as two new factions as in starcraft each race has a unique set of units structures technologies and base building methodology game also introduces creeps computer controlled units that are hostile to all players creeps guard key areas such as gold mines or neutral buildings and when killed provide experience points gold and special items that can be used by heroes warcraft iii also introduced a day night cycle to series besides having advantages or disadvantages for certain races at night most creeps fall asleep making nighttime scouting safer however line of sight for most units is also reduced additionally some night elf units become invisible at night when not moving other minor changes to gameplay were due to 3d terrain for instance units on a cliff have an attack bonus when attacking units at lower elevations in addition warcraft iii adds powerful new units called heroes for each enemy unit killed a hero will gain experience points which allow hero to level up to a maximum level of 10 progressing up a level increases hero s attributes and also allows hero to gain new spell options bringing role playing video game elements to series certain hero abilities can boost allied units all heroes can equip items to increase skills defense and other abilities at level six hero can obtain an ultimate skill that is more powerful than three other spells that hero possesses heroes can also utilize various natural resources found throughout map such as controllable non player characters and markets in which hero can purchase usable items often hero units become deciding factor in determining a winner warcraft iiis campaign mode is divided into four campaigns each featuring a different faction each campaign is itself divided into chapters and there is a set order in which they have to be played as story follows events in these campaigns additionally an optional prologue campaign that serves as a tutorial can be played before starting main campaign unlike previous blizzard titles such as warcraft ii or starcraft there are no mission briefings in which plot exposition occurs and objectives are announced rather warcraft iii uses a system of seamless quests some plot development happens in an occasional cinematic but most occurs in game with cutscenes objectives known as quests are revealed during progress of map main quests are those that must be completed to proceed to next chapter but there are also optional side quests that are not initially revealed but can be discovered and completed while following main oftentimes granting benefits that help with those main objectives through each race s campaign player retains control of one or more heroes who slowly grow in experience as levels progress which is carried over to subsequent missions allowing hero to become more powerful throughout course of campaign while different in terms of story line and precise gameplay all of different races campaigns are structured similarly each begins with a level involving simple mechanics to introduce faction and basic elements of their hero and units after one or two such levels first building mission occurs requiring them to build and maintain a base while competing with one or more enemy forces only campaign that breaks this pattern is night elf campaign whose first mission involves building a limited base last level of each race s campaign is an epic battle in which a large number of enemy foes has to be defeated game s multiplayer mode uses battle net network players can create free accounts in regional gateways which helps reduce lag these are azeroth u s east lordaeron u s west northrend europe and kalimdor asia unlike previous battle net enabled games warcraft iii introduced anonymous matchmaking automatically pairing players for games based on their skill level and game type preferences preventing cheating and inflating their records artificially if players want to play with a friend in ranked matches warcraft iii offers arranged team games where a team joins a lobby and battle net will search for another team as with anonymous matchmaking enemy team is not known beforehand while campaign games can have many different objectives sole objective in multiplayer games is to destroy all buildings of opposition in default melee matches players can pick their own heroes and losing one will not end game to make game proceed more quickly by default map is fully revealed but covered in fog of war warcraft iii like blizzard s previous title starcraft allows for single and multiplayer replays to be recorded and viewed allowing a game to be played at slower and faster speeds and viewed from perspective of all players players can also host custom games using maps either created in warcraft iii world editor or default multiplayer scenarios map editor allows a variety of custom maps to be created such as a number of tower defense and multiplayer online battle arena maps most notable of which was defense of ancients game also offers friends lists and channels for chatting where players can create custom channels or join blizzard approved ones warcraft iii also allows players to band together to form clans which can participate in tournaments or offer a recreational aspect to warcraft iii global scores and standings in matchmaking games are kept on a ladder players have opportunity to order a new class of units heroes heroes of each race are unique and in addition to ability to fight they are endowed with additional abilities that increase as heroes gain experience and put hero above any other unit synopsis setting and

camera perspective after success of warcraft ii 1995 and warcraft ii beyond dark portal 1996 blizzard originally planned to continue story with an point and click adventure game called warcraft adventures lord of clans this game was supposed to tell story of thrall from being raised in captivity to becoming leader of his clan however in 1998 blizzard canceled lord of clans for not meeting company s quality standards thrall s story was instead worked into warcraft iii whose development began in early 1998 game was announced as a role playing strategy game rps on september 5 1999 at a press conference by game s lead designer rob pardo inside henley suite at european computer trade show 1999 according to pardo mike o brien game s lead programmer originally planned a strategy game tentatively titled warcraft legends with few units to command over shoulder camera and no base building however after a year of work this concept did not work out and existing framework was used to create warcraft iii instead as a result of these design choices first version shown at ects 1999 had no notable interface however it did have portraits for heroes in first previews game s design and gameplay was therefore compared to games such as myth and heroes of might and magic various articles showed that abilities and items were used via right click on a unit and an appearing icon collar in early stages of development blizzard emphasized role playing aspect and downplayed base building around january 24 2000 a video from korea appeared on internet video showed some aspects of gameplay along with commentary by pardo this version already had an interface concept however most of interface were placeholders it had a map icons for abilities and unit commands and an eye shaped display for gold originally game was planned to be released at end of 2000 at e3 2000 blizzard showed a first gameplay trailer that included an interface with some elements of final design then from e3 2000 around may 12 2000 to ects 2000 game was not changed very much gameplay footage from 2001 reveals a polished version of interface seen in e3 2000 trailer back in november 2000 game was set to feature five playable races with addition of demons and only a single resource to be mined in january 2001 blizzard announced night elves as last race as well as conversion of demons into a npc race next major changes came between ects 2000 and e3 2001 when a different interface and night elf race was revealed versions demonstrated at e3 2001 and ects 2001 already contained all final interfaces and units in april 2001 blizzard still experimented with different resources and had versions of game with gold lumber mana stones and upkeep or a race depending resource that represented population like required food in newer versions in middle of january 2002 blizzard shipped out 5000 beta versions of warcraft iii to randomly selected testers in order to help improve it before being released in stores beta release had all game s units and races however it was only playable over battle net single player games and lan play were not playable on beta version of game warcraft iii was first released in united states on july 3 2002 and in europe on july 5 2002 blizzard continues to maintain warcraft iii regarding technical issues and compatibility for newer operating systems in april 2018 blizzard integrated widescreen support for first time more than 15 years after game s first release thumb rob pardo lead designer visual design warcraft iii was first blizzard game to be rendered using 3d graphics unlike other 3d games of that era this included all parts of game including menu screens all characters including environment units like sheep have their own 3d portraits when selected that animate when unit is talking game does not use mission briefings like its predecessor but instead tells story using cutscenes rendered using game s 3d engine these cutscenes show characters using a side view camera zooming in to models additionally each campaign features pre rendered cinematics that show outcome of campaign according to samwise didier blizzard s art director for warcraft iii company when developing first game of series attempted to create a more realistic experience based on belief that pc gamers preferred these graphics leading to warcraft orcs and humans looking like medieval europe blizzard allowed classical fantasy properties like dungeons dragons and lord of rings influence warcraft ii adding more fantasy races such as elves ogres and dwarves while still keeping a more realistic design with establishment of a dependable fan base due to success of first two games creative team behind warcraft iii decided no longer to follow their artistic vision as such game s visuals mark a notable departure from previous games in series using bolder and more vibrant colors and pursuing a more comic book style didier also integrated characters he designed for dungeons dragons into warcraft iii such as uther lightbringer and illidan stormrage shift towards a more cartoonish looking world that started with warcraft iii was continued in world of warcraft which deliberately used less realistic depictions to allow game to be played on less powerful pcs thus increasing potential player base artwork of warcraft iii was hugely influential on a number of other high fantasy real time strategy games that followed it audio most of music of warcraft iii was composed by tracy w bush derek duke jason hayes and glenn stafford limited edition of reign of chaos came with much of orchestral music on a separate cd each of four playable races has different music monastic music for humans ambient and native american sounding music for night elves warlike music for orcs and fast haunting music for undead one of signatures of blizzard games are unit quotes if a single unit is clicked four or more times in a row unit s voice samples become increasingly comical unit may start getting angry at player or make allusions and references to other games film or jokes writing thumb chris metzen writer and creative director most of game s missions and background story was written by chris metzen who also provided voice for thrall metzen had previously contributed artwork to first game and became involved in writing stories and missions in warcraft ii warcraft iii was first game metzen served as creative director for a role he would continue in for all blizzard games until his retirement in 2016 modding as did warcraft ii and starcraft before it warcraft iii contains a world editor program that allows players to create their own custom scenarios and maps world editor is powerful enough to allow modders to change almost any aspect of game and create new maps that feature little of game s original content despite its wealth of features world editor was easy enough for players without any coding experience to design new games through battle net players can then share these maps with others increasing popularity of custom maps to facilitate modding blizzard and third party developers released tools for a variety of tasks though editor has received updates through game patches it is not officially supported as a product some custom maps have enjoyed great success particularly maps based on aeon of strife such as defense of ancients which became a tournament item at blizzcon 2005 and other tournaments around world defense of ancients is largely attributed with to being most significant inspiration for moba genre in 2012 valve acquired commercial rights to dota trademark expansion immediately after release blizzard began brainstorming content for an expansion and development began in october 2002 in january 2003 blizzard announced that expansion pack was titled frozen throne and continues story for night elves humans and undead after events of main game while
