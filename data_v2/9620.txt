cctv in chinese press event was used as proof of dangers of falun gong and was used to legitimise government s campaign against group official account of events soon came under scrutiny however two weeks after self immolation event washington post published an investigation into identity of two self immolation victims who were killed and found that no one ever saw them practice falun gong other evidence surfaced by journalists and international observers suggests that chinese authorities had advance knowledge of self immolation human rights watch hrw wrote that incident was of most difficult stories for reporters in beijing at time to report on because of a lack of independent information available self immolation victims were accessible only to reporters from china s state run press international media and even victims family members were barred from contacting them a wide variety of opinions and interpretations of what may have happened then emerged event may have been set up by government to frame falun gong it may have been an authentic protest self immolators could have been new or unschooled falun gong practitioners and other views campaign of state propaganda that followed event eroded public sympathy for falun gong time magazine noted that many chinese had previously felt that falun gong posed no real threat and that state s crackdown against it had gone too

comparisons to cultural revolution and nazi germany s treatment of jews pomfret john 12 october 1999 cracks in china s crackdown washington post according to human rights watch leadership s frustration with failure of its efforts to quickly and thoroughly dismantle falungong was also evident in its media campaign state run press admitted in late 2000 that falun gong was continuing to stage protests in defiance of ban and proclaimed that broad masses had to be made to understand duration complexity and ferocity of our battle with falun gong in january 2001 chinese authorities launched a new wave of propaganda to discredit falun gong in which they urged state run media organizations to vilify group incident on 23 january 2001 eve of chinese new year five people on tiananmen square poured gasoline over their clothes and set themselves on fire a cnn film crew who were there on a routine check for a possible falun gong protest observed a man sitting down on pavement northeast of monument to people s heroes at centre of square he proceeded to pour gasoline over himself and set himself ablaze police officers quickly congregated on scene and extinguished flames shortly afterwards another four people on square set themselves alight one of four a man was detained and driven away in a police van cnn reported that at least two men and altogether five persons set themselves on fire after pouring gasoline over themselves they did not see a child among self immolators cnn crew began filming events from a distance but were quickly intercepted by military police

been involved wang jindong wang jin dong liu chunling liu chun ling liu siying liu si ying chen guo chen guo hao huijun hao hui jun liu baorong liu bao rong liu yunfang liu yun fang had not set themselves on fire liu chunling reportedly died on scene a few months later state media announced death of her daughter liu siying who according to state news had been hospitalised with severe burns following incident other three were reported to have been severely disfigured beijing denied requests from western journalists to interview survivors and only china central television and official new china news agency were permitted to speak to their relatives or their colleagues chinese media reports xinhua released details of incident to foreign media 2 hours after self immolation occurred xinhua then distributed a fuller press release seven days later on tuesday 30 january in response to other media reports on incident on 31 january a 30 minute special edition of current affairs programme forum told state s version of events to chinese public china central television aired footage said to be taken by nearby surveillance cameras of five people in flames chinese authorities stated that seven people who had come to tiananmen square with intention of self were all from city of kaifeng in henan province state run xinhua news agency asserted that self immolators were avid practitioners of falun gong who had taken up practice between 1994 and 1997 and that they during preceding week about how wonderful it would be to enter heaven six of them reportedly took train on 16 january meeting chen guo daughter of one of them upon their arrival in beijing seven agreed to light themselves in different parts of square at 2 30 pm on designated day with gasoline smuggled there in plastic soda bottles each had been armed with two lighters in case one would fail according to government run china association for cultic studies website wang jindong stated afterwards that group arrived in tiananmen square by two taxis and were dropped off at south of great hall of people from where they walked to spot where they would ignite themselves wang said he was approached by police as he was splitting open soda bottles and ignited himself hurriedly without assuming lotus position a press release from chinese government says that liu yunfang felt that police were able to stop him burning himself because he had not attained required spiritual level articles in evening news and southern daily reported that police had evidence that a few foreign reporters had advance knowledge of incident and suggested that such reporters could be charged with instigating and abetting a suicide state media claimed surveillance video showed six or seven reporters from cnn associated press and agence france presse arriving just 10 minutes before self immolations took place however all three agencies denied advance knowledge of and afp said they had no reporters in square at time while cnn s chief news executive eason jordan said cnn crew were there on a routine check for a possible falun gong protest falun gong response discrepancies pointed out by false fire documentary according to documentary false fire liu chunling only self immolator to have died on scene appears to collapse from being bludgeoned on head by a man in military suit false fire a attempt to deconstruct v lawrence falun gong adds media weapons in struggle with china s rulers wall street journal eastern edition 14 april 2004 p b 2i points out several inconsistencies in chinese government s version of story including second investigation report on tiananmen square self immolation incident world organization to investigate persecution of falun gong gong august 2003 retrieved 6 february 2007 liu chunling only self immolator who died on spot appears to fall from being bludgeoned on head by a man in military suit programme argues that liu could have died from a severe blow to head self immolators appear to be wearing several layers of possibly fire protective clothing and masks hair and bottle of gasoline at feet of an alleged self immolator are intact although this should have caught fire first police who normally are not known to carry fire extinguishers on duty appeared to have used almost 25 pieces of fire fighting equipment on hand on day of self immolations nearest building is 10 minutes away and footage shows that only two police vehicles were at scene flames were put out in less than a minute s time camera of cctv footage zooms in on scene as it unfolds surveillance cameras in tiananmen square are usually fixed wang jindong shouts comments that do not form part of falun dafa teachings his posture including hand position and sitting position does not reflect full or half lotus position required in falun dafa exercises hospital treatment of victims as recorded by chinese state media is inconsistent with proper care of severe burn victims for instance patients were not kept in sterile rooms girl who allegedly underwent a tracheotomy appeared to be able to speak and sing clearly mere days after surgery immediately following self immolation falun dafa information center denied that self immolators could have been falun gong practitioners emphatically pointing out that falun gong s teachings do not sanction any form of violence and that suicide is considered a sin falun gong sources overseas questioned official chinese government account of event and apparent inconsistencies in government s official narrative led to a hypothesis that self immolation was staged by government to justify persecution against falun gong by portraying its practitioners as irrational and suicidal according to this hypothesis self immolation participants were paid actors and were presumably assured that flames would be extinguished before doing real harm falun gong affiliated new tang dynasty television produced a programme called false fire which analyses inconsistencies in accounts of event in official chinese media based on a review of cctv footage programme purports to demonstrate that self immolators donned fire proof clothing and masks and raises question of why participants hair and apparently gasoline filled bottles they carried did not catch fire falun gong sources also noted that self immolators behaviour slogans they shouted and their meditation postures were not consistent with teachings or practices of falun gong furthermore program s frame by frame analysis of cctv footage purportedly shows that liu was actually killed by a deadly blow to head from a man in a military overcoat false fire documentary described death of 12 year old liu siying as being under unusual circumstances saying that she was apparently recovering well before dying suddenly on 17 march some falun gong sources argue that she may have been killed by government as a way of guaranteeing her silence program suggests that reaction time of state run television crews and police on tiananmen square demonstrates they had advance knowledge of event they observed that officers arrived almost immediately on scene equipped with numerous fire extinguishers fire extinguishers are not standard equipment for police on tiananmen square nearest building that would house them was several minutes away from scene world organization to investigate persecution of falun gong further called attention to portrayals of wang jindong on state run television claiming that man who self immolated on square was not same person who appeared in subsequent interviews with cctv it pointed to a voice analysis conducted by speech processing laboratory at national taiwan university which concluded that voices did not match and also noted that hairline and facial proportions appeared to be different these observations were used to advance theory that self immolators were actors third party findings thumb left upright 1 15 alt composite image of three portraits and a table comparing them three pictures broadcast by state media presented by falun gong as evidence that wang jindong was played by different people identities of some of self immolators and their relationship to falun gong was called into question by philip pan of washington post while state run xinhua news agency had reported that liu chunling s adoptive mother spoke of liu s obsession with falun gong her worshipping of li hongzhi and that liu would teach her daughter falun gong pan found most residents in kaifeng felt disgraced by what liu had done i e self immolation but none of liu s neighbours had ever observed her practising falun gong they remarked there were problems between liu and her mother and reporter learned that liu worked in a nightclub took money to keep men company according to david ownby a university of montreal historian and expert on falun gong pan s portrayal of liu is highly inconsistent with typical profile of a falun gong practitioner identities of participants on tiananmen square was also called into question by a cnn producer on scene while chinese government claimed that a 12 year old liu siying had set herself on fire at urging of her mother cnn producer said that she did not see any children among self immolators several observers have noted that foreign journalists were not allowed to interview self immolation victims recovering in hospitals even victims relatives were not permitted to speak with them according to david ownby david ownby falun gong and future of china oxford university press 2008 p 217 pan wrote that beijing denied requests to interview liu siying and three other survivors who are all hospitalized a kaifeng official said only china central television and official new china news agency were permitted to speak to their relatives or their colleagues a man who answered door at liu home referred questions to government survivors were interviewed by state run press however in one such interview cctv interviewed 12 year old liu siying government sources reported liu siying had undergone a tracheotomy shortly before interview speaking through approved media outlets she said that her own mother told her to set herself on fire to reach heavenly golden kingdom journalist danny schechter doubted that child would have been able to speak to chinese media so soon after a tracheotomy yet liu siying appeared to be speaking clearly and singing in interview according to schechter xinhua had unusually released a statement on self immolation to foreign media only hours after event occurred saying that this was unusual because sensitive subjects in chinese press are almost never reported on a timely basis usual protocol is approval by several party officials before publication which usually takes a fair amount of time ian johnson similarly observed state media reported victim s death with unusual alacrity implying that either death took place earlier than reported or usually cautious media had top level approval to rush out electronic reports and a televised dispatch questions were also raised over where footage of event came from and speed with which camera crews appeared on scene chinese government media reported that close up shots in its video footage came from confiscated cnn tapes cnn representatives argued that this was impossible however as their reporters were detained shortly after event began and were not allowed to film rest pan was also suspicious of positioning of cameras and fact that close up shots shown on chinese television were taken without police interference in some camera is clearly behind police barricades washington post article says in addition overhead surveillance camera footage seemed to show a man filming scene using a small hand held camera rather than a large camera of type used for tv news reporting age commented that ready availability of fire extinguishers and official tv teams and lack of verification about victims raised questions about whether authorities had advanced knowledge of self immolation police were on scene of self immolation within 90 seconds carrying numerous pieces of firefighting equipment a european journalist was quoted as saying i have never seen policemen patrolling on tiananmen square carrying fire extinguishers how come they all showed up today location of incident is at least 20 minutes roundtrip from nearest building people s great hall john gittings of guardian stated however that it was common practice in many countries for police camera operators to be on hand when a public disturbance is anticipated police used small scale fire extinguishers of type carried in public vehicles many of which are routinely on square dispute following incident details of why individuals were involved has been and remains subject of dispute between representatives of falun gong chinese government and other observers a significant challenge to arriving at a definitive assessment of event is that independent corroboration of government s claims has not been possible according to human rights watch hrw lack of independent information made incident one of most difficult stories for reporters in beijing to report new york times stated that conflicting claims were difficult to assess w ith propaganda streaming in from seemingly opposite ends of universe especially since remaining falun gong practitioners have been driven underground philip pan s investigation and other inconsistencies highlighted by falun gong organisations led some journalists and other observers to entertain possibility that self immolation was not as straightforward as chinese official media accounts suggested in national review ann noonan of laogai research foundation suggested that it was hardly a far fetched hypothesis that government staged incident or allowed it to proceed to discredit falun gong as government vowed to crush practice before eightieth anniversary celebrations of communist party in july clive ansley a vancouver based rights lawyer who lived in china during self immolation suggested that a dramatic response by falun gong would have been understandable but ultimately concluded that event was staged you ve got falun gong people in this country they ve been oppressed over and over again they are not allowed to speak they are not allowed to assert any of their rights as citizens level of frustration must be terribly terribly high i can understand people doing that but ironically we ultimately found out that it was staged anyway it was not real it was completely staged by government quoted in peter rowe 2007 beyond red wall persecution of falun gong cbc television documentary in his 2001 book on falun gong journalist danny schechter drew on evidence from falun gong sources from philip pan and interviews with other journalists to conclude that self immolation was orchestrated by chinese government danny schechter falun gong s challenge to china akashic books 2001 pp 20 23 citing schechter s research anthropologist noah porter wrote that convincing evidence has been provided that events described by chinese media are at least deceptive if not a complete hoax also stating even if there were people who lit themselves on fire and considered themselves falun gong practitioners they would not be representative of falun gong practitioners noah porter masters thesis for university of south florida falun gong in united states an ethnographic study 2003 p 105 reviewing divergent narratives on identity of self immolation victims historian david ownby concluded that although arguments of falun gong practitioners seem cogent it is very difficult to arrive at a final judgment about self immolation there are desperate people in china and elsewhere who will do anything for money which would go to their families in this case one supposes unless authorities had promised to rescue them before flames could do harm or entire event could have been staged but it seems just as possible that those who set themselves on fire might have been new or unschooled falun gong practitioners had discovered and practised falun gong on their own and badly in post suppression period and for whatever reason decided to make ultimate sacrifice other human rights activists speculated that five who set themselves on fire did so to protest government s crackdown on falun gong barend ter haar was open to idea that self immolators were falun gong practitioners and postulated that former buddhists may have brought with them respectable buddhist tradition of self immolation as a sacrifice to buddha he sought to account for inconsistencies by suggesting that government may have fabricated a video of their own when they realised potential of suicides francesco sisci asia editor of la stampa supported possibility that self immolators were falun gong practitioners writing in asia times that no one believed that government could have paid a mother to torch herself and her daughter or that she was so loyal to communist party that she pretended to be a falungong member and kill herself and her only daughter even if falungong master li hongzhi forbade suicide in sisci s view chinese officials made a mistake by arresting foreign journalists on tiananmen independently filmed news footage of proceedings could have been best proof of falungong madness instead when government reported episode it looked like propaganda time noted some of confusion surrounding conflicting views on self immolation one beijing falun gong practitioner interviewed appeared to accept that self immolators were practitioners engaged in protest while falun gong organisations overseas denied any involvement time also speculated that lack of solidarity in falun gong was contributing to sense of desperation of mainland chinese practitioners who may feel out of touch with exiled leadership guardian reporter john gittings reported that some observers believed it was possible that self immolators acted in desperation and confusion some observers have speculated that if participants were falun gong practitioners they may have resorted to self immolation in response to publication of a new scripture by li hongzhi released on 1 january 2001 beyond limits of forbearance an article authored by a collection of mainland chinese falun gong practitioners and published on main chinese language falun gong website noted that scripture had caused confusion both among falun gong practitioners and in society and that some people wondered whether falun gong would resort to violence to resist persecution authors wrote that this would not occur as violence would be both counterproductive and contrary to core teachings of practice harmonizing dafa not going to extremes 10 january 2001 a falun gong spokesperson clarified that new scripture simply meant it was time to bring truth to light about human rights abuses committed by chinese government nonetheless gittings posited that scripture may have confused falun gong followers particularly in mainland china matthew forney wrote in time magazine that li s message had spread into china via internet and informal networks of followers and speculated that it may have galvanised more radical practitioners there david ownby wrote that he found brief message to be difficult to interpret on its surface scripture resembled a call to arms against what li described as evil beings who no longer have any human nature or righteous thoughts yet ownby said no practitioners he talked to had seen scripture as a green light for violent action instead practitioners had interpreted it to mean exactly opposite that they could non violently resist suppression without guilt they could stop simply surrendering to police at first moment of a confrontation they could run away they could organize they were in a word free of whatever constraints necessity to forbear had previously placed upon them in an interview with washington post ownby noted that li does not endorse suicide in any of his recent statements but a practitioner at end of his or her rope in china could certainly see statements as an endorsement for martyrdom and perhaps choose his or her own means to achieve that aftermath media campaign and public opinion state media coverage of event resulted in increased support for party s persecution efforts against falun gong and eroded public sympathy for group time reported that prior to self immolation incident many chinese had felt that falun gong posed no real threat and that state s persecution had gone too far after event however china s media campaign against falun gong gained significant traction world organization to investigate persecution of falun gong reported that hostility toward falun gong from general public escalated government had stepped up its campaign and charged that hate crimes targeting falun gong increased one western diplomat commented that public changed from sympathising with falun gong to siding with government popular consensus seemingly shifted by human interest stories and accounts of rehabilitation efforts of former practitioners ostergaard believes that in retrospect new year scripture was li s greatest gift to state as self immolations marked a turning point which ended domestic support for movement self immolation incident was given prominent coverage in official chinese media which analysts say took a propagandistic line according to philip pan communist party launched an all out campaign to use incident to prove its claim that falun gong is a dangerous cult and to turn public opinion in china and abroad against group every morning and night state controlled media carry fresh attacks against falun gong and its u s based leader li hongzhi posters leaflets and videos were produced detailing supposed detrimental effects of falun gong practice new york times reported that public was bombarded with graphic images of act on television and in newspapers erik beijing judge jails 4 for promoting falun gong s public suicides new york times 18 august 2001 in china s schools regular anti falun gong classes were scheduled eight million students joined anti cult action by youth civilized communities across nation twelve million children were made to submit writings disapproving of practice within a month of tiananmen square incident authorities issued a document entitled whole story of self immolation incident created by falun gong addicts in tiananmen square containing colour photographs of charred bodies state council s office for prevention and handling of evil cults declared after event that it was now ready to form a united front with global anti cult struggle meetings took place in factories offices universities and schools and approved religious leaders across country had delivered denunciations of falun gong in kaifeng post office issued an anti falun gong postmark and 10 000 people signed a petition denouncing group violence and re education washington post reported that chinese authorities benefited from turn in public opinion against falun gong that followed self immolation seizing on opportunity to sanction systematic use of violence against group according to post authorities established a network of brainwashing classes and embarked on a painstaking effort to weed out followers neighbourhood by neighbourhood and workplace by workplace reeducation tactics employed included beatings shocks with electric truncheons and intensive anti falun gong study classes according to a report published in wall street journal in february 2001 6 10 office stepped up pressure on local governments to implement anti falun gong campaign in particular it issued new detailed instructions requiring that all who continued to actively practice falun gong were to be sent to prison or labour camps and individuals who refused to renounce practice were to be socially isolated and monitored by their families and workplaces this was a shift from past when local officials sometimes tolerated falun gong on condition that it was practised privately charles hutzler falun gong feels effect of china s tighter grip shift means even private practice is banned asian wall street journal 26 april 2001 according to freedom house in year following incident scale of imprisonment torture and deaths of falun gong practitioners in custody increased significantly according to freedom house months of relentless propaganda succeeded in turning public opinion against group over next year scale of imprisonment torture and even deaths of falun gong practitioners from abuse in custody increased dramatically impact on falun gong s resistance self immolation necessitated a change in tactics for falun gong tiananmen square had been permanently contaminated as a venue for protest according to journalist ethan gutmann and falun gong s daily demonstrations in beijing nearly ceased altogether gutmann ethan 6 december 2010 into thin airwaves weekly standard according to human rights watch practitioners may have concluded protests had outlived their usefulness for demonstrating chinese abuses or for informing an overseas audience of falungong s diaspora practitioners living overseas focused their attentions on getting word out about treatment of practitioners by chinese government issuing reports to united nations and human rights organisations staging public marches and hunger strikes outside of china and documenting human rights abuses on websites within china practitioners used mass mailings and handed out literature to spread truth and counter government s allegations against them in an august 2001 press release us based falun dafa information center noted this shift in strategy and said that chinese practitioners sometimes also manage to post large posters and banners in major thoroughfares they even set up loudspeakers on rooftops or trees around labour camps and in densely populated areas to broadcast news about human rights abuses in 2002 falun gong practitioners in changchun successfully broadcast false fire video on chinese state television interrupting scheduled programming for 50 minutes liu chengjun a falun gong practitioner who hacked into satellite feed was arrested and sentenced to prison where he died 21 months later allegedly tortured to death united states department of state said liu chengjun had reportedly been abused in custody and beaten to death by police in jilin city prison remaining five individuals behind television hijacking were also imprisoned and all have reportedly died or been tortured to death in custody fate of self immolators five of people involved in incident were sentenced in mid 2001 although official xinhua news agency had described proceedings as a public trial only final day in month long trial was public and consisted mainly of reading of verdicts guardian reported that on last day of one month trial xinhua had by mid morning issued a full report of verdicts people s daily had produced its own editorial by afternoon liu yunfang named as mastermind was given a life sentence wang jindong was given 15 years two other accomplices a 49 year old man named xue and a 34 year old beijing woman named liu who apparently provided group with lodging and helped in preparation of incident were sentenced to 10 and 7 years in prison respectively liu baorong who had acknowledged her crime escaped punishment because her role in planning event was minor after having denied foreign media access to self immolation victims for previous year in april 2002 government arranged for foreign press to interview purported survivors of self immolation in presence of state officials interviewees refuted claims that self immolation was staged showing their burn injuries as evidence and denounced falun gong while expressing support for authorities handling of group when asked why they set themselves on fire hao huijun replied that she had realized futility of writing letters and demonstrating by waving banners so finally we decided to make a big event to show our will to world we wanted to show government that falun gong was good at time of interview chen guo and her mother were said to still be in hospital both having lost their hands ears and noses both her mother s eyes were covered with skin grafts wang jindong showing burns to his face said he felt humiliated because of my stupidity and fanatical ideas references external links
