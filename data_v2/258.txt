asm a 1 tarzon also known as vb 13 was a guided bomb developed by united states army air forces during late 1940s mating guidance system of earlier razon radio controlled weapon with a british tallboy bomb asm a 1 saw brief operational service in korean war before being withdrawn from service in 1951 design and development development of vb 13 tarzon began in february 1945 with bell aircraft being awarded a contract by united states army air forces for development of a very large guided bomb parsch 1998 p 13 vb 13 was a combination of a radio command guidance system as used on smaller vb 3 razon range and azimuth only guided bomb with british developed tallboy earthquake bomb schmitt 2002 p 45 known to usaaf as gillepsie 2006 p 54 tarzon name was a portmanteau combining tallboy range and azimuth only describing weapon and guidance system fact sheet vb 13 tarzon bomb and was pronounced similarly to that of tarzan popular ape man fictional character bomb with a brain british pathe newsreel 52 51a june 23 1952 accessed 2013 03 22 vb 13 redesignated asm a 1 in 1948 was developed under project code mx 674 dorr 2003 p 31 it had an annular wing around midsection of its body mounted near weapon s center of gravity at rear of bomb was an octagonal tail surface containing razon control surfaces intended to be carried by boeing b 29 superfortress bomber tarzon bomb used combination of an arw 38 joint army navy piloted aircraft radio automatic flight or remote control command link transmitter on b 29 and an an 2 joint army navy utility radio automatic flight or remote control receiver on tarzon to provide manual command guidance of range and azimuth this was done with visual tracking of bomb s course aided by a flare mounted in tail of weapon gyroscopes on board asm a 1 aided in stabilisation while a pneumatic system drove bomb s control surfaces guidance system was considered effective tarzon proved in testing to have an accuracy of in addition to nominal weight of tallboy it was based on annular wing and control surfaces boosted weight of tarzon by an additional this made asm a 1 too large and heavy to fit inside bomb bay of a superfortress instead weapon was carried in a semi recessed mounting half weapon being exposed to airstream this increased drag on carrying aircraft and caused turbulent airflow that could affect handling of b 29 operational history thumb left tarzon being loaded on a b 29 of 19th bomb group although vb 13 project had not reached testing stage by end of world war ii it avoided being cancelled proceeding as a low priority project limited testing was conducted during 1948 and 1949 additional testing at alamogordo new mexico in 1950 led to tarzon being approved for operational service in korean war schmitt 2002 p 46 tarzon saw its first combat use in december 1950 asm a 1 replacing razon in operational service smaller weapon had been determined to be too small for effective use against bridges and other hardened targets gillepsie 2006 p 58 used solely by 19th bomb group which had previously conducted razon s combat missions first tarzon drop in combat took place on december 14 1950 largest bomb used in combat during war tarzon was used in strikes against north korean bridges and other hardened targets tarzon s improved accuracy over conventional dumb bombs led to confirmed destruction of at least six high priority targets during approximately six months of combat use these included a hydroelectric plant proving effectiveness of guided weapons against conventional targets as well as bridges thirty tarzon missions were flown between december 1950 and march 1951 weapon s success led to a contract for production of 1 000 additional asm a 1 missiles gillepsie 2006 p 59 on march 29 1951 however a tarzon strike against sinuiju went awry group commander s aircraft was destroyed as a result of premature detonation of bomb when aircraft suffering mechanical difficulties weapon was jettisoned in preparation for ditching steadfast and courageous pp 33 34 thirtieth and as it proved final mission three weeks following sinuiju mission also suffered an unintentional detonation of a jettisoned safed bomb although this time without loss of aircraft an investigation proved that fault lay in construction of bomb s tail breaking up on impact a safed bomb would have its arming wire removed rendering it unsafe and detonating weapon modifications were made to solve problem but damage had been done safety issues gillepsie 2006 p 60 increased maintenance costs compared to conventional bombs fact that bomb s guidance system required clear day use only rendering bombers vulnerable to enemy fighters and required that weapon be released at a prime altitude for aircraft to be in danger from enemy flak these combined with weapon s poor reliability only six of twenty eight bombs dropped successfully destroyed their targets to result in production order being canceled by usaf following this
