thumb watson s avatar inspired by ibm smarter planet logo watson is a question answering computer system capable of answering questions posed in natural language developed in ibm s deepqa project by a research team led by principal investigator david ferrucci watson was named after ibm s founder and first ceo industrialist thomas j watson computer system was initially developed to answer questions on quiz show jeopardy and in 2011 watson computer system competed on jeopardy against legendary champions brad rutter and ken jennings winning first place prize of 1 million in february 2013 ibm announced that watson software system s first commercial application would be for utilization management decisions in lung cancer treatment at memorial sloan kettering cancer center new york city in conjunction with wellpoint now anthem manoj saxena ibm watson s then business chief said in 2013 that 90 of nurses in field who use watson now follow its guidance description 350px thumb high level architecture of ibm s deepqa used in watson watson was created as a question answering qa computing system that ibm built to apply advanced natural language processing information retrieval knowledge representation automated reasoning and machine learning technologies to field of open domain question answering key difference between qa technology and document search is that document search takes a keyword query and returns a list of documents ranked in order of relevance to query often based on popularity and page ranking while qa technology takes a question expressed in natural language seeks to understand it in much greater detail and returns a precise answer to question when created ibm stated that more than 100 different techniques are used to analyze natural language identify sources find and generate hypotheses find and score evidence and merge and rank hypotheses in recent years watson capabilities have been extended and way in which watson works has been changed to take advantage of new deployment models watson on ibm cloud and evolved machine learning capabilities and optimised hardware available to developers and researchers it is no longer purely a question answering qa computing system designed from q a pairs but can now see hear read talk taste interpret learn and recommend software watson uses ibm s deepqa software and apache unstructured information management architecture framework implementation system was written in various languages including java c and and runs on suse linux enterprise server 11 operating system using apache framework to provide distributed computing hardware system is workload optimized integrating massively parallel power7 processors and built on ibm s deepqa technology which it uses to generate hypotheses gather massive evidence and analyze data watson employs a cluster of ninety ibm power 750 servers each of which uses a 3 5 ghz power7 eight core processor with four threads per core in total system has 2 880 power7 processor threads and 16 terabytes of ram according to john rennie watson can process 500 gigabytes equivalent of a million books per second ibm s master inventor and senior consultant tony pearson estimated watson s hardware cost at about three million dollars its performance stands at 80 teraflops which is about half as fast as cut off line for top 500 supercomputers list according to rennie all content was stored in watson s ram for jeopardy game because data stored on hard drives would be too slow to be competitive with human jeopardy champions data sources of information for watson include encyclopedias dictionaries newswire articles and literary works watson also used databases taxonomies and specifically and were used ibm team provided watson with millions of documents including dictionaries encyclopedias and other reference material that it could use to build its knowledge operation watson parses questions into different keywords and sentence fragments in order to find statistically related phrases watson s main innovation was not in creation of a new algorithm for this operation but rather its ability to quickly execute hundreds of proven language analysis algorithms simultaneously more algorithms that find same answer independently more likely watson is to be correct once watson has a small number of potential solutions it is able to check against its database to ascertain whether solution makes sense or not comparison with human players thumb ken jennings watson and brad rutter in their jeopardy exhibition match watson s basic working principle is to parse keywords in a clue while searching for related terms as responses this gives watson some advantages and disadvantages compared with human jeopardy players watson has deficiencies in understanding contexts of clues as a result human players usually generate responses faster than watson especially to short clues watson s programming prevents it from using popular tactic of buzzing before it is sure of its response watson has consistently better reaction time on buzzer once it has generated a response and is immune to human players psychological tactics such as jumping between categories on every clue in a sequence of 20 mock games of jeopardy human participants were able to use average six to seven seconds that watson needed to hear clue and decide whether to signal for responding during that time watson also has to evaluate response and determine whether it is sufficiently confident in result to signal part of system used to win jeopardy contest was electronic circuitry that receives ready signal and then examined whether watson s confidence level was great enough to activate buzzer given speed of this circuitry compared to speed of human reaction times watson s reaction time was faster than human contestants except when human anticipated instead of reacted to ready signal after signaling watson speaks with an electronic voice and gives responses in jeopardy question format watson s voice was synthesized from recordings that actor jeff woodman made for an ibm text to speech program in 2004 jeopardy staff used different means to notify watson and human players when to buzz which was critical in many rounds humans were notified by a light which took them tenths of a second to perceive watson was notified by an electronic signal and could activate buzzer within about eight milliseconds humans tried to compensate for perception delay by anticipating light but variation in anticipation time was generally too great to fall within watson s response time watson did not attempt to anticipate notification signal history development since deep blue s victory over garry kasparov in chess in 1997 ibm had been on hunt for a new challenge in 2004 ibm research manager charles lickel over dinner with coworkers noticed that restaurant they were in had fallen silent he soon discovered cause of this evening hiatus ken jennings who was then in middle of his successful 74 game run on jeopardy nearly entire restaurant had piled toward televisions mid meal to watch phenomenon intrigued by quiz show as a possible challenge for ibm lickel passed idea on and in 2005 ibm research executive paul horn backed lickel up pushing for someone in his department to take up challenge of playing jeopardy with an ibm system though he initially had trouble finding any research staff willing to take on what looked to be a much more complex challenge than wordless game of chess eventually david ferrucci took him up on offer in competitions managed by united states government watson s predecessor a system named piquant was usually able to respond correctly to only about 35 of clues and often required several minutes to respond to compete successfully on jeopardy watson would need to respond in no more than a few seconds and at that time problems posed by game show were deemed to be impossible to solve in initial tests run during 2006 by david ferrucci senior manager of ibm s semantic analysis and integration department watson was given 500 clues from past jeopardy programs while best real life competitors buzzed in half time and responded correctly to as many as 95 of clues watson s first pass could get only about 15 correct during 2007 ibm team was given three to five years and a staff of 15 people to solve problems by 2008 developers had advanced watson such that it could compete with jeopardy champions by february 2010 watson could beat human jeopardy contestants on a regular basis during game watson had access to 200 million pages of structured and unstructured content consuming four terabytes of disk storage including full text of 2011 edition of wikipedia but was not connected to internet for each clue watson s three most probable responses were displayed on television screen watson consistently outperformed its human opponents on game s signaling device but had trouble in a few categories notably those having short clues containing only a few words although system is primarily an ibm effort watson s development involved faculty and graduate students from rensselaer polytechnic institute carnegie mellon university university of massachusetts amherst university of southern california s information sciences institute university of texas at austin massachusetts institute of technology and university of trento as well as students from new york medical college jeopardy preparation thumb 250px watson demo at an ibm booth at a trade show in 2008 ibm representatives communicated with jeopardy executive producer harry friedman about possibility of having watson compete against ken jennings and brad rutter two of most successful contestants on show and program s producers agreed watson s differences with human players had generated conflicts between ibm and jeopardy staff during planning of competition ibm repeatedly expressed concerns that show s writers would exploit watson s cognitive deficiencies when writing clues thereby turning game into a turing test to alleviate that claim a third party randomly picked clues from previously written shows that were never broadcast jeopardy staff also showed concerns over watson s reaction time on buzzer originally watson signalled electronically but show staff requested that it press a button physically as human contestants would even with a robotic finger pressing buzzer watson remained faster than its human competitors ken jennings noted if you re trying to win on show buzzer is all and that watson can knock out a microsecond precise buzz every single time with little or no variation human reflexes can t compete with computer circuits in this regard stephen baker a journalist who recorded watson s development in his book final jeopardy reported that conflict between ibm and jeopardy became so serious in may 2010 that competition was almost canceled as part of preparation ibm constructed a mock set in a conference room at one of its technology sites to model one used on jeopardy human players including former jeopardy contestants also participated in mock games against watson with todd alan crain of onion playing host about 100 test matches were conducted with watson winning 65 of games to provide a physical presence in televised games watson was represented by an avatar of a globe inspired by ibm smarter planet symbol jennings described computer s avatar as a glowing blue ball criss crossed by threads of thought 42 threads to be precise and stated that number of thought threads in avatar was an in joke referencing significance of number 42 in douglas adams hitchhiker s guide to galaxy joshua davis artist who designed avatar for project explained to stephen baker that there are 36 states that watson was able to use throughout game to show its confidence in responding to a clue correctly he had hoped to be able to find forty two to add another level to hitchhiker s guide reference but he was unable to pinpoint enough game states a practice match was recorded on january 13 2011 and official matches were recorded on january 14 2011 all participants maintained secrecy about outcome until match was broadcast in february practice match in a practice match before press on january 13 2011 watson won a 15 question round against ken jennings and brad rutter with a score of 4 400 to jennings s 3 400 and rutter s 1 200 though jennings and watson were tied before final 1 000 question none of three players responded incorrectly to a clue first match first round was broadcast february 14 2011 and second round on february 15 2011 right to choose first category had been determined by a draw won by rutter watson represented by a computer monitor display and artificial voice responded correctly to second clue and then selected fourth clue of first category a deliberate strategy to find daily double as quickly as possible watson s guess at daily double location was correct at end of first round watson was tied with rutter at 5 000 jennings had 2 000 watson s performance was characterized by some quirks in one instance watson repeated a reworded version of an incorrect response offered by jennings jennings said what are 20s in reference to 1920s then watson said what is 1920s because watson could not recognize other contestants responses it did not know that jennings had already given same response in another instance watson was initially given credit for a response of what is a leg after jennings incorrectly responded what is he only had one hand to a clue about george eyser correct response was what is he s missing a leg because watson unlike a human could not have been responding to jennings s mistake it was decided that this response was incorrect broadcast version of episode was edited to omit trebek s original acceptance of watson s response watson also demonstrated complex wagering strategies on daily doubles with one bet at 6 435 and another at 1 246 gerald one of ibm researchers who worked on watson explained that watson s wagers were based on its confidence level for category and a complex regression model called game state evaluator watson took a commanding lead in double jeopardy correctly responding to both daily doubles watson responded to second daily double correctly with a 32 confidence score although it wagered only 947 on clue watson was only contestant to miss final jeopardy response in category u s cities its largest airport was named for a world war ii hero its second largest for a world war ii battle rutter and jennings gave correct response of chicago but watson s response was what is toronto ferrucci offered reasons why watson would appear to have guessed a canadian city categories only weakly suggest type of response desired phrase u s city did not appear in question there are cities named toronto in u s and toronto in ontario has an american league baseball team dr chris welty who also worked on watson suggested that it may not have been able to correctly parse second part of clue its second largest for a world war ii battle which was not a standalone clause despite it following a semicolon and required context to understand that it was referring to a second largest airport eric nyberg a professor at carnegie mellon university and a member of development team stated that error occurred because watson does not possess comparative knowledge to discard that potential response as not viable although not displayed to audience as with non final jeopardy questions watson s second choice was chicago both toronto and chicago were well below watson s confidence threshold at 14 and 11 respectively this lack of confidence was reason for multiple question marks in watson s response game ended with jennings with 4 800 rutter with 10 400 and watson with 35 734 second match during introduction trebek a canadian native joked that he had learned toronto was a u s city and watson s error in first match prompted an ibm engineer to wear a toronto blue jays jacket to recording of second match in first round jennings was finally able to choose a daily double clue while watson responded to one daily double clue incorrectly for first time in double jeopardy round after first round watson placed second for first time in competition after rutter and jennings were briefly successful in increasing their dollar values before watson could respond nonetheless final result ended with a victory for watson with a score of 77 147 besting jennings who scored 24 000 and rutter who scored 21 600 final outcome prizes for competition were 1 million for first place watson 300 000 for second place jennings and 200 000 for third place rutter as promised ibm donated 100 of watson s winnings to charity with 50 of those winnings going to world vision and 50 going to world community grid similarly jennings and rutter donated 50 of their winnings to their respective charities in acknowledgment of ibm and watson s achievements jennings made an additional remark in his final jeopardy response i for one welcome our new computer overlords echoing a similar reference to episode deep space homer on simpsons in which tv news presenter kent brockman speaks of welcoming our new insect overlords jennings later wrote an article for slate in which he stated ibm has bragged to media that watson s question answering skills are good for more than annoying alex trebek company sees a future in which fields like medical diagnosis business analytics and tech support are automated by question answering software like watson just as factory jobs were eliminated in 20th century by new assembly line robots brad and i were first knowledge industry workers put out of work by new generation of thinking machines quiz show contestant may be first job made redundant by watson but i m sure it won t be last philosophy philosopher john searle argues that watson despite impressive capabilities cannot actually think drawing on his chinese room thought experiment searle claims that watson like other computational machines is capable only of manipulating symbols but has no ability to understand meaning of those symbols however searle s experiment has its detractors match against members of united states congress on february 28 2011 watson played an untelevised exhibition match of jeopardy against members of united states house of representatives in first round rush d holt jr d nj a former jeopardy contestant who was challenging computer with bill cassidy r la later senator from louisiana led with watson in second place however combining scores between all matches final score was 40 300 for watson and 30 000 for congressional players combined ibm s christopher padilla said of match technology behind watson represents a major advancement in computing in data intensive environment of government this type of technology can help organizations make better decisions and improve how government helps its citizens current and future applications according to ibm goal is to have computers start to interact in natural human terms across a range of applications and processes understanding questions that humans ask and providing answers that humans can understand and justify it has been suggested by robert c weber ibm s general counsel that watson may be used for legal research company also intends to use watson in other information intensive fields such as telecommunications financial services and government watson is based on commercially available ibm power 750 servers that have been marketed since february 2010 ibm also intends to market deepqa software to large corporations with a price in millions of dollars reflecting 1 million needed to acquire a server that meets minimum system requirement to operate watson ibm expects price to decrease substantially within a decade as technology improves commentator rick merritt said that there s another really important reason why it is strategic for ibm to be seen very broadly by american public as a company that can tackle tough computer problems a big slice of ibm s profit comes from selling to u s government some of biggest most expensive systems in world in 2013 it was reported that three companies were working with ibm to create apps embedded with watson technology fluid is developing an app for retailers one called north face which is designed to provide advice to online shoppers is developing an app designed to give people advice on ways to engage in activities to improve their health md is developing an app for purpose of advising medical institutions on equipment procurement decisions in november 2013 ibm announced it would make watson s api available to software application providers enabling them to build apps and services that are embedded in watson s capabilities to build out its base of partners who create applications on watson platform ibm consults with a network of venture capital firms which advise ibm on which of their portfolio companies may be a logical fit for what ibm calls watson ecosystem thus far roughly 800 organizations and individuals have signed up with ibm with interest in creating applications that could use watson platform on january 30 2013 it was announced that rensselaer polytechnic institute would receive a successor version of watson which would be housed at institute s technology park and be available to researchers and students by summer 2013 rensselaer had become first university to receive a watson computer on february 6 2014 it was reported that ibm plans to invest 100 million in a 10 year initiative to use watson and other ibm technologies to help countries in africa address development problems beginning with healthcare and education on june 3 2014 three new watson ecosystem partners were chosen from more than 400 business concepts submitted by teams spanning 18 industries from 43 countries these bright and enterprising organizations have discovered innovative ways to apply watson that can deliver demonstrable business benefits said steve gold vice president ibm watson group winners were apps with their adaptive educational platform fang friendly anthropomorphic networked genome red ant with their retail sales trainer and with their medical recommendation service on july 9 2014 telecommunications laboratories announced plans to integrate watson to improve their customer experience platform citing sheer volume of customer data to analyze is staggering watson has been integrated with databases including bon appetit magazine to perform a recipe generating platform watson is being used by decibel a music discovery startup in its app which uses

is targeting in february 2017 rare carat a new york city based startup and e commerce platform for buying diamonds and diamond rings introduced an ibm watson powered artificial intelligence called rocky to assist novice diamond buyers through daunting process of purchasing a diamond as part of ibm global entrepreneur program rare carat received assistance of ibm in development of rocky chat bot in may 2017 ibm partnered with pebble beach company to use watson as a concierge watson s artificial intelligence was added to an app developed by pebble beach and was used to guide visitors around resort mobile app was designed by ibm ix and hosted on ibm cloud it uses watson s conversation applications programming interface in november 2017 in mexico city experience voices of another time was opened at national museum of anthropology using ibm watson as an alternative to visiting a museum healthcare in healthcare watson s natural language hypothesis generation and evidence based learning capabilities are being investigated to see how watson may contribute to clinical decision support systems and increase in artificial intelligence in healthcare for use by medical professionals to aid physicians in treatment of their patients once a physician has posed a query to system describing symptoms and other related factors watson first parses input to identify most important pieces of information then mines patient data to find facts relevant to patient s medical and hereditary history then examines available data sources to form and test hypotheses and finally provides a list of individualized confidence scored recommendations sources of data that watson uses for analysis can include treatment guidelines electronic medical record data notes from healthcare providers research materials clinical studies journal articles and patient information despite being developed and marketed as a diagnosis and treatment advisor watson has never been actually involved in medical diagnosis process only in assisting with identifying treatment options for patients who have already been diagnosed in february 2011 it was announced that ibm would be partnering with nuance communications for a research project to develop a commercial product during next 18 to 24 months designed to exploit watson s clinical decision support capabilities physicians at columbia university would help to identify critical issues in practice of medicine where system s technology may be able to contribute and physicians at university of maryland would work to identify best way that a technology like watson could interact with medical practitioners to provide maximum assistance in september 2011 ibm and wellpoint now anthem announced a partnership to utilize watson s data crunching capability to help suggest treatment options to physicians then in february 2013 ibm and wellpoint gave watson its first commercial application for utilization management decisions in lung cancer treatment at memorial sloan kettering cancer center ibm announced a partnership with cleveland clinic in october 2012 company has sent watson to cleveland clinic lerner college of medicine of case western reserve university where it will increase its health expertise and assist medical professionals in treating patients medical facility will utilize watson s ability to store and process large quantities of information to help speed up and increase accuracy of treatment process cleveland clinic s collaboration with ibm is exciting because it offers us opportunity to teach watson to think in ways that have potential to make it a powerful tool in medicine said c martin harris md chief information officer of cleveland clinic in 2013 ibm and md anderson cancer center began a pilot program to further center s mission to eradicate cancer however after spending 62 million project did not meet its goals and it has been stopped on february 8 2013 ibm announced that oncologists at maine center for cancer medicine and medical group in new york have started to test watson supercomputer system in an effort to recommend treatment for lung cancer on july 29 2016 ibm and manipal hospitals a leading hospital chain in india announced launch of ibm watson for oncology for cancer patients this product provides information and insights to physicians and cancer patients to help them identify personalized evidence based cancer care options manipal hospitals is second hospital in world to adopt this technology and first in world to offer it to patients online as an expert second opinion through their website manipal discontinued this contract in december 2018 on january 7 2017 ibm and fukoku mutual life insurance entered into a contract for ibm to deliver analysis to compensation payouts via its ibm watson explorer ai this resulted in loss of 34 jobs and company said it would speed up compensation payout analysis via analysing claims and medical record and increase productivity by 30 company also said it would save y in running costs it is said that ibm watson will be carrying knowledge base of 1000 cancer specialists which will bring a revolution in field of healthcare ibm is regarded as a disruptive innovation however stream of oncology is still in its nascent stage several startups in healthcare space have been effectively using seven business model archetypes to take solutions based on ibm watson to marketplace these archetypes depends on value generate for target user e g patient focus vs healthcare provider and payer focus and value capturing mechanisms e g providing information or connecting stakeholders in 2019 eliza strickland calls watson health story a cautionary tale of hubris and hype and provides a representative sample of projects
