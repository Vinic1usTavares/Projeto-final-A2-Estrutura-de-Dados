touchet formation or touchet beds consist of large quantities of gravel and fine sediment which overlay almost a thousand meters several thousand feet of volcanic basalt of columbia river basalt group in south central washington and north central oregon beds consist of between 6 and 40 distinct rhythmites horizontal layers of sediment each clearly demarcated from layer below these touchet beds are often covered by windblown loess soils which were deposited later number of layers varies with location beds vary in depth from at lower elevations where a number of layers can be found to a few extremely thin layers at maximum elevation where they are observed touchet beds are one element in a chain of evidence which helped identify and define progression of missoula floods which occurred around 16 450 to 13 750 years bce during floods flow through wallula gap was slow enough such that water pooled in a temporary lake lake lewis lake lewis back flooded up yakima walla walla touchet and tucannon river valleys in these relatively calm arms of lake slack waters deposited suspended materials eroded from scabland regions north of lake lewis and redeposited them in pronounced layers before receding discovery and interpretation thumb left 200px alt this photo shows a series of horizontal layers of soil in a road cut in center of photo barely visible there is a geologist s hammer and a leather glove to establish perspective they suggest that layers are about 1 meter thick in geology type locale is a location where first example of a newly described object was found this is type locale this set of layered beds although nowhere near as clearly pronounced in layering as in several of other photos shows first location where touchet formation was identified in published literature touchet beds in touchet river valley although visible along walla walla and touchet rivers touchet beds were not subjected to study until early 20th century they remain at center of scientific analyses to characterize missoula floods type locality type locality for touchet formation is confluence of touchet river with walla walla river originally noted by richard foster flint in 1938 numerous other exposures were subsequently identified throughout basins of former lake lewis and lake condon touchet equivalent slackwater deposits are also present in willamette valley near portland former lake allison early interpretation in 1923 j harlen bretz published a paper arguing that channeled scablands in eastern washington were caused by massive flooding in distant past this view which was seen as arguing for a catastrophic explanation for geologic development which ran counter then prevailing view of uniformitarianism and bretz s views were initially decried bretz defended his theories setting off a forty year debate over missoula floods before bretz s view of a catastrophic flood finally prevailed waitt extended bretz s argument arguing for a sequence of multiple missoula floods 40 or more waitt s proposal was based mainly on analysis from glacial lake bottom deposits in ninemile creek and touchet formation deposits in burlingame canyon this represented a move away from a single catastrophic flood toward a series of catastrophic floods but with flood source still ascribed to glacial lake missoula controversy whether channeled scabland landforms were formed mainly by multiple periodic large floods or by a single grand scale cataclysmic flood from either late pleistocene glacial lake missoula or an unidentified canadian source reappeared in 1999 shaw s team reviewed sedimentary sequences of touchet beds and concluded that sequences do not automatically imply multiple floods separated by decades or centuries rather they proposed that sedimentation in glacial lake missoula basin was result of jokulhlaups draining into lake missoula from british columbia to north shaw s team proposed that rhythmic touchet beds are result of multiple pulses or surges within a single larger flood in response atwater s team observed that there is substantial evidence for multiple large floods including evidence of mud cracks and animal burrows in lower layers of touchet beds which were filled by sediment from later floods causes thumb 200px left alt this photo shows several layers of horizontal touchet beds layers are not as clearly demarked as they were in some of prior photos there is a geologist s hammer and a glove in photo to establish perspective it suggests layers are about 1 meter thick most significantly there is a thin white horizontal line running through top of one of layers this layer consists of two layers of ash deposited by an eruption of mount st helens separated by a thin layer ash allows an alternative confirmation of dating layer touchet beds in touchet river valley note distinct white line which consists of two layers of mount st helens s ash that fell in eastern washington between 13 350 and 14 400 years bce recent scientific investigations support waitt s proposed separation of layers into records of sequential flood events although various sources support temporal separation of floods they do not definitively identify source of water for all of floods though they all agree that lake missoula was source for at least some of them formation touchet beds are formed of sediment which deposited during various missoula floods around 16 450 to 13 750 bce and during bonneville flood that occurred in approximately 12 500 bce another potential source for periodic flooding still somewhat controversial is flood release by jokulhlaups from subglacial lakes in british columbia but no specific source for these jokulhlaups has yet been identified during floods flow through narrow wallula gap was restricted such that water pooled in a temporary lake lake lewis which formed in lowlands of columbia plateau lake lewis back flooded up yakima walla walla touchet and tucannon river valleys this flooding lasted for a period of 4 7 days in relatively calm arms of lake slack waters were thick with suspended materials eroded from scablands above some of suspended materials settled out creating thick touchet formation layers or rhythmites which are found throughout these valleys larger clasts settled out first followed by finer ones this resulted in layers with graded bedding or bedding in which larger particles are at bottom and smaller ones are at top periodicity thumb 300px right alt this photo shows four profiles of lake lewis at various flood levels it illustrates that lake back flooded several valleys in which touchet beds were found lake lewis was formed when restricted flow of was restricted by a hydraulic dam a restriction to flow rate caused by a narrowed reach in a river valley from periodic cataclysmic floods from glacial lake missoula pluvial lake bonneville and perhaps from subglacial outbursts backed up through constriction formed by wallula gap in horse heaven hills southern washington in 1980 r b waitt studied touchet formation in wall of burlingame canyon west of walla walla washington where he counted at least 41 distinct flood deposit layers he postulated that these floods could occur only when glacial lake missoula existed which estimates place at 16 450 to 13 750 bce more recent studies have used radiocarbon dating to establish approximate ages of deposition for various layers side valleys were protected from violent currents of main channel as a result flood strata laid down by earlier floods were not eroded away by subsequent floods but were buried and preserved average period between flood episodes is estimated to be 20 to 60 years periodicity estimates are based on a number of constraints time to recharge lake missoula depends upon level at which dam is breached releasing flood as well as upon adjusted precipitation rate in drainages flowing into lake missoula for volumes which correspond to calculated maximum flow rates this is estimated to take from 20 to 80 years paleomagnetic orientations from beds of tephra volcanic ash that lie between layers of touchet formation show secular variation which indicates that beds must have been formed by many floods purity of tephra suggests subaerial deposition tephra could be mixed with surrounding sediment if it was deposited in moving water which indicates a dry period during ash falls and hence a hiatus between floods offshore deposits on bed of pacific at mouth of columbia river include of material deposited over a several thousand year period that corresponds to period of multiple scabland floods seen in touchet beds since there are at least 40 floods this would give an average separation between floods of 50 years number of layers deposited varies with location in lake lewis basin this can best be understood as result of multiple floods variable levels correspond to lake missoula breaching ice dam at varying lake levels releasing different volumes of flood waters this would suggest time between floods is variable flood beds in other locations upstream of lake lewis such as ninemile creek in montana and sanpoil arm of glacial lake columbia show a corresponding regularity of flood deposits as well as deposit grading and rhythmical repetition to those in lake lewis since glacial lake columbia remained filled annual deposits varves can be observed between flood deposits flood deposits can be distinguished from annually deposited varves by both their thickness and presence of materials foreign to immediate drainage atwater reports from 35 to 55 annual varves between flood deposits in lake columbia supporting a period of 35 to 55 years between ice dam failures additional varve counts from lake missoula basin sanpoil river and latah creek suggest that time between floods was 30 40 years on average locations touchet river valley thumb 200px left alt this photo shows several layers of touchet formation as seen close up there is a geologist s hammer and a leather glove in photo to provide perspective they suggest layers are about 1 meter deep there is a vertical seam of a different material running through horizontal layers this is clastic dike which was introduced by later geologic processes carson and pogue identified these as clastic dikes penetrating touchet layers photo taken in a road cut several miles up touchet valley touchet formation was originally identified at confluence of touchet river with walla walla river it is also found at some distance up touchet river valley number of layers observed decreases as one progresses up valley indicating that floodwater lakes varied in depth and distance upstream from various flood dams clastic dike intrusions are observed in some locations penetrating layers vertically dikes are infilled with uniform size fine grained materials and are indications that period between floods was long enough that deposits dried forming vertical cracks and allowing wind blown eroded materials to infill cracks walla walla river valley thumb 200px alt this photo shows another canyon cut into surrounding flat soil with about 30 distinct horizontal layers of sediment each clearly demarked from layer below above canyon a telephone pole can be seen in distance pole provides perspective that helps viewer establish that cut is deep in foreground one observes near edge of canyon which help one establish that canyon is quite narrow and steep walled touchet beds near lowden in walla walla valley note distinct layers walla walla river valley is a broad open basin drained by walla walla river below valley river flows through a narrow gap to its confluence with columbia river this area was filled to varying depths by successive missoula floods and sediments settled out to form touchet beds over much of basin creating what is today a fertile farmland region in lowest part of broader valley to east of columbia river and west of city of walla walla washington soils commonly form on touchet beds in several locations erosion has exposed these beds one outcrop gardena terrace segment of rhythmites can be seen along highway west of walla walla touchet formation is also extensively exposed at burlingame canyon just southwest of town of touchet near confluence of touchet and walla walla rivers deposits are also found along tributaries to walla walla extending some distance south into oregon yakima river valley thumb 200px left alt this photo shows a canyon cut into surrounding flat soil with over 20 distinct horizontal layers of sediment each clearly demarked from layer below above canyon lip a number of boxes used for transporting harvested apples are stacked size of these boxes indicates that layers each are 0 5 1 meter in depth touchet beds on yakima river in zillah washington note distinct layers apple crates at top provide scale each is 1 meter high for layer thickness lake lewis extended up yakima valley flooding an area of about of valley and covering area now occupied by city of yakima by about valley extends for widening westwards above chandler narrows and then narrowing again at union gap just below yakima toppenish basin and benton basin of lower yakima river both contain large amounts of touchet formation deposits rhythmites are extensively exposed north of mabton and at zillah ice rafted erratics are also commonly found in these beds tucannon river valley tucannon river and its tributary creek also have valleys partially filled with alluvial deposits from missoula and bonneville floods although they lie some distance up snake river drainage flood waters of lake lewis backed up this drainage far enough to deposit sediments floodplain deposits consist of up to six distinct touchet beds as well as loess silt and fine sand these alluvial and loess deposits narrow as they approach basalt valley walls and thicken into central valley with a maximum sediment thickness of between due to elevation of valley only six of flooding events caused water to back into tucannon valley in sufficient volume to deposit distinct layers columbia river basin rhythmites from missoula floods have also been observed in columbia river valley one notable location is white bluffs which are made up of more thickly bedded deposits from eddy that formed in floodwaters behind saddle mountains another location is at trinidad wa located approximately 8 miles west of quincy crescent bar road willow creek valley touchet formation is also found in oregon in areas flooded by lake condon this lake back flooded into umatilla and john day river valleys as well as other tributaries as one example silt sand rhythmites associated with missoula floods are present along willow creek a valley tributary to columbia river willow creek with columbia a few miles west of boardman oregon excellent exposures of unit which contains abundant clastic dikes can be found in roadcuts along hwy 74 highway near ranching community of cecil oregon these deposits are associated with former lake condon references external links category geologic formations of oregon category geologic formations
