siege of tyana was carried out by umayyad caliphate in 707 708 or 708 709 in retaliation for a heavy defeat of an umayyad army under maimun mardaite by byzantine empire in c 706 arab army invaded byzantine territory and laid siege to city in summer 707 or 708 date is uncertain as virtually each of extant greek arabic and syriac parallel sources has in this respect a different date tyana initially withstood siege with success and arab army faced great hardship during ensuing winter and was on point of abandoning siege in spring when a relief army sent by emperor justinian ii arrived quarrels among byzantine generals as well as inexperience of a large part of their army contributed to a crushing umayyad victory thereupon inhabitants of city were forced to surrender despite agreement of terms city was plundered and largely destroyed and according to byzantine sources its people were made captive and deported leaving city deserted background in 692 693 byzantine emperor justinian ii and umayyad caliph abd al malik broke truce that had existed between byzantium and umayyad caliphate since 679 following failed muslim attack on byzantine capital constantinople byzantines secured great financial and territorial advantages from truce which they extended further by exploiting umayyad government s involvement in second muslim civil war 680 692 however by 692 umayyads were clearly emerging as victors in conflict and abd al malik consciously began a series of provocations to bring about a resumption of warfare justinian confident in his own strength based on his previous successes responded in kind finally umayyads claimed that byzantines had broken treaty and invaded byzantine territory defeating imperial army at battle of sebastopolis in 693 haldon

eastern asia minor that would culminate in second attempt to conquer constantinople in 716 718 haldon 1997 pp 72 76 80 83 howard johnston 2010 pp 507 510 lilie 1976 pp 110 112 122 furthermore justinian was deposed in 695 beginning a twenty year period of internal instability that almost brought byzantine state to its knees lilie 1976 p 140 treadgold 1997 pp 345 346 arab campaign against tyana as part of these arab raids an invasion under a certain maimun al maimun mardaite took place which raided cilicia and was defeated by a byzantine army under a general named marianus near tyana dating of this expedition is unclear although primary account by al baladhuri places it under abd al malik who died in 705 it is commonly dated to 706 by modern scholars according to baladhuri this maimun had been a slave of caliph muawiyah s sister who had fled to mardaites a group of christian rebels in northern syria after mardaites had been subdued general maslama ibn abd al malik who had heard of his valour liberated him and entrusted him with a military command and later swore to avenge his death brooks 1898 p 203 lilie 1976 p 116 stratos 1980 pp 144 145 as a result maslama launched another attack aimed at tyana with his nephew al abbas ibn al walid as co commander lilie 1976 p 116 mango scott 1997 p 525 stratos 1980 p 145 chronology of expedition is again unclear byzantine chronicler theophanes confessor puts it in a m 6201 708 709 ad and possibly even 709 710 but arab sources date it to a h 88 and 89 706 707 ad and 707 708 ad respectively as a result siege has been variously dated to 707 708 ad and 708 709 ad brooks 1898 p 192 lilie 1976 p 117 note 40 mango scott 1997 p 525 stratos 1980 p 147 arabs besieged city employing siege engines to bombard its fortifications they managed to destroy part of wall but were unable to enter city despite launching several assaults defenders successfully drove them back siege continued into winter and arabs began to suffer greatly from shortage of food so that they began contemplating abandoning siege altogether lilie 1976 pp 116 117 mango scott 1997 p 526 stratos 1980 p 145 in spring however justinian ii who had been restored to byzantine throne in 705 assembled a relief army under generals theodore and theophylact and sent it towards tyana byzantine chroniclers record that regular troops were complemented by armed peasants numerous but lacking in any military experience lilie 1976 p 117 mango scott 1997 p 526 stratos 1980 pp 145 146 modern historians consider this an indication of dire situation of regular byzantine army partly as a result of justinian s purge of officer corps after his restoration and partly due to losses suffered in war with bulgars lilie 1976 p 117 note 41 as relief army approached tyana it was confronted by arabs and in ensuing battle byzantines were routed according to theophanes two byzantine generals quarrelled among themselves and their attack was disorderly byzantines lost many thousand dead and captives also numbered in thousands arabs captured byzantine camp and took all provisions they had brought along for beleaguered city allowing them to continue siege lilie 1976 p 117 mango scott 1997 p 526 stratos 1980 p 146 inhabitants of tyana now despaired of any succour and as their own supplies dwindled they began negotiations for a surrender arabs promised to allow them to depart unharmed and city capitulated after a siege of nine months in march according to michael syrian in may june according to al tabari theophanes reports that arabs broke their promise and enslaved entire population which was deported to caliphate but no other source confirms this after looting town arabs razed it to ground lilie 1976 p 117 mango scott 1997 p 526 stratos 1980 pp 146 147 aftermath chroniclers report that after sacking tyana abbas and maslama divided their forces and campaigned in byzantine territory again chronology as well as identity of targets is uncertain primary sources give 709 or 710 as dates which could mean that these raids happened in immediate aftermath of tyana or in year after abbas raided cilicia and from there turned west as far as dorylaion while maslama seized fortresses of and heraclea near tyana or according to another interpretation of arabic sources marched also west and took heraclea pontica and nicomedia while some of his troops raided chrysopolis across from constantinople itself lilie 1976 p 118 mango scott 1997 p 526 stratos 1980 pp 147 148 arab raids continued for next years and were carried out even while a huge army under maslama was besieging constantinople in 717 718 after failure of this undertaking arab attacks continued but they were now concerned with plunder and prestige rather than outright conquest although umayyad attacks of early 8th century were successful in gaining control of border districts of cilicia and region around melitene and despite their destruction of byzantine strongholds like tyana in following decades arabs were never able to permanently establish a presence west of taurus mountains which thus came to delineate arab byzantine frontier for next two
