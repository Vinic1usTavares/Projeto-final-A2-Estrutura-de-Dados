a parkway between bronx river parkway and hawthorne circle parkway sold a majority of its right of way in 1920s but proposed parkway met strong opposition from village of bronxville and yonkers sprain brook proposal sat on table until 1949 when state council of parks run by robert moses sought to ease congestion on bronx river parkway moses proposed that a new state park would be constructed in westchester with sprain brook parkway serving as a traffic alternative to bronx river and nearly a decade and a half after parkway was deeded land this time bronxville opposed project rather than yonkers but an agreement was worked out in 1951 this new alignment would bypass parts of bronxville and yonkers to construct freeway construction of alternative highway began in 1958 with stretch from bronx river parkway to tuckahoe road this section was completed in 1961 next piece from tuckahoe road to jackson avenue was constructed during 1962 and 1963 with it opening in latter construction

in 1920s when westchester county road commission acquired right of way for a planned extension of taconic state parkway land bought from 1925 to 1927 for 1 5 million in modern dollars was however not used as a parkway and in 1938 was proposed to be used instead as an arterial state highway rather than a parkway commission sent a request in april 1938 to state council of parks to have state take over right of way after state withdrew its support for parkway extension in april 1938 county was approached by westchester county park commission to transfer new project to state for construction by state council of parks project which at time would have cost 7 million in modern dollars was to connect to robert moses proposed highway between new york city and albany opposition to this plan was immediate yonkers officials publicly disapproved saying that county would lose any hope for state aid in january 1939 village of bronxville joined opposition deeming new parkway as a needless expenditure of public money that would adversely affect local property values and cause flooding at same time proposals in state legislature provided a sum of 25 000 for project county executive william bleakley said that a new parkway should be built but not so close to saw mill river and bronx river parkways he argued instead for use of new york central railroad s right of way or a parkway on hudson river there were also fears a new parkway would siphon off toll paying drivers who previously used cross county parkway and its new fleetwood viaduct nor would it help county s largest bottleneck hawthorne circle county s board of supervisors however disagreed with executive in april 1941 county officials admitted that it was likely that 7 million appropriated would not be enough and instead it would be better spent on improving other nearby parkways proposed parkway would have needed 400 000 more for additional right of way and construction costs would leave no money to repave bronx river parkway link to cross county parkway and to extend saw mill river parkway county would have had to spend 8 million of its own money as well parkway was instead shortened from bronxville to elmsford revival in march 1949 state council of parks led by robert moses recommended development of a new state park in sprain valley this new state park which would also have a parkway built through it would intend to take traffic off congested bronx river parkway this new parkway would be one of construction projects involved which included rebuilding bronx river and development of ridge road park moses led committee also suggested that 25 000 be appropriated for a study survey and report on new parkway and possible expansion of ridge road park city of yonkers also became involved in proposal because a section of land needed between ny 100 central park avenue and palmer road was deeded over to state by westchester county for new 13 million 1949 usd parkway residents in yonkers protested that this december 1949 transfer would require demolition or defacing of 1 million worth of homes in city in april 1950 state council of parks met in ardsley bronxville opposed construction claiming that there would be property value depreciation however there was no cited opposition for parkway from any communities further north of bronxville and that officials from westchester county were looking into ideas for an alternate route around bronxville at time county had most of right of way in bronxville claimed short of one piece need for parkway was helped by fact that widening of bronx river parkway was not applicable due to land limitations and prohibitory cost of acquiring land for a widening parkway while creating a needed connection between saw mill river parkway and bronx river parkway would not answer need for diverting traffic off hawthorne circle and issue of what to do with truck traffic parkway if started would take about three years to complete and would be constructed by taconic state park commission route a in february 1951 westchester county started getting ready to approve new parkway plans from state of new york new 16 18 million 1950 usd parkway still had a short section still in question with various groups preferring two different alignments state council of parks wanted to use alignment used by odell parkway which still would require demolition of thirty homes in cedar knolls section of yonkers while other groups wanted parkway to be aligned through crestwood which would cost 100 homes five different sites were proposed at meeting with westchester county board of supervisors on february 15 however an agreement could not be reached by committee and it was delayed to next week on february 19 county board gave approval to state plans at a vote of 32 to 9 letters of discontent amounted to fifty nine letters or telegrams chairman jefferson armstrong spoke that new parkway would lead to planning for destruction of westchester he stated that county was giving away 8 million in taxpayer funds to state with a debt of 2 3 million after collecting tolls on saw mill river and hutchinson river parkways residents of town of greenburgh protested county s decision to give undeveloped rochambeau park for development into a state park in july 1951 county of westchester approved route a one of proposed alignments for sprain brook through city of yonkers costing 10 512 million 1951 usd route was approved by state and fact that county still owned right of way would determine whether county would give it to state this section of parkway as part of route a began at bronx river parkway extending to a point just north of jackson avenue a hearing was held on june 18 that mentioned that only route f 1 which would cost 14 579 million and was longer would be only other acceptable proposal people living along route a track preferred route f 1 which would take fifty four homes over thirty from accepted proposal during meeting of westchester county board of supervisors on august 6 two officials from yonkers attempted to filibuster meeting to avoid transfer of sprain brook right of way along with route a proposal to state this filibuster failed as board voted 39 to 2 to transfer right of way taconic state parkway commission westchester county park commission and westchester county planning commission all endorsed route a over route f 1 however ridge road picnic area in greenburgh was not given to state remaining opposition stated that route would cut 517 000 from tax revenue and damage now 3 million worth of homes in route a section which included house of jefferson armstrong construction in december 1953 county executive for westchester county herbert gerlach proposed that now 22 million 1953 usd parkway should be constructed with tolls to help pay for new roadway at this time southern of bronx river parkway was being reconstructed for use in new sprain brook parkway with funds received before korean war jefferson armstrong declared new plan as a scheme by robert moses to spend beyond his pocketbook and that gerlach was intolerant for proposing this just before start of holiday season at same time proposal was made that county could gain funds by re appropriating usage of westchester county airport which would cost county 11 million a year but would only gain county 26 000 in revenue left thumb sprain brook parkway southbound north of tuckahoe road in north yonkers that interchange served as northern terminus of parkway from 1961 1963 on september 30 1958 state

new york nelson rockefeller also noted that extension of parkway north from cross westchester to hawthorne traffic circle was still in final design and would begin construction in 1971 with completion of a new interchange in hawthorne completion delay of final long portion of sprain brook from cross westchester expressway and taconic state parkway near hawthorne circle spent multiple years without progress until demands were placed upon governor hugh carey to get state funds attached to project project had been delayed multiple times and local lobbying interests including union carbide threatened to back out of opening corporate locations in area of new extension which in 1976 was slated to cost 20 million 1976 usd east hudson parkway authority ehpa originally proposed raising tolls on saw mill river and hutchinson river parkways and building new tolls on hutchinson along with bronx river and taconic parkways however nysdot reported during a meeting in albany that contracts on new extension would be given in 1978 however ehpa also wanted more monetary funds for maintenance of parkway system in westchester and wanted to raise tolls to help pay for that cost along state

redistribute traffic along different parkways with nysdot estimating about 44 000 cars daily using completed roadway effects of completion of parkway were nearly immediate traffic on saw mill river parkway lessened with new parkway along with a 20 reduction on taconic state parkway however while route south of sprain brook was seeing less traffic portion north of hawthorne to campfire road a section was seeing much more traffic with new parkway proposals for solving this problem included a 50 million 1982 usd proposal to widen taconic state parkway to six lanes ny 9a south of hawthorne
