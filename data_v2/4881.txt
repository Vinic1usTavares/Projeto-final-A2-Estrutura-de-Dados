battle of pulo aura was a minor naval engagement of napoleonic wars fought on 14 february 1804 in which a large convoy of honourable east india company heic east indiamen well armed merchant ships intimidated drove off and chased a powerful french naval squadron although french force was much stronger than british convoy commodore nathaniel dance s aggressive tactics persuaded contre admiral charles alexandre durand linois to retire after only a brief exchange of shot dance then chased french warships until his convoy was out of danger whereupon he resumed his passage toward british india linois later claimed that unescorted british merchant fleet was defended by eight ships of line a claim criticised by contemporary officers and later historians battle occurred during an extended commerce raiding operation by a french squadron led by linois in ship of line marengo linois had sailed to indian ocean in 1803 before declaration of war under orders to install garrisons in french and dutch colonies in region and to prey on lightly defended british merchant shipping one of richest and most significant targets was china fleet an annual convoy of east indiamen from china and other far eastern ports that carried millions of pounds worth of trade goods although these large vessels were accompanied by numerous smaller merchant ships news of outbreak of war had only just arrived in pacific and only warship available to defend fleet was small heic armed brig ganges dutch informants notified linois of fleet s destination and date of departure from canton while he was anchored at batavia on java and he sailed in search of convoy on 28 december 1803 eventually discovering it in early february although no warships protected convoy commodore dance knew that lookouts could from a distance mistake a large east indiaman for a ship of line he raised flags that indicated his fleet included part of royal navy squadron operating in indian ocean at time and formed into a line of battle although linois s ships were clearly superior british reaction unnerved him and he quickly broke off combat dance continued his ruse pursuing linois for two hours until body of convoy was safe king george iii knighted dance for his courage and various mercantile and patriotic organisations awarded him large sums of money while both emperor napoleon and linois s own officers personally castigated french admiral for his failure to press attack against a weaker and extremely valuable enemy although he remained in command of squadron for another two years and had some minor success against undefended merchant ships he suffered a string of defeats and inconclusive engagements against weaker british naval forces ironically linois was captured at action of 13 march 1806 by a numerically superior british battle squadron which he had mistaken for a merchant convoy background during napoleonic wars british economy depended on its ability to trade with british empire particularly valuable colonies in british india intercontinental trade was conducted by governors of india honourable east india company heic using their fleet of large well armed merchant vessels known as east indiamen victory of seapower gardiner p 101 these ships were of between 500 and 1200 nominal tons burthen bm and could carry up to 36 guns for defence against pirates privateers and small warships they were not however capable under normal circumstances of fighting off an enemy frigate or ship of line their guns were usually of inferior design and their crew smaller and less well trained than those on a naval ship east indiamen sought to ensure safety of their cargo and passengers not defeat enemy warships in battle clowes p 337 despite these disadvantages size of east indiamen meant that from a distance they appeared quite similar to a small ship of line a deception usually augmented by paintwork and dummy cannon maffeo p 190 at bali strait incident of 28 january 1797 an unescorted convoy of east indiamen had used this similarity to intimidate a powerful french frigate squadron into withdrawing without a fight parkinson p 106 in february 1799 an attack by a combined french spanish squadron on assembled convoy at macau was driven off in macau incident without combat by small royal navy escort squadron nelson against napoleon gardiner p p 546 east indiamen would gather at ports in india and far east and from there set out for britain in large convoys often carrying millions of pounds worth of trade goods journey would usually take six months and ships would subsequently return carrying troops and passengers to augment british forces stationed in india adkins p 342 country ships smaller merchant vessels chartered for local trade sometimes independently from heic would often join convoys to protect their ships from depredations of pirates heic also operated its own private navy of small armed vessels in combination these ships were an effective deterrent against smaller raiders but were no match for a professional warship victory of seapower gardiner p 88 understanding importance of indian ocean trade and seeking to threaten it from start of inevitable war first consul napoleon bonaparte ordered a squadron to sail for india in march 1803 this force was under command of contre admiral charles alexandre durand linois and consisted of ship of line marengo and three frigates linois operated from island base of ile de france with orders to attack british shipping once war had begun woodman p 172 sailing initially to pondicherry in india linois had a close encounter with a british squadron under rear admiral peter rainier during july but was at ile de france in august when news arrived that napoleonic wars had started on 16 may clowes p 59 determined to fortify french raiding bases in region linois landed troops and supplies at reunion and batavia during operation he despatched frigate to muscat captured numerous individual country ships and burned british trading post of bencoolen on 10 december he anchored at batavia for winter james vol 3 p 213 shortly thereafter informants passed to batavia composition and date of departure of british china fleet clowes p 336 leading linois to set out to intercept it on 28 december linois s squadron consisting of marengo frigates and corvette and dutch brig departed batavia ships carried six months worth of provisions as linois had anticipated an extended patrol in approaches to strait of malacca in south china sea china fleet was a large annual british merchant convoy that gathered at canton in pearl river during winter before sailing for britain via india as convoy passed through east indies it was joined by vessels sailing from other european ports in region on route to india until it often numbered dozens of ships 1804 fleet departed in late january and by time it reached approaches to strait of malacca it had swelled to include 16 east indiamen 11 country ships a portuguese merchant ship from macau and a vessel from botany bay in new south wales although heic had provided small armed brig ganges as an escort this vessel could only dissuade pirates it could not hope to compete with a french warship there was no military escort news of outbreak of war had reached canton before reinforcements had arrived from squadron in india woodman p 194 spies based in canton had passed composition and date of departure of china fleet to linois in batavia maffeo p 186 but dutch informants at canton had also passed on false reports that royal navy warships were accompanying convoy reports that may have been deliberately placed by british authorities convoy was an immensely valuable prize its cargo of tea silk and porcelain valued at over ps8 million in contemporary values equivalent of ps as of also on board were 80 chinese plants ordered by sir joseph banks for royal gardens and carried in a specially designed plant room heic select committee in canton had been very concerned for safety of unescorted convoy and had debated delaying its departure various captains had been consulted including henry meriton who in his ship had captured a frigate during action of 4 august 1800 a disastrous french attack on a convoy of east indiamen off brazil woodman p 149 meriton advised that convoy was powerful enough in both appearance and reality to dissuade any attack john farquharson captain of opposed meriton arguing that crews of east indiamen were so badly trained they would be unable to mutually defend one another if faced with a determined enemy campaign of trafalgar gardiner p 31 eventually committee decided it could delay convoy no longer and awarded command to most experienced captain commodore nathaniel dance an officer with over 45 years service at sea in east indiaman earl camden tracy p 113 battle at 08 00 on 14 february 1804 with island of pulo aura within sight to south west near eastern entrance to straits of malacca indiaman royal george raised a signal describing three sail approaching convoy from direction of island this was linois s squadron which had been cruising in area for previous month in anticipation of convoy s arrival dance ordered brig ganges and indiamen alfred royal george and hope to approach strange vessels and investigate rapidly discovering they were enemy warships by 13 00 dance had readied his guns and reformed his convoy with large indiamen formed up in line of battle to receive french attack as if they were warships during late afternoon linois s squadron fell in behind slow line of merchant ships and dance expected an immediate attack but linois was cautious and merely observed convoy preferring to wait until following morning before engaging enemy dance made use of delay to gather smaller country ships on opposite side of his line from french brig ganges shepherding them into position and collecting volunteers from their crews to augment sailors on board indiamen james vol 3 p 248 linois later excused his delay in attacking merchant convoy by citing need for caution thumb left defeat of linois by commodore dance 15th 1804

both british and french raised their colours dance hoped to persuade linois that his ships included some fully armed warships and he therefore ordered brig ganges and four lead ships to hoist blue ensigns while rest of convoy raised red ensigns by system of national flags then in use in british ships this implied that ships with blue ensigns were warships attached to squadron of admiral rainier while others were merchant ships under their protection dance was unknowingly assisted by information that had reached linois at batavia which claimed that there were 23 merchant ships and brig in convoy dance had collected six additional ships during his journey and identity of these were unknown to french who assumed that at least some of unidentified vessels must be warships particularly as several vessels had been recently painted at canton to resemble ships of line james vol 3 p 249 at 09 00 linois was still only observing convoy reluctant to attack until he could be sure of nature of his opponents dance responded to reprieve by reforming line of battle into sailing formation to increase his convoy s speed with intention of reaching straits ahead of linois campaign of trafalgar gardiner p 32 with convoy a less intimidating target linois began to slowly approach british ships woodman p 195 by 13 00 it was clear that linois s faster ships were in danger of isolating rear of convoy and dance ordered his lead ships to tack and come about so they would cross in front of french squadron british successfully executed manoeuvre and at 13 15 linois opened fire on lead ship

clowes p 338 at 14 00 linois abandoned action and ordered his squadron to haul away with wind and sail eastwards away from convoy under all sail determined to maintain pretence of presence of warships dance ordered ships flying naval ensigns including his flagship earl camden to chase french none of merchant ships could match french speed but an attempt at a chase would hopefully dissuade french from returning for two hours dance s squadron followed linois hope coming close to catching aventurier but ultimately unable to overtake brig at 16 00 dance decided to gather his scattered ships and return to his former heading rather than risk attack from other raiders or lose sight of his convoy in darkness by 20 00 entire british convoy had anchored at entrance to straits of malacca on 28 february british ships of line and joined them in strait and conducted them safely to saint helena in south atlantic lloyd s list there escorted convoy to england five whalers and carmarthen captain

they had prevented both heic and lloyd s of london from likely financial ruin repercussions of which would have had profound effects across british empire maffeo p 193 various commanders and their crews were presented with a ps50 000 prize fund to be divided among them and lloyd s patriotic fund and other national and mercantile institutions made a series of awards of ceremonial swords silver

earl camden and one worth 100 pounds to nathaniel dance dance was specifically rewarded receiving royal recognition when he was made a knight bachelor by king george iii he was also personally presented with sum of ps5 000 by bombay insurance company and an additional ps500 a year for life by heic dance immediately retired from sea to enfield town where he died in 1827 tracy p 114 he

and john franklin who later became a polar explorer brown p 440 also aboard was indian businessman jamsetjee returning from second of his five voyages to china linois continued his raiding achieving some success against individual sailing ships but failing to press successfully his numerical superiority against british naval forces most notably at battle of vizagapatam on 15 september 1804 and action of 6 august 1805 ironically linois was eventually captured at action of 13 march 1806 after mistaking a squadron of british ships of line for a merchant convoy in mid atlantic victory of seapower gardiner p 29 linois was concerned throughout engagement for safety of his ships with nearest dockyard over away at ile de france he could not afford to suffer severe damage to his rigging or masts that would leave his squadron crippled maffeo p 191 he also sought to defend his behaviour off pulo aura with claim that british convoy was protected by as many as eight ships of line and that he had performed heroically in saving his squadron from this overwhelming force james vol 3 p 250 subsequent historians have ridiculed this latter statement william james wryly commented in his account of action written in 1827 that it would be uncharitable to call into question courage of rear admiral linois james vol 3 p 251 and william laird clowes said in 1900 that his timidity and want of enterprise threw away a great opportunity clowes p 339 nicholas rodger writing in 2004 was even more critical insisting that his linois s officers do not seem to have been fooled and it is extremely difficult to believe that he was he goes on to suggest that no experienced seaman could possibly have mistaken a poorly manned and poorly trained merchant crew for crew of a real royal navy ship of line concluding that linois had thrown away a prize worth at least ps8 million through mere timidity most scathing criticism of linois s conduct came from napoleon himself who wrote to minister of marine denis decres on subject stating in literature battle has been fictionalised twice in captain frederick marryat s 1832 novel newton forster or merchant service and in patrick o brian s novel hms surprise published in 1973 in o brian s novel royal navy captain jack aubrey aids china fleet organizing indiamen who then succeeded as in history rewards were shed on aubrey rather than
