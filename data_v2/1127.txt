timor leste defence force or falintil fdtl often f fdtl is military body responsible for defence of east timor f fdtl was established in february 2001 and comprised two small infantry battalions a small naval component and several supporting units f fdtl s primary role is to protect east timor from external threats it also has an internal security role which overlaps with that of policia nacional de timor leste pntl this overlap has led to tensions between services which have been exacerbated by poor morale and lack of discipline within f fdtl f fdtl s problems came to a head in 2006 when almost half force was dismissed following protests over discrimination and poor conditions dismissal contributed to a general collapse of both f fdtl and pntl in may and forced government to request foreign peacekeepers to restore security f fdtl is currently being rebuilt with foreign assistance and has drawn up a long term force development plan role constitution of east timor assigns f fdtl responsibility for protecting east timor against external attack constitution states that f fdtl shall guarantee national independence territorial integrity and freedom and security of populations against any aggression or external threat in respect for constitutional order constitution also states that f fdtl shall be non partisan and shall owe obedience to competent organs of sovereignty in accordance with constitution and laws and shall not intervene in political matters national police of east timor or pntl and other civilian security forces are assigned responsibility for internal security rees 2004 pp 7 9 in practice responsibilities of f fdtl and pntl were not clearly delineated and this led to conflict between two organisations rees 2004 p 14 east timorese government has broadened f fdtl s role over time as what have been designated new missions f fdtl has been given responsibility for crisis management supporting suppression of civil disorder responding to humanitarian crises and facilitating co operation between different parts of government patrikainen et al 2011 p 140 history pre independence f fdtl was formed from national liberation movement guerrilla army known as falintil portuguese acronym for forcas armadas de libertacao de timor leste or armed forces for liberation of east timor during period before 1999 some east timorese leaders including current president jose ramos horta proposed that a future east timorese state would not have a military widespread violence and destruction that followed independence referendum in 1999 and need to provide employment to falintil veterans led to a change in policy however wainwright 2002 p 23 following end of indonesian rule falintil proposed establishment of a large military of about 5 000 personnel centre for defence studies king s college london paragraph 205 in mid 2000 united nations transitional administration in east timor untaet invited a team from king s college london to conduct a study of east timor s security force options team s report identified three options for an east timorese military option 1 was based on falintil s preference for a relatively large and heavily armed military of 3 000 5 000 personnel option 2 was a force of 1 500 regulars and 1 500 conscripts and option 3 was for a force of 1 500 regulars and 1 500 volunteer reservists centre for defence studies king s college london paragraphs 7 2 to 7 4 study team recommended option 3 as being best suited to east timor s security needs and economic situation this recommendation was accepted by untaet in september 2000 and formed basis of east timor s defence planning plan was also accepted by all countries that had contributed peacekeeping forces to east timor fawthrop and harris 2001 p 37 king s college report has been criticised on grounds that it led east timor to establish a large police force and a large army when its security needs may have been better met by a single smaller paramilitary force while east timor s decision to form a military has been criticised by some commentators east timorese government has consistently believed that force is necessary for political and security reasons critics of f fdtl s establishment argue that as east timor does not face any external threats government s limited resources would be better spent on strengthening pntl while east timor s political leadership recognises that country does not currently face an external threat they believe that it is necessary to maintain a military capacity to deter future aggression establishment of f fdtl was also seen as an effective means of integrating falintil into an independent east timor smith 2005 pp 31 32 formation of f fdtl thumb upright falintil veterans falintil officially became f fdtl on 1 february 2001 first 650 members of f fdtl were selected from 1 736 former falintil applicants and began training on 29 march fdtl s 1st battalion was established on 29 june 2001 and reached full strength on 1 december most members of battalion were from east timor s eastern provinces ball 2002 p 180 2nd battalion was established in 2002 from a cadre of 1st battalion and was manned mainly by new personnel under age of 21 who had not participated in independence struggle rees 2004 p 31 due to force s prestige and relatively high pay there were 7 000 applications for first 267 positions in battalion f fdtl s small naval component was established in december 2001 jane s sentinel security assessment southeast asia issue 20 2007 p 148 australian untaet contingent provided most of f fdtl s training and united states equipped force dobbins et al 2013 p 139 some of problems that have affected f fdtl throughout its existence were caused by process used to establish force a key flaw in this process was that falintil s high command was allowed to select candidates for military from members of falintil without external oversight as a result selection was conducted to a large degree on basis of applicants political allegiance this led to many falintil veterans feeling that they had been unfairly excluded from military and reduced force s public standing rees 2004 pp 47 49 furthermore untaet failed to establish adequate foundations for east timorese security sector by developing legislative and planning documents administrative support arrangements and mechanisms for democratic control of military these omissions remained uncorrected after east timor achieved independence on 20 may 2002 international crisis group 2008 p 5 f fdtl

20 2007 p 116 f fdtl conducted its first operation in january 2003 when an army unit was called in to quell criminal activity caused by west timorese militia gangs in district while f fdtl operated in a relatively disciplined and orderly fashion during this operation it illegally arrested nearly 100 people who were released 10 days later without being charged rees 2004 pp 20 21 f fdtl has suffered from serious morale and disciplinary problems since its establishment horta 2006 these problems have been driven by uncertainty over f fdtl s role poor conditions of service due to limited resources tensions arising from falintil s transition from a guerrilla organisation to a regular military and political and regional rivalries f fdtl s morale and disciplinary problems have resulted in large numbers of soldiers being disciplined or dismissed rees 2004 pp 32 33 east timorese government was aware of these problems before 2006 crisis but did not rectify factors that were contributing to low morale international crisis group 2008 p 2 tensions between f fdtl and pntl have also reduced effectiveness of east timor s security services during 2003 and 2004 members of police and f fdtl clashed on a number of occasions and groups of soldiers attacked police stations in september 2003 and december 2004 these tensions were caused by overlapping roles of two security services differences of opinion between members of east timor s leadership and fact that many members of pntl had served with indonesian national police prior to east timor s independence while f fdtl was based around falintil robinson 2011 p 1011 in 2003 east timorese government established three new paramilitary police forces equipped with modern weapons formation of these units led to dissatisfaction with government among some members of f fdtl 2006 crisis tensions within f fdtl came to a head in 2006 in january 159 soldiers from most units in f fdtl complained in a petition to then president gusmao that soldiers from east of country received better treatment than westerners petitioners received only a minimal response and left their barracks three weeks later leaving their weapons behind united

experience in crowd control were deployed to dili on 29 april and three deaths resulted on 3 may major alfredo reinado commander of f fdtl s military police unit and most of his soldiers including lt

naval component s patrol boats fired on attackers united nations independent special commission of inquiry for timor leste 2007 pp 31 33 during crisis relationship between f fdtl and pntl had deteriorated further and on 25 may members of f fdtl attacked pntl s headquarters killing nine unarmed police officers as a result of escalating violence government was forced to appeal for international peacekeepers on 25 may peacekeepers began to arrive in dili next day and eventually restored order a total of 37 people were killed in fighting in april and may and 155 000 fled their

external security two years after crisis thumb alt white gates with buildings behind them gate to f fdtl nicolau lobato training centre near metinaro in 2004 commander of f fdtl formed a team which included international contractors to develop a long term strategic vision document for military this study was supported by australian government burton 2007 p 101 resulting force 2020 document was completed in 2006 and made public in 2007 international crisis group 2008 p 8 document sets out an aspirational vision for development of f fdtl to 2020 and beyond and is of equivalent status to a defence white paper it proposes expanding military to a strength of 3 000 regular personnel in medium term through introduction of conscription it also sets longer term goals such as establishing an air component and purchasing modern weapons such as anti armour weapons armoured personnel carriers and missile boats by 2020 force 2020 plan is similar to option 1 in king s college report king s college study team strongly recommended against such a force structure labelling it unaffordable and raising concerns over impact of conscription upon east timorese society and military readiness team estimated that sustaining such a force structure would cost 2 6 to 3 3 percent of east timor s annual gross domestic product and would represent a heavy burden on east timor economy centre for defence studies king s college london paragraphs 7 2 and 205 212 moreover force 2020 plan may not be realistic or suitable as it appears to emphasise military expansion to counter external threats over spending on other government services and internal security and outlines ideas such as long term 2075 development of space forces international crisis group 2008 pp 6 9 while force 2020 plan has proven controversial it appears to have been adopted by east timorese government plan was criticised by united nations and governments of australia and united states as unaffordable and in excess of east timor s needs east timorese president jose ramos horta defended plan however arguing that its adoption will transform f fdtl into a professional force capable of defending east timor s sovereignty and contributing to nation s stability east timorese defence officials have also stressed that force 2020 is a long term plan and does not propose acquiring advanced weapons for some years repercussions of 2006 crisis continue to be felt on 11 february 2008 a group of rebels led by alfredo reinado attempted to kill or kidnap president ramos horta and prime minister gusmao although ramos horta and one of his guards were badly wounded these attacks were not successful and reinado and another rebel were killed a joint f fdtl and pntl command was established to pursue surviving rebels and military and police have demonstrated a high degree of co operation during this operation joint command was disbanded on 19 june 2008 while joint command contributed to surrender of many of reinado s associates it has been alleged that members of this unit committed human rights violations unmit 2008 pp 2 5 6 in june 2008 government offered to provide financial compensation to

security in 2007 was established in 2002 to provide civilian oversight of f fdtl a lack of suitable staff for ministry and close political relationship between senior f fdtl officers and government figures rendered this oversight largely ineffectual and retarded development of east timor s defence policy up to at least 2004 rees 2004 pp 11 14 failure to institute effective civilian oversight of
