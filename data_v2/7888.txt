primary market rival is sony s playstation portable psp fourth iteration entitled nintendo dsi xl is a larger model that launched in japan on november 21 2009 and worldwide beginning in march 2010 development of dsi began in late 2006 and handheld was unveiled during an october 2008 nintendo conference in tokyo consumer demand convinced nintendo to produce a slimmer handheld with larger screens than ds lite consequently nintendo removed game boy advance gba cartridge slot to improve portability without sacrificing durability while dsi s design is similar to that of ds lite it features two digital cameras supports internal and external content storage and connects to an online store called nintendo dsi shop nintendo stated that families often share ds and ds lite consoles its new functionality was intended to facilitate personalization so as to encourage each member of a household to purchase a dsi handheld supports exclusive physical media in addition to ds games with dsi specific features and standard ds titles only exception to its backward compatibility are earlier ds games that required gba slot nintendo had sold over 41 million dsi and dsi xl units combined they were succeeded by nintendo 3ds reviews of nintendo dsi were generally positive although ign and bit tech decried console s lack of exclusive software and removal of gba cartridge slot its added functionality caused many journalists to recommend it to those who had not purchased a previous ds model numerous critics were disappointed with limited resolution of dsi s cameras though others such as ars technica and gamespot agreed they were adequate for handheld s display cnet and pcworld considered dsi shop to be most important buying incentive for current ds owners some critics believed dsi xl was not an essential upgrade gamepro and wired uk on other hand praised dsi xl s larger screens for improving gaming experience and revitalizing older ds games development thumb kuwahara discussed dsi s creation at 2009 game developers conference alt a man stands behind a podium talking to audience next to him is a projection screen displaying a presentation program slide development of nintendo dsi started at end of 2006 it was first time masato kuwahara of nintendo s development engineering department served as a hardware project leader work went at a quick pace to meet deadlines his team had to devise a theme for new ds in time for a late december presentation and by february 2007 most specifications for a chipset had to be completed kuwahara reported that his team had difficulty determining potential market for handheld during design process he said of their goal we have to be able to sell console on its own without games at launch it also has to be able to meld into already existing ds market console s digital cameras were considered early in development nintendo president and chief executive officer satoru iwata described touchscreen as nintendo ds s sense of touch and microphone as its ears a co worker suggested that it should have eyes kuwahara s team originally wanted one camera with a swivel mechanism but this was abandoned due to concerns of reliability cost and need of a thicker console owing to consumer demand nintendo also improved handhelds volume and audio quality and made it slimmer with larger screens compared to nintendo ds lite however to improve portability without sacrificing durability gba cartridge slot present on earlier models was removed to compensate nintendo continued to support ds lite as long as there was consumer demand for it dsi s size was changed midway through development delaying its release its original design included two ds game card slots because of demand from both fan communities and nintendo employees which consequently made it larger when console s designs were unveiled to nintendo entertainment analysis and development producers in october 2007 it was met with lukewarm reception due to its size however iwata and kuwahara s own hopes resulted in creation of a prototype a quick hands on investigation led them to abandon dual slot design which made dsi approximately slimmer ever since handheld s in company unveiling its internal designs were finished along with assembly and durability specifications iwata described having to resize console so close to manufacturing as being essentially same as making another handheld yui ehara designer of ds lite and dsi s original casing had to redesign revised case he advocated changing six speaker apertures as their circular perforations were redundant to rest of handheld s interface he believed that this alteration also signaled a clearer distinction between dsi and its predecessors while keeping unit neat and simple ehara hoped dsi s added features would not interfere with his desired iconic image of nintendo ds product line two rectangles one on top of other with each half containing another rectangle inside this model was publicly revealed at october 2008 nintendo conference in tokyo along with its japanese price and release date while ds product line s worldwide yearly sales figures consistently surpassed those of its primary market rival sony s playstation portable demand for it in japan was decreasing nintendo s launch of dsi was intended to stimulate sales company was less concerned with releasing dsi in other territories where ds lite market demand remained high development of a large ds lite model in 2007 eventually led to dsi xl known in japan as nintendo had designed a large ds lite model with screens compared to standard screens development of this new handheld advanced far enough that it could have begun mass production however iwata placed project on hold due to consumer demand for ds lite and wii he later pitched idea of simultaneously releasing large and small versions of dsi instead but nintendo s hardware team was incapable of developing two models concurrently after finishing work on dsi kuwahara started dsi xl project and became project leader dsi xl a dsi model with screens was announced on october 29 2009 various names for it were considered including dsi comfort dsi executive dsi premium dsi living and dsi deka japanese for large mario creator shigeru miyamoto insisted on dsi deka handheld has an improved viewing angle over its predecessor which allows onlookers to see screen s contents more easily this feature was absent from large ds lite model due to cost issues at time which also limited lcd screen size cost of lcd screens is determined

dsi received generally positive reviews critics praised many of console s changes to ds lite s aesthetic and functionality but complained that it launched with insufficient exclusive software ign s craig harris noted that dsi exclusive software library and dsi shop were lacking in content even after five months on japanese market jeff bakalar of cnet said that owners of original ds should consider buying a dsi but that its only incentive for ds lite owners was dsi shop pcworld new zealand s jan birkeland shared bakalar s opinion but believed that it was too early to judge quality of dsi shop software many critics were disappointed by removal of gba cartridge slot but some of them such as darren gladstone bit techs joe martin and ign s harris and lowe believed that it was a reasonable exchange for sd card support and dsi shop however bakalar stated we d gladly give up 4 millimeters of reduced thickness to be able to play any game boy advance game most reviewers criticized quality of its cameras particularly due to their resolution in comparison to contemporaneous mobile phones they considered them sufficient for dsi s screens however harris and lowe believed that camera s only use was to take silly pictures of yourself and others they complained about difficulty of taking photographs in low light environments and said that low light images were tinged green or blue opinions on dsi s photograph editing tools were varied bit techs martin and reid considered them to be a gimmick but bakalar and cliff edwards of businessweek thought otherwise edwards said that camera s use in gameplay was a new opportunity for developers martin did not think that concept would be widely adopted as he believed it to be a gimmick that would alienate ds lite owners eurogamer s tom bramwell speculated that dsi follows game watch and game boy creator gunpei yokoi s philosophy of using dated technology developers are familiar with to introduce new game design concepts that are inexpensive enough for mass production at a profit he argued its features are designed to briefly entertain early adopters while encouraging developers to consider it as an alternative of ds lite to build an attractive game library for long term because of dsi s additions to ds lite design critics recommended console to those who had not purchased a previous ds model pete metzger of los angeles times considered dsi to be more like version 2 5 than a total reboot but called its new features worthwhile additions to an already great product gladstone gave dsi a score of 75 100 and said that nintendo puts in smart nips and tucks to its already svelte handheld while adding a raft of useful multimedia features harris and lowe defined console s hardware redesign as evolutionary rather than revolutionary after dsi was unveiled goldman sachs analyst matthew j fassler called dsi shop a tangible early threat to big box stores and retailers martin believed that cameras and dsi shop did not justify purchasing dsi at launch but in line with general consensus saw potential in future software for console douglas rankine of wired uk and mckinley noble of gamepro thought previously existing nintendo ds games were revitalized with nintendo dsi xl s larger screens games like scribblenauts and world ends with you benefited from increased touchscreen precision and increased legibility of text respectively cvg s mike jackson argued that bigger screens which made its unchanged resolution would probably be less noticeable to older demographic for which xl is undoubtedly designed however jackson and ign s scott lowe and chris burke agreed its clear and vivid colors considerably compensated for its unchanged resolution carol of pc magazine thought families looking to share a handheld between members should consider a dsi xl but larger screens were not enough of an incentive for current dsi owners to upgrade lowe burke jackson and bakalar concluded larger dsi model is not an essential upgrade jackson explained if you tend not to carry it out with you and only ever tend to use it at home then dsi xl is better choice see also game boy micro second
