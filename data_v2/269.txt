convention on modern liberty faulks wrote novel partly because he felt that first world war had not been discussed enough in both literary and historical contexts reflecting on novel twenty years later faulks felt that published version did not fully do justice to experience of war it did not provide readers with a full appreciation of soldiers physical experience and perhaps more importantly a philosophical understanding of what it meant to be part of first genocidal event of century one that made others imaginable because faulks felt that much of extant world war i literature was deeply influenced by world war ii literature he deliberately avoided research with secondary documents such as historical monographs instead focusing on veteran interviews and period primary sources novel

her father and aunt jeanne irene a colleague of elizabeth bob irene s husband he offers to translate code used in stephen wraysford s war diaries for elizabeth themes recovering history novel deals explicitly with contemporary act of recovering memory of wwi and compiling contemporary understanding of those narratives a function common to works of historiographic metafiction like pat barker s regeneration trilogy a s byatt s possession and ian mcewan s atonement literary scholar jerome de groot calls birdsong one of first novels of its kind creating a trend in 1990s of literary fiction rethinking and reflecting on world wars and their historical legacy michael gorra a professor of english literature argues that faulks seeks to demonstrate that past can be recovered its code can be broken it can be used to add meaning to contemporary life its limitations can be overcome and its promises fulfilled because we know it can heal deliberate hiding of stephen s stories remaining silent to his family after war s end and encoding his journals mirrors actual loss of record and stories from veterans in post war britain elizabeth s search for that history is a process of recovering that memory in order to gain a greater emotional relationships with her grandfather to whom she had never felt connected writing in british medical journal medical doctor paul slade described reading about this investigation of another person s history to illuminate how superficial his own patient histories practice had been gorra described novel s split into parallel narratives as critical fault in reading experience of novel for de groot however split structure provides one of most sophisticated elements of novel de groot writes that benson s investigation of personal history allows faulks to examine difference between two perspectives on memory highlighting unknowability of horror of war and of history more generally trauma thumb death surrounded british soldiers on front line often to point of breaking their psychological endurance faulks explores this historical trauma throughout novel painting by c r w nevinson 1917 like other novels documenting wwi shock and trauma of death is embedded throughout book s depiction of war john mullen reviewing book for guardian described depictions of battle of somme particularly brutal according to scholar faulks treats war as a way to test human endurance and explore effect of carnage on psyche a reviewer for kirkus reviews also highlighted this theme writing that war here is faulks s real subject his stories of destroyed lives however wrenching only throwing its horror into greater relief and making it more unbearable contemporary historian simon describes novel alongside barker s regeneration as an exemplar of contemporary fiction which uses experience of world war i trenches to examine more contemporary understandings of ptsd de groot argues that this reinvestigation of a traumatic history mirrors a growing interest among both literary authors and historians in trauma as a thematic subject historian ross j wilson noted that this reinvestigation of traumas of world wars revisits and revives experience of trauma within contemporary culture faulks uses both different narrators and different narrative perspectives first third and omniscient on death in trenches to explore trauma of death in numerous and challenging ways for mullen this gives effect of t he novelist painfully ing reader s emotions style novel frequently changes narrative perspectives using a significant amount of interior monologue direct speech and dramatic irony though employing an omniscient narrator who occasionally describes events from a broad perspective novel tends to shadow a handful of characters closely principally stephen wraysford isabelle michael weir jack firebrace and elizabeth benson pat wheeler a scholar of literature describes narrative style as both naturalistic and realistic and very much in manner of nineteenth century writers faulks cites as literary influences wheeler notes emile zola charles dickens and george gissing among these wheeler emphasizes that naturalistic tendencies of narrative allow treatment of war setting without an idealization of human parts of narrative consistently reviews emphasize novel s imagery of battle experience in and amongst trenches for slade novel produces a vivid and traumatizing description of sights and sounds of life and death in and under trenches principal cause of this he says is pure fury and intensity of imagery created page after page reception birdsong is one of faulks s best received works of fiction both by public and amongst reviewers british press offered considerable praise with positive reviews from today guardian observer daily mail mail on sunday sunday express sunday telegraph times literary supplement spectator and scotsman american and other international press reviews were similarly positive novel s popular reception was similarly positive birdsong came 13th in a 2003 bbc survey called big read which aimed to find britain s favourite book it received an also mentioned credit in observer 2005 poll of

figures reviews of novel often focus on fluid reading experience as well as novel s effective treatment of real people within trauma of war gorra describes novel as mostly a strong wwi novel characterising it as superb with prose that is spare and precise review published in kirkus reviews was glowing once more faulks shows his unparalleled strengths as a writer of plain human life and high high compassion a wonderful book ringing with truth consistently one of greatest critiques of novel concerns its 1970s plot line for example gorra found that addition of a parallel narrative ran into problems especially concerning elizabeth benson whom he stopped believing in as a character unlike other reviewers critic sarah belo did not question historical investigation plot but depiction of elizabeth s experience as a 1970s woman in england on other hand almost all of reviewers describe novel s war sections as excellently written for example review in los angeles times called sections so powerful as to be almost unbearable novel has been favourably compared to other world war i and ii novels including all quiet on western front young lions and war and remembrance gorra described novel as even more original than barker s ghost road and rest of her regeneration trilogy kate saunders reviewing birdsong for sunday times praised novel and described it as without political cynicism that colours more modern treatments of this catastrophe reviewers have also compared novel to other literary works for example for one critic lead up to somme was as persuasive as scene in henry v before battle of agincourt while novelist suzanne ruta writes that faulks creates characters with a similar depth to those in thomas hardy novels adaptations birdsong was adapted as a radio drama of same title in 1997 and as a stage play in 2010 play adaptation was first directed by trevor nunn at comedy theatre in london in 2012 it was adapted as a two part television drama for bbc production starred eddie redmayne as stephen wraysford and clemence poesy as isabelle azaire and was directed by philip martin based on a screenplay by abi morgan historian edward madigan favourably compared television adaptation to steven spielberg s war horse as a successful evocation of experience of world war i trenches in both 2013 and 2014 faulks indicated that a feature film adaptation was in
