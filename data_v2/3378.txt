honest services fraud is a crime defined in federal mail and wire fraud statute added by united states congress in 1988 which states for purposes of this chapter term scheme or artifice to defraud includes a scheme or artifice to deprive another of intangible right of honest services statute has been applied by federal prosecutors in cases of public corruption as well as in cases in which private individuals breached a fiduciary duty to another in former courts have been divided on question of whether a state law violation is necessary for honest services fraud to have occurred in latter courts have taken differing approaches to determining whether a private individual has committed honest services fraud a test based on reasonably foreseeable economic harm and a test based on materiality statute which has been a target of criticism was given a narrow construction by supreme court of united states in case of skilling v united states 2010 in order to avoid finding statute to be unconstitutionally vague court interpreted statute to cover only fraudulent schemes to deprive another of honest services through bribes or kickbacks supplied by a third party who ha s not been deceived skilling v united states 130 s ct 2896 history and case law since at least 1941 particularly in 1970s and 1980s and prior to 1987 courts had interpreted mail fraud and wire fraud statutes as criminalizing not only schemes to defraud victims of money and property but also schemes to defraud victims of intangible rights such as honest services of a public official ninth circuit joins other circuits in ruling that honest services fraud conviction of a public official does not require a violation of state law martindale com in 1987 supreme court of united states ruled in mcnally v united states that mail fraud and wire fraud statutes pertained strictly to schemes to defraud victims of tangible property including money in 1988 congress enacted a new law that specifically criminalized schemes to defraud victims of intangible right of honest services meaning of honest services in public corruption honest services fraud is generally more easily proven in public sphere than in private because honest services fraud by public officials can include most unethical conduct whereas honest services fraud by private individuals only includes some unethical conduct federal courts have generally recognized two main areas of public sector honest service fraud bribery direct or indirect where a public official was paid in some way for a particular decision or action and failure to disclose a conflict of interest resulting in personal gain necessity or lack thereof of state law violations in 1997 united states court of appeals for fifth circuit decided in united states v brumley that in order for a state official to have committed honest services fraud he or she must have violated state statute defining services which were owed to employer state we find nothing to suggest that congress was attempting in ss 1346 to garner to federal government right to impose upon states a federal vision of appropriate services to establish in other words an ethical regime for state employees such a taking of power would sorely tax separation of powers and erode our federalist structure under most natural reading of statute a federal prosecutor must prove that conduct of a state official breached a duty respecting provision of services owed to official s employer under state law stated directly official must act or fail to act contrary to requirements of his job under state law this means that if official does all that is required under state law alleging that services were not otherwise done honestly does not charge a violation of mail fraud statute however first fourth ninth and eleventh circuit courts have all held that federal statute does not limit meaning of honest services to violations of state law as ninth circuit decided in united states v weyhrauch in 2008 because laws governing official conduct differ from state to state conditioning mail fraud convictions on state law means that conduct in one state might violate mail fraud statute whereas identical conduct in a neighboring state would not congress has given no indication it intended criminality of official conduct under federal law to depend on geography defendant in that case bruce weyhrauch appealed that decision to united states supreme court which ruled in his favor remanding case back to ninth circuit where federal charges were eventually dropped intent to defraud and personal benefit in 1997 united states court of appeals for first circuit set a key limit on honest services fraud in united states v czubinski ruling that a mere workplace violation does not constitute fraud without evidence of depriving employer of property in some way richard czubinski was employed in massachusetts by internal revenue service when in 1992 he violated irs rules by carrying out several unauthorized searches of irs database and accessing files outside of course of his official duties in 1995 he was convicted of wire fraud defrauding irs of property and public of his honest services and computer fraud appellate court reversed honest services fraud conviction on basis that czubinski s actions did not amount to anything more than a workplace violation warranting no more than a dismissal czubinski was not bribed or otherwise influenced in any public decisionmaking capacity nor did he embezzle funds he did not receive nor can it be found that he intended to receive any tangible benefit conclusive consideration is that government simply did not prove that czubinski deprived or intended to deprive public or his employer of their right to his honest services although he clearly committed wrongdoing in searching confidential information there is no suggestion that he failed to carry out his official tasks adequately or intended to do so czubinski s other convictions were also reversed meaning of honest services in private fiduciary relationships although law is most often applied to corrupt public officials several federal courts have upheld honest services fraud convictions of private individuals who breached a fiduciary duty to another such as an employer generally federal circuit courts have adhered to one of two approaches when dealing with honest services fraud cases one reasonably foreseeable economic harm test requires that defendant intentionally breached his fiduciary duty and foresaw or reasonably should have foreseen that his actions could cause economic harm to his victim other materiality test requires that defendant possessed a fraudulent intent and made any misrepresentation that has natural tendency to influence or is capable of influencing victim to change his behavior reasonably foreseeable economic harm test in 1997 united states court of appeals for sixth circuit held in united states v frost that private individuals could be also convicted of honest services fraud two professors at university of tennessee space institute walter frost and robert eugene turner were also president and vice president respectively of fwg associates a private atmospheric science research firm frost and turner gave fwg reports to two of their students one a doctoral candidate employed by department of army and one a master s degree candidate employed by nasa allowing them to plagiarize an overwhelming majority of reports for their respective dissertations they also allowed another doctoral candidate employed by nasa to submit a dissertation which was mostly written by one of their employees at fwg their aim was to secure federal contracts with agencies employing these students all three students received their degrees facilitated by frost and turner in addition to many other charges frost and turner were convicted of three counts of mail fraud for defrauding university of tennessee of their honest services as employees on appeal frost and turner argued that ss 1346 did not apply to them because they were not public servants court disagreed ruling that private individuals such as frost and turner may commit mail fraud by breaching a fiduciary duty and thereby depriving person or entity to which duty is owed of intangible right to honest services of that individual in 1998 united states court of appeals for d c circuit upheld wire fraud conviction of sun diamond growers of california for defrauding its hired public relations firm of honest services of one of its agents james h lake in order to curry favor with united states secretary of agriculture mike espy corporation s vice president for corporate affairs richard douglas had acted in scheme in such a manner that potentially could have caused economic harm to public relations firm tarnishing its reputation by engaging lake in illegal activity he and lake had illegally funneled contributions to a congressional candidate espy s brother sun diamond argued that those actions could not be criminal because there was no intent to do economic harm to firm however court ruled that an intent to do economic harm was not necessary to have committed wire fraud affirming a pre mcnally decision in light of 1988 statute in private sector context ss 1346 poses special risks every material act of dishonesty by an employee deprives employer of that worker s honest services yet not every such act is converted into a federal crime by mere use of mails or interstate phone system aware of risk that federal criminal liability could we held in lemire that not every breach of a fiduciary duty works a criminal fraud rather t here must be a failure to disclose something which in knowledge or contemplation of employee poses an independent business risk to employer sun diamond appears to confuse requirement of an intent to defraud with a requirement of intent to cause economic harm in 1999 united states court of appeals for eleventh circuit adopted a similar interpretation in united states v devegter michael devegter was a financial advisor hired by fulton county georgia to craft a professional recommendation of best underwriter for county to hire devegter accepted a payment of about 42 000 from richard poirier in exchange for manipulating report to influence fulton county into hiring poirier s investment banking firm for underwriter job devegter and poirier were both indicted for conspiracy and wire fraud with latter including charges under honest services statute district court dismissed honest services charges for lack of evidence before trial began government appealed court agreed with government that there was sufficient evidence alleged in indictment for defendants to be charged with honest services fraud because allegations showed a breach of fiduciary duty and an intent to defraud in such a manner that reasonably foreseeable economic harm to fulton county was a consequence of scheme in 2001 united states court of appeals for fourth circuit recognized that there were two different tests that other circuit courts had generally used to determine whether honest services fraud had been committed in united states v vinyard it concluded that reasonably foreseeable economic harm test was superior because it was based on employee intent and not employer response and applied that test to case at hand defendant in case michael vinyard had been convicted in united states district court for district of south carolina of fourteen counts of mail fraud and twelve counts of money laundering his brother james vinyard was an employee of sunoco products corporation who was charged with finding an independent broker to research recycled resins for their manufacture of plastic bags brothers instead created their own brokerage charles stewart enterprises incorporated in state of iowa and misrepresented it to sunoco as an legitimate independent firm that was supplying recycled resins at lowest possible price they purchased recycled resins from plastic vendors and marking up price sold them to sunoco which eventually yielded 2 8 million in profits brothers funneled these profits from cse to themselves through another entity in order to conceal their involvement with cse on their tax returns when brothers were eventually indicted for mail fraud and money laundering james vinyard pleaded guilty and testified against his brother michael vinyard appealed arguing that his conviction of honest services fraud defrauding sunoco of honest services of his brother their employee was wrongful because he did not cause harm nor did he intend to cause economic harm to victim sunoco upholding his conviction court rejected this argument reasonably foreseeable harm test is met whenever at time of fraud scheme employee could foresee that scheme potentially might be detrimental to employer s economic well being furthermore concept of economic risk embraces idea of risk to future opportunities for savings or profit focus on employer s wellbeing encompasses both long term and short term health of business whether risk materializes or not is irrelevant point is that employee has no right to endanger employer s financial health or jeopardize employer s long term prospects through self dealing therefore so long as employee could have reasonably foreseen risk to which he was exposing employer requirements of ss 1346 will have been met in 2006 united states court of appeals for ninth circuit treated issue of whether private defendants could be prosecuted under ss 1346 as settled law citing numerous other circuits which had affirmed practice in case united states v williams defendant john anthony williams was an oregon insurance salesman who had sold several annuities to an elderly rancher named loyd stubbs when stubbs liquidated his annuities williams deposited resulting funds in a joint bank account he had opened in his and stubbs names williams proceeded to make massive cash withdrawals from account depositing money in his own personal account and spending much of it he also wired money to personal bank accounts he had in belize and louisiana williams was convicted of four counts of wire fraud three counts of mail fraud three counts of money laundering and one count of foreign transportation of stolen money fraud charges stemmed from schemes to defraud stubbs of money and of williams honest services as his financial advisor on appeal williams argued that ss 1346 did not apply to private commerce court disagreed and citing previous case law ruled that within a fiduciary relationship statute applied materiality test in 1996 united states court of appeals for fifth circuit laid out materiality test in its decision in united states v gray kevin gray gary thomas and troy drummond were three members of men s basketball coaching staff at baylor university in texas these coaches helped five players recruited from two year colleges to obtain credits required for eligibility and possibly scholarships by providing these students with written course work or answers to correspondence exams which were then sent to sponsoring schools as students work they were convicted of conspiracy mail fraud and wire fraud fraud charges stemmed from schemes to deprive baylor university of both property in form of scholarships and coaches honest services as baylor employees court upheld convictions affirming honest services fraud convictions on basis that coaches made material misrepresentations a breach of fiduciary duty can constitute illegal fraud only when there is some detriment to employer detriment can be a deprivation of an employee s faithful and honest services if a violation of employee s duty to disclose material information is involved materiality exists whenever an employee has reason to believe information would lead a reasonable employer to change its business conduct information withheld i e coaches cheating scheme was material because baylor did not get quality student it expected further appellants failure to disclose scheme to baylor was material as baylor might have been able to recruit other qualified eligible students to play basketball instead once scheme was suspected baylor was forced to institute a costly investigation and players under suspicion were withheld from competition it is quite reasonable to believe that baylor would have changed its business conduct had it known of cheating scheme in 1997 united states court of appeals for tenth circuit also applied materiality test in its decision in united states v cochran robert m cochran was a bond underwriter in oklahoma who was convicted of five counts of wire fraud two counts of money laundering and one count of interstate transportation of stolen property three of wire fraud counts for which cochran was convicted were honest services fraud cochran s firm stifel nicolaus company served as managing underwriter when ssm healthcare system a non profit corporation operating several hospitals and nursing homes issued more than 265 million of tax exempt bonds sakura global capital bid 400 000 to provide ssm with a forward supply contract however sgc subsequently made a secret payment of 100 000 to cochran s firm over course of three wire transmissions thus cochran supposedly deprived ssm and its bondholders of his honest services appellate court reversed his conviction deciding that government did not provide sufficient evidence that cochran had actually defrauded ssm or its bondholders of his honest services applying materiality test though stifel misrepresented that sgc would not pay an additional fee to stifel for forward supply contract this information resulted in no actual or potential harm to ssm no evidence independent of alleged scheme suggests in any way that mr cochran sought to harm ssm or its bondholders moreover we know not from this record how ssm would have changed its conduct had disclosure been made in 1999 united states court of appeals for eighth circuit diverged from d c circuit s sun diamond ruling in its decision in united states v pennington donald b pennington was president of harvest foods a grocery store chain in eastern arkansas when that company contracted with a food broker and a consultant john oldner to negotiate deals between it and its suppliers broker and consultant both funneled a portion of their money from harvest foods and its supplier to pennington through a sham corporation capitol city marketing as kickbacks pennington was convicted of money laundering and mail fraud in his appeal he contended that there was insufficient evidence to convict him because government had failed to show that he had an intent to defraud harvest foods of his honest services as its president court upheld conviction stating that there was sufficient evidence that his actions were a breach of his duty as a fiduciary of harvest foods to disclose his material interest in their contracts with oldner and broker however court also went further and required and found intent to economically harm pennington and oldner correctly assert that when dealing with business transactions in private sector a mere breach of fiduciary or employee duty may not be sufficient to deprive a client or corporation of honest services for purposes of ss 1346 to be guilty of mail fraud defendants must also cause or intend to cause actual harm or injury and in most business contexts that means financial or economic harm however proof of intent to harm may be inferred from willful non disclosure by a fiduciary such as a corporate officer of material information he has a duty to disclose in 2003 united states court of appeals for second circuit like fourth circuit in vinyard noted existence of two tests but unlike fourth circuit it opted to use materiality test describing it as arising out of fundamental principles of law of fraud and critiquing alternative as designed simply to limit scope of law it applied this test to case at hand united states v rybicki defendants were two personal injury lawyers thomas rybicki and fredric grae in state of new york both were convicted of twenty counts of mail fraud two counts of wire fraud and one count of conspiracy fraud charges pertained to a scheme to make illegal payments to insurance claims adjusters with intent of inducing adjusters to expedite settlement of certain claims rybicki and grae made such payments in at least twenty cases as acceptance of such payments by adjusters was against insurance companies policies rybicki and grae had defrauded those insurance companies of honest services of their employees such was basis for successful fraud prosecution court affirmed conviction determining that all of necessary elements for crime of honest services fraud to have occurred were present including material misrepresentation court defined crime as follows phrase scheme or artifice to defraud by ing another of intangible right of honest services in private sector context means a scheme or artifice to use mails or wires to enable an officer or employee of a private entity or a person in a relationship that gives rise to a duty of loyalty comparable to that owed by employees to employers purporting to act for and in interests of his or her employer or of other person to whom duty of loyalty is owed secretly to act in his or her or defendant s own interests instead accompanied by a material misrepresentation made or omission of information disclosed to employer or other person usage and criticism statute grants jurisdiction to federal government to prosecute local state and federal officials it is frequently used to fight public corruption because it is easier to prove than bribery or extortion term honest services is broad and open to jury interpretation according to several legal experts prosecutions under 1970 racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico frequently use violations of honest services statute as mail and wire fraud are predicate acts of racketeering therefore two mailings or wire transmissions in execution of honest services fraud can form a pattern of racketeering activity prosecutions for honest services fraud that do not involve public corruption generally involve corporate crime although line between torts and crimes in such cases is considered murky and unclear law is reportedly a favorite of federal prosecutors because language of statute is vague enough to be applied to corrupt political officials unethical or criminal activities when they do not fall into a specific category such as bribery or extortion for similar reasons defense attorneys dislike law viewing it as a poorly defined law that can be used by prosecutors to convert any kind of unethical behavior into a federal crime nevertheless prosecutors must still prove all elements of mail fraud or wire fraud in a case regarding a scheme to defraud of honest services late u s supreme court justice antonin scalia criticized statute stating that clause was so poorly defined that it could be basis for prosecuting a mayor for using prestige of his office to get a table at a restaurant without a reservation sorich v united states 555 u s 1204 1205 2009 scalia j dissenting in perfect villain john mccain and demonization of lobbyist jack abramoff investigative journalist gary s argued that honest services fraud is so vague as to be unconstitutional and that prosecutors abused it as a tool to increase their conviction rates bennett l a professor at pace university law school similarly has contended that law is not only subject to abuse but has been abused case of former alabama governor don siegelman is often cited as an example of possible prosecutorial misconduct and abuse of honest services law many interest groups oppose usage of honest services law including conservative united states chamber of commerce and washington legal foundation as well as more liberal national association of criminal defense lawyers one notable proponent of law is citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington recent notable prosecutions several notable figures have been charged with or convicted of honest services fraud washington lobbyist jack abramoff pleaded guilty in 2006 to honest
