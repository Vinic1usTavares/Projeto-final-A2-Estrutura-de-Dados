apollo 9 was a march 1969 human spaceflight third in nasa s apollo program flown in low earth orbit it was second crewed apollo mission to be launched by a saturn v rocket and first flight of full apollo spacecraft command and service module csm with lunar module lm mission was flown to qualify lm for lunar orbit operations by demonstrating its descent and ascent propulsion systems showing that its crew could fly it independently then rendezvous and dock with csm again as would be required for first crewed lunar landing other objectives of flight included firing lm descent engine to propel spacecraft stack as a backup mode as would be required on apollo 13 mission and use of portable life support system backpack outside of lm cabin three person crew consisted of commander james mcdivitt command module pilot david scott and lunar module pilot rusty schweickart during ten day mission they tested systems and procedures critical to landing on moon including lm engines backpack life support systems navigation systems and docking maneuvers after launching on march 3 1969 crew performed first crewed flight of a lunar module first docking and extraction of same one two person spacewalk eva and second docking of two crewed spacecraft two months after soviets performed a spacewalk crew transfer between and mission concluded on march 13 and was a complete success it proved lm worthy of crewed spaceflight setting stage for dress rehearsal for lunar landing apollo 10 before ultimate goal landing on moon mission background in april 1966 mcdivitt scott and schweickart were

go to lunar orbit without a lm until then apollo8 was dmission with apollo9 e mission testing in medium earth orbit after nasa approved sending apollo8 to moon while making apollo9 dmission slayton offered mcdivitt opportunity to stay with apollo8 and thus go to lunar orbit mcdivitt turned it down on behalf of his crew preferring to stay with dmission now apollo9 apollo7 went well and crews were switched crew swap also affected who would be first astronauts to land on moon for when crews for apollo8 and9 were swapped so were backup crews since rule of thumb was for backup crews to fly as

when it was presented to him by scott after gemini 3 craft was dubbed molly brown by grissom nasa forbade naming spacecraft fact that during apollo9 mission csm and lm would separate and need different call signs caused apollo9 astronauts to push for a change in simulations they began to refer to csm as gumdrop a name inspired by cm s appearance while in blue protective wrapping in which

vibration and astronauts were surprised to be pushed forward when saturn v s first stage stopped firing before its second stage took over when they were pushed back into their couches each of first two stages slightly underperformed a deficiency made up more or less by s ivb third stage once third stage cut out at 00 11 04 7 into mission apollo9 had entered a parking orbit of 102 3 by 103 9

spacecraft would separate from rocket if it was not possible to make such a docking lunar landing could not take place it was scott s responsibility to fly csm which he did to a successful docking as probe and drogue docking assembly worked properly after mcdivitt and schweickart inspected tunnel connecting cm and lm assembled spacecraft separated from s ivb next task was to demonstrate that two docked spacecraft could be maneuvered by one engine five second burn took place at 05 59 01 1 into mission accomplished with sm s service propulsion system sps after which scott excitedly reported lm was still in place thereafter s ivb was fired again and stage was sent into solar orbit from 09 00 00 to 19 30 00 a sleep period was scheduled astronauts slept well but complained of being woken by non english transmissions scott theorized that they were possibly in chinese highlight of second day in orbit march 4 was three sps burns initial burn at 22 12 04 1 lasted 110 seconds and including swiveling or engine to test whether autopilot could dampen induced oscillations which it did within five seconds two more sps burns followed lightening sm s fuel load spacecraft and engine passed every test sometimes proving more robust than expected performance of csm in remaining stable while engine was being gimbaled would in 1972 help cause mcdivitt by then manager of apollo spacecraft program to approve continuation of apollo 16 when its csm was experiencing an unstable gimbal after separation from its lm in lunar orbit flight plan for third day in space was to have commander and lunar module pilot enter lm to check out its systems and use its descent engine to move entire spacecraft descent engine was backup to sps ability to use it in this manner would prove critical on apollo 13 flight plan was thrown into question when schweickart suffering from space adaptation sickness vomited while mcdivitt felt queasy as well they had been avoiding sudden physical motions but contortion like maneuvers to don their space suits for lm checkout caused them to feel ill experience would teach doctors enough about sickness to have astronauts avoid it on lunar landings but at time schweickart feared his vomiting might endanger kennedy s goal they were well enough to continue with day s plan and entered lm thus transferring between vehicles for first time in us space

for schweickart to exit hatch on lm and make his way along outside of spacecraft to cm s hatch where scott would stand by to assist demonstrating that this could be done in event of an emergency schweickart was to wear life support backpack or plss to be worn on lunar surface evas this was only eva scheduled before lunar landing and thus only opportunity to test plss in space mcdivitt initially cancelled eva due to schweickart s condition but with lunar module pilot feeling better decided to allow him to exit lm and once he was there to move around lm s exterior using handholds scott stood in cm s hatch both men photographed each other and retrieved experiments from exterior of their vehicles schweickart found moving around easier than it had been in simulations both he and scott were confident that schweickart could have completed exterior transfer if called upon to do so but considered it unnecessary brooks et al 1979 chapter 12 4 mission and men during eva schweickart

module and command module lunar module lacked capability to return astronauts to earth this was first time space travelers had flown in a vehicle that could not take them home mcdivitt and schweickart entered lm early having obtained permission to do so without wearing their helmets and gloves making it easier to set up lm when scott in gumdrop pushed button to release lm it initially hung on latches at end of docking probe but he hit button again and spider was released after spending about 45 minutes near gumdrop spider went into a slightly higher orbit meaning that over time two craft would separate with gumdrop ahead over next hours mcdivitt fired lm s descent engine at several throttle settings by end of day lm was thoroughly test flown at a distance of spider fired to lower its orbit and thus begin to catch up with gumdrop a process that would take over two hours and descent stage was jettisoned thumb right alt inside view of cm interior of gumdrop approach and rendezvous

major events had been scheduled for first days so that they would be accomplished if flight needed to be ended early remaining days in orbit were to be conducted at a more leisurely pace with main goals of mission accomplished hatch window was used for special photography of earth using four identical hasselblad cameras coupled together and using film sensitive to different parts of electromagnetic spectrum such photography allowed different features of earth s surface to appear for example tracking of water pollution as it exits mouths of rivers into sea and highlighting of agricultural areas using infrared camera system was a prototype and would pave way for earth resources technology satellite predecessor to landsat series photography was successful as ample time in orbit meant crew could wait to allow cloud cover to pass and would inform skylab s mission planning scott used a sextant to track landmarks on earth and turned instrument to skies to observe planet jupiter practicing navigation techniques that were to be used on later missions crew was able to track pegasus 3 satellite launched in 1965 as well as ascent stage of spider sixth burn of sps engine

extending gumdrop s orbital lifetime it shifted apogee of orbit to southern hemisphere allowing for a longer free fall time to entry when apollo9 returned to earth burn was extended to allow for testing of gaging system which had been behaving anomalously during earlier sps burns once it was accomplished apollo9 s rcs thrusters could have returned it to earth and still allowed it to land in
