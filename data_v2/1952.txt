erlewine of allmusic gave stripped mixes two out of five stars stating that he felt that logic of what is left behind doesn t quite make sense pointing out that i want you back and abc have no drums and feel a little tipsy and top heavy ben and with a child s heart have echoes of strings in background making it hard to identify songs as being stripped he added that since genius lies in arrangements having so much of arrangement absent means that music just sounds awkward and incomplete as if it was waiting for final round of mixing and overdubs erlewine s overall opinion on album was if purpose of this disc is to draw attention to michael s vocals stripped mixes does its job but just because his voice is pushed front and center does not mean that this is best place to appreciate his genius a writer for pr newswire praised album describing it as showcasing jackson s vocal talent and viewed stripped mixes as shining a bright fresh light on jackson s early career as both a solo artist and with his brothers in jackson 5 natalie salvo of com au commented that mix of ain t no sunshine made album personally worth buying she added that music does what it s supposed to do which was evoking right mood but not being overly showy despite praise she did state that album could be clinically looked at as an element of bad taste from a greedy record company and noted that it was difficult to stop yourself being overcome with cynicism towards this album jeff of tone publications described all of album s tracks as being quite strong and added that regardless of your interest in michael jackson stripped mixes is a disc you should have in your collection because it offers a rare look at classic material by jackson when he was just beginning his career track listing
