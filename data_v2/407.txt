harald sigurdsson also known as harald of norway 25 september 1066 and given epithet hardrada modern norwegian roughly translated as stern counsel or hard ruler in sagas det store norske leksikon great norwegian encyclopedia was king of norway as harald iii from 1046 to 1066 in addition he unsuccessfully claimed danish throne until 1064 and english throne in 1066 before becoming king harald had spent around fifteen years in exile as a mercenary and military commander in kievan rus and of varangian guard in byzantine empire when he was fifteen years old in 1030 harald fought in battle of stiklestad together with his half brother olaf haraldsson later saint olaf olaf sought to reclaim norwegian throne which he had lost to danish king cnut great two years prior in battle olaf and harald were defeated by forces loyal to cnut and harald was forced into exile to kievan rus sagas he thereafter spent some time in army of grand prince yaroslav wise eventually obtaining rank as a captain until he moved on to constantinople with his companions around 1034 in constantinople he soon rose to become commander of byzantine varangian guard and saw action on mediterranean sea in asia minor sicily possibly in holy land bulgaria and in constantinople itself where he became involved in imperial dynastic disputes harald amassed considerable wealth during his time in byzantine empire which he shipped to yaroslav in kievan rus for safekeeping he finally left byzantines in 1042 and arrived back in kievan rus in order to prepare his campaign of reclaiming norwegian throne possibly to harald s knowledge in his absence norwegian throne had been restored from danes to olaf s illegitimate son magnus good in 1046 harald joined forces with magnus s rival in denmark magnus had also become king of denmark pretender sweyn ii of denmark and started raiding danish coast magnus unwilling to fight his uncle agreed to share kingship with harald since harald in turn would share his wealth with him co rule ended abruptly next year as magnus died and harald thus became sole ruler of norway domestically harald crushed all local and regional opposition and outlined territorial unification of norway under a national governance harald s reign was probably one of relative peace and stability and he instituted a viable coin economy and foreign trade probably seeking to restore cnut s north sea empire harald also claimed danish throne and spent nearly every year until 1064 raiding danish coast and fighting his former ally sweyn although campaigns were successful he was never able to conquer denmark not long after harald had renounced his claim to denmark former earl of northumbria tostig godwinson brother of newly chosen but reigning not for long english king harold godwinson also known as harold of wessex pledged his allegiance to harald and invited him to claim english throne harald went along and invaded northern england with 10 000 troops and 300 longships in september 1066 raided coast and defeated english regional forces of northumbria and mercia in battle of fulford near york although initially successful harald was defeated and killed in an attack by harold godwinson s forces in battle of stamford bridge which wiped out almost his entire army modern historians have often considered harald s death which brought an end to his invasion as end of

sigurd syr sigurd was a petty king of ringerike and among strongest and wealthiest chieftains in uplands tjonn 2010 p 14 through his mother asta harald was youngest of king olaf ii of norway olaf haraldsson s later saint olaf three half brothers in his youth harald displayed traits of a typical rebel with big ambitions and admired olaf as his role model he thus differed from his two older brothers who were more similar to their father down to earth and mostly concerned with maintaining farm tjonn 2010 pp 15 16 icelandic sagas in particular snorri sturluson in heimskringla claim that sigurd like olaf s father was a great grandson of king harald fairhair in male line most modern scholars believe that ancestors attributed to harald hardrada s father along with other parts of fairhair genealogy are inventions reflecting political and social expectations of time of authors around two centuries after harald hardrada s lifetime rather than historical reality see for example

which seems odd considering that it would have provided significant legitimacy in connection with his claim to norwegian throne following a revolt in 1028 harald s brother olaf was forced into exile until he returned to norway in early 1030 on hearing news of olaf s planned return harald gathered 600 men from uplands to meet olaf and his men upon their arrival in east of norway after a friendly welcome olaf went on to gather an army and eventually fight in battle of stiklestad on 29 july 1030 in which harald took part on his brother s side tjonn 2010 pp 17 18 battle was part of an attempt to restore olaf to norwegian throne which had been captured by danish king cnut great canute battle resulted in defeat for brothers at hands of those norwegians who were loyal to cnut and olaf was killed while harald was badly wounded blondal benedikz 2007 p 54 harald was nonetheless remarked to have shown considerable military talent during battle devries 1999 p 25 exile in east to kievan rus after defeat at battle of stiklestad harald managed to escape with aid of rognvald brusason later earl of orkney to a remote farm in eastern norway he stayed there for some time to heal his wounds and thereafter possibly up to a month later journeyed north over mountains to sweden a year after battle of stiklestad harald arrived in kievan rus referred to in sagas as gardariki or hin he likely spent at least part of his time in town of staraya ladoga aldeigjuborg arriving there in first half of 1031 harald and his men were welcomed by grand prince yaroslav wise whose wife ingegerd was a distant relative of harald tjonn 2010 pp 21 1999 pp 25 26 badly in need of military leaders yaroslav recognised a military potential in harald and made him a captain of his forces devries 1999 p 26 harald s brother olaf haraldsson had previously been in exile to yaroslav following revolt in 1028 tjonn 2010 p 16 and morkinskinna says that yaroslav embraced harald first and foremost because he was brother of olaf tjonn 2010 p 25 harald took part in yaroslav s campaign against poles in 1031 and possibly also fought against other 1030s kievan enemies and rivals such as in estonia byzantines as well as pechenegs and other steppe nomad people devries 1999 p 27 in byzantine service after a few years in kievan rus harald and his force of around 500 men moved on south to constantinople capital of eastern roman empire later known as byzantine empire probably in 1033 or 1034 tjonn 2010 p 28 where they joined varangian guard although flateyjarbok maintains that harald at first sought to keep his royal identity a secret most sources agree that harald and his men s reputation was well known in east at time while varangian guard was primarily meant to function as emperor s bodyguard harald was found fighting on nearly every frontier of empire devries 1999 p 29 he first saw action in campaigns against arab pirates in mediterranean sea and then in inland towns in asia minor anatolia that had supported pirates by this time he had according to snorri sturluson become leader over all varangians by 1035 byzantines had pushed arabs out of asia minor to east and southeast and harald took part in campaigns that went as far east as tigris river and euphrates river in mesopotamia where according to his skald poet thjodolfr arnorsson recounted in sagas he participated in capture of eighty arab strongholds a number which historians blondal and benedikt benedikz see no particular reason to question although not holding independent command of an army as sagas imply it is not unlikely that king harald and varangians at times could have been sent off to capture a castle or town devries 1999 pp 29 benedikz 2007 pp 60 62 during first four years of reign of byzantine emperor michael iv paphlagonian harald probably also fought in campaigns against pechenegs blondal benedikz 2007 p 63 thumb near contemporary depiction of byzantine varangian guardsmen in an illumination from skylitzes chronicle thereafter harald is reported in sagas to have gone to jerusalem and fought in battles in area although sagas place this after his expedition to sicily historian kelly devries has questioned that chronology devries 1999 p 30 whether his trip was of a military or peaceful nature would depend on whether it took place before or after 1036 peace treaty between michael iv and muslim fatimid caliph ma ad al mustansir billah in reality caliph s mother originally a byzantine christian since caliph was a minor although it is considered unlikely to have been made before modern historians have speculated that harald may have been in a party sent to escort pilgrims to jerusalem possibly including members of imperial family following peace agreement as it was also agreed that byzantines were allowed to repair church of holy sepulchre furthermore this may in turn have presented harald with opportunities to fight against bandits who preyed on christian pilgrims devries 1999 pp 30 31tjonn 2010 p 43 in 1038 harald joined byzantines in their expedition to sicily devries 1999 p 31tjonn 2010 p 47 in george maniakes s sagas attempt to reconquer island from muslim saracens who had

102 after defeat harald and varangian guard were called back to constantinople following maniakes imprisonment by emperor and onset of other more pressing issues devries 1999 pp 31 32 harald and varangians were thereafter sent to fight in southeastern european frontier as balkan peninsula in bulgaria where they arrived in late 1041 there he fought in army of emperor michael iv in battle of ostrovo of 1041 campaign against bulgarian uprising led by peter delyan which later gained harald nickname bulgar burner by his skald tjonn 2010 pp 55 56 harald was not affected by maniakes conflict with emperor michael iv and received honours and respect upon his return to constantinople in a greek book written in 1070s strategikon of kekaumenos i e harald is said to have won favour of emperor blondal benedikz 2007 p 2004 p 2010 p 32 book says that byzantine emperor first appointed him manglabites possibly identified with title protospatharios a soldier of imperial guard after sicilian campaign bibikov 2004 p 1999 p 33 following campaign against bulgarians in which harald again served with distinction he received rank while at d amato page 8 varangian guard 988 1453 of spatharokandidatos identified by devries as a promotion to possibly third highest byzantine rank but by mikhail bibikov as a lesser rank than protospatharios that was ordinarily awarded to foreign allies to emperor strategikon indicates that ranks awarded to harald were rather low since harald reportedly was not angry for just having been appointed to manglabites or spatharokandidatos tjonn 2010 p 41 according to his skald tjodolv arnorsson harald had participated in eighteen greater battles during his byzantine service harald s favour at imperial court quickly declined after death of michael iv in december 1041 which was followed by conflicts between new emperor michael v and powerful empress zoe devries 1999 pp 33 34 during turmoil harald was arrested and imprisoned but sources disagree on grounds devries 1999 p 34 sagas state that harald was arrested for defrauding emperor of his treasure as well as for requesting 1999 pp 34 35 with an apparently fictional niece or granddaughter of zoe called maria his suit supposedly being turned down by empress because she wanted to marry harald herself william of malmesbury states that harald was arrested for defiling a noble woman while according to saxo grammaticus he was imprisoned for murder devries suggests that new emperor may have feared harald because of his loyalty to previous emperor sources also disagree on how harald got out of prison but he may have been helped by someone outside to escape in midst of revolt that had begun against new emperor while some of varangians helped guard emperor harald became leader of varangians who supported revolt emperor was in end dragged out of his sanctuary blinded and exiled to a monastery and sagas claim that it was harald himself who blinded michael v or at least claimed to have done so devries 1999 pp 35 38 back to kievan rus thumb left upright harald s wife elisiv of kiev daughter of yaroslav wise harald became extremely rich during his time in east and

5 25 sagas note that aside from significant spoils of battle he had retained he had participated three times in polutasvarf loosely translated as palace plunder a term which implies either pillaging of palace exchequer on death of emperor or perhaps disbursement of funds to varangians by new emperor in order to ensure their loyalty blondal benedikz 2007 pp 80 83 it is likely that money harald made while serving in constantinople allowed him to fund his claim for crown of norway devries 1999 p 39 if he participated in polutasvarf three times these occasions must have been deaths of romanos iii michael iv and michael v in which harald would have opportunities beyond his legitimate revenues to carry off immense wealth skaare 1995 p 45 after zoe had been restored to throne in june 1042 together with constantine ix harald requested to be allowed to return to norway although zoe refused to allow this harald managed to escape into bosphorus with two ships and some loyal followers

rus later in 1042 tjonn 2010 p 74 during his second stay there he married elisabeth referred to in scandinavian sources as daughter of yaroslav wise and granddaughter of swedish king olof shortly after harald s arrival in kiev yaroslav attacked constantinople and it is considered likely that harald provided him with valuable information about state of empire tjonn 2010 p 77 it is possible that marriage with elisiv had been agreed to already during harald s first time in rus or that they at least had been acquainted during his service in byzantine empire harald composed a love poem which included verse yet goddess in will not accept my gold rings henriksen 2011 whom snorri sturluson identifies with elisiv although morkinskinna claims that harald had to remind yaroslav of promised marriage when he returned to kiev devries 1999 pp 26 27 according to same source harald had spoken with yaroslav during his first time in rus requesting to marry elisiv only to be rejected because he was not yet wealthy enough tjonn 2010 p 27 it is in any case significant that harald was allowed to marry daughter of yaroslav since his other children were married to figures such as henry i of france andrew i of hungary and daughter of constantine ix king of norway return to scandinavia seeking to regain for himself kingdom lost by his half brother olaf haraldsson harald began his journey westwards in early 1045 departing from novgorod to staraya ladoga aldeigjuborg where he obtained a ship his journey went through lake ladoga down neva river and then into gulf of finland and baltic sea he arrived in sigtuna in sweden probably at end of 2010 p 83 or in early 1046 when he arrived in sweden according to skald tjodolv arnorsson his ship was unbalanced by its heavy load of gold in harald s absence throne of norway had been restored to magnus good an illegitimate son of olaf harald may actually have known this and it could have been reason why harald wanted to return to norway in first place blondal benedikz 2007 p 96 since cnut great s sons had chosen to abandon norway and instead fight over england and his sons and successors harold harefoot and harthacnut had died young magnus s position as king had been secured no domestic threats or insurrections are recorded to have occurred during his eleven year reign devries 1999 p 40 after death of harthacnut which had left danish throne vacant magnus had in addition been selected to be king of denmark and managed to defeat danish royal pretender sweyn estridsson devries 1999 pp 40 41 thumb right coin with legend rex generally held to date from magnus and harald s short co rule depicting magnus who had precedence 1865 p 24 but also speculated as harald s alone with magnus an epithet adopted after his death skaare 1995 p 46 having heard of sweyn s defeat by magnus harald met up with his fellow exile in sweden who was also his nephew as well as with swedish king jacob and three joined forces against magnus their first military exploit consisted of raiding danish coast in an effort to impress natives by demonstrating that magnus offered them no protection and thus leading them to submit to harald and sweyn learning about their actions magnus knew that their next target would be norway devries 1999 p 42 harald may have planned to be taken as king of his father s petty kingdom and thereafter claim rest of country tjonn 2010 p 94 in any case people were unwilling to turn against magnus and on hearing news of harald s schemes magnus abroad at time went home to norway with his entire army instead of going to war magnus s advisors recommended young king not fight his uncle and a compromise was reached in 1046 in which harald would rule norway not denmark jointly with magnus although magnus would have precedence notably harald also had to agree to share half of his wealth with magnus who at time was effectively bankrupt and badly in need of funds during their short co rule harald and magnus had separate courts and kept to themselves and their only recorded meetings nearly ended in physical clashes devries 1999 pp 43 2010 pp 95 102 in 1047 magnus and harald went to denmark with their forces later that year in jylland less than a year into their co rule magnus died without an heir before his death he had decided that sweyn was to inherit denmark and harald to inherit norway tjonn 2010 pp 102 103 on hearing news of magnus s death harald quickly gathered local leaders in norway and declared himself king of norway as well as of denmark devries 1999 pp 45 46 although magnus had appointed sweyn his successor as king of denmark harald immediately announced his plans to gather an army and oust his former ally from country in response army and chieftains headed by einar thambarskelfir opposed any plans of invading denmark although harald himself objected to bringing body of magnus back to norway norwegian army prepared to transport his body to nidaros now trondheim where they buried him next to saint olaf in late 1047 tjonn 2010 p 1999 p 57 einar an opponent of harald claimed that to follow magnus dead was better than to follow any other king alive invasions of denmark harald also wanted to re establish magnus s rule over denmark and in long term probably sought to restore cnut great s north sea empire in its entirety moseng et al 1999 p 81 while his first proposal to invade denmark fell through next year harald embarked on what would turn into constant warfare against sweyn from 1048 almost yearly until 1064 similar to his campaigns then together with sweyn against magnus s rule in denmark most of his campaigns against sweyn consisted of swift and violent raids on danish coasts in 1048 he plundered jutland and in 1049 he pillaged and burned hedeby at time most important danish trade center and one of best protected and most populous towns in scandinavia devries 1999 pp 56 58 hedeby as a civil town never recovered from harald s destruction and was left completely desolate when what remained was looted by slavic tribes in 1066 hjardar vike 2011 p 118 one of two conventional battles was set to be fought between two kings later same year but according to saxo grammaticus sweyn s smaller army was so frightened when approached by norwegians that they chose to jump in water trying to escape most drowned although harald was victorious in most of engagements he was never successful in occupying denmark devries 1999 pp 59 60 thumb left penny minted by harald with a on obverse used both by christians and in norse paganism it was used on coins in denmark by cnut great and his sons and harald probably adopted it as part of his claim to danish throne skaare 1995 pp 47 48 second more significant battle a naval encounter was battle of nisa on 9 august 1062 as harald had not been able to conquer denmark despite his raids he wanted to win a decisive victory over sweyn he eventually set out from norway with a great army and a fleet of around 300 ships sweyn had also prepared for battle which had been preassigned a time and place sweyn did not appear at agreed time and harald thus sent home his non professional soldiers which had made up half of his forces when dismissed ships were out of reach sweyn s fleet finally appeared possibly also with 300 ships battle resulted in great bloodshed as harald defeated danes 70 danish ships were reportedly left empty but many ships and men managed to escape including sweyn devries 1999 pp 61 65 during battle harald actively shot with his bow like most others in early phase of battle hjardar vike 2011 p 83 fatigue and huge cost of indecisive battles eventually led harald to seek peace with sweyn and in 1064 or 1065 according to morkinskinna two kings agreed on an unconditional peace agreement devries 1999 p 66 by agreement they retained their respective kingdoms with former boundaries and there would be no payments of reparations in subsequent winter of 1065 harald travelled through his realm and accused farmers of withholding taxes from him in response he acted with brutality and had people maimed and killed as a warning to those who disobeyed him harald maintained control of his nation through use of his hird a private standing army maintained by norwegian lords harald s contribution to strengthening of norway s monarchy was enforcement of a policy that only king could retain a hird thus centralising power away from local warlords ronald g norway new york praeger publishers 1972 79 domestic opposition according to historian knut helle harald completed first phase of what he has termed national territorial unification of norway moseng et al 2019 p 79 having forced his way to kingship harald would have to convince aristocracy that he was right person to rule norway alone to establish domestic alliances he married tora torbergsdatter of one of most powerful norwegian families tjonn 2010 pp 104 106 primary opposition to harald s rule would be descendants of haakon sigurdsson from powerful dynasty of earls of lade who had controlled northern norway and trondelag with much autonomy under norwegian king haakon had even ruled whole of norway nominally under danish king from 975 until 995 when he was killed during takeover by olaf tryggvasson even after haakon s death his offspring held a certain degree of sovereignty in north and by harald s early reign family was headed by einar thambarskelfir who was married to haakon s daughter while family had maintained good relations with magnus harald s absolutism and consolidation of kingship soon led to conflict with einar devries 1999 pp 51 2010 p 115 it was from his power struggle with norwegian aristocracy that harald got himself reputation that gave him nickname hardrada or hard ruler tjonn 2010 p 114 although relationship between harald and einar was poor from start confrontation did not occur before harald went north to his court in nidaros one time in nidaros einar arrived at harald s court and in a display of power was accompanied by eight or nine longships and almost five hundred men obviously seeking confrontation harald was not provoked by incident although sources differ on circumstances next event nonetheless led to murder of einar by harald s men which threatened to throw norway into a state of civil war although remaining descendants of haakon sigurdsson considered rebellion against king harald eventually managed to negotiate peace with them and secured family s submission for remainder of his reign devries 1999 pp 52 2010 pp 115 120 by death of einar and his son around 1050 earls of lade had outplayed their role as a base of opposition and trondelag was definitely subordinated to harald s national kingdom before battle of nisa harald had been joined by haakon who distinguished himself in battle and gained harald s favour reportedly even considering to give him title of earl haakon was greatly upset when harald later backed down from his promise with a strong hold over uplands haakon was additionally given earldom of by swedish king in early 1064 haakon entered uplands and collected their taxes region thus effectively threatening to renounce their loyalty to harald revolt of haakon and farmers in uplands may have been main reason why harald finally had been willing to enter a peace agreement with sweyn estridsson after agreement harald went to oslo and sent tax collectors to uplands only to find that farmers would withhold their taxes until haakon arrived in response harald entered sweden with an army and quickly defeated haakon tjonn 2010 pp 144 153 still facing opposition from farmers harald embarked on a campaign to crush areas that had withheld their taxes due to remote location of region in interior of country uplands had never been an integrated part of norwegian king s realm using harsh measures harald burned down farms and small villages and had people maimed and killed starting in romerike his campaign continued into and ringerike since regions contained several rich rural communities harald strengthened his economic position by confiscating farming estates tjonn 2010 pp 153 155 by end of 1065 there was probably peace in norway as any opposition had either been killed chased into exile or silenced tjonn 2010 p 155 policies harald s reign was marked by his background as a military commander as he often solved disputes with harsh force one of his skalds even boasted about how harald broke settlements he had made in his battles in mediterranean while sagas largely focus on harald s war with sweyn and invasion of england little is said about his domestic policies modern historians have taken this as a sign that despite his absolutism his reign was one of peace and progress for norway harald is considered to have instituted good economic policies as he developed a norwegian currency and a viable coin economy which in turn allowed norway to participate in international trade he initiated trade with kievan rus and byzantine empire through his connections as well as with scotland and ireland devries 1999 pp 46 47 according to later sagas harald founded oslo where he spent much time harald also continued to advance christianity in norway and archaeological excavations show that churches were built and improved during his reign he also imported bishops priests and monks from abroad especially from kievan rus and byzantine empire a slightly different form of christianity was thus introduced in norway from rest of northern europe although east west schism had not yet taken place jakobsson 2008 since clergy was not ordained in england or france it nonetheless caused controversy when harald was visited by papal legates protests by legates led harald to throw catholic clergy out of his court and he reportedly stated to legates that he did not know of any other archbishop or lord of norway than king himself devries 1999 pp 47 48 norwegian historian has remarked that words seemed as if spoken by a byzantine despot it is possible that harald maintained contacts with byzantine emperors after he became king which could suggest a background for his church policies bagge 1990 pp 176 177 northern explorations once he had returned to norway harald seems to have displayed an interest in exploring his own realm as for instance morkinskinna recounts harald s trip into uplands harald is also said to have explored seas beyond his kingdom as contemporary adam of bremen reports of such naval expeditions conducted by harald devries 1999 p 49 kelly devries has suggested that harald may even have known of and sought out legendary land called vinland which viking sailors had discovered only a short time before which adam mentions earlier in same passage to have been widely reported in denmark and norway h h lamb has on other hand proposed that land he reached may have been either spitsbergen or novaya zemlya invasion of england background and preparations with truce and recognition that he would not conquer denmark harald turned his attention to england england had belonged to harthacnut son of cnut great until he died childless in 1042 harald based his claim to throne of england on an agreement made between magnus and harthacnut in 1038 which stated that if either died other would inherit throne and lands of deceased when harthacnut died magnus assumed crown of denmark and considered himself lawful heir to harthacnut while edward confessor had himself crowned english king in his absence magnus had planned to invade england in 1045 only to be forced to turn his fleet towards denmark due to an uprising by sweyn estridsson although threat was temporarily averted by magnus s death in 1047 edward s negotiations with his enemies throughout 1050s gave harald as well as sweyn estridsson and william of normandy an impression that he was a possible heir to edward when edward died in january 1066 he was to harald s dismay succeeded by harold godwinson a son of one of edward s advisors hjardar vike 2011 pp 283 284 thumb right 13th century portrayal of harald hardrada from life of king edward confessor by english chronicler matthew paris harald s son magnus had previously been involved in gruffydd ap llywelyn s 1058 war against english king with a norwegian fleet possibly indicating that harald had tested situation in england long before his 1066 invasion only to find that he could not simultaneously be at war with denmark and england devries 1999 pp 66 67 after edward s death harald allied himself with tostig godwinson harold s brother who had been deprived of earldom of northumbria by edward in 1065 according to various sources tostig may have asked both or either of william of normandy and sweyn estridsson to assist him in invading england before turning to harald according to sagas tostig finally pledged his support for harald including that of majority of chieftains at a meeting in norway some historians doubt that this meeting took place as william of malmesbury claims that tostig did not pledge his support for harald until they met at humber this would indicate that invasion originally was harald s plan alone and that his joining of forces with tostig was merely a later agreement when two met for first time in scotland or northumbria another proposal by historians is that a meeting did indeed take place in norway but instead with one of tostig s early supporters and a fellow exile as tostig s mediator if this is correct it would both allow an agreement to have been made in norway and first personal meeting between harald and tostig to have taken place in britain devries 1999 pp 231 240 indeed morkinskinna mentions that some men claimed that tostig only had sent an emissary to norway while he still remained in france tjonn 2010 p 163 thumb harald landing near york left and defeating northumbrian army right from 13th century chronicle

september 1066 and had possibly begun already in march or april devries 1999 p 230 while he brought with him elisiv his daughters and his son olaf he left behind tora and made sure to have his oldest

norwegian control in both places he was joined by several important lords chieftains and soldiers including earls of orkney paul and erlend thorfinnsson he next went to dunfermline where he met with tostig s ally malcolm iii of scotland and according to some sources with tostig devries 1999 pp 250 251 who allocated him a couple thousand scottish soldiers hjardar vike 2011 pp 284 285 according to most contemporary sources harald and tostig met at tynemouth on 8 september harald with a total force of at most around 10 15 000 men on 240 300 longships tjonn 2010 p 1999 pp 264 265 269 and tostig with a mere 12 ships with soldiers devries 1999 pp 251 252 not mentioned in sagas but accounted for by john of worcester tostig had departed from his exile in flanders already in may or june he had then raided villages along southern coast of britain from isle of wight to sandwich as harold godwinson gathered a large army in response tostig sailed north to meet with harald while harold godwinson remained in south in expectation of invasion by william of normandy devries 1999 pp 242 243 who for a long time had openly claimed english throne tjonn 2010 p 165 invasion and battle of stamford

first resistance at scarborough where harald s demand for surrender was opposed in end harald resorted to burning down town and this action led to other northumbrian towns surrendering to him after further raiding harald and tostig sailed down humber disembarking at riccall news of invasion soon reached earls morcar of northumbria and edwin of mercia and they fought against harald s invading army two miles 3 km south of york at battle of fulford on 20 september battle was a decisive victory for harald and tostig and led york to surrender to their forces on 24 september devries 1999 pp 250 261 this would be last time a scandinavian army defeated english forces tjonn 2010 p 172 same day as york surrendered to harald and tostig harold godwinson arrived with his army in tadcaster just seven miles from anchored norwegian fleet at riccall from there he probably scouted norwegian fleet preparing a surprise attack as harald had left no forces in york harold godwinson marched right through town to stamford bridge devries 1999 pp 267 270 right thumb 350px harald at stamford bridge matthew paris may have attributed axe to harald due to its general norse association or royal iconography around st olaf according to sagas harald wore a blue tunic and helmet wielded a sword and landoydan as his royal standard but not his mail shirt emma and shield which was left at riccall devries 1999 pp 199 276 278 284 290 early on 25 september harald and tostig departed their landing place at riccall with most of their forces but left a third of their forces behind they brought only light armour as they expected to just meet citizens of york as they had agreed day before at stamford bridge to decide on who should manage town under harald tjonn 2010 pp 172 174 once there harald saw godwinson s forces approaching heavily armed and armoured and greatly outnumbering harald s although according to non saga sources english forces were held up at bridge for some time by a single gigantic norwegian allowing harald and tostig to regroup into a shield wall formation harald s army was in end heavily beaten harald was struck in throat by an arrow and killed early in battle in a state of having worn no body armour and fought aggressively with both hands around his sword devries 1999 pp 276 vike 2011 pp 289 291 when battle was almost over some reserve forces from riccall led by eystein orre finally appeared but they were exhausted as they had run all way eystein picked up harald s fallen banner landoydan and initiated a final counter attack although they for a moment appeared to almost breach english line eystein was suddenly killed which left rest of men to flee from battlefield hjardar vike 2011 p 291 among those left at riccall after battle who were allowed to return home peacefully by english forces was harald s son olaf devries 1999 p 1971 p 590 although sources state that harald s remaining army only filled 20 25 ships on return to norway it is likely that this number only accounts for norwegian forces most of forces from scotland and orkney probably remained at riccall throughout battle earls paul and erlend thorfinnsson are certainly known to have been stationed there entire time and has not been counted in traditional figure harold godwinson s victory was short lived as only a few weeks later he was defeated by william conqueror at battle of hastings fact that harold had to make a forced march to fight hardrada at stamford bridge and then move at utmost speed south to meet norman invasion all in less than three weeks is widely seen as a primary factor in william s victory at hastings stenton 1971 p 592 personal life harald is described by snorri sturluson to have been physically larger than other men and stronger he is said to have had light hair and beard a long upper beard moustache and that one of his eyebrows was somewhat higher situated than other he also reportedly had big hands and feet and could measure five ells in height it is not known whether snorri s description of harald s physical appearance actually represents historical facts bagge 1990 pp 187 189 tall stature of harald is also substantiated by a story that relates that before battle of stamford bridge harold godwinson offered tostig back earldom of northumbria and harald six feet of ground of england or perhaps more seeing that he is taller than most men according to henry of huntingdon or six feet of english ground or seven feet as he was taller than other men according to snorri sturluson harald himself composed skaldic poetry according to lee m hollander composing poetry was normal for norwegian kings but harald was only one who showed a decided talent lee m hollander skalds a selection of their poems with introductions and notes american scandinavian foundation 1945 repr princeton princeton university 1947 p 197 according to one poem harald had mastered a number of activities that were considered sports in viking age in addition to poetry brewing horse riding swimming skiing shooting rowing and playing harp hjardar vike 2011 p in hollander p 200 sagas state that harald and his varangians at least once took a break during siege of a town to enjoy sports devries 1999 p 32 with regards to religion harald had according to devries a religious inclination towards christianity and was publicly close to christian church although he was influenced by eastern christian culture of rus and byzantine empire having spent most of his life there he was clearly interested in advancing christianity in norway which can be seen by continued building and improvement of churches throughout his reign despite this devries notes that harald s personal morality appears not to have matched christian ideal citing his marriage arrangements issue harald married elisiv of kiev c 1025 after 1066 around 1044 45 and they had an unknown number possibly several children according to snorri sturluson they had two daughters devries 1999 p 48 ingegerd c 1050 1120 married first to future olaf i of denmark and after his death to future philip of sweden maria died 25 september 1066 promised away for marriage to eystein orre brother of tora torbergsdatter but reportedly died on orkney same day that harald and eystein died at stamford bridge according to sagas harald married tora torbergsdatter c 1025 after 1066 around 1048 some modern historians have disputed this since harald in that case would be in a bigamous marriage as he was still married to elisiv devries 1999 pp 48 49 it is nonetheless possible that such a marriage could take place in norway in 11th century and although harald had two wives only elisiv is noted to have held title of queen tjonn 2010 p 106 harald and tora had at least two children magnus
