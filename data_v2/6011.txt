also introduced a story arc in which scully develops cancer after getting approval from series creator chris carter gilligan asked former series writer darin morgan who had penned four episodes in second and third seasons to play eddie van blundht in fact role was written specifically with morgan in mind meisler pp 218 219 as gilligan had seen and was impressed by morgan s acting in a student
