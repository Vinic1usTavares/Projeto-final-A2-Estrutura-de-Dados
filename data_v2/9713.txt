maryland state roads commission in late 1910s and early 1920s and it became one of original state numbered highways in 1927 state highway was relocated and widened near reisterstown in late 1930s and along rest of its route in early 1950s hampstead bypass was planned as early as 1960s to ameliorate increasing congestion along md 30 corridor that was only exacerbated when i 795 was completed to reisterstown in late 1980s however construction of bypass was continually delayed due to environmental issues and politics bypass was finally constructed between 2006 and 2009 old highway through hampstead became md 30 business a md 30 bypass of manchester has also been discussed since 1960s but maryland state highway administration mdsha has no plans to construct new highway in foreseeable

principal arterial history wagon road to state highway first road along corridor of md 30 was a wagon road cut along an existing indian trail in 1736 and 1737 to connect conewago settlement which later became hanover with baltimore town which served as a much closer port for farmers and merchants in york county and adams county pennsylvania than philadelphia this road became known as conewago road pack horse road or wheelbarrow road last due to namesake implements being used to haul stones to widen road by order of maryland in 1793 highway became a toll road with 1805 incorporation of baltimore and reisterstown turnpike company which operated between two towns and split into westminster and hanover branches in reisterstown latter branch became known as hanover turnpike or baltimore and hanover turnpike and had ceased to collect tolls by 1899 thumb left md 30 northbound past md 86 in manchester work on modern md 30 began in 1918 with construction of a wide street through reisterstown and a concrete road north from reisterstown to woodensburg by 1921 whole length of future md 30 was planned for improvement and concrete road had been extended to southern end of hampstead in addition main street in manchester had been paved in concrete main street in hampstead was rebuilt as a concrete street and remainder of highway to pennsylvania line excluding main street in manchester was completed as a macadam road in 1923 md 30 was one of original state numbered highways marked in 1927 by 1934 entire length of md 30 was proposed to be widened from its existing width of to only major relocation of md 30 in 20th century was elimination of a grade crossing at western maryland railway now maryland midland railway at glen morris present bridge over railroad was completed in 1936 but relocated highway which replaced what is now old hanover road to east was not placed under construction until 1938 and did not open until 1939 md 30 was widened from hampstead south to baltimore carroll county line in 1938 with a pair of wide macadam shoulders expanding road s width to md 30 was relocated in a few spots widened and resurfaced from county line north to manchester in 1950 from county line south to north end of glen morris relocation in 1951 and 1952 and from manchester north to pennsylvania state line in 1953 and 1954 bypasses of hampstead and manchester a md 30 bypass of hampstead has been contemplated since 1940s and planned since at least 1960 heavy traffic along highway consisted of three types of highway users local traffic made up of people who had moved to hampstead or manchester for municipalities small town charm regional traffic comprising people who had moved to pennsylvania for cheaper housing and lower taxes but continued to work in baltimore area and truck traffic serving local industry and making connections between baltimore and hanover increase in congestion on md 30 accelerated with completion of i 795 in 1987 by early 1990s it took as long as 15 minutes for motorists to pass through each of towns during rush hour an average of 20 000 to 25 000 motorists used highway through hampstead each day by 2001 progress toward construction of bypass was continually delayed bypass was removed from mdsha plans by 1979 hampstead bypass had returned to state plans by 1990 when engineering and design work was underway and construction was planned to begin in 1992 however in 1991 bypass was shelved for six years for lack of funding there have been several causes of continual postponement of bypass in 1991 heavy groundwater contamination by industrial chemicals was discovered near southern end of proposed route then long at a black decker factory and near northern end of planned route at a shopping center bypass route changed again in 1994 when a population of bog turtles was discovered along bypass route bog turtle has been on maryland endangered species list since 1972 and was added to threatened list under u s endangered species act in 1997 in 1998 route of hampstead bypass changed a third time when bog turtle habitat was found to be larger than previously discovered delays were also ascribed to state s political climate carroll county is a heavily republican county in a heavily democratic state and until election of bob ehrlich as governor in 2002 state had not had a republican governor since spiro agnew left office in 1969 local sentiment was that county was relatively neglected and did not get its fair share of state highway funding for close to 40 years by 1997 start of construction of hampstead bypass was proposed for three to four years in future at that time most of engineering phase was complete but most of highway right of way had yet to be purchased three year timeframe was again put forth in 2001 finally in 2004 officials announced that bypass would begin construction in autumn 2005 construction finally got underway in summer 2006 houcksville road s bridge over bypass and highway s bridges over shiloh road and indian run were completed in 2007 roundabouts at md 482 and at southern end of bypass opened without connections to under construction bypass in april and may 2009 respectively roundabout at northern end of bypass opened when bypass opened to traffic on august 6 2009 to minimize disruption to bog turtle habitat mdsha installed tunnels under bypass for turtles to use and employed goats to consume invasive species in habitat area near bypass rather than remove them with mechanical mowers old md 30 through center of hampstead was redesignated md 30 business when bypass opened since as early as 1967 local officials have discussed building a manchester bypass either as a separate project or as part of a road bypassing both hampstead and manchester however by mid 1970s town of manchester decided it did not want bypass bypass was planned to pass to west of manchester but town allowed a residential subdivision to be built along bypass route planned bypass route was eventually changed to be east of town after two decades of disagreement by town and county over path of bypass in 1993 bypass was placed in town s master plan however state support for manchester bypass was scrapped in 1998 by smart growth proponent and governor parris glendening who said bypass would promote suburban sprawl manchester bypass is neither in maryland department of transportation s consolidated transportation program for 2012 to 2017 nor in mdsha s 2011 highway needs inventory for next 20 years junction list related routes
