being with his own happiness as moral purpose of his life with productive achievement as his noblest activity and reason as his only absolute she considered objectivism a systematic philosophy and

supernaturalism including all forms of religion den uyl douglas j rasmussen douglas b ayn rand s realism in in epistemology she considered all knowledge to be based on sense perception validity of which she considered axiomatic and reason which she described as faculty that identifies and integrates material provided by man s senses she rejected all claims of non perceptual or a priori knowledge including instinct intuition revelation or any form of just knowing in her introduction to objectivist epistemology rand presented a theory of concept formation and rejected analytic synthetic dichotomy in ethics rand argued for rational and ethical egoism rational self interest as guiding moral principle she said individual should exist for his own sake neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself she referred to egoism as virtue of selfishness in her book of that title in which she presented her solution to is ought problem by describing a meta ethical theory that based morality in needs of man s survival qua man she condemned ethical altruism as incompatible with requirements of human life and happiness and held that initiation of force was evil and irrational writing in atlas shrugged that force and mind are opposites rand s political philosophy emphasized individual rights including property rights and she considered laissez faire capitalism only moral social system because in her view it was only system based on protection of those rights she opposed statism which she understood to include theocracy absolute monarchy

she denounced libertarianism which she associated with anarchism she rejected anarchism as a naive theory based in that could only lead to collectivism in practice in aesthetics rand defined art as a selective re creation of reality according to an artist s metaphysical value judgments according to her art allows philosophical concepts to be presented in a concrete form that can be easily grasped thereby fulfilling a need of human consciousness as a writer art form rand focused on most closely was literature where she considered romanticism to be approach that most accurately reflected existence of human free will she described her own approach to literature as romantic realism rand acknowledged aristotle as her greatest influence and remarked that in history of philosophy she could only recommend three a s aristotle aquinas and ayn rand in a 1959 interview with mike wallace when asked where her philosophy came from she responded out of my own mind with sole acknowledgement of a debt to aristotle only philosopher who ever influenced me i devised rest of my philosophy myself however she also found early inspiration in friedrich nietzsche and scholars have found indications of his influence in early notes from rand s journals in passages from first edition of we living which rand later revised loiret prunet valerie ayn rand and feminist synthesis rereading we living in and in her overall writing style sheaffer robert rereading rand on gender in light of paglia in however by time she wrote fountainhead rand had turned against nietzsche s ideas and extent of his influence on her even during her early years is disputed mayhew robert we living 36 and 59 in rational egoism was embodied by russian author nikolay in 1863 novel what is to be done and several critics claim that what is to be done is one of sources of inspiration for rand s thought for example book s main character says i am not a man to make sacrifices and indeed there are no such things one acts in way that one finds most pleasant among philosophers rand held in particular disdain was immanuel kant whom she referred to as a monster although philosophers george walsh and fred seddon have argued that she misinterpreted kant and exaggerated their differences rand said her most important contributions to philosophy were her theory of concepts ethics and discovery in politics that evil violation of rights consists of initiation of force she believed epistemology was a foundational branch of philosophy and considered advocacy of reason to be single most significant aspect of her philosophy stating i am not primarily an advocate of capitalism but of egoism and i am not primarily an advocate of egoism but of reason if one recognizes supremacy of reason and applies it consistently all rest follows reception and legacy critical reception during rand s lifetime her work evoked both extreme praise and condemnation rand s first novel we living was admired by literary critic h l mencken ralston richard e publishing we living in her broadway play night of january 16th was both a critical and popular success and fountainhead was hailed by new york times reviewer lorine pruette as masterful reprinted in rand s novels were derided by some critics when they were first published as being long and melodramatic however they became bestsellers largely through word of mouth first reviews rand received were for night of january 16th reviews of production were largely positive but rand considered even positive reviews to be embarrassing because of significant changes made to her script by producer rand believed that her first novel we living was not widely reviewed but rand scholar michael s berliner writes it was most reviewed of any of her works with approximately 125 different reviews being published in more than 200 publications overall these reviews were more positive than reviews she received for her later work berliner michael s reviews of we living in her 1938 novella anthem received little attention from reviewers both for its first publication in england and for subsequent re issues berliner michael s reviews of anthem in rand s first bestseller fountainhead received far fewer reviews than we living and reviewers opinions were mixed berliner michael s fountainhead reviews in lorine pruette s positive review in new york times was one that rand greatly appreciated pruette called rand a writer of great power who wrote brilliantly beautifully and bitterly and stated that you will not be able to read this masterful book without thinking through some of basic concepts of our time there were other positive reviews but rand dismissed most of them as either not understanding her message or as being from unimportant publications some negative reviews focused on length of novel such as one that called it a whale of a book and another that said anyone who is taken in by it deserves a stern lecture on paper rationing other negative reviews called characters unsympathetic and rand s style offensively pedestrian rand s 1957 novel atlas shrugged was widely reviewed and many of reviews were strongly negative berliner michael s atlas shrugged reviews in in national review conservative author whittaker chambers called book sophomoric and remarkably silly he described tone of book as without reprieve and accused rand of supporting a godless system which he related to that of soviets claiming from almost any page of atlas shrugged a voice can be heard from painful necessity commanding to a gas chamber go atlas shrugged received positive reviews from a few publications including praise from noted book reviewer john chamberlain but rand scholar mimi gladstein later wrote that reviewers seemed to vie with each other in a contest to devise cleverest put downs calling it execrable claptrap and a nightmare they also said it was written out of hate and showed remorseless hectoring and rand s nonfiction received far fewer reviews than her novels had tenor of criticism for her first nonfiction book for new intellectual was similar to that for atlas shrugged with philosopher sidney hook likening her certainty to way philosophy is written in soviet union and author gore vidal calling her viewpoint nearly perfect in its immorality reprinted from esquire july 1961 her subsequent books got progressively less attention from reviewers on 100th anniversary of rand s birth in 2005 edward rothstein writing for new york times referred to her fictional writing as quaint utopian retro fantasy and programmatic neo romanticism of misunderstood artist while criticizing her characters isolated rejection of democratic society in 2007 book critic leslie clark described her fiction as romance novels with a patina of

evans nevertheless her influence among conservatives forced buckley and other national review contributors to reconsider how traditional notions of virtue and christianity could be integrated with support for capitalism political figures who cite rand as an influence are usually conservatives often members of republican party despite rand taking some positions that are atypical for conservatives such as being pro choice and an atheist a 1987 article in new york times referred to her as reagan administration s novelist laureate republican congressmen and conservative pundits have acknowledged her influence on their lives and have recommended her novels financial crisis of 2007 2008 spurred renewed interest in her works especially atlas shrugged which some saw as foreshadowing crisis opinion articles compared real world events with plot of novel during this time signs mentioning rand and her fictional hero john galt appeared at tea party protests there was also increased criticism of her ideas especially from political left with critics blaming economic crisis on her support of selfishness and free markets particularly through her influence on alan greenspan for example mother jones remarked that rand s particular genius has always been her ability to turn upside down traditional hierarchies and recast wealthy talented and powerful as oppressed while equating randian individual well being with that of volk according to goebbels corey robin of nation alleged similarities between moral syntax of and fascism academic reaction scholarly reception during rand s lifetime during rand s lifetime her work received little attention from academic scholars when first academic book about rand s philosophy appeared in 1971 its author declared writing about rand a treacherous undertaking that could lead to guilt by association for taking her seriously a few articles about rand s ideas appeared in academic journals before her death in 1982 many of them in personalist one of these was on randian argument by libertarian philosopher robert nozick who argued that her meta ethical argument is unsound and fails to solve is ought problem posed by david hume other philosophers writing in same publication argued that nozick misstated rand s case academic consideration of rand as a literary figure during her life was even more limited academic mimi gladstein was unable to find any scholarly articles about rand s novels when she began researching her in 1973 and only three such articles appeared during rest of 1970s posthumous overall assessments since rand s death interest in her work has gradually increased in 2009 historian jennifer burns identified three overlapping waves of scholarly interest in rand including an explosion of scholarship since year 2000 however as of that same year few universities included rand or objectivism as a philosophical specialty or research area with many literature and philosophy departments dismissing her as a pop culture phenomenon rather than a subject for serious study writing in 1998 edition of routledge encyclopedia of philosophy political theorist chandran summarizes mainstream philosophical reception to her work in two parts her ethical argument he says is viewed by most commentators as an unconvincing variant of aristotle s ethics her political theory he says is of little interest marred by an ill thought out and unsystematic effort to reconcile her hostility to state with her rejection of anarchism libertarian philosopher michael huemer argues that very few people find rand s ideas convincing especially her ethics which he believes are difficult to interpret and may lack logical coherence he attributes attention she receives to her being a compelling writer especially as a novelist noting that atlas shrugged rand s non fiction works as well as works of other philosophers of classical liberalism such as ludwig von mises friedrich hayek or frederic political scientist charles murray while praising rand s literary accomplishments criticizes her claim that her only philosophical debt was to aristotle instead asserting that her ideas were derivative of previous thinkers such as john locke and friedrich nietzsche although rand maintained that objectivism was an integrated philosophical system philosopher robert h bass argues that her central ethical ideas are inconsistent and contradictory to her central political ideas in literary encyclopedia entry for rand written in 2001 john david lewis declared that rand wrote most intellectually challenging fiction

theory published by cambridge university press rand s ideas have also been made subjects of study at clemson and duke universities scholars of english and american literature have largely ignored her work although attention to her literary work has increased since 1990s rand scholars douglas den uyl and douglas b rasmussen while stressing importance and originality of her thought describe her style as literary hyperbolic and emotional political writer and rand scholar jack wheeler writes that despite incessant bombast and continuous venting of randian rage rand s ethics are a most immense
