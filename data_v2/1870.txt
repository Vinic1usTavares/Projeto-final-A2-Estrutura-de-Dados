battle of ceresole or took place on 11 april 1544 during italian war of 1542 46 outside village of ceresole d alba in piedmont region of italy a french army commanded by francois de bourbon count of enghien defeated combined forces of holy roman empire and spain commanded by alfonso d avalos d aquino marquis del vasto despite having inflicted substantial casualties on imperial troops french subsequently failed to exploit their victory by taking milan enghien and d avalos had arranged their armies along two parallel ridges because of topography of battlefield many of individual actions of battle were uncoordinated battle opened with several hours of skirmishing between opposing bands of arquebusiers and an ineffectual artillery exchange after which d avalos ordered a general advance in center imperial landsknechts clashed with french and swiss infantry with both sides suffering terrific casualties in southern part of battlefield italian infantry in imperial service were harried by french cavalry attacks and withdrew after learning that imperial troops of center had been defeated in north meanwhile french infantry line crumbled and enghien led a series of ineffectual and costly cavalry charges against spanish and german infantry before latter were forced to surrender by arrival of victorious swiss and french infantry from center ceresole was one of few pitched battles during latter half of italian wars known among military historians chiefly for great slaughter that occurred when columns of intermingled arquebusiers and pikemen met in center it also demonstrates continuing role of traditional heavy cavalry on a battlefield largely dominated by emerging pike and shot infantry prelude opening of war in northern italy had been marked by fall of nice to a combined franco ottoman army in august 1543 meanwhile imperial spanish forces had advanced from lombardy towards turin which had been left in french hands at end of previous war in 1538 arnold renaissance at war 180 blockmans emperor charles v 72 73 oman art of war 213 by winter of 1543 1544 a stalemate had developed in piedmont between french under sieur de boutieres and imperial army under d avalos oman art of war 229 french position centered on turin reached outward to a series of fortified towns carmagnola susa villanova and a number of others d avalos meanwhile controlled a group of fortresses on periphery of french territory mondovi asti casale vercelli and ivrea oman art of war 229 d avalos had captured mondovi only a short time before two armies occupied themselves primarily with attacking each other s outlying strongholds boutieres seized san germano vercellese near vercelli and laid siege to ivrea d avalos meanwhile captured carignano only fifteen miles south of turin and proceeded to garrison and fortify it oman art of war 229 oman citing du bellay describes new fortifications as five bastions good curtains between them and a deep ditch left thumb upright portrait of alfonso d avalos marchese del vasto in armor with a page oil on canvas by titian c 1533 as two armies returned to winter quarters francis i of france replaced boutieres with francois de vendome count of enghien a prince with no experience commanding an army oman art of war 229 30 francis also sent additional troops to piedmont including several hundred heavy cavalry some companies of french infantry from dauphine and languedoc and a force of quasi swiss from gruyeres oman art of war 230 swiss while trained as pikemen had been raised by count of gruyeres from his own lands rather than being traditional levies of swiss cantons oman cites giovio s description of men having been raised from all regions of upper rhone and lake of geneva in january 1544 enghien laid siege to carignano which was defended by imperial troops under command of pirro colonna knecht renaissance warrior 490 oman art of war 230 oman notes that garrison of carignano included some of d avalos s best troops french were of opinion that d avalos would be forced to attempt a relief of besieged city at which point he could be forced into a battle but as such pitched battles were viewed as very risky undertakings enghien sent blaise de seigneur de montluc to paris to ask francis for permission to fight one knecht renaissance warrior 490 oman art of war 230 oman notes that du bellay seemingly having some dislike for montluc avoids identifying messenger in his chronicle describing him as un without giving his name montluc apparently convinced francis to give his assent contingent on agreement of enghien s captains over objections of comte de st pol who complained that a defeat would leave france exposed to an invasion by d avalos s troops at a time when charles v and henry viii of england were expected to attack picardy knecht renaissance warrior 490 oman art of war 230 231 major source for montluc s speech before francis and ensuing debate is montluc s own autobiography oman writes that his narrative cannot always be trusted since he sees himself in limelight at every crisis but also notes that it seems hardly credible that montluc could have invented his whole graphic tale of dispute at council board and his own impassioned plea for action requirement for enghien s subordinates to agree to a battle is recorded by du bellay montluc does not mention it montluc returning to italy brought with him nearly a hundred volunteers from among young noblemen of court including gaspard de coligny knecht renaissance warrior 490 oman art of war 231 a full list of names is given by du bellay and includes dampierre st andre vendome rochefort and d avalos having waited for arrival a large body of landsknechts dispatched by holy roman emperor charles v set off from asti towards carignano oman art of war 231 landsknechts in question were veteran troops and had been specially equipped with his total force included 12 500 18 000 infantry of which perhaps 4 000 were arquebusiers or musketeers he was only able to gather about 800 1 000 cavalry of which less than 200 were gendarmes hall weapons and warfare 186 oman art of war 231 hall gives lower numbers than oman noting that they are estimates by ferdinand lot and is source for specific proportion of arquebusiers in imperial army d avalos recognized relative weakness of his cavalry but considered it to be compensated by experience of his infantry and large number of arquebusiers in its ranks oman art of war 231 oman writes that d avalos related this view to des thermes who had been captured by imperial troops telling him that after pavia spanish officers had come to think little of french gendarmerie and believed that arquebusiers would always get better of them if properly covered enghien having learned of imperial advance left a blocking force at carignano and assembled remainder of his army at carmagnola blocking d avalos s route to besieged city oman art of war 231 232 234 blocking force probably consisted of companies of french infantry that had arrived as reinforcements during winter french cavalry shadowing d avalos s movements discovered that imperial forces were headed directly for french position on 10 april d avalos occupied village of ceresole d alba about five miles 8 km southeast of french oman art of war 232 other route available to d avalos was a sweep south through and racconigi that would have exposed his flank to enghien enghien s officers urged him to attack immediately but he was determined to fight on ground of his own choosing on morning of 11 april 1544 french marched from carmagnola to a position some three miles 5 km to southeast and awaited d avalos s arrival oman art of war 232 enghien and montluc felt that open ground would give french cavalry a significant tactical advantage hall weapons and warfare 186 hall notes that montluc by his own account told enghien sir sir what more could you have desired of god almighty than to find enemy in open field with neither hedge nor ditch to obstruct you by this point french army consisted of around 11 000 13 000 infantry 600 light cavalry and 900 1 250 heavy cavalry enghien and d avalos each had about twenty pieces of artillery hall weapons and warfare 186 oman art of war 232 234 oman notes that there are a variety of figures available for strength of french army he gives figures somewhat lower than montluc s and somewhat higher than du bellay s hall gives lower number for infantry but higher number for heavy cavalry in both cases from lot and notes that only around 500 of heavy cavalry were actually gendarmes battle came at a fortunate time for enghien as his swiss troops were as they had before battle of bicocca threatening to march home if they were not paid news of impending battle restored some calm to their ranks oman art of war 232 francis had sent some forty thousand ecus which was less than a month s worth of back pay battle dispositions thumb initial dispositions of opposing armies french troops are shown in blue and imperial troops in red enghien s troops were positioned along crest of a ridge that was higher in center than on either side preventing wings of french army from seeing each other hall weapons and warfare 186 oman art of war 234 hall explicitly attributes much of uncoordinated action during battle to poor visibility along line black also mentions topography as a source of confusion black dynasty forged by fire 43 french army was divided into traditional battle and rearward corps corresponding to center and right and left wings of french line oman art of war 234 oman suggests that this division seems to have been a theoretical one here on far right of french position was a body of light cavalry consisting of three companies under des thermes bernadino and maure with a total strength of around 450 500 men oman art of war 234 oman notes that full strength of three companies should have been 650 troopers rather than smaller number actually present to their left was french infantry under de tais numbering around 4 000 and farther to left a squadron of 80 gendarmes under boutieres who was nominally commander of entire french right wing oman art of war 234 squadron under boutieres was also under strength it should have included a hundred troopers center of french line was formed by thirteen companies of veteran swiss numbering about 4 000 under joint command of william frulich of soleure and a captain named st julian oman art of war 234 st julian commanded six of companies and william frulich other seven to their left was enghien himself with three companies of heavy cavalry a company of light horse and volunteers from paris in total around 450 troopers oman art of war 234 heavy cavalry companies commanded by d accier and were also under strength company of light horse commanded by d was not numbering about 150 men left wing was composed of two columns of infantry consisting of 3 000 of recruits from gruyeres and 2 000 italians all under command of sieur descroz oman art of war 232 235 descroz was given command because count of gruyeres had not yet arrived on extreme left of line were about 400 mounted archers deployed as light cavalry they were commanded by dampierre who was also given command of entire french left wing oman art of war 235 archers had been detached from companies of heavy cavalry with which they normally operated imperial line formed up on a similar ridge facing french position oman art of war 234 235 ridge occupied by d avalos troops shared same peculiarity of having a high center separating two wings from each other d avalos found that a knoll in center was only place from which he could observe his entire position on far left facing des thermes were 300 florentine light cavalry under rodolfo baglioni flanking them to right were 6 000 italian infantry under ferrante sanseverino prince of salerno oman art of war 231 236 in center were 7 000 landsknechte under command of eriprando madruzzo oman art of war 236 to their right was d avalos himself together with small force of about 200 heavy cavalry under carlo gonzaga oman art of war 236 imperial heavy cavalry was positioned directly across from enghien s cavalry imperial right wing was composed of around 5 000 german and spanish infantry under ramon de cardona they were flanked on far right by 300 italian light cavalry under philip de lannoy prince of sulmona oman art of war 231 236 cardona s infantry consisted primarily of veterans from african campaigns of charles v order

cavalry 300 rodolfo baglioni initial moves as d avalos s troops marching from ceresole began to arrive on battlefield both armies attempted to conceal their numbers and position from other enghien had ordered swiss to lie on ground behind crest of ridge while only left wing of imperial army was initially visible to french oman art of war 235 d avalos sent out parties of arquebusiers in an attempt to locate french flanks enghien in turn detached about 800 arquebusiers under montluc to delay imperial advance hall weapons and warfare 187 oman art of war 235 montluc s arquebusiers were drawn from french and italian infantry companies skirmishing between arquebusiers continued for almost four hours martin du bellay observing engagement described it as a pretty sight for anyone who was in a safe place and unemployed for they played off on each other all ruses and stratagems of petty war oman art of war 235 hall also mentions skirmishing hall weapons and warfare 187 as extent of each army s position was revealed enghien and d avalos both brought up their artillery oman art of war 235 imperial cannon were divided among two batteries near a pair of farms in front of imperial center and right wing while french artillery similarly split was adjacent to swiss in center and gruyeres contingent on left ensuing cannonade continued for several hours but had little effect because of distance and considerable cover available to troops on both sides hall weapons and warfare 186 oman art of war 235 hall notes that artillery was kept well back and officers on both sides took care not to expose unshielded infantry to its fire thumb left first phase of battle including imperial advance rout of florentine cavalry division of landsknechts and advance and retreat of spanish heavy cavalry skirmishing finally came to an end when it seemed that imperial cavalry would attack french arquebusiers in flank montluc then requested assistance from des thermes who advanced with his entire force of light cavalry d avalos observing french movement ordered a general advance along entire imperial line oman art of war 235 236 at southern end of battlefield french light cavalry drove baglioni s florentines back into sanseverino s advancing infantry and then proceeded to charge directly into infantry column italian formation held and des thermes himself was wounded and captured but by time sanseverino had dealt with resulting disorder and was ready to advance again fight in center had already been decided oman art of war 236 oman citing du bellay and montluc notes that des thermes thinking that he would have been better followed drove deep into enemy infantry before being unhorsed and taken prisoner a wholesale slaughter french infantry mostly gascons had meanwhile started down slope towards sanseverino montluc noting that disorder of italians had forced them to a standstill suggested that de tais attack madruzzo s advancing column of landsknechte instead this advice was accepted and french formation turned left in an attempt to strike landsknechte in flank oman art of war 236 source for montluc s role in this incident is his own narrative madruzzo responded by splitting his column into two separate portions one of which moved to intercept french while other continued up slope towards swiss waiting at crest hall weapons and warfare 187 oman art of war 237 oman praising madruzzo s tactical skill in effecting division quotes du bellay s description of movement seeing that french had changed their plan imperialists made a parallel change and of their great battalion made two one to fight swiss other french yet so close to each other that seen sideways they still looked one great mass hall calls movement an extremely difficult maneuver right thumb swiss mercenaries and landsknechte engaged in a push of pike engraving by hans holbein younger early 16th century right thumb a variant copy of holbein s engraving showing battle lines extended to both sides engraving by unknown artist early 16th century pike and shot infantry had by this time adopted a system in which arquebusiers and pikemen were intermingled in combined units both french and imperial infantry contained men with firearms interspersed in larger columns of pikemen hall weapons and warfare 186 187 hall notes that later 16th century system of arranging infantry in square formations with arquebusiers drawn back into center for protection was probably not fully in place at ceresole this combination of pikes and small arms made close quarters fighting extremely bloody hall weapons and warfare 187 mixed infantry was normally placed in separate clusters with arquebusiers on flanks of a central column of pikemen at ceresole however french infantry had been arranged with first rank of pikemen followed immediately by a rank of arquebusiers who were ordered to hold their fire until two columns met hall weapons and warfare 187 188 oman art of war 237 montluc who claimed to have devised scheme wrote that in this way we should kill all their captains in front rank but we found that they were as ingenious as ourselves for behind their first line of pikes they had put neither side fired till we were touching and then there was a wholesale slaughter every shot told whole front rank on each side went down oman art of war 237 hall gives a similar translation of montluc s quote but uses a great slaughter for une grande he notes that it is unclear how montluc escaped carnage he helped create hall weapons and warfare 187 swiss seeing french engage one of two columns of landsknechte finally descended to meet other which had been slowly moving up hillside oman art of war 237 swiss waited until french were within twelve pike lengths of their immediate adversaries before starting from their position both masses of infantry remained locked in a push of pike until squadron of heavy cavalry under boutieres charged into landsknechts flank shattering their formation and driving them down slope black dynasty forged by fire 43 hall weapons and warfare 187 oman art of war 237 238 imperial heavy cavalry which had been on landsknechts right and which had been ordered by d avalos to attack swiss recoiled from pikes and fled to rear leaving carlo gonzaga to be taken prisoner oman art of war 238 oman notes that actions of imperial cavalry are not mentioned in any french chronicle of battle but that giovio records that they disgraced themselves swiss and gascon infantry proceeded to slaughter remaining landsknechte whose tight order precluded a rapid retreat as they attempted to withdraw from battlefield hall weapons and warfare 187 oman art of war 238 road to ceresole was littered with corpses swiss in particular showed no mercy as they wished to avenge mistreatment of swiss garrison of mondovi previous november most of landsknechts officers were killed and while contemporary accounts probably exaggerate numbers of dead it is clear that german infantry had ceased to exist as a fighting force oman art of war 238 oman suggests that contemporary casualty figure of 5 000 out of 7 000 is exaggerated but notes that giovio s list of casualties records that practically all their captains were killed black merely notes landsknechts casualties as more than 25 percent black dynasty forged by fire 43 seeing this sanseverino decided that battle was lost and marched away to asti with bulk of italian infantry and remnants of baglioni s florentine cavalry french light cavalry meanwhile joined in pursuit of landsknechts oman art of war 238 baglioni s florentines had been able to reform without incident as they were not pursued by french after initial clash engagements in north on northern end of battlefield events had unfolded quite differently dampierre s cavalry routed lannoy s company of light horse italians and contingent from gruyeres meanwhile broke and fled leaving their officers to be killed without offering any real resistance to advancing imperial infantry black dynasty forged by fire 43 oman art of war 238 239 as cardona s infantry moved past original french line enghien descended on it with entire body of heavy cavalry under his command subsequent engagement took place on reverse slope of ridge out of sight of rest of battlefield hall weapons and warfare 187 oman art of war 239 oman is critical of enghien who lost all count of how battle was progressing elsewhere forgetting duties of a commander in chief thumb right second phase of battle including rout of neapolitan cavalry and landsknechts sanseverino s withdrawal enghien s cavalry attacks retreat of spanish german infantry and return of french and swiss infantry from ceresole on first charge enghien s cavalry penetrated a corner of imperial formation pushing through to rear and losing some of volunteers from paris hall weapons and warfare 187 oman art of war 239 oman compares action here purely a matter of infantry versus cavalry to that of battle of marignano as cardona s ranks closed again french cavalry turned and made a second charge under heavy arquebus fire this was far more costly and again failed to break imperial column black dynasty forged by fire 43 hall weapons and warfare 187 oman art of war 239 oman refers to du bellay and montluc for accounts of slaughter in second charge enghien now joined by dampierre s light cavalry made a third charge which again failed to achieve a decisive result fewer than a hundred of french gendarmes remained afterwards oman art of war 239 240 oman notes that third charge was apparently encouraged by gaspard de saulx sieur de tavannes according to his own narrative he told enghien that cup must be drained to dregs monsieur il faut boire cette enghien believed battle to be lost according to montluc he intended to stab himself which ancient romans might do but not good christians when st julian swiss commander arrived from center of battlefield and reported that imperial forces there had been routed hall weapons and warfare 187 oman art of war 240 oman is skeptical of montluc s claim here noting that montluc loves a tragic scene news of landsknechts defeat reached cardona s troops at about same time that it had reached enghien imperial column turned and retreated back towards its original position hall weapons and warfare 187 oman art of war 240 enghien followed closely with remainder of his cavalry he was soon reinforced by a company of italian mounted arquebusiers which had been stationed at racconigi and had started towards battlefield after hearing initial artillery exchange oman art of war 240 arquebusiers had been detached to watch over fords on maira river some eight miles 13 km away from battle these arquebusiers dismounting to fire and then remounting were able to harass imperial column sufficiently to slow its retreat oman art of war 240 meanwhile french and swiss infantry of center having reached ceresole had turned about and returned to battlefield montluc who was with them writes when we heard at ceresole that m d enghien wanted us both swiss and we gascons turned toward him i never saw two battalions form up so quick we got into rank again actually as we ran along side by side enemy was going off at quick march firing salvos of arquebuses and keeping off our horse when we saw them and when they us only 400 paces away and our cavalry making ready to charge they threw down their pikes and surrendered to horsemen you might see fifteen or twenty of them round a man at arms pressing about him and asking for quarter for fear of us of infantry who were wanting to cut all their throats oman art of war 240 hall gives a similar translation of montluc s account hall weapons and warfare 188 perhaps as many as half of imperial infantry were killed as they were attempting to surrender remainder about 3 150 men were taken prisoner hall weapons and warfare 188 oman art of war 240 241 hall quotes montluc more than half were slain because we dispatched as many of those people as we could get our hands on oman notes that prisoners included about 2 530 germans and 630 spaniards a few including baron of who had commanded german infantry contingents managed to escape oman art of war 240 oman cites giovio s account for this detail aftermath casualties of battle were unusually high even by standards of time and are estimated at 28 percent of total number of troops engaged hall weapons and warfare 217 smallest numbers given for imperial dead in contemporary accounts are between 5 000 and 6 000 although some french sources give figures as high as 12 000 oman art of war 241 oman does not consider higher french numbers to be probable a large number of officers were killed particularly among landsknechts many of those who survived were taken prisoner including ramon de cardona carlo gonzaga and eriprando madruzzo oman art of war 241 oman notes that giovio provides a full list of slain captains including heir of furstenberg baron of two brothers scaliger christopher and michael jacob etc etc madruzzo was so heavily wounded as to be believed dead but later recovered french casualties were smaller but numbered at least 1 500 to 2 000 killed oman art of war 241 oman considers loss of 500 men reported in some french chronicles to be obviously understated these included many of officers of gascon and gruyeres infantry contingents as well as a large portion of gendarmerie that had followed enghien oman art of war 241 oman notes deaths of five captains of gascon infantry la molle and st genevieve as well as all captains of gruyeres band including descroz and charles du governor of mondovi among heavy cavalry dead included two of enghien s squires and a large number of volunteers including d accier d de glaive courville and several dozen more only french prisoner of note was des thermes who had been carried along with sanseverino s retreating italians oman art of war 241 despite collapse of imperial army battle proved to be of little strategic significance black dynasty forged by fire 43 at insistence of francis i french army resumed siege of carignano where colonna held out for several weeks soon after city s surrender enghien was forced to send twenty three companies of italian and gascon infantry and nearly half his heavy cavalry to picardy which had been invaded by charles v oman art of war 242 left without a real army enghien was unable to capture milan d avalos meanwhile routed a fresh force of italian infantry under pietro strozzi and count of at battle of serravalle knecht renaissance warrior 490 oman art of war 242 243 oman puts battle on june 2 while knecht has it occur on june 4 end of war saw a return to status quo in northern italy historiography a number of detailed contemporary accounts of battle have survived among french chronicles are narratives of martin du bellay and blaise de montluc both of whom were present at scene sieur de tavannes who accompanied enghien also makes some mention of events in his memoirs oman art of war 243 most extensive account from imperial side is that of paolo giovio despite a number of inconsistencies with other accounts it provides according to historian charles oman valuable notes on points neglected by all french narrators oman art of war 243 oman notes that giovio is oddly wrong in reversing positions of swiss and gascons in initial french line interest of modern military historians in battle has centered primarily on role of small arms and resulting carnage among infantry in center hall weapons and warfare 188 arrangement of pikemen and arquebusiers used was regarded as too costly and was not tried again in subsequent battles arquebuses were used primarily for skirmishing and from flanks of larger formations of pikemen hall weapons and warfare 188 hall notes that imperial army despite being better equipped with small arms suffered more casualties than french ceresole is also of interest as a demonstration of continuing role of traditional heavy cavalry on battlefield hall weapons and warfare 188 190 despite failure of enghien s charges french according to bert hall held to their belief in effectiveness of unaided heavy cavalry to break disciplined formations a small body of gendarmes had been sufficient in center to rout infantry columns that were already engaged with other infantry hall weapons and warfare 188 189 hall notes that enghien certainly had reason to expect better results than his charging troops achieved as cardona s infantry had been in some disarray when french charges began beyond this tactical utility another reason for cavalry s continued importance is evident from final episode of battle french gendarmes were only troops who could reasonably be expected to accept an opponent s surrender as swiss and french infantry had no inclination towards taking prisoners cavalry was according to hall almost intuitively expected to heed these entreaties without question hall weapons and warfare 189 190 hall writes of episode and slaughter of much of imperial infantry despite their attempts to surrender that new brutalities of
