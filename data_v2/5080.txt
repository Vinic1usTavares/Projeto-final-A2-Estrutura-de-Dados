tropical storm and third hurricane of season at first national hurricane center nhc operationally did not designate it as a hurricane because initial data suggested winds of 70 mph 115 km h at erika s peak intensity it was not until later data was analyzed that nhc revised it to category 1 intensity in saffir simpson hurricane scale storm developed from a non tropical area of low pressure that was tracked for five days before developing in eastern gulf of mexico on august 14 under influence of a high pressure system erika moved quickly westward and strengthened under favorable conditions it made landfall as a hurricane on northeastern mexico on august 16 and rapidly dissipated inland while erika s precursor disturbance was moving across florida it dropped heavy rainfall in south texas erika produced moderate winds of 50 to 60 mph 80 to 95 km h along with light rain causing minor and isolated wind damage in state in northeastern mexico erika produced moderate amounts of rainfall resulting in mudslides and flooding there two people were killed when their vehicle was swept away by floodwaters meteorological history a weak surface area of low pressure detached from a frontal system on august 8 while 1 150 miles 1 850 km to east of bermuda it moved southwestward and on august 9 it generated convection as it passed beneath a cold core upper level low surface low and upper level low turned westward as it revolved around a common center and by august 11 surface low developed into a trough while 440 miles 700 km south of bermuda as system rapidly continued westward much of convection remained near center of upper level low preventing development of a closed surface circulation on august 13 while located near northwestern bahamas a substantial increase in convection resulted in upper level low building downwards to middle levels of troposphere coinciding with development of an upper level anticyclone a closed low level circulation nearly developed on august 14 to east of key largo florida but it weakened due to deep convection remaining to north over mid level center mid level storm continued westward and moved across florida after crossing florida hurricane hunters indicated a poorly defined circulation but with winds exceeding tropical storm strength and system was designated as tropical storm erika late on august 14 while located 85 miles 135 km west of fort myers thumb nexrad image of erika making landfall on northeastern mexico with well established outflow and low levels of wind shear erika strengthened as circulation became better defined a high pressure system persisted over south central united states forcing storm to move just south of due west at 25 mph 40 km h on august 15 convection organized into bands and as its winds approached hurricane strength an eye developed within storm erika turned to west southwest on august 16 and attained hurricane status just prior to making landfall near boca san rafael tamaulipas in northeastern mexico or about 40 miles 70 km south of united states mexico border storm rapidly weakened over mountainous sierra madre oriental and erika dissipated early on august 17 mid level circulation maintained integrity as it crossed mexico and led to formation of a tropical disturbance after entering gulf of california on august 18 it turned to northwest and weakened on august 20 operationally erika was never upgraded to hurricane status based on a persistent eye feature on radar and doppler weather radar estimated surface winds of 75 mph 120 km h national hurricane center posthumously upgraded erika to a hurricane preparations left thumb tropical storm erika approaching mexico on august 15 threat of erika s onslaught prompted evacuation of 51 oil platforms and 3 oil rigs in western gulf of mexico lack of production led to a loss of production of of oil per day and of natural gas per day on day of its landfall lack of production led to 1 979 less barrels of oil for day or about 0 12 of total daily production for gulf of mexico while loss of of gas for day was equivalent to 0 23 of total production however due to its rapid motion passage of storm resulted in minimal effects on operations while storm was located in eastern gulf of mexico on august 15 national hurricane center issued a hurricane watch and tropical storm warning from brownsville to baffin bay texas center also recommended a hurricane watch spanning from soto la marina tamaulipas to international border late that same day when strengthening was underway a hurricane warning was either issued or recommended from la pesca mexico to baffin bay texas though warnings for south texas were dropped when a more southward motion occurred just one month after hurricane claudette caused millions in damage in south
