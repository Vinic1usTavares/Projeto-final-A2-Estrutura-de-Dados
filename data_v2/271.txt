unknown scout came to his aid guiding him to his destination boy then refused boyce s tip explaining that he was a boy scout and was merely doing his daily good turn interested in boy scouts boyce met

incorporation established this institution among a small number of similarly chartered patriotic and national organizations such as girl scouts civil air patrol american legion red cross little league baseball and national academy of sciences federal incorporation was originally construed primarily as an honor however it does grant chartered organization some special privileges and rights including
