dupri bryan michael cox stargate dream tricky stewart scott storch and danja album revealed a more personal side of singer illustrated in its declarative theme of emancipation from her previous marriage and from her personal and professional setbacks although it shared similar vocal production as well as an inclination to her signature pop and r b ballads album also encompassed a variety of dance oriented and uptempo styles it was meant to be a continuation or a second part of her tenth studio album emancipation of mimi 2005 carey collaborated with a number of artists on album including t pain damian marley and young jeezy though considered by critics very similar to formula its predecessor had been built on e mc2 included other genres she had never explored such as reggae and her continued recording of gospel influenced hymns e mc2 was generally well received by music critics with many complimenting record s broad genre influences and musical and production styles some critics however felt that album was too similar to emancipation of mimi and didn t offer anything new from formula album debuted at number one on us billboard 200 with opening week sales of 463 000 copies

fourth and final single i stay in love became her fourteenth chart topper on dance club songs chart background and recording in 2002 carey signed a new record deal with island records and in 2005 she

industry awards and brought carey back to top of pop music following her commercial decline in 2001 after completing adventures of mimi tour she began working on material for her eleventh studio effort yet untitled e mc2 e mc2 was hailed as one of most anticipated albums of 2008 with many critics weighing their opinions on whether carey would be able to deliver significant success following her achievements with emancipation of mimi carey began writing and producing music she saw fit and not anything to please record executives throughout 2007 carey recorded album in a studio built into her private villa in anguilla in caribbean she describe e mc2 as one of her most expressive albums and one that she felt free on and able to express herself through her music in an interview with bryan times carey spoke of her sentiments on album it s hard for me to sit here and talk about it without sounding like if i m bragging if i m in love with it but i am i love with this album i think that having success with last record allowed me to have more freedom and just make records that i like its kind of a really fun record delays and release album was supposed to be released in late 2007 but carey spoke about reason album got delayed you can t really put records out in december if you want whole world to have a chance to actually hear it and my fans all over world are very important to me adding that she also wants to put out a pair of singles before album drops in a separate interview she elaborated further this happened to me with emancipation of mimi i started writing more songs i was like okay let me get these done then i wrote four more songs and you know how it goes so now i m like 22 songs in and clearly i have to cut some of those down it was then reported that album will be released in february 2008 however release was later pushed back yet again to april 2008 prior to its release album s working title had been that chick taken from a song on album with a similar name i m that chick as release date drew near title was changed to e mc2 in reference to carey s previous album emancipation of mimi 2005 title signifies e emancipation of mc mariah carey 2 to second power it is a word play on albert einstein s famous mass energy equivalence formula and has been dubbed as sequel and improved counterpart to emancipation of mimi in his review of album alex macpherson from guardian described his thoughts on its title as well as its meaning it is worth pondering what title of mariah carey s eleventh studio album could refer to emancipation maybe in a nod to her 2005 comeback album emancipation of mimi or perhaps energy of original equation a statement that carey still has what it takes to party all night at age of 37 even as she describes herself as eternally 12 then again she could just be identifying herself alongside einstein as a fellow genius either way e mc2 finds carey than ever embracing her own larger than life image with gusto mariah carey squared indeed carey expressed how she considered mimi main course and felt that new album would be treated as dessert in an interview with nme singer described her choice on album s title basically i m freer on this album than i ve ever been some of songs on last album were cool but maybe not quite as neat as this album when questioned if title represented carey s interest in physics she jokingly added einstein s theory physics me hello i even failed remedial math i could not pass seventh grade math even in lowest class with worst kids album s similarity to its predecessor is not only found in title and music but also in its artwork in album s cover art she holds almost exact pose as from her last album only with different lighting and wardrobe it features a black backdrop with carey completely naked except for a large feathered shawl covering her body only her first name appears in large pink letters on cover with e mc2 appearing in small white letters on top in describing cover macpherson wrote carey is naked but for world s largest feather boa an accessory for which flocks of birds have surely given their lives composition style and structure music critics compared e mc2 heavily to carey s previous album emancipation of mimi and felt it followed same formula of ballads and dance able tracks freedom de luc of washington post felt that after experiencing strong success for first time in 2000s with mimi carey tried to create e mc2 with same formula although possibly a little improved having found that winning formula of coquettish club bangers emotional ballads and frisky mid tempo coos diva with golden tone has eschewed radical experimentalism here for stasis e mc2 is mostly more of same then with 2 representing something sequential rather than exponential meet new mariah almost exactly same as old mimi songs and lyrics first song on album s track list is migrate a song carey wrote and co produced alongside danja and features a rap verse from t pain its melody is built on a heavy electronic beat and incorporates whistle registers and several studio created synthesizers into its melody additionally song features inclusion of auto tune and several vocal manipulators which are used heavily on both carey and t pain s vocals lyrically song finds singer during a night out migrating from several locations from car to club from bar to v i p from party to after party and finally to hotel according to brian hiatt from vh1 she hops from my car into club from bar to vip from party to after party to hotel with t pain who urges her to

features a stuttering mid tempo beat that s accented by finger snaps and electronic synthesizers as its instrumentation lyrically song describes protagonist revealing several bedroom fantasies in

that decorated every room inside private hell we built and i dealt with it like a kid i wished i could fly away sarah rodman from boston globe described it as another look at her fractious marriage to mottola and wrote although union ended in 1998 carey is still suffering including dreams of violent times and sleeping with enemy interestingly her vocal approach here is almost emo as she hits her rock solid middle register and refuses to be held captive by demons of her past mtv news writer jennifer vineyard described song in detail it finally reveals a side of mariah we don t see that often her true self mariah we usually see and hear is a glossy one psychologists might say her affect is off meaning her gestures and facial expressions don t match her mood there s a reason for that as she explains on side effects which is emotional abuse she says she suffered during her marriage to music mogul tommy mottola mariah who is usually quite guarded has alluded to subject in songs like petals but never has she gone into such detail as she does on side effects in which she refers to marriage as a private hell that we built even though it s been 11 years since they split up she sings in a lower register that she s still up scared some nights dreaming about violent times her emotional scars left her a little protective a little defensive a little depressed which makes her fake a smile as she deal s with side effects even though it features young jeezy it sounds like a rock power ballad i m that chick is a song carey wrote alongside norwegian duo stargate it is a fast paced song

tour s theme carey explained i m thinking elaborate i like elaborate we only do substantial that s what my jeweler says i haven t gotten looks in mind just yet but we re going to figure it out soon enough despite continued plans for a tour and announcements made on x factor in united kingdom in november tour was suddenly cancelled by early december tabloids and critics began heavily speculating

figure began to change as she stopped her exercise routines and gained weight though carey had eventually announced that she was pregnant with twins on november 28 2010 over two years later she

100 indicating generally positive reviews on website metacritic which averages professional reviews into a numerical score stephen thomas erlewine senior editor of allmusic rated album three out of five stars and wrote it s misleading to judge mariah based on her new record of possessing most number one singles as she s not about longevity she s about being permanently transient a characteristic e mc2 captures all too well billboards gary trust felt that on album carey was in pristine form stating she s proclaimed emancipation before but mariah carey s never sounded as free as she does on her 10th album carey s made a pop album with equal parts levity and gravity writing for entertainment weekly margeaux watson graded e mc2 an a and described how album s goal was to prove her comeback was no fluke she continued complimenting album s several collaborations and wrote result is a largely enjoyable mix of flirtatious club jams midtempo love songs and emotional ballads anchored by hip hop beats that handsomely showcase singer s powerful vocal chops though carey s voice had been criticized since her 2002 release charmbracelet for not being able to deliver gravity defying vocals from 1990s roger friedman from fox news wrote her infamous eight octave range has suffered a little wear and tear over years but carey still can flutter from great highs to mellow lows like no one else alex macpherson from guardian gave album four out of five stars heavily describing singer s vocal state throughout album carey s voice has been mocked bizarrely as being a triumph of technique over soul an argument that fails to comprehend that technique and soul are intertwined that technique primarily exists as a means to convey emotion but she is on fine vocal form throughout e mc2 whether belting out massive ballads or layering her voice into a swooning bank of a hundred mariahs macpherson concluded his review with when she sings elsewhere them other regularities they can t compare with mc it is hard not to agree referencing a lyric on for record houston chronicles joey guerra felt all of album s tracks were strong and wrote every track plays like a potential hit single and that s exactly what fans will love about e mc2 expect it to soundtrack much of summer and beyond los angeles times staff writer richard cromelin gave album two out of four stars noting its alternatives to glass shattering flamboyance of her early 90s youth he concluded in his mixed review of album of course consistency isn t so important when an album is assembled as a series of singles rather than a cohesive work fortunately for carey tabloid tailored real life back story on one side and producer s craft on other matter more than art of singing in this particular fairy tale ben ratliff of new york times felt album didn t level up to par with carey s previous release writing much of record sounds like urban radio imitations without peculiarities and effective hooks of mimi maybe emancipation isn t a continuing procedure maybe it only comes once writing for popmatters evan sawdey rated e mc2 four out of ten discs describing it as a shallow imitation of its predecessor sawdey concluded his review on a mixed note stating second act of mariah s comeback doesn t wisely expand her sound it instead succumbs to blueprint so carefully laid out by its predecessor a pointless remake that exists only because it has to if you ever had a doubt as to its formulaic nature you need to look no further than its title long live diva caryn ganz from rolling stone questioned why she limited her vocal abilities throughout record nearly every song confines carey to four note verses offering little room for her glorious range journalist eric henderson writing for slant magazine graded album three out of five stars and concluding with such are rewards of an album like e mc2 in which one does reach a solution but not before mariah bends over backward to show her work album finished in top ten of several best of 2008 lists ending at number four on an official poll held by billboard eight by detroit news and number ten by san diego union tribune robert christgau picked
