roughtail stingray dasyatis centroura is a species of stingray in family dasyatidae with separate populations in coastal waters of northwestern eastern and southwestern atlantic ocean this bottom dwelling species typically inhabits sandy or muddy areas with patches of invertebrate cover at a depth of it is seasonally migratory overwintering in offshore waters and moving into coastal habitats for summer largest whip tail stingray in atlantic roughtail stingray grows up to across and in weight it is plain in color with an angular diamond shaped pectoral fin disc and a long whip tail tail bearing a subtle fin fold underneath many thorns on its back and tail serve to distinguish it from other stingrays that share its range often found lying on bottom buried in sediment roughtail stingray is a generalist predator that feeds on a variety of benthic invertebrates and bony fishes it is aplacental viviparous with embryos receiving nourishment initially from yolk and later from histotroph uterine milk produced by mother in northwestern atlantic females bear an annual litter of 4 6 young in fall and early winter after a gestation period of 9 11 months by contrast in mediterranean there is evidence that females bear two litters of 2 6 young per year after a gestation period of only four months rays in northwestern atlantic are also larger at birth and at sexual maturity than those from mediterranean venomous tail spine of roughtail stingray is potentially dangerous to humans international union for conservation of nature iucn has listed this species under least concern overall and in northwestern atlantic where it is not commercially utilized however in mediterranean and southwestern atlantic it is subject to heavy fishing pressure and has been assessed as near threatened taxonomy and phylogeny first description of roughtail stingray was published by american naturalist samuel mitchell in one of earliest north american works on ichthyology a short treatise on fishes of new york in 1815 first volume of transactions of literary and philosophical society of new york mitchell based his account on specimens caught off long island though did not designate any types and named new species raja centroura from greek in reference to its thorns subsequent authors moved this species to genus dasyatis this ray may also be referred to as rough tailed stingray rough tailed northern stingray or thorny stingray taxonomy of roughtail stingray is not fully resolved with disjunct northwestern atlantic southwestern atlantic and eastern atlantic populations differing in life history and perhaps representing a complex of different species lisa rosenberger s 2001 phylogenetic analysis of 14 dasyatis species based on morphology found that roughtail stingray is sister species to broad stingray d lata and that they form a clade with southern stingray d americana and longtail stingray d longa close relationship between roughtail and southern stingrays was upheld by a genetic analysis published by leticia de almeida leao vaz and colleagues in 2006 roughtail and broad stingrays are found in atlantic and pacific oceans respectively and therefore likely diverged before or with formation of isthmus of panama c 3 ma distribution and habitat thumb upright 1 2 left alt side view of a dark brown stingray swimming over a sandy flat a roughtail stingray at mcgrail bank in gulf of mexico sandy flats are a favored habitat of this species roughtail stingray is broadly but discontinuously distributed in coastal waters of atlantic ocean in western atlantic it occurs from georges bank off new england southward to florida bahamas and northeastern gulf of mexico there are also scattered reports from venezuela to argentina and on barrier reef in belize in eastern atlantic it occurs from southern bay of biscay to angola including mediterranean sea madeira and canary islands a single record from quilon india was likely a misidentification one of deepest diving stingrays roughtail stingray has been recorded to a depth of in bahamas and regularly occurs down to in mediterranean however it is most common at a depth of this bottom dwelling species favors live bottom habitat patches of rough terrain that are densely encrusted by sessile invertebrates and also frequents adjacent open areas of sand or mud rays in northwestern atlantic do not usually enter brackish water whereas those off west africa have been recorded from lower reaches of large rivers favored temperature range of roughtail stingray is which is most important factor determining its distribution it conducts seasonal migrations off eastern united states from december to may this ray is found over middle and outer parts of continental shelf from cape hatteras in north carolina to florida with larger rays occurring further south than smaller ones in spring population moves north of cape and towards coast into bays inlets and saltier estuaries though preserving north south gradient of body sizes a similar migration from shallow coastal waters in summer to deeper offshore waters in winter apparently occurs in mediterranean pregnant females tend to be found apart from other individuals description thumb alt line drawing of a stingray from above roughtail stingray is characterized by angular shape of its disc and thorns over its body and tail roughtail stingray has a diamond shaped pectoral fin disk 1 2 1 3 times as wide as long with straight to gently sinuous margins rather angular outer corners and a moderately long obtuse snout eyes are proportionally smaller than other stingrays in its range and immediately followed by larger spiracles there is a curtain of skin between nostrils with a finely fringed posterior margin mouth is bow shaped with a row of six papillae nipple like structures across floor seven upper and 12 14 lower tooth rows at center are functional though total number of tooth rows is much greater teeth are arranged with a quincunx pattern into flattened surfaces each has a tetragonal base with a blunt crown in juveniles and females and a pointed cusp in adult males pelvic fins have nearly straight margins and angular tips tail is long and whip like measuring some 2 5 times length of disc a long saw toothed spine is placed atop tail at around half a disc length back from tail base sometimes one or two replacement spines are also present in front of existing one behind spine there is a long ventral fin fold that is much lower than that of southern stingray individuals under across have completely smooth skin larger rays develop increasing numbers of distinctive tubercles or bucklers flat based thorns over middle of back from snout to tail base as well as dorsal and lateral rows of thorns on tail bucklers vary in size with largest of equal diameter to eye and may bear up to three thorns each this species is a uniform dark brown or olive above and off white below without dark fin margins among largest members of its family roughtail stingray can reach across long and in weight females grow larger than males biology and ecology thumb upright 1 2 left alt side view of a stingray over a field of rocks scattered on sand with small fish nearby roughtail stingray typically forages for food on sea bottom but will also take prey from water column roughtail stingray is reportedly not highly active spending much time buried in sediment it is a generalist predator whose diet generally reflects most available prey in its environment it mainly captures prey off bottom but also opportunistically takes free swimming prey a variety of invertebrates as well as bony fishes such as sand lance and are known to be consumed off massachusetts main prey are crabs cancer bivalves mya gastropods squid loligo and annelid worms in delaware bay most of its diet consists of shrimp and blood worm overall dietary composition there is nearly identical to that of bluntnose stingrays d say that share bay shrimp upogebia affinis is a major food source off virginia off florida crustaceans brevirostris and and polychaete worms are most important prey sharks and other large fishes in particular great hammerhead sphyrna mokarran prey upon roughtail stingray live is sometimes found attached to its body known parasites of this species include tapeworms acanthobothrium sp polypocephalus sp and rhinebothrium maccallumi monogenean dendromonocotyle and leech like other stingrays roughtail stingray is aplacental viviparous developing embryo is initially sustained by yolk and later by histotroph uterine milk containing proteins lipids and mucus delivered by mother through finger like projections of uterine epithelium called trophonemata only left ovary and uterus are functional in adult females off eastern united states reproduction occurs on an annual cycle with mating in winter and early spring after a gestation period of 9 11 months females give birth to 4 6 typically five young in fall or early winter newborns measure across off north africa birthing occurs in june and december indicating either that females bear two litters per year with a four month gestation period or that there are two cohorts of females bearing one litter per year with a ten month gestation period newborns are much smaller than those in northwestern atlantic at across which would be consistent with a shorter gestation period size at maturity also differs between two regions off eastern united states males and females mature at and across respectively while off north africa males and females mature at and across respectively human interactions thumb alt a stingray on deck of a ship surrounded by other caught fish and fishery workers a roughtail stingray caught in gulf of mexico this specie was fished in united states waters with its large size and long venomous spine roughtail stingray can inflict a severe wound and can be very dangerous for fishers to handle however it is not aggressive and usually occurs too deep to be encountered by beachgoers it has been reported to damage farmed shellfish beds pectoral fins or wings are sold for human consumption fresh smoked or dried and salted rest of ray may also be processed to obtain fishmeal and liver oil international union for conservation of nature iucn has assessed roughtail stingray as of least concern worldwide while noting that as a large slow reproducing species it is susceptible to population depletion in northwestern atlantic roughtail stingray is listed under least concern it is not targeted or utilized by commercial fisheries though inconsequential numbers are captured incidentally in trawls and on demersal longlines historically it was sometimes ground up for fertilizer in mediterranean intensive fishing occurs in habitat of roughtail stingray and it is caught incidentally by artisanal and commercial fishers using trawls longlines gillnets and handlines though no specific data is available on this species declines of other species and its intrinsic susceptibility to depletion have led it to be assessed as near threatened in region in southwestern atlantic roughtail stingray and other large rays are heavily fished using demersal trawls gillnets longlines and hook and line this fishing pressure is liable to increase due to growing commercial interest in using large stingrays for minced fish products anecdotal reports suggest that landings of this species are decreasing leading to a regional assessment of near threatened references
