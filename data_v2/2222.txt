character in saga who is also described as being from island sources main source for ljotolfr is orkneyinga saga which was compiled sometime around 1200 by an unknown icelander saga is thought to have been based upon poetry oral tradition and other written material it can be summed up as an account of lives of many of earls of orkney between 9th and 13th centuries according to research fellow ian beuermann saga is useful not for specific events it describes but rather for what it reveals about ideas shaping texts during periods of composition or revision for example it is possible that even one of main characters of saga sveinn asleifarson never existed or at least that historical sveinn differed from saga s portrayal of him another source which mentions ljotolfr is s 17th century latin

originally from hebrides saga also states that he was from a good family williams 2007 p 139 links to clan macleod captain f w l thomas a 19th century antiquarian proposed that ljotolfr was eponymous progenitor of clan macleod however today accepted understanding is that clan s eponymous ancestor is another man leod who flourished about a century after ljotolfr this webpage cited leod s name and modern surname macleod are considered to be ultimately derived from old norse personal name ljotr webpage cited following book for surname mcleod this name is derived from old west norse word ljotr meaning foul ugly misshapen personal name ljotolfr is composed of two elements first liut is derived from germanic word meaning light shining second element is derived from a germanic word meaning wolf this webpage cited and also see also while current understanding of leod s ancestry does not include a man named ljotolfr 20th century clan historian alick morrison considered it possible that ljotolfr could be an ancestor of leod albeit on his distaff side morrison even suggested that leod s name could have been derived from ljotolfr this webpage cited vigfusson 1887 pp xxxvii xxxviii thumb thomas proposed connection between ljotolfr and thorketill macleods have two main branches siol scottish gaelic seed of tormod and siol thorcaill seed of torcall siol thorcaill was dominant family on lewis from late middle ages until end of 16th century thomas 1879 80 pp 369 370 379 gaelic names tormod and torcall are derived from old norse names thormodr and thorketill hanks hodges 2006 pp 207 263 397 410 thomas noted that these names were also those of two men with lewis connections who are both recorded in 13th century kings saga hakonar saga hakonarsonar one of these men was thorketill who according to saga was slain near isle of skye in about year 1230 thomas proposed that this man could be a grandson of ljotolfr vigfusson 1887 pp xxxvii xxxviii another man who appears in saga thormodr thorkelsson was forced to flee lewis leaving behind his wife retainers and goods according to thomas this shows that thormodr was a resident on island thomas noted that thormodr thorkelsson was married in about 1231 and on assumption that each generation could be estimated to be 30 years thomas gave thormodr s birth at 1201 his supposed father thorketill at 1171 thorketill s father thormodr at 1141 and this man s father at 1111 thomas concluded that elder thormodr would have been born at about time ljotolfr flourished on lewis thomas 1874 76 pp 506 507 see also history of
