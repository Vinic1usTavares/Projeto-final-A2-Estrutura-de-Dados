however his overall performance with browns proved uneven and his two season batting average was just 241 on may 17 1895 youngstown daily vindicator reported that hogan had been farmed out as a center fielder to indianapolis hoosiers a club connected to well organized western league predecessor of american league vindicator added at any time by giving a proper notification st louis team of which

chris von der ahe reclaims his pet hogan s obituary stated that at some point in his playing career he set a record for baserunning several sources trace this record to a field day event held in indianapolis in 1895 when he reportedly rounded bases in 13 2 seconds world almanac and encyclopedia 1906 for instance reported that hogan lowered base running record in 1895 noting that t he distance around bases is 120 yards in january 1906 sporting life reported that hogan had taken steps to have base running record awarded to him report added under proper conditions hogan turned route in 13 1 5 seconds at indianapolis in 1895 some observers questioned veracity of record however in 1907 for instance washington post sports columnist j ed grillo conceded that hogan was a great sprinter but described his unofficial record as out of reason grillo who argued that fastest runners in baseball failed to come anywhere near mark lent his support to an official record of 14 1 that had been set more recently by eastern league player wally clement an article published in washington herald days earlier also raised questions about hogan s baserunning record in this case however writer claimed that most authentic record had been set by harry berthrong in 1860s article stated that while hogan was said to have beaten berthrong s base circling record of 13 2 5 seconds by a fifth of a second this alleged feat was not performed under official sanction one year earlier in 1906 berthrong himself weighed in on debate according to an article that appeared in sporting life in march of that year

as saying in an interview three stop watches were held over me slowest giving me 14 1 4 retired player added i am skeptical about this man hogan doing bases in 13 1 5 nobody but an arthur duffey could possibly do it and i doubt if he could for reasons that are unclear article indicated that hogan claimed to round bases in 1889 six earlier than other reports a similar description of hogan s claim appeared elsewhere in same edition of sporting life a brief news item suggested he claimed to set record in indianapolis in 80 s baseball historian jon daly traced hogan s contested record to 1898 he speculated that ben morgan an official of national association disputed that claim when doing a study of field day records most widely accepted national baserunning record was set by swanson who rounded bases in 13 4 seconds in 1929 despite questions surrounding hogan s baserunning record he became popularly known as indianapolis ringer newspaper reports suggest he defended his position as baserunning champion of western league in various pre game competitions on august 2 1895 vindicator noted that outfielder had a rival for base running honors in western league in george nichol of who it is claimed can get down to first quicker than hogan article added a race between two is talked of then on august 17 1895 vindicator reported that hogan had defeated detroit outfielder frank tower

baserunning abilities article noted that outfielder had offered to match himself to run 100 yards for 500 a side against any player in national league meanwhile his batting evidently continued to improve on may 24 1896 an article in st paul minnesota globe indicated hogan performed exceptionally well at bat during a contest between hoosiers and st paul saints marty hogan through an inadvertent mix up of and baseball tried to hammer face off ball which had other hoosiers article stated and when marty s work was done ball was out of lot and he was on second base at some point in 1896 season

hogan had performed poorly in a contest between hoosiers and local ball club marty hogan made a bad fumble and then looked up at sky to see if it had moved while he was locating ball paper reported it

dayton during upcoming 1898 season marty hogan s contract with dayton is such that he cannot be reserved as are rest of players article stated unless marty has a better offer to play with some other team it is safe to say that he will be with dayton next year further research is required to determine how long hogan continued to play as an outfielder in minor leagues his obituary indicated that he also worked as a major league trainer during his playing career he apparently received at least one serious injury in february 1903 sporting life reported that former baseball player s friends were anxious to get him appointed on staff of american league umpires article added hogan has suffered from operations to remove portions of his breast bone which was injured in a collision during a

that by march hogan had signed his outfield players accepting terms being curt elson blount and miller further research is needed to determine zanesville infants league ranking at close of 1908 season but available information shows that team neither won championship nor placed as a runner up more information is available on hogan s dissatisfaction with his situation in zanesville which evidently stemmed from increasing limits on his control over club an article that appeared in pittsburgh gazette times in december 1908 described hogan s reasons for leaving organization there were too many directors connected with zanesville club to suit hogan as each one had his own idea of how a club should be run paper reported as hogan has his own which did not exactly coincide with numerous

while red roses pulled out of a mid season slump prevailed with a 72 38 record in an article regarding this outcome sporting life stated that nothing can be found to cast discredit upon lancaster team or its popular manager marty hogan paper added with a team that never stood high in club hitting or fielding marty pulled them through and anchored them in second place which position they attained more by dint of their cleverness in inside work than with their prowess with stick or in field in december 1910 a little more than two months after article appeared hogan reportedly set down roots in lancaster opening a cigar shop and billiard hall in city his relationship with red roses would not last more than another season however in 1911 hogan s final year as manager of lancaster team club

that hogan began 1911 season with relatively modest expectations paper stated hogan is not promising a pennant winning team but he does promise a good team and means to fight hard for pennant again team s challenges included salary limits that sharply limited its capacity to attract more experienced players earlier that year tri state league s imposition of 1 900 limits for individual salaries had created a stir throughout lancaster where fans resented fact that outgoing clubs had been permitted to vote on an issue that would not affect them club president john h myers efforts to persuade league to advance individual salary limit proved unsuccessful and hogan was directed to secure best team that can be secured under circumstances in january 1911 hogan had announced he would cut out exhibition games and devote entire preparatory season to hard practice hogan added that exhibitions do not pay club and do harm to unseasoned players ultimately 1911 league championship went to a

based franchise scheduled to compete in league u s baseball league also established teams in chicago cleveland pittsburgh new york city reading pennsylvania richmond virginia and washington d c following month however hogan was evidently replaced by hugh mckinnon who was described in an april new york times article as manager of league s cincinnati franchise an article that appeared in new york times several weeks earlier suggested that mckinnon was originally tapped as manager of league s washington franchise same article also pointed out that ex major leaguer george browne had been approached by washington club in end browne was named as head of washington team when mckinnon was appointed manager of cincinnati club while these developments shed some light on outcome reasons for hogan s replacement as manager of cincinnati franchise remain uncertain in any event league did not survive for long sports historian rudolf k observed that u s baseball league stressed inherent good of baseball for all individuals and communities and indicated that it wished to conduct its business in accepted capitalist style free competition in marketplace new league however quickly incurred scorn and hostility of baseball establishment burdened with weak leadership limited financing poor attendance and a lack of skillful players u s baseball league folded after about one month of action

old friends paper stated marty wound up season with zanesville and has not definitely decided upon his plans for coming season ultimately hogan went to zanesville where he managed zanesville flood sufferers in 1913 team s nickname was evidently inspired by a massive flood that had devastated cities and towns throughout central and southern ohio including zanesville in spring of 1913 in april 1913 sporting life noted that zanesville club would stick to circuit despite fact that city was hit hard by recent floods according to paper zanesville s ballpark was completely destroyed but games will be played at fair grounds earlier in january 1913 flood sufferers pulled out from 12 team central league and joined newly formed interstate league which included eight clubs according to sporting life new league was expected to include teams from akron youngstown canton steubenville wheeling and either johnstown or mckeesport in february paper confirmed that interstate league which included johnstown not mckeesport had achieved class b status on basis of eight cities combined populations sporting life which estimated total population of league s participating cities at 412 415 noted that youngstown with a population of 79 066 was largest city in interstate league later that month paper reported that new league s salary limit of 2000 makes it imperative for each club to hold down expenses in every way consequently marty hogan of zanesville club will be only bench manager in league and he knows how to save his salary in various ways during hogan s tenure as manager of zanesville flood sufferers club took advantage of at least one opportunity to test their skills against a major league club sports writer walter leconte observed that on june 15 1913 zanesville team participated in an in season exhibition game with new york giants when umpire declared game forfeited after a disagreement with giants player fred merkle hogan ordered game continued so fans could see a 9 inning baseball game leconte added that hogan even assumed umpiring duties and game was then concluded giants won game with a score of 5 4 reliable information on zanesville club s overall performance is currently unavailable but an associated press report indicated team had disbanded by late july 1913 at zanesville hogan signed future cleveland indians pitcher samuel pond sad sam jones to his first professional contract baseball historian alexander edelman noted that jones gained valuable experience as a member of zanesville club including a chance to play against giants in an
