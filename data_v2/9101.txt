typhoon krovanh known in philippines as typhoon nina was a moderate tropical cyclone that caused a swath of damage stretching from philippines to vietnam in august 2003 fifteenth named storm and sixth typhoon in western pacific that year krovanh originated from a tropical disturbance within monsoon trough on august 13 despite rather favorable conditions initial tropical depression did not intensify significantly and degenerated into a remnant low on august 18 however these remnants were able to reorganize and system was reclassified as a tropical cyclone a day later intensification was rather rapid upon storm s reformation depression reached tropical storm status on august 20 and then typhoon intensity two days later shortly after krovanh made landfall on luzon at peak intensity with winds of 120 km h 75 mph typhoon emerged into south china sea as a much weaker tropical storm though it was able to restrengthen over warm waters once again at typhoon intensity krovanh clipped haiyan before moving over leizhou peninsula on its way to a final landfall near cam pha vietnam on august 25 quick weakening due to land interaction occurred as krovanh moved across northern vietnam where storm met its demise following day krovanh first struck philippines resulting in heavy rainfall and displacing approximately 1 000 families flooding caused severe damage and killed one person krovanh s effects were much more severe in china in hong kong eleven people were injured and isolated flooding occurred as a result of typhoon s outer rainbands however guangdong province hainan province and guangxi were chinese regions most extensively impacted typhoon brought record wind gusts into guangxi in those three regions combined 13 000 homes were estimated to have collapsed and a large swath of farmland was damaged two people were killed in china and economic losses approximated at y 2 1 billion us 253 million due to its positioning and track of all areas in vietnam only country s more northern regions were impacted by krovanh flash flooding occurred in those regions and 1 000 homes were flattened one person was killed and five others were injured in vietnam overall typhoon was responsible for deaths of four persons meteorological history origin of typhoon krovanh can be traced back to an area of persistent convection well east of chuuk state on august 13 over course of day disturbance gradually consolidated within favorable atmospheric conditions and at 1800 utc that day japan meteorological agency jma assessed system to have organized sufficiently to be classified as a tropical depression shower activity was suppressed by a nearby upper level low for much of storm s early existence however at 0600 utc on august 15 system was classified by joint typhoon warning center jtwc as a tropical depression depression tracked northwestward under influence of a nearby ridge strengthening and development of tropical cyclone was very minimal over next few days and on august 18 both tracking agencies discontinued monitoring system due to lack of an identifiable low level circulation center redevelopment of disturbance was a possibility following its degeneration and on august 19 convection once again increased prompting jtwc to resume monitoring system as a tropical depression at 0900 utc with jma following suit nine hours later due to slight wind shear depression s circulation center remained slightly displaced from stronger convection at 0600 utc on august 20 jtwc determined that disturbance had intensified to reach tropical storm status upon 1200 utc upgrade to such an intensity by jma tropical cyclone was assigned name krovanh subsequently following reclassification krovanh began to quickly intensify as it tracked in a somewhat southwest bearing by august 21 tropical storm had begun to develop a banding eye feature at 0600 utc that day jma upgraded krovanh to severe tropical storm intensity whilst jtwc indicated that storm intensified into a typhoon on august 22 jma reassessed krovanh as a typhoon and determined that storm had reached its peak intensity with winds of 120 km h 75 mph meanwhile jtwc analyzed storm to have peaked with one minute sustained winds of 165 km h 105 mph this was followed by storm making landfall on luzon just north of isabela at 1115 utc later that day thumb tropical storm krovanh intensifying off philippines on august 21 alt image of a tropical cyclone to right of a group of small landmasses tropical cyclone is characterized by a sprawling mass of though no eye is evident land interaction during krovanh s passage of luzon significantly weakened cyclone and upon system s reemergence into south china sea by 2000 utc on august 22 krovanh was classified as only a tropical storm by jma redevelopment was rather rapid following emergence and just four hours later storm was redesignated as a severe tropical storm on august 24 storm began to develop tight banding and reformed its prior banding eye feature which later organized into a well defined eye later that day krovanh clipped northeastern coast of hainan before crossing leizhou peninsula on august 25 during this time jma upgraded krovanh back to typhoon intensity and indicated that storm was reaching a secondary peak in strength jtwc indicated a similar development as typhoon traversed gulf of tonkin however according to jma krovanh waned into a severe tropical storm shortly before storm made its final landfall on cam pha vietnam at approximately 1500 utc on august 25 over land krovanh deteriorated rapidly and both agencies ceased monitoring system on august 26 while it was well northwest of hanoi preparations and impact china thumb left tropical storm krovanh in south china sea on august 24 as krovanh was approaching philippines taiwan s central weather bureau cautioned residents of island against strong winds and warning ships in bashi channel after typhoon entered south china sea sea warnings were issued for areas offshore hainan additional warnings were issued and expanded as krovanh moved closer to chinese coast in preparation for storm shipping routes across qiongzhou strait were suspended while security measures for river dykes and reservoirs were strengthened in both hainan and guangdong in hong kong hong kong observatory issued a standby signal no 1 on august 23 which was upgraded to a strong wind signal no 3 at around noon following day all warning signals in hong kong were discontinued on august 25 in guangzhou 15 flights were cancelled in anticipation of krovanh stranding 500 passengers in hong kong krovanh s outer rainbands brought squally weather coupled with strong winds rainfall in hong kong area peaked at 232 mm 9 13 in on high island hong kong much of which occurred on august 25 other rainfall totals of at least 70 mm 2 75 in were measured over a majority of country gusts peaked at 144 km h 89 mph on cheung chau strong winds and gusts uprooted trees and caused scaffolding at an estate to collapse in province 11 people were injured due to effects from krovanh a ferry service and four bus routes were temporarily suspended following storm guangdong and hainan provinces as well as guangxi were regions of china most heavily impacted by krovanh in zhanjiang guangdong two people were killed economic losses from western guangdong alone amounted to y 1 2 billion us 144 million in hainan heavy rainfall was reported peaking at 394 mm 15 51 in in jinjiang roughly 1 700 homes collapsed and 16 reservoirs were contaminated and destroyed widespread power outages occurred impacting several neighborhoods strong winds also toppled coconut palms direct economic losses in province totaled y 683 million us 82 million beihai city was city most severely affected in guangxi beginning on august 25 entire population of beihai temporarily suffered a water shortage in city alone losses reached y 988 million us 119 million in weizhou island a weather station reported a wind gust of 190 km h 119 mph this would be strongest wind gust reported in guangxi since 1982 overall a total of 13 000 residences collapsed and of farmland were impacted across china total economic loss was in excess of y 2 1 billion us 253 million elsewhere striking luzon in philippines on august 22 krovanh brought heavy precipitation rainfall in philippines peaked at 342 mm 13 46 in in dagupan other high rainfall totals included 263 mm 10 35 in in baguio and 203 mm 7 99 in in iba zambales flooding rains displaced 1000 families on archipelago and killed a girl although full damage reports were never released damages were estimated at p 4 3 million us 73 000 and of severe extent typhoon krovanh was strongest tropical cyclone to affect vietnam in 2003 one person was killed in mong cai after their house collapsed hundreds of other homes were unroofed and traffic was halted trees were also uprooted and power outages resulted from strong winds particularly in quang ninh province heavy rains triggered flash flooding in northern vietnam five additional persons were injured by flying debris about 1 000 homes in vietnam were flattened by storm see also typhoon koryn 1993
