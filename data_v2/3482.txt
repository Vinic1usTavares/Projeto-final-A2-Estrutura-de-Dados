niobium formerly known as columbium is a chemical element with symbol nb formerly cb and atomic number 41 niobium is a light grey crystalline and ductile transition metal pure niobium has a hardness similar to that of pure titanium and it has similar ductility to iron niobium oxidizes in earth s atmosphere very slowly hence its application in jewelry as a hypoallergenic alternative to nickel niobium is often found in minerals pyrochlore and columbite hence former name columbium its name comes from greek mythology specifically niobe who was daughter of tantalus namesake of tantalum name reflects great similarity between two elements in their physical and chemical properties making them difficult to distinguish knapp brian 2002 francium to polonium atlantic europe publishing company p 40 english chemist charles hatchett reported a new element similar to tantalum in 1801 and named it columbium in 1809 english chemist william hyde wollaston wrongly concluded that tantalum and columbium were identical german chemist heinrich rose determined in 1846 that tantalum ores contain a second element which he named niobium in 1864 and 1865 a series of scientific findings clarified that niobium and columbium were same element as distinguished from tantalum and for a century both names were used interchangeably niobium was officially adopted as name of element in 1949 but name columbium remains in current use in metallurgy in united states it was not until early 20th century that niobium was first used commercially brazil is leading producer of niobium and ferroniobium an alloy of 60 70 niobium with iron niobium is used mostly in alloys largest part in special steel such as that used in gas pipelines although these alloys contain a maximum of 0 1 small percentage of niobium enhances strength of steel temperature stability of niobium containing superalloys is important for its use in jet and rocket engines niobium is used in various superconducting materials these superconducting alloys also containing titanium and tin are widely used in superconducting magnets of mri scanners other applications of niobium include welding nuclear industries electronics optics numismatics and jewelry in last two applications low toxicity and iridescence produced by anodization are highly desired properties niobium is considered a technology critical element history thumb

0 5 picture of a hellenistic sculpture representing niobe by giorgio sommer alt black and white image of a marmor sculpture of a bowing woman with a child nestling in her lap niobium was identified by english chemist charles hatchett in 1801 he found a new element in a mineral sample that had been sent to england from connecticut united states in 1734 by john winthrop f r s grandson of john winthrop younger and named mineral columbite and new element columbium after columbia poetical name for united states columbium discovered by hatchett was probably a mixture of new element with tantalum subsequently there was considerable confusion over difference between columbium niobium and closely related tantalum in 1809 english chemist william hyde wollaston compared oxides derived from both columbium columbite with a density 5 918 g cm3 and tantalum tantalite with a density over 8 g cm3 and concluded that two oxides despite significant difference in density were identical thus he kept name tantalum this conclusion was disputed in 1846 by german chemist heinrich rose who argued that there were two different elements in tantalite sample and named them after children of tantalus niobium from niobe and pelopium from pelops this confusion arose from minimal observed differences between tantalum and niobium claimed new elements pelopium ilmenium and were in fact identical to niobium or mixtures of niobium and tantalum differences between tantalum and niobium were unequivocally demonstrated in 1864 by christian wilhelm and henri etienne sainte claire deville as well as louis j troost who determined formulas of some of compounds in 1865 and finally by swiss chemist jean charles galissard de marignac in 1866 who all proved that there were only two elements articles on ilmenium continued to appear until 1871 de marignac was first to prepare metal in 1864 when he reduced niobium chloride by heating it in an atmosphere of hydrogen although de marignac was able to produce tantalum free niobium on a larger scale by 1866 it was not until early 20th century that niobium was used in incandescent lamp filaments first commercial application this use quickly became obsolete through replacement of niobium with tungsten which has a higher melting point that niobium improves strength of steel was first discovered in 1920s and this application remains its predominant use in 1961 american physicist eugene and coworkers at bell labs discovered that niobium tin continues to exhibit superconductivity in presence of strong electric currents and magnetic fields et al 1993 gives a critical point at currents of 150 and magnetic fields of 8 8 tesla making it first material to support high currents and fields necessary for useful high power magnets and electrical power machinery this discovery enabled two decades later production of long multi strand cables wound into coils to create large powerful electromagnets for rotating machinery particle accelerators and particle detectors naming element columbium symbol cb was name originally bestowed by hatchett upon his discovery of metal in 1801 name reflected that type specimen of ore came from america columbia this name remained in use in american journals last paper published by american chemical society with columbium in its title dates from 1953 while niobium was used in europe to end this confusion name niobium was chosen for element 41 at 15th conference of union of chemistry in amsterdam in 1949 a year later this name was officially adopted by international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac after 100 years of controversy despite chronological precedence of name columbium this was a compromise of sorts iupac accepted tungsten instead of wolfram in deference to north american usage and niobium instead of columbium in deference to european usage while many us chemical societies and government organizations typically use official iupac name some metallurgists and metal societies still use original american name columbium characteristics physical niobium is a lustrous grey ductile paramagnetic metal in group 5 of periodic table see table with an electron configuration in outermost shells atypical for group 5 this can be observed in neighborhood of ruthenium 44 rhodium 45 and palladium 46 z element no of electrons shell 23 vanadium 2 8 11 2 41 niobium 2 8 18 12 1 73 tantalum 2 8 18 32 11 2 105 dubnium 2 8 18 32 32 11 2 although it is thought to have a body centered cubic crystal structure from absolute zero to its melting point high resolution measurements of thermal expansion along three crystallographic axes reveal which are inconsistent with a cubic structure therefore further research and discovery in this area is expected niobium becomes a superconductor at cryogenic temperatures at atmospheric pressure it has highest critical temperature of elemental superconductors at 9 2 k niobium has greatest magnetic penetration depth of any element in addition it is one of three elemental type ii superconductors along with vanadium and technetium superconductive properties are strongly dependent on purity of niobium metal when very pure it is comparatively soft and ductile but impurities make it harder metal has a low capture cross section for thermal neutrons thus it is used in nuclear industries where neutron transparent structures are desired chemical metal takes on a bluish tinge when exposed to air at room temperature for extended periods despite a high melting point in elemental form 2 468 degc it has a lower density than other refractory metals furthermore it is corrosion resistant exhibits superconductivity properties and forms dielectric oxide layers niobium is slightly less electropositive and more compact than its predecessor in periodic table zirconium whereas it is virtually identical in size to heavier tantalum atoms as a result of lanthanide contraction as a result niobium s chemical properties are very similar to those for tantalum which appears directly below niobium in periodic table although its corrosion resistance is not as outstanding as that of tantalum lower price and greater availability make niobium attractive for less demanding applications such as vat linings in chemical plants isotopes niobium in earth s crust comprises one stable isotope 93nb by 2003 at least 32 radioisotopes had been synthesized ranging in atomic mass from 81 to 113 most stable of these is 92nb with a half life of 34 7 million years one of least stable is with an estimated half life of 30 milliseconds isotopes that are lighter than stable 93nb tend to decay by b decay and those that are heavier tend to decay by b decay with some exceptions and have minor b delayed proton emission decay paths decays by electron capture and positron emission and 92nb decays by both b and b decay at least 25 nuclear isomers have been described ranging in atomic mass from 84 to 104 within this range only and do not have isomers most stable of niobium s isomers is with a half life of 16 13 years least stable isomer is with a half life of 103 ns all of niobium s isomers decay by isomeric transition or beta decay except which has a minor electron capture branch occurrence niobium is estimated to be 34th most common element in earth s crust with 20 ppm some think that abundance on earth is much greater and that element s high density has concentrated it in earth s core free element is not found in nature but niobium occurs in combination with other elements in minerals minerals that contain
