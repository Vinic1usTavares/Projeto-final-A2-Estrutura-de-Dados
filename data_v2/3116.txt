galleria with his friend tim devaughn nixon played danny dyson son of miles and tarissa dyson production development thumb home of legal guardians of john connor talk of a potential sequel to terminator arose soon after its release but several outstanding issues precluded such a production there were technical limitations regarding computer generated imagery an aspect of film essential to creation of t 1000 terminator production of james cameron s 1989 film abyss provided proof of concept needed to satisfactorily resolve technical concerns perhaps more serious were intellectual property disputes between hemdale film corporation which owned 50 of rights to franchise and stymied efforts to produce a sequel and carolco pictures given that hemdale was then experiencing financial problems schwarzenegger urged mario kassar head of carolco to bid for rights i reminded mario that this is something that we ve been looking for four years and that it should be him that should go all out no matter what it takes to make this deal carolco eventually paid hemdale 5 million for franchise in 1990 resolving legal gridlock end of legal disputes coincided with willingness and availability of cameron schwarzenegger and hamilton to participate in sequel schwarzenegger who portrayed terminator in first film commented i always felt we should continue story of terminator i told jim that right after we finished first film he and hamilton reprised their roles from first terminator film after an extensive casting search 13 year old edward furlong was selected from hundreds of candidates to portray john connor robert patrick was chosen to play t 1000 terminator because his slender physique would create a contrast between advanced t 1000 and schwarzenegger s older t 800 patrick had previously appeared in action feature die hard 2 but furlong had no formal acting experience joe morton was picked to portray miles dyson a cyberdyne scientist whose work would eventually lead to creation of skynet calling themselves t2 productions james and co producers stephanie austin and b j rack rented an office in north hollywood before starting to assemble crew adam greenberg who worked on terminator and ghost 1990 became director of photography while joseph nemec iii who had worked with cameron on abyss was tasked with production design team conducted a national search for a steel mill suitable for film s climax and selected a dormant kaiser steel mill in fontana california after weeks of negotiations locating cyberdyne building was more difficult as site was to host numerous stunts shootouts and explosions an industrial park in fremont california was eventually rented for duration of film s production cameron and william wisher completed 140 page screenplay draft on may

cinemascore reported that audiences gave film a rare a grade montreal film journal called it one of best crafted hollywood action flicks syd field lauded plot of terminator 2 writing every scene sets up next like links in a chain of dramatic action roger ebert writing for chicago sun times gave film 3 5 stars out of 4 and wrote schwarzenegger s genius as a movie star is to find roles that build on rather than undermine his physical and vocal characteristics hal hinson reviewer for washington post was also positive writing that no one in movies today can match cameron s talent for this kind of hyperbolic big screen action cameron who directed first terminator and aliens doesn t just slam us over head with action in staging movie s gigantic set pieces he has an eye for both grandeur and beauty he possesses that rare director s gift for transforming objects he shoots so that we see for example lyrical muscularity of an 18 wheel truck because of cameron movie is opposite of its terminator character it s a machine with a human heart gene siskel of chicago tribune was enthusiastic about film giving it 3 1 2 stars thanks to some truly spectacular and at times mystifying special effects as well as some surprisingly solid acting this is one terrific action picture more enjoyable than original halliwell s film guide also rated film as an improvement on its predecessor giving it two stars out of four and describing it as a thunderous high voltage action movie with dazzling special effects that provide a distraction from often silly narrative halliwell s film guide 13th edition writing for time richard corliss was far less pleased stating that film was a humongous visionary parable that intermittently and ultimately disappoints t2 is half of a terrific movie wrong half leonard maltin gave movie only 2 1 2 stars stating like so many sequels it lacks freshness of first film and gives us no one to root for in guardian peter bradshaw agreed saying of terminator 2
