praised performance abilities of both artists explaining when left to jay z s own devices on stage rapper is forceful and beguiling it takes little for him to have thousands waving their hands to tom ford as he looks dapper in honour of designer but when beyonce rises up out of stage in a denim military outfit to question bad bitch and then storms into run world girls track s sentiment couldn t resound more without doubt she lives up to her hype as one of world s best performers slick movement tight choreography innocent attitude and effortless vocals instantly escalate atmosphere of show
