nbr 224 and 420 classes consisted of six steam locomotives of 4 4 0 wheel arrangement built by north british railway nbr in 1871 and 1873 224 had three claims to fame it was first inside cylinder 4 4 0 engine to run in great britain it was locomotive involved in tay bridge disaster and after rebuilding in 1885 it was only compound expansion locomotive on nbr and one of just three tandem compounds in britain intended for express passenger trains on edinburgh glasgow edinburgh carlisle and burntisland dundee routes they handled these well when trains from london to edinburgh began to be forwarded via carlisle over nbr in mid 1876 these heavier trains were beyond locomotives capabilities and they had to be removed from front line service on carlisle line rebuilt between 1885 and 1897 they remained in service until 1914 19 history thomas wheatley became locomotive superintendent of north british railway nbr at start of february 1867 during his tenure of seven years he provided nbr with 185 new locomotives but only eight of these were suitable for hauling express passenger trains first two of which were 2 4 0s built in 1869 141 class which were considered to be very good engines in 1871 wheatley followed these with two 4 4 0s nos 224 and 264 which were built at nbr s cowlairs locomotive works these two locomotives formed 224 class a leading bogie was chosen because of preponderance of sharp curves on nbr bogie wheels were quite small at diameter and had solid centres without spokes bogie centre was fixed as opposed to adams type used later by nbr and bogie wheelbase was coupled wheels were diameter and other principal dimensions were cylinders diameter by stroke coupled wheelbase no 224 was first inside frame inside cylinder 4 4 0 to run in great britain and predated g swr 6 class by some two years latter being introduced in july 1873 this layout 4 4 0 with inside frames and inside cylinders became widespread across most of great britain with great western railway being only main line company which did not eventually possess type there had been earlier 4 4 0 designs on other railways but these either had outside cylinders such as nos 160 161 built 1860 of stockton and darlington railway or outside frames such as whitby bogies 1864 65 of north eastern railway 224 class were used on express passenger trains no 264 being used both on waverley route between edinburgh and and on line between edinburgh and glasgow no 224 was used in fife which in days before construction of forth bridge was an isolated part of nbr system 224 class were followed in 1873 by four locomotives of wheatley s 420 class nos 420 3 these differed from 224 class in several respects bogie wheels were diameter instead of coupled wheelbase was instead of dome was mounted on boiler barrel instead of firebox and rear wheel were shaped to wheel instead of being square topped they were intended for use on waverley route over which an increase of traffic was anticipated midland railway mr were at time building their settle carlisle line this route not yet being open and english traffic being entirely in hands of london and north western railway who worked closely in tandem with caledonian railway nbr s main rival trains over waverley route were comparatively light and well within capabilities of 420 class mr opened settle and carlisle line on 1 may 1876 and a through service using that route between london st pancras and edinburgh waverley was introduced at same time north of trains were operated by nbr over their waverley route each company used its own locomotives over their respective lines and initially locomotives used by nbr were 420 class no 421 being equipped with westinghouse brake as were three other locomotives at a cost of ps90 or ps as of per engine brake with which mr carriages were then fitted but these locomotives proved insufficiently powerful a second engine often being needed to assist in climbing gradients particularly those at falahill between and and at between and wheatley s successor dugald drummond offered opinion that nbr express locomotives of period were like skinny chickens all legs and wings as a result drummond designed a new class of 4 4 0 476 class which began to displace wheatley 4 4 0s from through trains in 1877 and which were capable of maintaining schedule of 2 hr 35 min for with three intermediate stops 420 class remained on waverley route but were used on local trains which were lighter than through trains from england no 224 and tay bridge disaster thumb right no 224 following its recovery from firth of tay in 1880 until opening of forth bridge in 1890 passengers from edinburgh to dundee would cross firth of forth by a ferry from granton which connected with trains at burntisland further north firth of tay had been bridged in 1878 and trains could travel through from to and onward to on 28 december 1879 regular engine for 1 30 p m mail train from dundee to burntisland no 89 of 88 class an 0 4 2t failed and no 224 which was based at dundee and spare at time was called out to work train it did so without incident on southbound run but when working 5 20 p m northbound service later in day due to arrive at dundee a little before 7 30 it was on tay bridge when shortly after 7 13 p m latter collapsed driver david mitchell and stoker fireman john marshall of no 224 had no warning of impending disaster and neither closed regulator nor applied brakes they were among 75 persons killed despite fall locomotive was relatively undamaged being protected by bridge girders which formed a cage around train as they fell together in april 1880 an attempt to recover locomotive failed when chains broke two days later a second attempt also failed because salvage equipment broke after locomotive had been brought to surface one week later it was recovered and stood on bank of tay until it was sent to cowlairs on its own wheels for repairs after which it was returned to traffic it gained nickname diver as a result of its accident and difficult recovery after this drivers refused to take no 224 across second tay bridge which was built to a new design and opened in 1887 however on 29th anniversary of disaster 28 december 1908 no 224 was used on sunday evening mail to dundee via tay bridge rebuilding matthew holmes locomotive superintendent of nbr between 1882 and 1903 rebuilt no 224 as a four cylinder tandem compound in 1885 in this form low pressure cylinders which were diameter were mounted in position previously occupied by original cylinders above bogie centre and high pressure cylinders which were of diameter were placed in front of these common stroke remained at engine was given a modified form of joy valve gear boiler pressure was and grate area chief features of design had been patented no 16 967 of 1884 by w h nesbit or nisbet who was a cousin of holmes although not entirely successful it did somewhat better than only two other british tandem compounds great western railway nos 7 8 of 1886 although tandem compound system was more widely used in usa and russia no 224 was rebuilt back into simple expansion form during 1887 on nbr locomotives were generally rebuilt when their boilers wore out no 224 received two new boilers in course of its life one was fitted by drummond other by holmes holmes ultimately rebuilt all of locomotives other than no 224 nos 420 1 were rebuilt in 1887 nos 422 3 in 1890 and no 264 in 1893 no 224 then received its third rebuilding in 1897 in later years no 224 was used on secondary and branch line trains final years every six months nbr renumbered some of its older locomotives into a duplicate list in order to vacate numbers for new construction accordingly in 1913 nos 224 and 264 were placed on duplicate list becoming nos 1192 8 respectively nos 420 3 were similarly treated in 1914 becoming 1241 4 in same order no 1244 was withdrawn from service in 1914 others following in 1915 no 1241 1917 no 1198 1918 nos 1242 3 and 1919 no 1192 these were only classes of 4 4 0 on nbr to be completely withdrawn before 1923 grouping as such they were not among 183 locomotives of this wheel arrangement which were passed by nbr to london and north eastern railway when latter company was formed at start of 1923 by amalgamation of nbr with several other railways
