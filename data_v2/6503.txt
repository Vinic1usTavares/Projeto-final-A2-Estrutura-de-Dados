2011 and proceeds from sales helped to raise awareness to ways people can support independent labels that lost stock in pias recordings uk warehouse fire regarding inspiration behind remix hayden thorpe from wild beasts group told guardian of this match was perhaps what compelled us to take it on gaga in many ways is epitome of what we are not she is butcher to our butter knife essential thrill is always to keep eluding what is expected of us and what we expect of ourselves last of remix to be released was weeknd s take on marry night which featured illangelo thus earning him a co producer credit on it composition album opens with zedd remix of born this way which begins with some minimalist beat followed by loud synths and consists of a techno breakdown goldfrapp remix of judas follows as second track remix consists of industrial music and gaga s vocals are converted to a slow low key moan making it almost like a man s voice foster people remixed edge of glory and introduced a new break down from 3 20 time sequence producers weeknd and illangelo kept overall feel of marry night intact but introduced vocals by abel tesfaye of weeknd and a steely looping drum machine jason lipshultz from billboard described addition as directly conflict ing with gaga s m o but like so many of these remixes weeknd marries his vision of song to gaga s gorgeous voice without losing original s integrity tesfaye s voice can be heard in spots on song adding an occasional ooh yeah and a moan ultimately at 2 20 mark song collapses on itself and ditches percussion for infrequent piano notes remix of black jesus amen fashion retains most of composition of its original counterpart although it introduces a new synth by michael woods thus turning it into a rave trance track horrors remix of born this way album track bloody mary consisted of gaga s vocals fading in and out of sequence scheisse featured influences from knife song heartbeats 2003 as well as we like to party 1999 electric chapel s composition is completely changed by two door cinema altering dark mood of song to a fun and engaging one metronomy remix of you and i varies little from its original equivalent while dubstep is introduced in hurts remix of judas with a different conclusion sultan ned shepard s remix of edge of glory last track on album features pumping drums and slinking synths critical reception after its release born this way remix received mixed reviews from critics it earned an overall score of 57 out of 100 on review aggregator site metacritic jason lipshultz from billboard commented that album did not re invent anything new in terms of remix composition but instead gives less recognizable artists a platform to tinker with these complex pop schemes he added that album is not essential listening for non gaga diehards but electronica fans who have yet to drink mother monster kool aid will find plenty of produced club tracks to groove to album is a great avenue for fans to digest new versions of their favorite songs of year as well as discover artists that are trying to command audiences way gaga so masterfully does stephen thomas erlewine from allmusic gave album three out of five stars commenting that some remixes take considerable liberty ditching verses or hooks whatever catches their fancy so it s a remix album not for fairweather travelers but rather hardcore little monsters kind who love every gesture grand or small from gaga but it also displays enough imagination to appeal to those listeners who fall into neither camp and are only looking for some darkly elastic dance harley brown of consequence of sound website was impressed with diversity of remixes on album prompting him to comment that just in time for holiday season there s something for everyone on born this way remix and unlike many remix albums featuring one song reworked again and again this remix comprises a diverse tracklist to match diverse list of remixers jody rosen from rolling stone gave a mixed review of album wondering why remix album was necessary to be released in first place she nevertheless added that t he album has some diverting moments goldfrapp s down tempo judas is less a remix than a smart cover and weeknd and illangelo re imagine marry night as a strobe y atmospheric r b epic but there are two or three duds for each winner like bludgeoning scheisse a gratuitous exercise that strives to make a dance floor thumper out of a song that was born that way rosen s view was shared by paul rice from slant magazine who gave album a rating of two out of five stars rice s main complaint was that c artists cry out for remix treatment more than others usually those whose vocal talents are relatively straightforward and could benefit from extra fuss he added that gaga was not such an artist and that original born this way album in particular is too big and untamed full of too many of its own references and styles from springsteen to madonna as such it s best enjoyed on its own flawed bombastic terms nick levine reviewing album for bbc music felt that most of tracks are already available as digital downloads and cd singles so it s easy to dismiss born this way remix as inessential and yes a cash in but taken as a whole this release offers enough revelations to suggest original album is worth revisiting that additional purpose whether intentional or not feels at least partly fulfilled levine complimented weeknd and twin shadow s remixes while criticizing foster people and sultan ned shepard for their predictable remixes commercial performance in united kingdom born this way remix entered uk albums chart at number 77 for issue dated december 12 2011 in japan album sold 12 120 copies in its first
