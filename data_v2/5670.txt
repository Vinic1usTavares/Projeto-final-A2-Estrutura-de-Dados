thorfinn sigurdsson 1009 1065 also known as thorfinn mighty magnusson 2000 p 733 old norse thorfinnr inn riki was an 11th century earl of orkney he was youngest of five sons of earl sigurd hlodvirsson and only one resulting from sigurd s marriage to a daughter of malcolm ii of scotland he ruled alone as earl for about a third of time that he held title and jointly with one or more of his brothers or with his nephew rognvald brusason for remainder thorfinn married ingibiorg finnsdottir daughter of finn arnesson jarl of heimskringla of icelandic historian snorri sturluson and anonymous compiler of orkneyinga saga wrote that thorfinn was most powerful of all earls of orkney and that he ruled substantial territories beyond northern isles a sizeable part of latter saga s account concerns his wars with a king of scots named karl hundason whose identity is uncertain in his later years he went on a pilgrimage to rome and he was instrumental in making orkney and shetland part of mainstream christendom on his death in latter half of 11th century he was followed as earl by his sons paul and erlend there are numerous problems associated with chronology of thorfinn s life and in identifying his relationships to southern polities of kingdom of alba precursor to modern scotland and kingdom of moray his diplomacy with norwegian court has also been interpreted in various ways his life has been subject of various works of historical fiction sources sources for thorfinn s life are almost exclusively norse sagas which were written down long after time of events in his life they record main sources are st olaf s saga and more detailed orkneyinga saga which were first compiled in iceland in early 13th century much of information latter contains is hard to corroborate woolf 2007 p 242

thorkel fosterer as his tax gatherer in islands but einar had not forgotten their earlier dispute and thorkel again left islands in fear of his life returning to thorfinn s base in caithness probably

assistance of his grandfather king malcolm while brusi had only forces he could raise from his share of islands making any conflict a very unequal one brusi went to norway to have king olaf judge dispute and thorfinn joined him there brusi surrendered earldom to olaf who granted a third to each brother and kept a third for himself thorfinn attempted to use his relationship with king of scots as a means to avoid acknowledging olaf as his overlord in orkney and shetland but olaf threatened to appoint another to rule thorfinn s share following thorkel fosterer s advice thorfinn agreed to

norway where king magnus supplied him with ships and men he returned to islands facing thorfinn and kalf arnesson in a sea battle which arnor skald commemorated in verse battle went rognvald s way to begin with but in end he was defeated and forced again to seek refuge with king magnus orkneyinga saga c 26 king magnus offered to fit out another expedition for rognvald but he decided to take just one ship and a picked crew he sailed to shetland in winter and learning that thorfinn was staying on a farm on orkney mainland with only a few men he set out at once to attack him rognvald s men surprised thorfinn and set farm ablaze saga says that thorfinn had to break down a wall and escape carrying his wife in his arms flying south to caithness for safety rognvald ruled in kirkwall over winter believing thorfinn dead but in spring while staying on papa stronsay thorfinn and his men turned tables taking rognvald by surprise just as he had surprised thorfinn rognvald escaped house thorfinn had surrounded but was tracked down given away by barking of his lap dog and killed by thorkel fosterer orkneyinga saga c 25 29 orkneyinga saga offers this assessment of rognvald everyone agrees that of all earls of orkney he was most popular and gifted and his death was mourned by many orkneyinga saga c 29 pilgrimage thumb st magnus church birsay site is a possible location for

attack on rognvald magnus was at war with danish king sweyn estridsson and died before he could take any action magnus s uncle and successor harald hardrada was more friendly towards thorfinn and made peace accepting thorfinn s gifts orkneyinga saga cc 30 31 thorfinn had two sons both by his wife ingibiorg and unlike a number of his predecessors he appears to have married only once furthermore unlike his brothers thorfinn had been raised as a christian among signs of changes in orkney society was thorfinn s pilgrimage to rome which took place after his meeting with king harald probably beginning in 1048 saga says that he travelled through saxony meeting with emperor henry iii on journey it is thought that he also met with archbishop adalbert of hamburg bremen crawford 1987 pp 80 81 orkneyinga saga suggests that as a result of thorfinn s request first bishop of orkney was appointed at about this time woolf 2007 p 309 named thorulf he may have been same person as bishop of isles crawford 1987 pp 81 82 watt 1994 p 109 110 original seat of bishops of orkney was thorfinn s new christ kirk at birsay or perhaps brough of birsay near earl s palace where thorfinn had his residence in his later years orkneyinga saga cc 31 2008 pp 85 87 death and legacy orkneyinga saga dates thorfinn s death no more precisely than placing it towards end of harald sigurdsson s reign who died at battle of stamford bridge in 1066 orkneyinga saga cc 32 33 thorfinn was buried at christ church he himself had built he is known to history as thorfinn mighty and at his height of power he controlled all of orkney and shetland hebrides caithness and sutherland and his influence extended over much of north of scotland saga also makes a grander and more unlikely claim that he controlled a total of seven earldoms in scotland orkneyinga saga c 32 he was followed as earl by his sons paul and erlend and his widow ingibiorg earls mother later married malcolm canmore king of scots st olaf s saga states that following thorfinn s decease many of dominions that earl had laid under himself were lost anderson 1922 p 2 interpretations there is clearly some doubt about historicity of many of claims in orkneyinga saga just as backdrop to supposed great expedition to west undertaken by king harald fairhair that led to founding of orkney earldom was mid 13th century norwegian contest with kings of scots over 1987 pp 52 53 we can see parallels with later events that have been included as embellishments to life of thorfinn saga writer would have had access to arnor s thorfinnsdrapa and whatever oral history was available in early 13th century there are also a number of parallels with life of harald maddadsson and woolf 2007 speculates that aspects of thorfinn s story may have been included to legitimise latter s adventures woolf 2007 p 244 descent saga states that thorfinn s grandfather was king malcolm of scotland orkneyinga saga c 13 and it is often assumed that this was malcolm ii however both irish annals for this period and norse sagas have a tendency to refer to a king of scots when discussing a regional chief or mormaer woolf 2007 suggests that reference may then be to mael coluim mac mail brigti a pictish mormaer of moray or alternatively that as elsewhere in icelandic literature was simply used as a generic name in this case for scottish royalty chronology thumb one of

1258 1264 national and university library of iceland retrieved 1 january 2015 chronology of thorfinn s life is problematic duncan 2002 p 42 dating of his assumption of earldom being an example heimskringla states that thorfinn was 5 years old when his father sigurd was killed at clontarf reliably dated to 1014 when thorfinn came of age he asked earl einar for a third of islands and it is clear from text of orkneyinga saga that einar brusi and thorfinn were joint earls for a period muir 2005 states that einar died in october 1020 but if thorfinn was five years old in 1014 this would have made him only eleven by then a rather earlier birthdate for thorfinn is thus implied with a coming of age c 1016 at about time of sumarlidi s death similarly thorfinn is often stated as dying c 1064 although woolf 2007 states that there is no reason why a date in late 1050s is not just as credible woolf 2007 p 267 st olaf s saga states that thorfinn took earldom when he was five winters old and he ruled for more than sixty winters although this implies a very late death date of 1074 anderson 1922 p 3 one version of icelandic annals has his rule lasting 52 years providing more commonly quoted year of death as c 1065 ingibiorg related to this are actions of his widow historians offering a later date for thorfinn s death have proposed that malcolm canmore married a postulated daughter of thorfinn named ingibiorg rather than his widow if a date in 1050s is presumed then malcolm could well have married as saga suggests crawford 1987 p 67 fig 21 p 74 donaldson 1990 pp 57 58 duncan 2002 pp 41 43 duncan 2002 argued that malcolm came to marry thorfinn s widow because he spent some or all of period of macbeth s reign in orkney or caithness at thorfinn s court thorfinn and malcolm were both descendants of malcolm ii daughter s son and daughter s grandson respectively and both had good reason to be hostile to macbeth and his moray kinsmen duncan 2002 pp 38 42 malcolm canmore became king of scots c 1058 and orkneyinga saga records that he and ingibiorg had a son duncan who was later king orkneyinga saga c 33 there is some circumstantial evidence that ingibiorg may have backed malcolm s claim to kingship which adds further weight to a slightly earlier death date for thorfinn although evidence for her marriage to malcolm is not entirely convincing woolf 2007 p 269 who was karl hundason identity of karl hundason unknown to scots and irish sources has long been a matter of dispute his existence rests solely on orkneyinga saga and more particularly on those elements of thorfinnsdrapa which are preserved within it robertson 1862 proposed that hundason should be identified with duncan i robertson 1862 ii pp 477 479 skene 1902 suggested that karl or kali hundason should be identified with malcolm mackenneth a son of kenneth iii skene 1902 1 c 5 another candidate is smyth kirby 1991 pp 106 107 whose father may be called jarl hundi in njal s saga woolf 2007 proposes that hundason rather that being some hitherto unknown scots king was son of thorfinn s brother hundi woolf 2007 pp 309 310 however thomson 2008 notes that both orkneyinga saga and st olaf s saga suggest hundi only lived a short while and was unlikely to have had a son himself thomson 2008 pp 75 77 anderson 1990 suggested that this is a fabulous story and concluded that n o solution to riddle seems to be justified anderson 1990 p 576 note 7 muir 2005 points out that a literal translation of karl is peasant son of a dog an insult that would have been obvious to norse speakers hearing saga and that we can assume this wasn t his real name muir 2005 p 47 implication is that there is no purpose in seeking phonetic parallels with known scots personages thomson points out that both karl and hundi are names used in other contexts without disparaging intentions although combination is otherwise unknown thomson 2008 notes that war with seem to have taken place between 1029 and 1035 and that annals of ulster record violent death of brother of mael coluim mac mail brigti and mormaer of moray in 1032 he too is thus a candidate for thorfinn s scots foe and manner of his death by fire bears comparison with arnor s poetic description of aftermath of battle at torfness thomson 2008 p 79 whoever karl son of hundi may have been it appears that saga is reporting a local conflict with a scots ruler of moray or ross t he whole narrative is consistent with idea that struggle of thorfinn and karl is a continuation of that which had been waged since ninth century by orkney earls notably sigurd rognvald s son ljot and sigurd stout against princes or mormaers of moray sutherland ross and argyll and that in fine malcolm and karl were mormaers of one of these four provinces taylor 1937 p 338 see also crawford 1987 pp 71 74 it is therefore entirely possible that thorfinn s campaign was not fought against scottish crown as such but that rather scots may have been his allies in a struggle they both had against power of moray thomson 2008 p 80 according to local tradition a series of stone mounds on a hillside near kirkhill west of inverness marks site of a battle between

modern statue in bremen cathedral of archbishop adalbert of hamburg who may have met with earl thorfinn and who appointed bishop thorulf of orkney joint rulership of earls was a recurring theme in period up to 1214 and was inherently unstable and usually ended in violence thomson 2008 p 58 thomson 2008 identifies these family feuds as being main theme of orkneyinga saga culminating in martyrdom of st magnus c 1115 and that saga writer regularly emphasises doom of kin slaying in this case sigurdsson brothers do not assassinate one another but rather thorkel fosterer becomes an intermediary killing both einar and at a later date rognvald on behalf of thorfinn orkneyinga saga c 29 it is also clear that there is a moral element to tale with brusi cast as peacemaker who is father to noble rognvald and who stands in contrast to his greedy half brother notwithstanding these roles thorfinn s christianity is emphasised in saga materials norse in northern isles would have been strongly influenced by neighbouring christian countries and it is likely that marriages to individuals from such polities would have required baptism even before his time informal pagan practice was likely conducted throughout his earldom woolf 2007 p 311 but weight of archaeological evidence suggests that christian burial was widespread in orkney even during reign of sigurd hlodvirsson thorfinn s father thomson 2008 p 64 furthermore brusi has a relatively minor role to play compared to thorfinn mighty whose conquests included expansion well into north mainland scotland and whose rule may have marked zenith of scandinavian influence in scotland as there were only seven traditional scottish earldoms in total sagas claim that he held this many seems to suggest that he was king of scots however this may reflect either a royal pretension of thorfinn s or given that his conquests were in north and west rather than in lowland heartland of scotland that they are references to local although saga suggests that first bishop of orkney was installed towards end of thorfinn s time as earl first recorded bishop was henry of lund also known as fat who was appointed sometime prior to 1035 he may have been more of a missionary bishop than a permanent resident in islands watt and murray 2003 p 247 indeed there is no record of his ever having visited orkney thomson 2008 p 85

court in norway crawford 1987 pp 78 icelandic annals have little to say about orkney but under year 1021 it is recorded that earl thorfinn and earl brusi sigurd s sons gave orkneys into power of king olaf although saga writer paints a vivid and plausible picture of scene this merely tell us that thirteenth century saga writer knew his orkney traditions and recurring factors which did indeed come to fore on occasions during thirteenth century when kings and earls fought or negotiated from their related positions of strength although thorfinn is clearly stated to be fighting in and around saga

receiving submission of malcolm ii macbeth and a third king called iehmarc and that location of meeting is stated as being in fife in a verse by thordarson thomson therefore speculates that thorfinn s visit to fife may have involved an attempt by cnut to avoid a threat to his position from orkney and that this issue was one of factors involved in feud between thorfinn and earl rognvald who supported cnut s rival magnus olafsson thomson 2008 pp 81 82 finally thorfinn s death may have created a power vacuum and been a cause of invasion of irish sea region nominally led by king harald
