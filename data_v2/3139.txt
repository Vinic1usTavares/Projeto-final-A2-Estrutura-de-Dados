on daily show jon stewart remarked tongue in cheek apparently colbert was under impression that they d hired him to do what he does every night on television while comics were expected to tell jokes about administration 2006 dinner was held at a time when relationship between administration and media was under great strain and administration was sensitive to criticism attorney and columnist julie

criticize him when they got chance media matters and editor publisher came to colbert s defense calling his detractors hypocrites they contrasted critical reaction to colbert to praise that many in press had for a controversial routine that bush performed at a similar media dinner in 2004 where bush was shown looking for wmds in oval office and joking those weapons of mass destruction must be somewhere and nope no weapons over there canadian broadcasting corporation news online columnist heather mallick wrote colbert had wit and raw courage to do to bush what mark antony did to brutus

bush years editor of realist paul krassner later put colbert s performance in historical context saying that it stands out among contemporary us satire as only example of spirit of satire of lenny
