development production staff had considered a film adaptation of simpsons since early in series show s creator matt groening felt a feature length film would allow them to increase show s scale and animate sequences too complex for a tv series he intended film to be made after show ended but that was undone by good ratings there were attempts to adapt fourth season episode kamp krusty into a film but difficulties were encountered in expanding episode to feature length for a long time project was held up there was difficulty finding a story that was sufficient for a film and crew did not have enough time to complete such a project as they already worked full time on show groening also expressed a wish to make a parody of fantasia it was never produced partly because it would have been too difficult to write a feature length script before his death phil hartman had said he had wished to make a live action troy mcclure film and several of show s staff had expressed a desire to help create it even josh weinstein proposed to use plot of 1996 episode a fish called selma for film before cancellation of project if every episode of simpsons is a celebration which we try to make it then movie is like a big celebration it s a way of honoring animators allowing them to really strut their stuff and really go as far as they can with art of handwritten gesture it s a way of honoring writers because we were able to get best all star writers of simpsons and write our hearts out and it s a way of honoring all great actors matt groening voice cast was signed on to do film in 2001 and work then began on script producers were initially worried that creating a film would have a negative effect on series as they did not have enough crew to focus their attention on both projects as series progressed additional writers and animators were hired so that both show and film could be produced at same time groening and james l brooks invited back mike scully and al jean who continued to work as showrunner on television series to produce film with them they then signed david silverman who in anticipation of project had quit his job at pixar to direct film strongest possible writing team was assembled with many of writers from show s early seasons being chosen david mirkin mike reiss george meyer john swartzwelder and jon vitti were selected ian maxtone graham and matt selman joined later and brooks groening scully and jean also wrote parts of script sam simon did not return having left show over creative differences in 1993 former writer conan o brien expressed interest in working with simpsons staff again although he later joked that i worry that simpsons writing portion of my brain has been destroyed after 14 years of talking to lindsay lohan and that guy from one tree hill so maybe it s all for best same went for director brad bird who said he had entertained fantasies of asking if he could work on movie but did not have enough time due to work on ratatouille producers arranged a deal with fox that would allow them to abandon production of film at any point if they felt script was unsatisfactory registration required work continued on screenplay from 2003 onwards taking place in small bungalow where groening first pitched simpsons in 1987 writers spent six months discussing a plot and each of them offered sketchy ideas jean suggested family rescue manatees which became 2005 episode bonfire of manatees and there was also a notion similar to that of truman show where characters discovered their lives were a tv show groening rejected this as he felt that simpsons should never become aware of themselves as celebrities but idea was later used in video game simpsons game groening read about a town that had to get rid of pig feces in their water supply which inspired plot of film decision for flanders to have an important role also came early on as jean wished to see bart wonder what his life would be like if flanders were his father hank scorpio a character from 1996 episode you only move twice was originally meant to return as main antagonist but staff dropped idea and created russ cargill instead having eventually decided on basic outline of plot for film writers then separated it into seven sections jean scully reiss swartzwelder vitti mirkin and meyer wrote 25 pages each and group met one month later to merge seven sections into one very rough draft film s script was written in same way as television series writers sitting around a table pitching ideas and trying to make each other laugh script went through over 100 revisions and at one point film was a musical however songs were continually being shortened and idea was dropped groening described his desire to also make film dramatically stronger than a tv episode saying that he wanted to give you something that you haven t seen before animation thumb alt a man with a cowboy hat on his back upright director david silverman looked at some of television episodes he had directed for inspiration animation for film began in january 2006 with itchy scratchy short being first scene to be storyboarded groening rejected making either a live action or a cgi film calling film s animation deliberately imperfect and a tribute to art of hand drawn animation film was produced in a widescreen 2 39 1 aspect ratio to distinguish it from look of television series and colored with largest palette animators ever had available to them a lot of animation was produced using cintiq tablets which allowed images to be drawn directly onto a computer monitor to facilitate production animation production work was divided among four studios around world film roman in burbank california rough draft studios in glendale california and and rough draft s division in seoul south korea as with television series storyboarding characters background layout and animatic parts of production were done in america overseas studios completed digital ink and paint and rendered animation to tape before being shipped back to united states director david silverman said that unlike tv series where you have to pick and choose film gave them opportunity to lavish that attention on every single scene characters have shadows unlike in show silverman and animators looked to films such as incredibles triplets of belleville and bad day at black rock for inspiration as they were a great education in staging because of how characters are placed they also looked for ideas for a dream sequence in disney films such as dumbo and pluto cartoon pluto s judgment day and for crowd scenes in it s a mad mad mad mad world silverman looked at some of simpsons episodes he had directed primarily his two favorites homie clown and three men and a comic book mike b anderson lauren macmullan rich moore and steven dean moore each directed animation for around a quarter of film under silverman s supervision with numerous other animators working on scenes casting for inspiration for crowd scenes in film production staff referenced a poster featuring more than 320 simpsons characters groening said they tried to include every single character in film with 98 having speaking parts and most members of crowds being previously established characters instead of generic people series regular voice actors dan castellaneta julie kavner nancy cartwright yeardley smith hank azaria and harry shearer as well as semi regular performers tress macneille pamela hayden marcia wallace maggie roswell russi taylor and karl wiedergott reprised their roles joe mantegna returned as fat tony while albert brooks who supplied many guest voices in episodes was cast as main antagonist russ cargill from main page go to simpsons house click on lisa s book click on about dvd then on production notes after he told staff that he wanted to be part of film for about a week he was to reprise role of hank scorpio but when character was omitted from film he ended up voicing cargill himself alt lots of angry people holding flaming torches as they march together frame shot of an angry mob coming for homer features cameos from more than 320 characters cast did first of three table readings in may 2005 and began recording every week from june 2006 until end of production james l brooks directed them for first time since television show s early seasons castellaneta found recording sessions more intense than recording television series and more emotionally dramatic some scenes such as marge s video message to homer were recorded over one hundred times leaving voice cast exhausted writers had written opening concert scene without a specific band in mind green day were cast in that role having requested to guest star in show tom hanks also appears as himself in film and accepted offer after just one phone call everybody loves raymond creator philip rosenthal provides voice of father in new grand canyon commercial with hanks due to time restraints several guests who had recorded parts were cut from film minnie driver recorded part of a patronizing grievance counselor in a scene that ended up being cut edward norton recorded part of man who gets crushed as dome is implemented performing a woody allen impression staff felt voice was too distracting so castellaneta re recorded norton s dialogue with a different voice isla fisher and erin brockovich also recorded cameos but their scenes were cut kelsey grammer recorded lines for sideshow bob who was to appear at several different points but these scenes were also cut johnny knoxville was also touted as a possible guest star although he does not provide voice arnold schwarzenegger is president of united states rather than then president george w bush because according to groening in two years film would be out of date brooks was nervous about idea noting that schwarzenegger s opinion polls were way down and has said that they were hoping he d make a political comeback animators began by drawing an accurate caricature of schwarzenegger but one of staff instead suggested an altered version of recurring character rainier wolfcastle as president this idea was developed with design of wolfcastle himself also a caricature of schwarzenegger being given more wrinkles under his eyes and a different hairstyle editing every aspect of film was constantly analyzed with storylines jokes and characters regularly being rewritten although most animated films do not make extensive changes to film during active production due to budget restrictions simpsons movie crew continued to edit their film into 2007 with some edits taking place as late as may two months before film was released james l brooks noted 70 percent of things in one of trailers based on where we were eight weeks ago are no longer in movie groening said that enough material for two more movies was cut various new characters were created and then cut because they did not contribute enough originally marge was character who had prophetic vision in church writers however considered this to be too dark and it was changed to grampa role of lisa s love interest colin was frequently revised he was previously named dexter and adrien and his appearance was completely altered one idea was to have milhouse act as lisa s love interest but writers realized audience was not as familiar with his long standing crush on lisa as they had thought a car chase in which homer throws flaming mummies out of a truck at epa was replaced with more emotional and realistic scenes at motel and carnival that allowed for a change of pace further changes were made after march 2007 preview screenings of film in portland oregon and phoenix arizona this included deletion of kang and kodos heavily criticizing film during end credits a lot of people at screenings found original film too coarse and some of homer s behavior too unkind so several scenes were toned down to make him appear nicer russ cargill was redesigned several times originally appearing as an older man whose speech patterns albert brooks based on donald rumsfeld older model was one used by burger king for action figure cargill s scene with bart and homer at film s conclusion was added in to fully resolve his story and spider pig gag was also a late addition one excised scene before dome is put over springfield had mr burns reminding viewers that it was last point in film that they could get a refund other deletions included homer s encounter with a sausage truck driver which was featured on dvd a scene with plopper pig at end and a news report showing dome s effect on daily life in springfield in areas such as farming and sport was cut because it did not fit overall context of film several musical numbers at various intervals throughout film were cut these included a song about alaska featuring music by dave stewart of eurythmics jean said it got pretty far along in animation and then we got scared that movie began to drag in that section music james l brooks chose hans zimmer to compose film s score as they were good friends and regular collaborators zimmer felt that score was a unique challenge and he had to try and express style of simpsons without wearing audience out he used danny elfman s original opening theme but did not wish to overuse it he created themes for each member of family homer s leitmotif was a major focus and zimmer also composed smaller themes for bart and marge regular television series composer alf clausen was not asked to score film noting sometimes you re windshield sometimes you re bug in addition to their appearance in film green day recorded its own version of simpsons theme and released it as a single zimmer turned spider pig song into a choral piece which was a joke he never intended to be put into film zimmer also had to write foreign language lyrics for 32 dubbed versions of song when film was released internationally he found translating song into spanish hardest to write same choir learned to sing piece for each of foreign language dubs themes thumb alt a girl looks nervous as she looks at boy next to her an apple tree is in background an apple tree was inserted into background here in reference to adam and eve and garden of eden al jean described film s message as being a man should listen to his wife in addition film parodies two major contemporary issues religion and environmentalism theme of environmentalism is present throughout film in homer s polluting of lake springfield green day s cameo lisa s activism and her romance with colin villainous russ cargill is head of environmental protection agency reviewer ed gonzalez argued plot was a satire of government s reaction to effects of hurricane katrina on new orleans ian nathan of empire magazine criticized this focus believing it gave film an overt political agenda which border s on polemic james d bloom of muhlenberg college commented on explicitness of film s intellectual agenda on this issue shown particularly through lisa he wrote that film s first post opening credits scene which sees green day fail in an attempt to engage their audience on issue of environment sets in motion a plot expressly built around cultural agenda setting and reflection on timely issues religion is focused on in grampa s momentary possession and marge believing what he said to be a message from god groening joked film posit s existence of a very active god when asked if he believed it was likely to offend mark i pinsky author of gospel according to simpsons said film treats genuine faith with respect while keeping a sharp eye out for religious pretension and hypocrisy of all kinds regarding scene where tenants of moe s tavern and church switch locations he believed it took chance to unmask everyone s human fallibility in analyzing role of ned flanders he wrote it is willingness of simpsons to depict all different sides of us that makes it so rich and funny on our complicated relationship with religion trees are a motif in film and they were implemented in every important or emotional scene throughout film animators inserted an apple tree behind lisa and colin during their initial meeting which was a reference to biblical figures of adam and eve and garden of eden cultural references many cultural references and allusions are made throughout film green day play nearer my god to thee on violins as their barge sinks in a sequence parodying film titanic when bart is riding his skateboard naked different passing objects are almost constantly covering his genitalia a nod to similar techniques used in austin powers international man of mystery homer and marge s love scene parodies many disney films including cinderella with disney style animals helping them undress originally music from wizard of oz was used in that scene and fawn had white spots these were removed because animators felt it resembled bambi too clearly bart impersonates mickey mouse on train calling himself mascot of an evil corporation homer plays grand theft walrus an allusion to video game series grand theft auto in game his character shoots a tap dancing penguin in reference to film happy feet spider pig song is a parody of theme song of 1967 spider man tv series and name of lisa s lecture is an irritating truth a play on al gore s film an inconvenient truth bomb disposal robot was based on vincent d onofrio s character leonard pyle lawrence from film full metal jacket who commits suicide in a similar way at end of film crowd s celebration is similar to conclusion of return of jedi with carl performing exactly same hand gestures as lando calrissian 1 000 homer received when entering alaska is a reference to alaska permanent fund dividend as homer leaves eski moe s he grabs on to a passing truck and uses it to propel himself back to house a tribute to actor buster keaton while epiphany scene features homages to film brazil and works of salvador dali hillary clinton appears as itchy s vice president while an orc from lord of rings appears in mob scene a scene that was cut had marge and kids appear on tv talk show view to spread news of springfield s impending doom parts were written for show s entire panel and scene was planned to feature russ cargill having a gunfight with joy behar another dropped scene featured moe describing springfield s varying physical states inside dome one of which was disneyland ride there are several references to events in previous tv episodes of simpsons these include wreckage of ambulance from episode bart daredevil crashed into a tree next to springfield gorge carpenters song they long to be close to you was used in homer and marge s wedding video and had also been used in several emotional moments between them in tv series

of a on an a to f scale british newspapers guardian and times both gave film four out of five stars times james bone said that it boasts same sly cultural references and flashes of brilliance that have earned television series a following that ranges from tots to comparative literature phds guardian s peter bradshaw stated that it gives you everything you could possibly want and that he thought eighty five minutes was not long enough to do justice to 17 years of comedy genius ed gonzalez praised film for its political message likening itchy scratchy cartoon at beginning to president schwarzenegger s situation later on as well as film s visual gags randy shulman praised cast and described them as having elevated their vocal work to a craft that goes way beyond simple line readings and particularly praised kavner who he said gave what must be most heartfelt performance ever roger ebert gave a positive review of three out of four stars but admitted he was generally not a fan of movies spun off from tv animation he called it radical and simple at same time subversive and good hearted offensive without really meaning to be richard corliss of time said that film doesn t try to be ruder or just bigger and better left thumb upright julie kavner pictured in 1974 was praised for her emotional performance as marge and was nominated for an annie award for voice acting usa today film critic claudia puig said that story did warrant a full length feature thanks to a clever plot and non stop irreverent humor patrick kolan believed that film was easily best stuff to come from simpsons since season 12 or 13 and praised animation but also said that appearances of characters such as comic book guy and seymour skinner were small and unfunny kirk honeycutt of hollywood reporter praised film s good nature stating that laughs come in all sizes but also noted that little has been gained bringing simpsons to screen variety s brian lowry called it clever irreverent satirical and outfitted but that it was just barely capable of sustaining a running time longer than a television episode lisa schwarzbaum praised voice cast but stated that action sequences sometimes falter when comparing film to early episodes of show stephen rowley concluded that film has more going for it than show in its later years but is still a long way short of what made it so invigorating monthly critic luke davies echoed lowry s concerns about length everything moves with whip crack speed of a half hour episode and that s paradox it makes film feel like three episodes strung together we re in a cinema and we expect something epic he opined that in great arc that is history of simpsons this film will come to be seen as oddity rather than apotheosis more negative reception came from magazine empire where reviewer ian nathan compared film to new coke saying that it utterly failed phil villarreal believed that there were too few laugh worthy moments and that instead of stretching to new frontiers film rests on familiar sheila johnston criticized pacing of film and its joke level saying that overall momentum flags at times and that it was a salvo of comic squibs some very funny others limp david edwards agreed with this writing that although there s a great half hour show rattling around rest is padding at its very dullest concluding that it isn t a terrible film just a terribly disappointing one cosmo landesman believed humour seem ed to have lost its satirical bite and wit and that much of comedy is structured around idiocy of homer this assessment was shared by carina chocano of los angeles times who felt that once movie wanders into its contemplation of mortality and meaning kind of creaks and falls off she negatively compared it to south park bigger longer uncut 1999 a film similarly adapted from an animated television series saying that in terms of satire it offers nothing we don t hear every night on daily show with jon stewart bruce newman criticized
