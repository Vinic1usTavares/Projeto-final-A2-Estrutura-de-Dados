for games such as super mario land and metroid while suzuki was a composer and musician for bands of many different genres nes was only able to play three notes at a time which suzuki has noted greatly limited what he was able to produce as he could not create some of sounds he wanted melodies and themes from some pieces from soundtrack were reused in other games in series pollyanna snowman and of a little dog make an appearance in all three games some of music from game was recorded as a studio album by suzuki and tanaka in collaboration with various artists entitled mother album was released by cbs sony on august 21 1989 it consists of eleven tracks seven of which are english vocal arrangements of songs from game created by suzuki david bedford takeshi and michael nyman lyrics to

direct with its tracks digitally remastered a song from earthbound entitled smiles and tears was added and track world of mother was replaced with a version that is six minutes longer despite being recorded in england album was only available in japan as game was never released outside of country until a virtual console release over 25 years later following a kickstarter campaign american independent record label ship to shore worked with sony music to reissue album on vinyl record in 2015 only 2 000 copies were pressed though a limited run of cd albums was also produced gavin sheehan wrote this soundtrack is gorgeous at least for time it was created in he noted experimental style of tracks which he credited to experimental style of game itself as well as relative newness of genre of video game music at time reviewer patrick gann of rpgfan received album well saying that he enjoyed variety of genres presented in it though he noted that lyrics were trite and cheesy though still catchy he also applauded production value calling it incredible especially for 1989 square enix music online in their review of album called it a happy little gem with quirks and surprises though unlike rpgfan they felt that sound production quality was not as good as it could be they still felt that pieces had stood test of time in terms of good music earthbound earthbound known in japan as is a role playing video game published by nintendo for super nes video game console in 1994 keiichi suzuki and hirokazu tanaka reprised their roles from mother as composers for game and were joined by assistant composers hiroshi kanazu and toshiyuki ueno in an interview with weekly famitsu keiichi suzuki commented on how snes gave composers much more freedom to compose what they wanted than nes which made development of music for earthbound much easier than for its predecessor this freedom was partially a result of larger memory space available because one of many problems composers had in first game was trying to get all of their music on to cartridge another advantage was that snes could support playing eight notes at same time which when combined with increased sound quality meant that he could compose music for game in a similar fashion to how he would compose music for real life suzuki cited john lennon as an influential figure to all composers while soundtrack was being developed as his songs about love matched up with feeling of game critics and players have noted similarities between parts of some songs in game to popular songs including several suspected homages to songs by lennon and beatles legal issues surrounding these similarities were suspected to prevent game from being released on virtual console outside of japan but rumors were ultimately proved untrue in a famitsu interview shigesato itoi said that amount of music that they fit into eight megabits of space one third of total size of game would be enough to fill two compact discs if released as a full album he ascribed amount of music to disorderly or broad number of styles of music that were included by tanaka and suzuki he also noted his belief that earthbound was first video game to include vibrato or string bending in its music and described one of differences between music of earthbound and mother as that this game had more jazzy pieces suzuki has estimated that he composed over 100 pieces of music for earthbound including pieces that did not make it into game and says that his favorite was music played when player rode a bicycle in game which he had actually composed before starting work on game soundtrack album for earthbound was released by sony records in japan on november 2 1994 it was re released a decade later on february 18 2004 by sony music direct album has 24 tracks where many of these tracks are arrangements combining several pieces from game into one piece final three tracks on album consist of remixes of multiple tracks merged for example room number psi mix is a remixed version of several pieces of music played in different shops and hotels in game combined into one song album was released again in 2016 by ship to shore as a set of two vinyl lp records originally released in four character themed color options there exist eight different as of 2018 album named mother 2 uses same tracks and artwork as original soundtrack release vincent chorley in his review of album for rpgfan praised original game music applauding it for conveying emotion and atmosphere and then playing around with this mental image as for album itself however he was disappointed in way that it merged tracks together and kept tracks based on a single song short saying that many of tracks are so short that they are impossible to enjoy in their entirety vinyl release was praised by jeremy parish of usgamer for its sound quality and soundtrack s towering achievement in game music but he felt that music was not very listenable on its own and that album did not fit lp format as well as an album originally produced for format would have mother 1 2 video game is a port release of mother and earthbound mother 2 by nintendo for game boy advance released in 2003 despite its title eponymous album is an arranged album it was released by toshiba emi on august 20 2003 first ten tracks from album are from mother while last 16 are from earthbound unlike original soundtrack albums mother tracks on this album did not include any vocal arrangements and earthbound tracks were not composed of tracks merged another album for collection mother 1 2 midi piano version was released three years later on may 27 2006 by sky port publishing album contains midi piano arrangements by shunsuke sakamoto of songs from two games with its music covering many different moods from lively to sedated like soundtrack album mother 1 2 midi piano version had its first ten tracks taken from mother and other 16 from earthbound but with several different tracks than first album kyle miller of rpgfan in his review of mother 1 2 album called it a quality collection of uplifting passionate songs he preferred mother tracks to earthbound ones as he felt that second half of album contained more gimmick tracks but still called both halves unique fun and well done overall in his review of mother 1 2 midi piano version album he concluded that while fans of midi piano music would enjoy album that soundtrack album was superior of two his criticism was mainly based on fact that while tracks were well orchestrated pieces played masterfully and retained quality of compositions of originals wacky instrumentation of original pieces did not translate to piano arrangements causing tunes to lose some of spirit that they are known for mother 3 mother 3 is a role playing video game published by nintendo for game boy advance handheld game console in 2006 music for game was composed exclusively by shogo sakai who had previously composed music for games such as super smash bros melee and kirby air ride series developer shigesato itoi stated that sakai was given position because he understood mother 3 most given that he could not use keiichi suzuki or hirokazu tanaka composers for first two games as they were both busy with other projects itoi also said that given massive number of songs in game over 250 he needed someone who had a lot of time to dedicate to project and who could focus exclusively on it love theme main theme of mother 3 was composed late in game s development earlier in development itoi intended to use pigmask army theme as main theme of game during creation of an important scene in game however sakai was asked to create a song that would have a greater impact than pigmask theme upon its creation it was chosen to be used as main theme instead of pigmask army song itoi claims that given how quickly sakai composed song that he had been waiting for order to make a song like love theme itoi requested that love theme be playable on a piano with only one finger as eight melodies theme from mother had gained popularity and been played in elementary schools due to its simplicity ok desu ka that plays after player chooses character s name was recorded without itoi s knowledge by hirokazu tanaka more than a decade before release of mother 3 mother3 soundtrack album was first released by tokyo itoi shigesato office on november 2 2006 and then distributed through itunes store on february 2 2007 featuring an additional bonus track mother3 theme of love another album of music from game mother3i was released on february 6 2007 by tokyo itoi shigesato office in itunes store and other online music services like earthbound soundtrack album each track of mother3i is a combination of several tracks from game itself though it still does not cover all of tracks from game kyle miller of rpgfan gave a warm reception to mother3 in his review saying that it retains same quirky but thoughtful feel so well captured by previous entries in series and was a worthy addition to mother musical canon he enjoyed that it included both songs that were new to mother 3 and pieces originally from previous entries in series he felt that weakest tracks on album were those that used real life instruments while he named snowman as strongest square enix music online was not as pleased with album although reviewer agreed with miller on which tracks were best and worst they were very critical of fact that album contained only nine or ten distinct themes from a pool of perhaps one hundred viable choices they also disliked fact that pieces were by design short and repetitive they instead recommended mother3i album which though missing iconic love theme and perennial series favorites like pollyanna had more engaging arrangements less cloying sentimentality and a wider variety of themes they also noted improved sound quality of album over original game boy advance version mother3 reached position 24 on japanese oricon charts and stayed on charts for three weeks legacy music from earthbound was arranged for piano and published by doremi music publishing in 1995 book contains 16 scores with some covering more than one song from game s theme was also included in game music piano solo album a book published by doremi with sheet music from many different games sky port publishing published a book of piano arrangements in 1996 for release of mother 1 2 containing 27 pieces eight melodies song from mother received some popularity and was included in some japanese music textbooks due to its simplicity a full sheet music book for mother has never officially been made available but after its release on virtual console as earthbound beginnings entire soundtrack was transcribed by a fan into sheet music super smash bros a series of fighting games published by nintendo featuring characters and music from established video games has included several songs from mother series 2015 undertale
