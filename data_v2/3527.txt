saegusa ito oxidation is a chemical reaction used in organic chemistry it was discovered in 1978 by takeo saegusa and yoshihiko ito as a method to introduce a b unsaturation in carbonyl compounds reaction as originally reported involved formation of a silyl enol ether followed by treatment with palladium ii acetate and benzoquinone to yield corresponding enone original publication noted its utility for regeneration of unsaturation following 1 4 addition with nucleophiles such as center 500px saegusa ito oxidation for acyclic substrates reaction yields thermodynamic e olefin product exclusively center 500px acyclic substrates this discovery was preceded nearly eight years earlier by a report that treatment of unactivated ketones with palladium acetate yielded same products in low yields major improvement provided by saegusa and ito was recognition that enol form was reactive species developing a method based on silyl enol ethers benzoquinone is actually not a necessary component for this reaction its role is to regenerate palladium ii from its reduced form palladium 0 so that a smaller amount of expensive palladium ii acetate is required at beginning reaction conditions and purifications could be easily simplified by just using excess of palladium ii acetate without benzoquinone while at a much higher cost since reaction typically employs near stoichiometric amounts of palladium and is therefore often considered too expensive for industrial usage some progress has been made in development of catalytic variants despite this shortcoming saegusa oxidation has been used in a number of syntheses as a mild late stage method for introduction of functionality in complex molecules mechanism mechanism of saegusa ito oxidation involves coordination of palladium to enol olefin followed by loss of silyl group and formation of an palladium complex b hydride elimination yields palladium hydride enone complex which upon reductive elimination yields product along with acetic acid and pd0 oxidation chem 215 lecture notes reversibility of elimination step allows equilibration leading to thermodynamic e selectivity in acyclic substrates it has been shown that product can form a stable pd0 olefin complex which may be responsible for difficulty with re oxidation seen in catalytic variants of reaction center 500px mechanism

transformation catalytic with respect to palladium salt primarily due to its high cost original conditions though technically catalytic still require 50 mol of palladium ii acetate raising cost to prohibitively high levels for large scale syntheses major advances in catalytic versions of this reaction have steered towards co oxidants that regenerate palladium ii species effectively specifically
