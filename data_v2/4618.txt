thumb right representation of a sitting of roman senate cicero attacks catiline from a 19th century fresco senate of roman republic was a political institution in ancient roman republic it was not an elected body but one whose members were appointed by consuls and later by censors after a roman magistrate served his term in office it usually was followed with automatic appointment to senate according to greek historian polybius our principal source on constitution of roman republic roman senate was predominant branch of government polybius noted that it was consuls highest ranking of regular magistrates who led armies and civil government in rome and it was roman assemblies which had ultimate authority over elections legislation and criminal trials however since senate controlled money administration and details of foreign policy it had most control over day to day life power and authority of senate derived from precedent high caliber and prestige of senators and senate s unbroken lineage which dated back to founding of republic in 509 bc it developed from senate of roman kingdom and became senate of roman empire originally chief magistrates consuls appointed all new senators they also had power to remove individuals from senate around year 318 bc ovinian plebiscite plebiscitum ovinium gave this power to another roman magistrate censor who retained this power until end of roman republic this law also required censors to appoint any newly elected magistrate to senate thus after this point in time election to magisterial office resulted in automatic senate membership appointment was for life although censor could impeach any senator senate directed magistrates especially consuls in their prosecution of military conflicts senate also had an enormous degree of power over civil government in rome this was especially case with regards to its management of state finances as only it could authorize disbursal of public monies from treasury in addition senate passed decrees called senatus consultum which was officially advice from senate to a magistrate while technically these decrees did not have to be obeyed in practice they usually were during an emergency senate and only senate could authorize appointment of a dictator last ordinary dictator however was appointed in 202 bc after 202 bc senate responded to emergencies by passing senatus consultum ultimum ultimate decree of senate which suspended civil government and declared something analogous to martial law venue and ethical standards rules and procedures of roman senate were both complex and ancient many of these rules and procedures originated in early years of republic and were upheld over centuries under principle of mos maiorum customs of ancestors while senate meetings could take place either inside or outside of formal boundary of city pomerium no meeting could take place more than a mile outside of pomerium byrd 34 senate meetings might take place outside of formal boundary of city for several reasons for example senate might wish to meet with an individual such as a foreign ambassador whom they did not wish to allow inside city lintott 73 at beginning of year first senate meeting always took place at temple of jupiter capitolinus other venues could include temple of fides or temple of concord lintott 72 or if meeting was outside of formal boundary of city at temple of apollo or if a war meeting at temple of bellona in addition senate operated while under various religious restrictions for example before any meeting could begin a sacrifice to gods was made and a search for divine omens auspices was taken auspices were taken in order to determine whether that particular senate meeting held favor with gods senate was only allowed to meet in a building of religious significance such as curia ethical requirements of senators were significant senators could not engage in banking or any form of public contract they could not own a ship that was large enough to participate in foreign commerce and they could not leave italy without permission from senate in addition since they were not paid individuals usually sought to become a senator only if they were independently wealthy byrd 36 censors were magistrates who enforced ethical standards of senate whenever a censor punished a senator they had to allege some specific failing possible reasons for punishing a member included corruption abuse of capital punishment or disregard of a colleague s veto constitutional precedent or auspices senators who failed to obey various laws could also be punished while punishment could include impeachment expulsion from senate often a punishment was less severe than outright expulsion lintott 70 while standard was high for expelling a member from senate it was easier to deny a citizen right to join senate various moral failings could result in one not being allowed to join senate including bankruptcy prostitution or a prior history of having been a gladiator one law lex of 123 bc made it illegal for a citizen to become a senator if they had been convicted of a criminal offense many of these laws were enacted in last century of republic as public corruption began reaching unprecedented levels debates thumb upright orator c 100 bc an roman bronze sculpture depicting latin aulus metellus an etruscan man of roman senatorial

beginning of a meeting a magistrate who wished to summon senate had to issue a compulsory order a and senators could be punished if they failed to appear without reasonable cause in 44 bc for example consul mark antony threatened to demolish house of former consul cicero for this very reason lintott 75 senate meetings were technically public because doors were usually left open which allowed people to look in but only senators could speak senate was directed by a presiding magistrate who was usually either a consul highest ranking magistrate or if consul was unavailable a praetor second highest ranking magistrate usually urban praetor byrd 42 by late republic another type of magistrate a plebeian tribune would sometimes preside while in session senate had power to act on its own and even against will of presiding magistrate if it wished presiding magistrate began each meeting with a speech fecit lintott 78 which was usually brief but was sometimes a lengthy oration presiding magistrate would then begin a discussion by referring an issue to senators who would discuss issue one at a time by order of seniority with first to speak most senior senator known as princeps senatus leader of senate who was then followed by ex consuls consulares and then praetors and ex praetors this continued until most junior senators had spoken senators who had held magisterial office always spoke before those who had not and if a patrician was of equal seniority as a plebeian patrician would always speak first abbott 228 a senator could make a brief statement discuss matter in detail or talk about an unrelated topic all senators had to speak before a vote could be held and since all meetings had to end by nightfall byrd 44 a senator could talk a proposal to death a filibuster or diem if they could keep debate going until nightfall it is known for example that senator cato younger once filibustered in an attempt to prevent senate from granting julius caesar a law that would have given land to veterans of pompey delaying and obstructive tactics senators had several ways in which they could influence or frustrate a presiding magistrate when a presiding magistrate was proposing a motion for example senators could call consult consule which required magistrate to ask for opinions of senators any senator could demand a quorum call with cry of which required a count of senators present like modern quorum calls this was usually a delaying tactic senators could also demand that a motion be divided into smaller motions acts such as applause booing or heckling often played a major role in a debate and in part because all senators had an absolute right to free speech any senator could respond at any point if he was attacked personally once debates were underway they were usually difficult for presiding magistrate to control presiding magistrate typically only regained some control once debating had ended and a vote was about to be taken lintott 82 in later years of republic attempts were made by aristocracy to limit increasing level of chaos associated with obstructive tendencies and democratic impulses of some of senators laws were enacted to prevent inclusion of extraneous material in bills before senate other laws were enacted to outlaw so called omnibus bills byrd 112 which are bills usually enacted by a single vote that contain a large volume of often unrelated material laws were also enacted to strengthen requirement that three days pass between proposal of a bill and vote on that bill during his term as dictator julius caesar enacted laws that required publication of senate resolutions this publication called acta diurna or daily proceedings was meant to increase transparency and minimize potential for abuse byrd 133 this publication was posted in roman forum and then sent by messengers throughout provinces votes and tribune s vote when it was time to call a vote presiding magistrate could bring up whatever proposals in whatever order he wished and every vote was between a proposal and its negative lintott 83 quorums were required for votes to be held and it is known that in 67 bc size of a quorum was set at 200 senators by lex cornelia de at any point before a motion passed proposed motion could be vetoed usually vetoes were handed down by plebeian tribunes if senate proposed a bill that plebeian tribune magistrate who was chief representative of people did not agree with he issued a veto which was backed by promise to literally interpose sacrosanctity of his person or intercessio if senate did not comply if senate did not comply he could physically prevent senate from acting and any resistance could be criminally prosecuted as constituting a violation of his sacrosanctity if vetoed motion was proposed next day and plebeian tribune who had vetoed it day before was not present to interpose himself motion could be passed in general plebeian tribune had to physically be present at senate meeting otherwise his physical threat of interposing his person had no meaning ultimately plebeian tribune s veto was based in a promise of physical force once a vote occurred and a measure passed he could do nothing since his promise to physically interpose his person against senators was now meaningless in addition during a couple of instances between end of second punic war in 201 bc and beginning of social war in 91 bc although they had no legal power to do so several consuls were known to have vetoed acts of senate ultimately if there was no veto and matter was of minor importance it could be voted on by a voice vote or by a show of hands if there was no veto and matter was of a significant nature there was usually a physical division of house where senators voted by taking a place on either side of chamber any motion that had support of senate but was vetoed was recorded in annals as a senatus auctoritas while any motion that was passed and not vetoed was recorded as a senatus consultum after vote each senatus consultum and each senatus auctoritas was transcribed into a final document by presiding magistrate this document included name of presiding magistrate place of assembly dates involved number of senators who were present at time motion was passed names of witnesses to drafting of motion and substance of act in addition if motion was a senatus consultum a capital letter c was stamped on document to verify that motion had been approved by senate lintott 85 document was then deposited in temple that housed treasury aerarium while a senatus auctoritas vetoed senate motion had no legal value it did serve to show opinion of senate if a senatus consultum conflicted with a law lex that was passed by a roman assembly law overrode senatus consultum because senatus consultum had its authority based in precedent and not in law a senatus consultum however could serve to interpret a law abbott 233 see also notes references further reading cambridge ancient history volumes 9 13
