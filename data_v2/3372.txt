third battle of seoul also known as chinese new year s offensive january fourth retreat or third phase campaign western eastern sector is first and second battles of wonju was a battle of korean war which took place from december 31 1950 to january 7 1951 around south korean capital of seoul in aftermath of major chinese people s volunteer army pva victory at battle of ch ongch on river united nations command un started to contemplate possibility of evacuation from korean peninsula china s chairman mao zedong ordered chinese people s volunteer army to cross 38th parallel in an effort to pressure un forces to withdraw from south korea on december 31 1950 chinese 13th army attacked republic of korea army rok s 1st 2nd 5th and 6th infantry divisions along 38th parallel breaching un defenses at imjin river hantan river gapyeong and chuncheon in process to prevent pva forces from overwhelming defenders us eighth army now under command of lieutenant general matthew b ridgway evacuated seoul on january 3 1951 although pva forces captured seoul by end of battle chinese invasion of south korea galvanized un support for south korea while idea of evacuation was soon abandoned by un command at same time pva were exhausted after months of nonstop fighting since start of chinese intervention thereby allowing un forces to regain initiative in korea background thumb left map of us eighth army retreat december 1 23 1950 alt a series of front lines drawn over korean peninsula with each line labeled with a date with china entering korean war in late 1950 conflict had entered a new phase to prevent north korea from falling under un control after un offensive into north korea pva entered north korea and launched their second phase offensive against un forces near sino korean border on 25 november resulting battles at ch ongch on river valley and chosin reservoir forced un forces to retreat from north korea during december 1950 with pva and north korean korean people s army kpa forces recapturing much of north korea on korean western front after us eighth army suffered a disastrous defeat at ch ongch on river it retreated back to imjin river while setting up defensive positions around south korean capital of seoul although eighth army was ordered to hold seoul for as long as possible un commander general douglas macarthur planned a series of withdrawals to pusan perimeter if un forces were about to be overwhelmed general walton walker commander of eighth army was killed in a traffic accident on december 23 and lieutenant general matthew b ridgway assumed command of eighth army on december 26 1950 at un a ceasefire along 38th parallel was proposed to china on december 11 1950 in order to avoid any further escalation of hostility between china and us although pva had been weakened from their earlier battles with nearly 40 percent of its forces rendered combat ineffective its unexpected victories over un forces had convinced chinese leadership of invincibility of pva immediately after pva 13th army s victory over eighth army at ch ongch on river china s chairman mao zedong started to contemplate another offensive against un forces on urging of north korean premier kim il sung after learning of macarthur s plans and un ceasefire mao also believed that un evacuation of korean peninsula was imminent although over stretched chinese logistics prevented pva from launching a full scale invasion against south korea mao still ordered pva 13th army to launch an intrusion dubbed third phase campaign to hasten un withdrawal and to demonstrate china s desire for a total victory in korea on december 23 1950 china s foreign minister zhou enlai formally rejected un ceasefire while demanding all un forces to be withdrawn from korean peninsula prelude locations terrain and weather seoul is capital city of south korea which is roughly bisected into northern and southern halves by han river seoul is located south of 38th parallel battle was fought over un defenses at 38th parallel which stretches horizontally from imjin river mouth on korean west coast to town of chuncheon in central korea route 33 runs south across 38th parallel at hantan river passes through uijeongbu and eventually arrives at seoul and it is an ancient invasion route towards seoul another road ran across imjin river and it connects seoul and kaesong through towns of munsan and koyang finally a road runs through chuncheon and it connects to seoul from northeast harsh korean winter with temperatures as low as had frozen imjin and hantan river over most of river crossings eliminating a major obstacle for attacking chinese forces forces and strategies un evacuation of korea will prove to be true soon or at least when our 13th army corps reaches kaesong or seoul mao zedong arguing for new offensive by december 22 1950 us eighth army s front had stabilized along 38th parallel just days before his death walker placed us i corps us ix corps and rok iii corps of eighth army along 38th parallel to defend seoul us i and ix corps were to defend imjin and hantan river respectively while rok iii corps were to guard areas around chuncheon boundary between us i and ix corps was marked by route 33 and was defended by rok 1st infantry division on west side and rok 6th infantry division on east side because rok forces had suffered nearly 45 000 casualties at end of 1950 most of their units were composed of raw recruits with little combat training after inspecting front just days before battle general j lawton collins us army chief of staff concluded that most of rok formations were only fit for outpost duties at same time eighth army was also suffering from low morale due to its earlier defeats and most of its soldiers were anticipating an evacuation from korea eighth army s lack of will to fight and to maintain contact with chinese forces resulted in a lack of information on pva troop movements and intentions after inspecting front on december 27 ridgway ordered us i and ix corps to organize a new defensive line around koyang to uijeongbu called bridgehead line to cover han river crossings in case un forces were forced to evacuate seoul pva however were also suffering from logistics problems and exhaustion after their earlier victories arguing against third phase campaign on december 7 pva commander peng dehuai telegraphed to mao that pva would need at least three months to replace its casualties while most of its troops were in critical need of resupply rest and reorganization chinese logistics system which was based on concept of people s war with native population supplying army also ran into difficulties due to indifferent and sometimes hostile korean population near 38th parallel pva were now suffering from hunger and lack of winter clothing responding to peng s concern over troops conditions mao limited scope of third phase campaign to pin down rok forces along 38th parallel while inflicting as much damage as possible upon noticing that us units were not interspersed between rok formations therefore unable to support them mao ordered pva 13th army to destroy rok 1st infantry division rok 6th infantry division and rok iii corps following mao s instruction peng placed pva 38th 39th 40th and 50th corps of 13th army in front of rok 1st and 6th infantry divisions while 42nd and 66th corps of 13th army were moved into rok iii corps sector start date of offensive was set to 31 december in order to take advantage of night assault under a full moon and anticipated low alertness of un soldiers during holiday for same reasons ridgway had predicted that 31 december would be likely time for new chinese offensive believing that destruction of rok forces at 38th parallel would render un forces incapable of counterattacks in future mao promised to pull all chinese troops off front line for rest and refit by end of campaign battle on evening of december 31 1950 pva 13th army launched a massive attack against rok forces along 38th parallel along imjin river and hantan river pva 38th 39th 40th and 50th corps decimated rok 1st division while routing rok 6th division at chuncheon sector pva 42nd and 66th corps forced rok iii corps into full retreat with defenses at 38th parallel completely collapsed by january 1 1951 ridgway ordered evacuation of seoul on january 3 actions at imjin river and hantan river thumb left map of chinese third phase campaign alt a map with multiple red arrows pressing against a blue line at 38th parallel by december 15 1950 rok 1st infantry division had retreated back to town of choksong on southern bank of imjin river its original defensive position at start of korean war on right flank of rok 1st infantry division rok 6th infantry division was located at north of along southern bank of hantan river rok 1st infantry division planned to defend imjin river by placing its 11th and 12th regiments at west and east side of choksong respectively while rok 6th infantry division defended route 33 at hantan river by placing its 7th and 19th regiments on each side of road both rok 15th regiment 1st infantry division and rok 2nd regiment 6th infantry division were placed in rear as reserves south koreans had also constructed numerous bunkers barbed wire obstacles and minefields on both banks of river in order to strengthen defenses and to maintain troop morale faced with south korean defense chinese had prepared for well over a month for offensive in weeks before operational orders for third phase campaign were issued by pva high command advance elements of pva 39th corps had been conducting detailed reconnaissance on rok defenses rok positions were then thoroughly analyzed by pva commanders engineers and artillery officers pva thrust companies which were composed of specially trained assault and engineer teams were also organized to lead attack across imjin and hantan river during preparation pva artillery units had suffered heavy losses under un air attacks but pva deputy commander han xianchu still managed to bring up 100 artillery pieces against rok fortifications on december 22 pva high command issued operational orders that signaled start of third phase campaign pva 39th and 50th corps were tasked with destruction of rok 1st infantry division while 38th and 40th corps were tasked with destruction of rok 6th infantry division acting on ridgway s prediction rok army headquarters ordered all units to full alert at dusk on december 31 but many of its soldiers were either drunk from new year celebration or had abandoned their posts in order to escape cold pva artillery units began to shell rok defenses at 16 30 on december 31 first blow fell on rok 12th regiment 1st infantry division due to unit s positioning as both boundary between rok 1st and 6th infantry divisions and boundary between us i and ix corps because river banks on rok 12th regiment s flanks were composed of high cliffs difficult for attackers to scale most of regiment s strength were used to defend its center upon noticing this development pva 39th corps decided to use rok 12th regiment s flanks as main points of attack in order to achieve maximum surprise following a feint attack on rok 12th regiment s center pva 116th and 117th divisions of 38th corps struck both flanks of rok 12th regiment rok 12th regiment was caught off guard and offered little resistance and within hours regiment was cut to pieces with a battery of us 9th field artillery battalion seized by chinese under cover of fleeing rok soldiers attacking pva forces then penetrated rok 15th regiment s defense without firing a shot desperate to contain pva breakthrough brigadier general paik sun yup of rok 1st infantry division used division s rear service personnel to form an assault battalion but they were unable to stop pva advance with only rok 11th regiment remaining intact by morning of january 1 rok 1st infantry division was forced to withdraw on january 2 only few miles north of seoul i ran head on into that fleeing army i d never had such an experience before and i pray to god i never witness such a spectacle again lt gen matthew b ridgway after meeting rok 6th infantry division pva attacks against rok 6th infantry division however did not go as commanders had planned original plan called for pva 38th and 40th corps to attack rok 19th regiment 6th infantry division s right flank but bulk of pva forces mistakenly attacked us 19th infantry regiment 24th infantry division which was stationed to east of rok 19th regiment poor intelligence had also made pva charge through several minefields resulting in heavy casualties in spite of losses pva pushed us 19th infantry regiment back exposing right flank of rok 6th infantry division in process with rok 1st infantry division out of action and us 24th infantry division s defenses penetrated pva forces on both flanks of rok 6th infantry division then advanced southward in an attempt to encircle division by midnight of new year s eve rok 6th infantry division was forced into full retreat although pva managed to intercept some elements of rok 6th infantry division most of rok escaped trap by infiltrating pva lines using mountain trails as ridgway tried to inspect front on morning of january 1 he was greeted by fleeing and weaponless remnants of rok 6th infantry division a few miles north of seoul despite ridgway s efforts to stop retreat division continued to flee south it was not until personal intervention of south korean president syngman rhee that division finally stopped its retreat by night of january 1 un defenses at imjin river and hantan river had completely collapsed with pva advancing into un territory chinese stopped their advance on january 2 actions at gapyeong and chuncheon at beginning of battle rok iii corps was located to east of us 24th infantry division of us ix corps defending 38th parallel to north of gapyeong kapyong and chuncheon composed of four divisions rok iii corps placed its 2nd infantry division on corps left flank at hills north of gapyeong while 5th infantry division defended corps center at chuncheon cold winter created great difficulties for rok defenders with heavy snow hindering construction and icy roads limiting food and ammunition supplies north korean guerrillas were also active in region and had caused serious disruption in rear of rok iii corps chinese operational order for third phase campaign called for 42nd and 66th corps to protect pva left flank by eliminating rok 2nd and 5th infantry divisions while cutting road between chuncheon and seoul following instructions two pva corps quickly struck after midnight on new year s eve pva 124th division first penetrated flanks of rok 2nd infantry division then blocked division s retreat route trapped rok 17th and 32nd regiments 2nd infantry division were forced to retreat in disarray with pva 66th corps pressuring rok 5th infantry division s front pva 124th division then advanced eastward in rear and blocked rok 5th infantry division s retreat route as well maneuver soon left rok 36th regiment 5th infantry division surrounded by pva and they had to escape by infiltrating pva lines using mountain trails by january 1 rok iii corps had lost contact with 2nd and 5th infantry divisions while rest of iii corps were retreating to town of wonju on january 5 pva 42nd and 66th corps were relieved by kpa ii and v corps and kpa launched a separate offensive towards wonju evacuation of seoul thumb left a knocked out cromwell tank of cooper force alt an upside down tank lying on a snowy ground in aftermath of pva attacks on along 38th parallel ridgway worried that chinese would exploit breakthrough at chuncheon to circle entire eighth army he also lacked confidence in un troops ability to hold against chinese offensive on morning of january 3 after conferring with major general frank w milburn and major general john b coulter commanders of us i and ix corps respectively ridgway ordered evacuation of seoul with collapse of un defenses at 38th parallel retreat had already started on january 1 at 09 00 on january 1 milburn ordered us i corps to retreat to bridgehead line following his orders us 25th infantry division of i corps took up position to west of koyang while british 29th independent infantry brigade of i corps had dug in to east to east of i corps coulter also ordered withdrawal of us ix corps at 14 00 with anglo australian 27th british commonwealth brigade covering rear some pva forces managed to trap 3rd battalion royal australian regiment 3 rar of 27th british commonwealth brigade at uijeongbu during their attacks against rok 6th infantry division but battalion escaped trap with four wounded by midnight on january 1 us 24th infantry division of ix corps reached bridgehead line south of uijeongbu and 27th commonwealth brigade was moved into ix corps rear as reserves pva forces lacked ability to lay siege to seoul so evacuation order caught peng by surprise on morning of january 3 peng ordered pva 13th army to pursue retreating un forces by attacking towards seoul us 24th 25th infantry division and british 29th infantry brigade soon bore brunt of pva attacks in us ix corps sector pva 38th corps attacked us 24th infantry division as american were trying to withdraw in fierce fighting that followed us 19th infantry regiment on division s left flank was involved in numerous hand to hand struggles with pva around uijeongbu pva overran companies e and g of us 19th infantry regiment during their attacks but us artillery and air strikes soon inflicted 700 casualties in return faced with heavy pva pressure 27th commonwealth brigade was again called in to cover retreat of us ix corps after us 24th division evacuated seoul on night of january 3 27th commonwealth brigade started to cross han river on morning of january 4 and by 07 40 entire us ix corps had left seoul at last after weeks of frustration we have nothing between us and chinese i have no intention that this brigade group will retire before enemy unless ordered by higher authority in order to conform with general movement if you meet him you are to knock hell out of him with everything you got you are only to give ground on my orders brigadier thomas brodie s order to 29th independent infantry brigade during defense of seoul on left flank of us 24th infantry division british 29th infantry brigade of us i corps was involved in hardest fighting of entire battle in 29th infantry brigade s first action of korean war brigade was ordered to defend areas east of koyang on bridgehead line 1st battalion royal ulster rifles 1rur covered brigade s left flank while 1st battalion royal northumberland fusiliers 1rnf was stationed on brigade s right flank 1st battalion gloucestershire regiment and 1st battalion 21st royal thai regiment covered brigade s rear with artillery support at 04 00 on january 3 1rur first made contact with 149th division of pva 50th corps pva surprised and overran companies b and d of 1rur but a counterattack by major c a h b blake of 1rur restored battalion s position by morning while 1rur was under attack pva forces also infiltrated 1rnf s positions by exploiting unguarded valleys between hilltops occupied by british entire 1rnf soon came under sniper fire and pva made repeated attempts to capture y company of 1rnf to restore 1rnf s position brigadier thomas brodie of 29th infantry brigade sent w company of 1rnf with four churchill tanks as reinforcement reinforcement was met with machine gun and mortar fire but pva resistance immediately crumbled under churchill tanks devastating assaults surviving pva troops fled under bombardment from 4 2 inch mortars and 25 pounder field guns in aftermath of fighting 29th infantry brigade suffered at least 16 dead 45 wounded and 3 missing while 200 pva dead were found within 1rnf s position left thumb soldiers from british 29th infantry brigade captured by chinese alt a group of men under guard standing in front of a camera while british 29th infantry brigade and pva 149th division fought at east of koyang us 25th infantry division of us i corps started to withdraw on left flank of 29th infantry brigade evacuation plan called for a coordinated withdrawal between us 25th infantry division and british 29th infantry brigade in order to prevent pva from infiltrating un rear areas but heavy fighting soon made coordination between american and british units impossible after us 27th infantry regiment 25th infantry division formed rearguard of us i corps 25th infantry division and 29th infantry brigade were ordered to evacuate at 15 00 on january 3 25th infantry division retreated with little difficulties but withdrawal of 29th infantry brigade did not start until after dark at 21 30 with road completely open between us rearguards and british units pva regiment 149th division infiltrated un rear areas and set up an ambush against 1rur and cooper force of 8th king s royal irish hussars cooper force was an ad hoc unit composed of reconnaissance troops and six cromwell tanks from 8th king s royal irish hussars see farrar hockley 1990 p 386 1rur and cooper force were then quickly overrun by chinese soldiers most of whom were completely unarmed pva had also attacked cromwell tanks of cooper force with bundle grenades and bangalore torpedoes setting several on fire in desperate hand on hand fighting that followed although 100 soldiers from 1rur managed to escape trap under command of major j k h shaw major blake of 1rur and captain d astley cooper of cooper force were killed in action while another 208 british soldiers were missing in action most of whom were captured by pva us 27th infantry regiment tried to rescue trapped british troops but brodie stopped rescue in order to prevent more unnecessary losses when british 29th infantry brigade left seoul at 08 00 on january 4 us 27th infantry regiment became last un tactical unit that remained in city after fighting several more holding engagements at outskirts of seoul 27th infantry regiment crossed han river at 14 00 on january 4 ridgway warned his forces around noon on 4th to expect orders to withdraw to line d all corps abreast i and ix corps in meantime were to pull back at 20 00 to intermediate positions south of han and hold until air force and army supplies stocked at suwon farther south had been removed ridgway expected supplies to be cleared within 24 to 36 hours ridgway intended that starting hour of intermediate move provide time for 3rd logistical command to finish evacuating inchon ascom city and kimpo airfield on 3 january ridgway had notified col john g hill commander of 3rd logistical command to cease port operations at inchon at noon next day deadline seemed reasonable since gradual reductions of stocks at port and airfield areas since early december already had brought items on hand to modest quantities but unforeseen delays in getting some reserve stocks released from eighth army staff officers too few tankers too little suitable shipping for such items as long lengths of railroad track and an overestimate of ammunition that would be issued to line troops had prevented colonel hill from removing all stocks by designated hour after receiving ridgway s noontime orders general milburn in whose sector port and airfield lay instructed hill to execute his demolition plans as soon as he had removed all troops other than demolition crews while back shipment at inchon did continue through favorable afternoon tide on 4th hill s main attention was diverted to rendering airfield and port facilities useless to pva kpa forces all port units scheduled to travel south by road had gone by time hill received milburn s instructions and last fifth air force unit except for army aviation engineers had flown from kimpo to a new base in japan through afternoon these engineers burned airfield buildings and drums of aviation gasoline and napalm remaining at kimpo while eighth army engineers from 82nd engineer petroleum distribution company destroyed four and six inch pipelines between inchon and kimpo and booster pumps and storage tanks at airfield members of 50th engineer port construction company began demolishing inchon port at 18 00 all main facilities except one pier and a causeway to island of wolmi do were destroyed prime targets were lock gates of tidal basin which by compensating yellow sea s wide tidal range had largely given inchon capacity of a principal port demolitions at wolmi do as well as city itself were completed by 03 00 on 5th colonel hill and his remaining troops left by water for pusan within hour supplies destroyed at kimpo ascom city and inchon included some 1 6 million gallons of petroleum products 9 300 tons of engineer materiel and 12 rail cars loaded with ammunition while time and tide may have made destruction of this materiel unavoidable extensive damage to port facilities could not be fully justified denying enemy use of a port was theoretically sound on other hand un command s absolute control of korean waters made inchon s destruction purposeless on afternoon of january 4 kpa i corps pva 38th corps and pva 50th corps entered seoul but they were only greeted by an empty city in flames most of civilians had either fled south through frozen han river or evacuated to nearby countryside south korean government in seoul which was reduced to essential personnel before battle also left city with little difficulties a chinese platoon reached seoul city hall at about 13 00 and raised north korean flag on january 5 peng ordered pva 50th corps and kpa i corps to seize gimpo and incheon while instructing all other units to rest on northern bank of han river by january 7 peng halted third phase campaign due to troop exhaustion and to prevent a repeat of incheon landing eighth army withdrawal to line d thumb i and ix corps withdrawal to line d 4 7 january 1951 i and ix corps left lower bank of han while hill s engineers were still blowing inchon so hill had been obliged to put out his own security above port these outposts were not engaged neither were milburn s forces as they moved to positions centered on route 1 at town of anyang nor were coulter s as they extended line northeastward to junction of han and rivers late on 4th while i and ix corps were withdrawing to positions above suwon ridgway ordered withdrawal to line d to begin at noon on 5th by which time he now expected supplies at suwon to have been removed all five corps were to withdraw abreast meeting in process ridgway s basic requirement of maximum delay and maximum punishment of enemy ridgway specifically instructed milburn and coulter to include tanks in their covering forces and to counterattack pva who followed withdrawal ridgway learned during morning of 5th that supplies at suwon and at airfield south of town could not be cleared by noon creating delay was not only sheer bulk of materiel but also about 100 000 desperate refugees from seoul area who crowded suwon railroad yards and blocked trains at mid morning ridgway radioed milburn to stand fast until remaining suwon stocks had been shipped out and he notified coulter to leave forces to protect east flank of i corps forward position milburn received ridgway s instructions in time to hold bulk of 25th division and rok 1st division at anyang position and coulter ordered rok 6th division to protect milburn s east flank but coulter did not dispatch his instructions until an hour after rok 6th had started for line d and general chang did not receive them until midafternoon it took chang another half hour to get his division stopped by that time his forces were almost due east of suwon where with coulter s agreement chang deployed them along route 17 during night of 5th a pva regiment crossed han and assembled east of o patrols from regiment moved south through hills east of route 1 and reconnoitered rok 1st division front before midnight but somehow missed finding vulnerable east flank earlier left open by ix corps by daylight on 6th patrol contact in center of general paik s front developed into a general engagement between a pva battalion and rok 3rd battalion 11th regiment but pva attempt to dislodge rok eased by noon and ended altogether at 14 00 by then supplies had been cleared from suwon and milburn and coulter could continue south toward line d two corps completed their withdrawals on 7th since 15th infantry and 3rd battalion 65th infantry of 3rd division in meantime had arrived from kyongju and been attached to i corps milburn was able to keep a substantial reserve and still organize a fairly solid line d front from west coast eastward through pyongtaek and ansong british 29th brigade and thai battalion stood at far left astride route 1 just below p aek 3rd division held a sector across hills between routes 1 and 17 which general soule manned with 15th infantry lending depth to this central position 3rd battalion 65th infantry and 35th infantry of 25th division were assembled not far behind it above ansong rok 1st division lay across route 17 remainder of 25th division and turkish brigade went into corps reserve at south of pyongtaek along a slightly longer front tipping to northeast and reaching beyond ni to han river coulter deployed rok 6th division british 27th brigade and 24th division west to east hard against right corps boundary behind front bulk of 1st cavalry division was in corps reserve at ch ungju on route 13 now ix corps main supply route to protect route from attacks by guerrillas known to be located in tanyang area further east 5th cavalry regiment had begun to patrol road from ch ungju south through a mountain pass at mun gyong way milburn and coulter had moved to line d exasperated general ridgway reports so far reaching me he told two corps commanders on 7th indicate your forces withdrew to d line without evidence of having inflicted any substantial losses on enemy and without material delay in fact some major units are reported as having broken contact i desire prompt confirming reports and if substantially correct reasons for non compliance with my basic directives reports reaching ridgway were true except for clashes between pva and rok 1st division east of anyang on 6th i corps had withdrawn from south bank of han without contact and ix corps had not engaged enemy forces since leaving bridgehead line attempting once more to get quality of leadership he considered essential ridgway pointed out to milburn and coulter that their opponents had only two alternatives to make a time consuming coordinated follow up or to conduct a rapid uncoordinated pursuit if pva chose first eighth army could at least achieve maximum delay even though there might be few opportunities for strong counterattacks if they elected second eighth army would have unlimited opportunities not only to delay but to inflict severe losses on them in either case ridgway again made clear milburn and coulter were to exploit every opportunity to carry out basic concept of operations that he had repeatedly explained to them immediate response was a flurry of patrolling to regain contact according to i corps intelligence officer 39th and 50th armies were now advancing south of seoul and their vanguards had reached suwon area an rok 1st division patrol moving north over route 17 during afternoon of 7th supported this assessment when it briefly engaged a small pva group in ni east of suwon further west patrols from 15th infantry and british 29th brigade moved north as far as osan short of suwon without making contact in ix corps sector 24th division at far right sent patrols into and both on an east west line with suwon both towns were empty shallower searches to north by british 27th brigade in center of corps sector also failed to reestablish contact general ridgway considered attempts by patrols to regain contact at least to be moves in right direction what he wanted and planned to see next in west was more vigorous patrolling by gradually enlarged forces this patrolling would be main mission of larger efforts to acquire better combat intelligence which in his judgment had been sadly neglected and which was a prime requisite for still larger offensive action that he intended would follow his attention meanwhile was drawn to east where withdrawal to line d was still in progress and where kpa forces as expected had opened an attack to seize wonju aftermath now that they celebrate recovery of seoul what would they have to say if military situation requires us to evacuate seoul in future pva deputy commander deng hua reflecting on victory although un casualties were moderate during battle extent of south korean losses is unknown due to lack of records see appleman 1989 p 403 third battle of seoul was a significant success for chinese military in korea and un forces morale had sunk to its lowest point during war ridgway was also extremely displeased with performance of eighth army ridgway then took immediate steps to restore morale and fighting spirit of un forces in korea with ridgway leading eighth army macarthur started to regain confidence in un forces ability to hold korea and un evacuation plan was abandoned on january 17 meanwhile at un although un members and us were initially divided on how to respond to chinese intervention in korea chinese rejection of un ceasefire soon rallied un members towards us a un resolution that condemned china as an aggressor was passed on february 1 in opinion of historian bevin alexander chinese rejection of un ceasefire had damaged international prestige it had built from its earlier military successes and this later made it difficult for china to either join un or to deny us support for taiwan korean war which ultimately ended at 38th parallel would drag on for another two bloody years due to chinese demand for all un forces to be withdrawn from korean peninsula despite its victory pva had become completely exhausted after nonstop fighting pva deputy commander han xianchu later reported to peng that although combat casualties had been light with only 8 500 battle casualties poor logistics and exhaustion had cost backbone of chinese forces during third phase campaign us far east air forces interdiction campaign no 4 which was launched on december 15 1950 against pva kpa supply lines also made pva unable to sustain any further offensives southward believing that un forces in korea were thoroughly demoralized and unable to counterattack mao finally permitted pva to rest for at least two to three months while peng and other chinese commanders were planning for one last decisive battle in spring of 1951 but to surprise of chinese commanders ridgway and eighth army soon counterattacked pva with operation thunderbolt on january 25 1951 see also second phase offensive un retreat from north korea operation
