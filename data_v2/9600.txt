thumb vegetables in a market in philippines vegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans or other animals as food original meaning is still commonly used and is applied to plants collectively to refer to all edible plant matter including flowers fruits stems leaves roots and seeds alternate definition of term vegetable is applied somewhat arbitrarily often by culinary and cultural tradition it may exclude foods derived from some plants that are fruits flowers nuts and cereal grains but include savoury fruits such as tomatoes and courgettes flowers such as broccoli and seeds such as pulses originally vegetables were collected from wild by hunter gatherers and entered cultivation in several parts of world probably during period 10 000 bc to 7 000 bc when a new agricultural way of life developed at first plants which grew locally would have been cultivated but as time went on trade brought exotic crops from elsewhere to add to domestic types nowadays most vegetables are grown all over world as climate permits and crops may be cultivated in protected environments in less suitable locations china is largest producer of vegetables and global trade in agricultural products allows consumers to purchase vegetables grown in faraway countries scale of production varies from subsistence farmers supplying needs of their family for food to with vast of single product crops depending on type of vegetable concerned harvesting crop is followed by grading storing processing and marketing vegetables can be eaten either raw or cooked and play an important role in human nutrition being mostly low in fat and carbohydrates but high in vitamins minerals and dietary fiber many nutritionists encourage people to consume plenty of fruit and vegetables five or more portions a day often being recommended etymology thumb domestic vegetable garden in london word vegetable was first recorded in english in early 15th century it comes from old french and was originally applied to all plants word is still used in this sense in biological contexts it derives from medieval latin growing flourishing i e of a plant a semantic change from a late latin meaning

or root year 1955 saw first use of shortened slang term veggie as an adjective word vegetable is used in scientific and technical contexts with a different and much broader meaning namely of related to plants in general edible or not as in vegetable matter vegetable kingdom vegetable origin etc swedenborg emanuel 2003 swedenborg concordance 1888 kessinger publishing p 502 terminology thumb a venn diagram shows overlap in terminology of vegetables in a culinary sense and fruits in botanical sense exact definition of vegetable may vary simply because of many parts of a plant consumed as food worldwide roots stems leaves flowers fruits and seeds broadest definition is word s use to mean matter of plant origin more specifically a vegetable may be defined as any plant part of which is used for food a secondary meaning then being edible part of such a plant a more precise definition is any plant part consumed for food that is not a fruit or seed but including mature fruits that are eaten as part of a main meal falling outside these definitions are edible fungi such as edible mushrooms and edible seaweed which although not parts of plants are often treated as vegetables in latter mentioned definition of vegetable which is used in everyday language words fruit and vegetable are mutually exclusive fruit has a precise botanical meaning being a part that developed from ovary of a flowering plant this is considerably different from word s culinary meaning while peaches plums and oranges are fruit in both senses many items commonly called vegetables such as eggplants bell peppers and tomatoes are botanically fruits question of whether tomato is a fruit or a vegetable found its way into united states supreme court in 1893 court ruled unanimously in nix v hedden that a tomato is correctly identified as and thus taxed as a vegetable for purposes of tariff of 1883 on imported produce court did acknowledge however that botanically speaking a tomato is a fruit nix v hedden 149 u s 304 1893 findlaw com history before advent of agriculture humans were hunter gatherers they foraged for edible fruit nuts stems leaves corms and tubers scavenged for dead animals and hunted living ones for food forest gardening in a tropical jungle clearing is thought to be first example of agriculture useful plant species were identified and encouraged to grow while undesirable species were removed plant breeding through selection of strains with desirable traits such as large fruit and vigorous growth soon followed while first evidence for domestication of grasses such as wheat and barley has been found in fertile crescent in middle east it is likely that various peoples around world started growing crops in period 10 000 bc to 7 000 bc subsistence agriculture continues to this day with many rural farmers in africa asia south america and elsewhere using their plots of land to produce enough food for their families while any surplus produce is used for exchange for other goods throughout recorded history rich have been able to afford a varied diet including meat vegetables and fruit but for poor people meat was a luxury and food they ate was very dull typically comprising mainly some staple product made from rice rye barley wheat millet or maize addition of vegetable matter provided some variety to diet staple diet of aztecs in central america was maize and they cultivated tomatoes avocados beans peppers pumpkins squashes peanuts and amaranth seeds to supplement their tortillas and porridge in peru incas subsisted on maize in lowlands and potatoes at higher altitudes they also used seeds from quinoa supplementing their diet with peppers tomatoes and avocados in ancient china rice was staple crop in south and wheat in north latter made into dumplings noodles and pancakes vegetables used to accompany these included yams soybeans broad beans turnips spring onions and garlic diet of ancient egyptians was based on bread often contaminated with sand which wore away their teeth meat was a luxury but fish was more plentiful these were accompanied by a range of vegetables including marrows broad beans lentils onions leeks garlic radishes and mainstay of ancient greek diet was bread and this was accompanied by goat s cheese olives figs fish and occasionally meat vegetables grown included onions garlic cabbages melons and lentils in ancient rome a thick porridge was made of emmer wheat or beans accompanied by green vegetables but little meat and fish was not esteemed romans grew broad beans peas onions and turnips

dietary fiber and are important sources of essential vitamins minerals and trace elements particularly important are antioxidant vitamins a c and e when vegetables are included in diet there is found to be a reduction in incidence of cancer stroke cardiovascular disease and other chronic ailments research has shown that compared with individuals who eat less than three servings of fruits and vegetables each day those that eat more than five servings have an approximately twenty percent lower risk of developing coronary heart disease or stroke nutritional content of vegetables varies considerably some contain useful amounts of protein though generally they contain little fat and varying proportions of vitamins such as vitamin a vitamin k and vitamin b6 dietary minerals and carbohydrates however vegetables often also contain toxins and which interfere with absorption of nutrients these include a a enzyme inhibitors of protease amylase etc cyanide and cyanide precursors oxalic acid tannins and others these toxins are natural defenses used to ward off insects predators and fungi that might attack plant some beans contain and cassava roots contain cyanogenic glycoside as do bamboo shoots these toxins can be deactivated by adequate cooking green potatoes contain and should be avoided fruit and vegetables particularly leafy vegetables have been implicated in nearly half gastrointestinal infections caused by norovirus in united states these foods are commonly eaten raw and may become contaminated during their preparation by an infected food handler hygiene is important when handling foods to be eaten raw and such products need to be properly cleaned handled and stored to limit contamination dietary recommendations usda dietary guidelines for americans recommends consuming five to nine servings of fruit and vegetables daily fabulous fruits versatile vegetables united states department of agriculture retrieved 2012 03 30 total amount consumed will vary according to age and gender and is determined based upon standard portion sizes typically consumed as well as general nutritional content potatoes are not included in count as they are mainly providers of starch for most vegetables and vegetable juices one serving is half of a cup and can be eaten raw or cooked for leafy greens such as lettuce and spinach a single serving is typically a full cup a variety of products should be chosen as no single fruit or vegetable provides all nutrients needed for health international dietary guidelines are similar to ones established by usda japan for example recommends consumption of five to six servings of vegetables daily japanese diet food guide pyramid com french recommendations provide similar guidelines and set daily goal at five servings french dietary guide food guide pyramid com in india daily recommendation for adults is of vegetables per day production cultivation thumb right growing vegetables in south africa vegetables have been part of human diet from time immemorial some are staple foods but most are accessory foodstuffs adding variety to meals with their unique flavors and at same time adding nutrients necessary for health some vegetables are perennials but most are annuals and biennials usually harvested within a year of sowing or planting whatever system is used for growing crops cultivation follows a similar pattern preparation of soil by loosening it removing or burying weeds and adding organic manures or fertilisers sowing seeds or planting young plants tending crop while it grows to reduce weed competition control pests and provide sufficient water harvesting crop when it is ready sorting storing and marketing crop or eating it fresh from ground different soil types suit different crops but in general in temperate climates sandy soils dry out fast but warm up quickly in spring and are suitable for early crops while heavy clays retain moisture better and are more suitable for late season crops growing season can be lengthened by use of fleece plastic mulch and greenhouses in hotter regions production of vegetables is constrained by climate especially pattern of rainfall while in temperate zones it is constrained by temperature and day length thumb right weeding cabbages in colorado us on a domestic scale spade fork and hoe are tools of choice while on commercial farms a range of mechanical equipment is available besides tractors these include ploughs drills cultivators irrigation equipment and harvesters new techniques are changing cultivation procedures involved in growing vegetables with computer monitoring systems gps and self steer programs for driverless machines giving economic benefits harvesting thumb left harvesting beetroot in united kingdom when a vegetable is harvested it is cut off from its source of water and nourishment it continues to transpire and loses moisture as it does so a process most noticeable in wilting of green leafy crops harvesting root vegetables when they are fully mature improves their storage life but alternatively these root crops can be left in ground and harvested over an extended period harvesting process should seek to minimise damage and bruising to crop onions and garlic can be dried for a few days in field and root crops such as potatoes benefit from a short maturation period in warm moist surroundings during which time wounds heal and skin thickens up and hardens before marketing or storage grading needs to be done to remove damaged goods and select produce according to its quality size ripeness and color storage all vegetables benefit from proper post harvest care a large proportion of vegetables and perishable foods are lost after harvest during storage period these losses may be as high as thirty to fifty percent in developing countries where adequate cold storage facilities are not available main causes of loss include spoilage caused by moisture moulds micro organisms and vermin thumb temporary storage of potatoes in netherlands storage can be short term or long term most vegetables are perishable and short term storage for a few days provides flexibility in marketing during storage leafy vegetables lose moisture and vitamin c in them degrades rapidly a few products such as potatoes and onions have better keeping qualities and can be sold when higher prices may be available and by extending marketing season a greater total volume of crop can be sold if refrigerated storage is not available priority for most crops is to store high quality produce to maintain a high humidity level and to keep produce in shade proper post harvest storage aimed at extending and ensuring shelf life is best effected by efficient cold chain application kohli 2008 why cold chain for vegetables in fruits and vegetables post harvest care basics crosstree techno visors cold storage is particularly useful for vegetables such as cauliflower eggplant lettuce radish spinach potatoes and tomatoes optimum temperature depending on type of produce there are temperature controlling technologies that do not require use of electricity such as evaporative cooling storage of fruit and vegetables in controlled atmospheres with high levels of carbon dioxide or high oxygen levels can inhibit microbial growth and extend storage life irradiation of vegetables and other agricultural produce by ionizing radiation can be used to preserve it from both microbial infection and insect damage as well as from physical deterioration it can extend storage life of food without noticeably changing its properties preservation objective of preserving vegetables is to extend their availability for consumption or marketing purposes aim is to harvest food at its maximum state of palatability and nutritional value and preserve these qualities for an extended period main causes of deterioration in vegetables after they are gathered are actions of naturally occurring enzymes and spoilage caused by micro organisms canning and freezing are most commonly used techniques and vegetables preserved by these methods are generally similar in nutritional value to comparable fresh products with regards to carotenoids vitamin e minerals and dietary fiber thumb bean field and canning factory new jersey us canning is a process during which enzymes in vegetables are deactivated and micro organisms present killed by heat sealed can excludes air from foodstuff to prevent subsequent deterioration lowest necessary heat and minimum processing time are used in order to prevent mechanical breakdown of product and to preserve flavor as far as is possible can is then able to be stored at ambient temperatures for a long period freezing vegetables and maintaining their temperature at below will prevent their spoilage for a short period whereas a temperature of is required for longer term storage enzyme action will merely be inhibited and blanching of suitably sized prepared vegetables before freezing mitigates this and prevents off flavors developing not all micro organisms will be killed at these temperatures and after thawing vegetables should be used promptly because otherwise any microbes present may proliferate thumb left sun drying tomatoes in greece traditionally sun drying has been used for some products such as tomatoes mushrooms and beans spreading produce on racks and turning crop at intervals this method suffers from several disadvantages including lack of control over drying rates spoilage when drying is slow contamination by dirt wetting by rain and attack by rodents birds and insects these disadvantages can be alleviated by using solar powered dried produce must be prevented from reabsorbing moisture during storage high levels of both sugar and salt can preserve food by preventing micro organisms from growing green beans can be salted by layering pods with salt but this method of preservation is unsuited to most vegetables marrows beetroot carrot and some other vegetables can be boiled with sugar to create jams vinegar is widely used in food preservation a sufficient concentration of acetic acid prevents development of destructive micro organisms a fact made use of in preparation of pickles chutneys and relishes fermentation is another method of preserving vegetables for later use sauerkraut is made from chopped cabbage and relies on lactic acid bacteria which produce compounds that are inhibitory to growth of other micro organisms top producers thumb farmers market showing vegetables for sale near palace in
