spent on reading story s narrative and dialogue text in game is accompanied by character sprites which represent who riki is talking to over background art throughout game player encounters cg artwork at certain points in story which take place of background art and character sprites when game is completed at least once a gallery of viewed cgs and played background music becomes available on game s title screen little busters follows a branching plot line with multiple endings and depending on decisions that player makes during game plot will progress in a specific direction there are seven main plot lines that player will have chance to experience throughout gameplay player is given multiple options to choose from and text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made to view all plot lines in their entirety player will have to replay game multiple times and make different choices to further plot to an alternate direction when first playing game scenarios for all six heroines are available once a scenario for any one heroine is completed that scenario will be unavailable in next play through because last choice that will ultimately lead to that heroine s scenario becomes unavailable for players to choose after completion of these six routes final scenario called refrain is made available which serves to bring everything to a definite conclusion and answers questions brought up throughout normal gameplay completing refrain makes available all heroine s scenarios that were previously made inaccessible during gameplay so that player can revisit scenarios again along with some extra decision points that were previously unavailable thumb 215px left an example of fighting mode in little busters featuring rin fighting masato throughout gameplay player encounters various minigames which range from simple to more complex first type of minigame encountered is a battle sequence that resembles a fighting game but no interaction from player is required to fight these recurring battle sequences represent when members of little busters get into physical fights with either each other or with others each member of fight has a set of statistics attributed to them which includes strength stamina agility reflex concentration judgment and luck along with a life bar to keep track of how many hit points a fighter has left maximum number of hit points is determined by given fighter s stamina rating weapons may be used along with any accessories fighter has in their possession and these items may be exchanged with other characters another recurring minigame involves player being able to play baseball batting practice with members of little busters player as riki controls his position and when to swing bat little busters will also participate in missions to accomplish some goal and a mission will either be completed or failed depending on choices of player these missions are connected with battle sequences and batting practice in that they serve to give characters experience obtain accessories to use during fights and improve their statistics however these missions do not affect main plot in any way player even has choice to turn off most of minigames so that player may focus on main plot including battle sequences and batting practice first time that game is played rin s statistics are weak compared to other characters however when player completes several heroine s routes rin s and riki s statistics will start out higher than before when player starts a new game allowing rin and riki to stand a better chance against opponents with higher statistics statistics of little busters members are shown in a ranking system from highest to lowest in overall statistics despite little busters having a rating for all ages there is an ample amount of cg artwork featuring female characters in risque situations though never to point to be considered sexual in nature this is in stark contrast to key s previous titles clannad and planetarian reverie of a little planet that also have ratings for all ages but those titles contain no such risque situations or even any fan service in little busters ecstasy adult elements were added to gameplay in form of sexual cgs depicting riki and a given heroine having sex ecstasy extends story for scenarios of heroines in little busters as well as increasing number of heroine routes from six to nine these three heroine routes include scenarios for kanata futaki and sasami sasasegawa two supporting characters from little busters and a new heroine named saya tokido who is only featured in ecstasy first time game is played these three heroine routes are unavailable to player until after refrain scenario is completed though player is given option to make them immediately available ecstasy has several minor additions and changes to minigames as well including addition of weapons available for use in battle sequences also ecstasy features addition of two recurring minigames related to saya a shooting game with pistols and navigating a labyrinth plot setting and themes main part of story takes place at a high school in japan there is a secret of this world that

group of friends called little busters which originally consisted of four members but expanded to five with riki during his childhood leader of little busters is kyousuke natsume who is eldest member he often comes up with absurd ideas but almost always follows up with a reasonable explanation along with it kyousuke s younger sister is rin natsume main heroine of little busters and is initially only female member of little busters she does not communicate well with others due to her poor social skills and can be seen as inarticulate due to this she is shy and is usually seen alone rin loves

story revolves around main protagonist riki naoe a young male high school student when riki was a child his parents died leaving him hopeless and depressed he was saved by a group three boys and a girl all his age who referred to themselves as little busters a group dedicated to fighting evil and preserving justice leader of group was kyousuke natsume who had a younger sister named rin other two members were masato inohara and kengo miyazawa who were friends despite being rivals they took riki out and played together with him during his time of need making him fifth little busters member

place in school term previous to little busters and riki and rin are reliving it in an artificial world created by other members of little busters they and other main characters were involved in a bus accident during a field trip and only two of them will survive kyousuke and others created artificial world to make them strong enough to deal with what will happen when they awaken in real world this was caused by a ripple effect based on all of their desires to save riki and rin world loops but though they forget what happens riki and rin do grow stronger and kyousuke hopes that they will eventually be strong enough to leave world they do manage to survive and get away from crash site before riki collapses because he has narcolepsy riki vows to fight against his narcoleptic condition which was reason why he was only able to save rin and merely get away from explosion before collapsing rejecting this turn of events rin travels back into artificial world again this time created by riki and rin and helps riki overcome his weakness afterwards two of them go back to waking up at crash site this time riki and rin work together to save everyone at crash scene kyousuke who sneaked
