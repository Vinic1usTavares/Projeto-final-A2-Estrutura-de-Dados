on albums and he needed to pick one song to cut from list in order to turn a profit on album girls just want to have lunch was chosen due to yankovic s personal dislike of song as his record label had forced him to record it in order to release dare to be stupid back in 1985 also absent from release is waffle king song had originally been recorded for off deep end however yankovic decided to swap

not be released until later in year label originally proposed a release entitled al unplugged which would have featured studio remixes of previously released material with electronic instruments missing label also wanted cover to feature yankovic holding cords of unplugged kitchen appliances yankovic did not enjoy this idea and convinced them to instead release food album a concept he hated only slightly less but would later describe it as a cheesy compilation put out against his better wishes and judgement tv album was released under similar circumstances in 1995 however when it came time to release latter album yankovic reported that record company was a whole lot nicer when they asked second time and that there was more and less demanding following release of food album and tv album in addition to various greatest hits records that had been released scotti brothers used up all of their compilation options in yankovic s contract which prevented release of further compilations when volcano records acquired his contract in late 1990s artwork album artwork which features a cartoon alien after it has eaten yankovic was created by doug lawrence who is better known as mr lawrence an american voice actor comedian writer storyboard artist animator and director grotesque cover was yankovic s passive aggressive protest against his label for forcing out album
