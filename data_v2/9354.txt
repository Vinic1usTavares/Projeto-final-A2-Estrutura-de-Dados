prepare his chicken in an iron frying pan but he did not want to deep fry although a much faster process in sanders opinion it produced dry and crusty chicken that was unevenly cooked on other hand if he prepared chicken in advance of an order there was sometimes waste at end of day in 1939 first commercial pressure cookers were released onto market predominantly designed for steaming vegetables sanders bought one and modified it into a pressure fryer which he then used to prepare chicken new method reduced production time to be comparable with deep frying yet in sanders opinion retained

his restaurant sales more than tripled with 75 percent of increase coming from sale of fried chicken in utah a product from kentucky was exotic and evoked imagery of southern hospitality as a franchise led operation kfc s success depended on work of early franchisees and harman has been described as virtual co founder of chain by sanders biographer harman trademarked phrase it s finger lickin good which was eventually adopted as a slogan across entire chain in 1957 harman bundled 14 pieces of chicken five bread rolls and a pint of gravy into a cardboard bucket and offered it to families as a complete meal for us 3 50 around us 30 in 2014 he first test trialled packaging as a favor to sanders who had called on behalf of a denver franchisee who did not know what to do with 500

had grown to over 600 making it largest fast food operation in united states in 1963 sanders met john y brown jr a young kentucky encyclopaedia salesman who explained that he was keen to join company sanders instead proposed sale of company as business skills did not come naturally to him and he lacked an obvious or willing heir among his relatives lacking sufficient funds himself brown convinced financier jack c massey to provide 60 percent of acquisition capital and provided a major contribution himself with smaller contributions from franchise holder pete harman and company officials lee cummings and harlan adams sanders then began to have doubts about selling company as some members of his family were against it group acquired company in 1964 for us 2 million around us 15 million in

and brown introduced standardization to fragmented company after visiting pete harman s operations in utah they began to implement stand alone take out model across entire chain franchisees were ordered to delist their own menu items so that they could concentrate on kfc products restaurants were re branded with a distinctive red and white striped color pattern and mansard roofs with cupolas roll out of freestanding stores accelerated company s growth as outlets exclusively selling fried chicken proved to be more appealing to potential franchisees despite selling company sanders retained significant moral authority over executives and franchisees and made his feelings clear when he disagreed with corporate decisions when massey moved company headquarters from kentucky to nashville tennessee sanders was quoted as saying this ain t no goddam tennessee fried chicken no matter what some slick silk suited son of a bitch says he believed that company had reneged on their contract with him when they opened operations in canada arguing that contract had granted him exclusive rights to operate there kfc was forced to renegotiate with sanders regarding canadian activities as he owned 1 5 million worth of stock and was using it to prevent massey from listing company publicly until his points of issue were addressed brown and massey claimed that sanders only had rights to process chicken in canada after they renegotiated contract to guarantee sanders exclusive rights over canada he sold his stock to them and company went public in 1966 after going public company bought out its 600 franchisees and directly operated them itself later that year massey resigned from day to day management of company although he remained as chairman and brown announced that headquarters would be moved to louisville kentucky by 1967 kfc had become sixth largest restaurant chain in us by sales volume and 30 percent of sales were take out brown felt that company had to expand quickly or else emerging rivals such as church s chicken would steal company s lead 863 outlets were opened in 1968 company s growth pushed its stock value to stratospheric levels according to reuters and in 1969 it was listed on new york stock exchange meanwhile kfc entered into ventures with other companies brown believed that colonel sanders brand could be used to market anything and launched kentucky roast beef restaurant chain and colonel sanders inns motels two ventures quickly failed although roast beef chain had 100 outlets by 1970 that same year kfc entered a joint venture with california based fish and chips chain h salt esquire which proved more successful but was sold off in 1980 massey resigned as chairman of company in march 1970 and brown took over his role chain had reached 3 000 outlets in 48 different countries by 1970 but expansion was often chaotic and poorly executed when he was promoted to regional manager dave thomas complained that company had become too corporate sent him a lot of mickey mouse memos and that brown lacked motivational skill a member of kfc senior management described international strategy as throwing some mud against map on wall and hoping some of it would stick first outlet in japan was opened after just two weeks preparation and it proved to be a costly failure losing 400 000 during its opening month and wasting more chicken than it

seating and its crispy chicken product kfc introduced its own extra crispy chicken in 1972 introduction of barbecue spare ribs in 1973 caused tremendous operating problems after product was launched there was a shortage of pork which pushed prices beyond what customers were willing to pay when management withdrew product they realized that fried chicken sales had been decreasing meanwhile sanders increasingly regretted selling company and his relationship with new owners had soured he began to complain of company s declining food quality to media my god that gravy is horrible they buy tap water for 15 20 cents a thousand gallons and then they mix it with flour and starch and end up with pure wallpaper paste and another thing that new crispy recipe is nothing in world but a damn fried

settled out of court with sanders for us 1 million around us 4 million in 2013 and allowed his restaurant venture to go ahead under reworked name claudia sanders dinner house heublein had no previous experience in operation of fast food outlets overconfidence led kfc to fail in such overseas markets as hong kong which company abandoned in 1975 after two years in operation sanders continued to attack heublein publicly and in 1976 complained that company doesn t know what it s doing and that it was downright embarrassing to have his image associated with such a poor quality product 800 company owned stores had become unprofitable by 1978 heublein promoted michael a miles to run chain in 1977 and miles is credited with saving ailing company by instituting its back to basics formula miles refurbished stores and introduced indoor seating and drive thru windows electronic tills produced daily customer counts inventories and profit and loss statements so that problems could be identified quickly kfc expanded internationally in 1970s and 80s particularly in japan australia and united kingdom miles also lured sanders back and listened to his recommendations for business
