hydra is a natural satellite of pluto with a diameter of approximately across its longest dimension it is second largest moon of pluto being slightly larger than nix hydra was discovered along with nix by pluto companion search team in june 2005 it was named after hydra nine headed underworld serpent in greek mythology by distance hydra is fifth and outermost moon of pluto orbiting beyond pluto s fourth moon kerberos hydra has a highly reflective surface caused by presence of water ice similar to other plutonian moons hydra s reflectivity is intermediate in between those of pluto and charon new horizons spacecraft imaged pluto and its moons in july 2015 and had returned multiple images of hydra discovery left thumb upright discovery images of nix and hydra hydra was discovered by researchers of pluto companion search team consisting of hal a weaver and many others involved in new horizons mission to pluto including alan stern and marc w buie new horizons team had suspected that pluto and charon might be accompanied by other smaller moons previously undiscovered hence they used hubble space telescope to observe faint moons around pluto since hydra s brightness is about 5 000 times fainter than pluto long exposure images of pluto were taken in order to find hydra discovery images were taken on 15 may 2005 and 18 may 2005 hydra and nix were independently discovered by max j mutchler on 15 june 2005 and by andrew j steffl on 15 august 2005 discoveries were announced on 31 october 2005 after confirmation by precovering archival hubble images of pluto from 2002 two newly discovered moons were subsequently provisionally designated s 2005 p 1 for hydra and s 2005 p 2 for nix iau circular no describing discovery moons were informally referred to as p1 and p2 respectively by discovery team naming thumb left 120px hubble image of pluto s moons annotated name hydra was approved on 21 june 2006 by international astronomical union iau and was announced along with naming of nix in iau circular 8723 iau circular no 8723 naming moons hydra was named after lernaean hydra a nine headed serpent that battled heracles in greek mythology particularly nine heads of hydra subtly references pluto s former ninth planetary status two newly named moons were intentionally named that order of their initials n and h honors new horizons mission to pluto similarly to how first two letters of pluto s name honors percival lowell hydra s name was also intentionally chosen that its initial h honors hubble space telescope used by pluto companion search team to discover hydra and nix names of features on bodies in pluto system are related to mythology and literature and history of exploration in particular names of features on hydra must be related to legendary serpents and dragons from literature mythology and history origin pluto s smaller moons including hydra were thought to have formed from debris ejected from a massive collision between pluto and another kuiper belt object similarly to how moon is believed to have formed from debris ejected by a large collision of earth ejecta from collision would then coalesce into moons of pluto it was thought that hydra had initially formed at a closer proximity to pluto and its orbit had undergone changes through tidal interactions in this case hydra along with smaller moons of pluto would have migrated outwards with charon into their current orbits around pluto charon barycenter through tidal damping by mutual tidal interactions with charon hydra s orbit around pluto charon barycenter gradually became more circular over time hydra is believed to have formed from two smaller objects merging into one single object characteristics physical characteristics hydra is irregular in shape measuring along its longest axis and its shortest axis measuring across this gives hydra measured dimensions of surface of hydra is highly reflective due to presence of water ice on its surface surface of hydra displays a neutral spectrum similarly to pluto s small moons although spectrum of hydra appears slightly bluer water ice on hydra s surface is relatively pure and shows no significant darkening compared to charon one explanation suggests that hydra s surface is continually refreshed by micrometeorite impacts ejecting darker material from surface of hydra surface spectrum of hydra is slightly bluish compared to that of nix explanations for hydra s bluish color suggest that surface of hydra has a higher amount of water ice compared to nix which could also explain hydra s very high geometric albedo or its reflectivity of 83 percent derived from crater counting data from new horizons surface of hydra is estimated to be about four billion years old large craters and indentations on hydra suggest that it may have lost some of its original mass from impact events since its formation rotation hydra is not tidally locked and rotates chaotically its rotational period and axial tilt vary quickly over astronomical timescales to point that its rotational axis regularly flips over hydra s chaotic tumbling is largely caused by varying gravitational influences of pluto and charon as they orbit around their barycenter hydra s chaotic tumbling is also strengthened by its irregular shape which creates torques that act on object at time of new horizons flyby of pluto and its moons hydra s rotation period was approximately 10 hours and its rotational axis was tilted about 110 degrees to its orbit it was rotating sideways at time of new horizons flyby hydra rotates relatively quickly compared to rest of pluto s moons which all have rotation periods greater than one day this rapid rotation of hydra is common among rotation periods of most kuiper belt objects hydra s surface material could get ejected due to centrifugal forces if it were rotating at a faster rate orbit hydra orbits pluto charon barycenter at a distance of hydra is outermost moon of pluto orbiting beyond kerberos similarly to all of pluto s moons hydra s orbit is nearly circular and is coplanar to charon s orbit all of pluto s moons have very low orbital inclinations to pluto s equator nearly circular and coplanar orbits of pluto s moons suggest that they may have gone through tidal evolutions since their formation at time of formation of pluto s smaller moons hydra may have had a more eccentric orbit around pluto charon barycenter present circular orbit of hydra may have been caused by charon s tidal damping of eccentricity of hydra s orbit through tidal interactions mutual tidal interactions of charon on hydra s orbit would cause hydra to transfer its orbital eccentricity to charon thus causing orbit of hydra to gradually become more circular over time hydra has an orbital period of approximately 38 2 days and is resonant with other moons of pluto hydra is in a 2 3 orbital resonance with nix and a 6 11 resonance with styx ratios represent numbers of orbits completed per unit time period ratios are inverses as a result of this laplace like 3 body resonance it has conjunctions with styx and nix in a 5 3 ratio hydra s orbit is close to a 1 6 orbital resonance with charon with a timing discrepancy of 0 3 a hypothesis explaining near resonance suggests that resonance originated before outward migration of charon after formation of all five known moons and is maintained by periodic local fluctuation of 5 in pluto charon gravitational field strength exploration new horizons spacecraft visited pluto system and imaged pluto and its moons during its flyby on 14 july 2015 at time of new horizons flyby hydra was behind pluto and was further away from new horizons at closest approach larger distance of hydra from new horizons resulted in lower resolution images of hydra before flyby long range reconnaissance imager on board new horizons performed measurements of hydra s size estimating hydra to be about in diameter hydra s surface composition reflectivity and other basic physical properties were later measured by new horizons during flyby first detailed image of hydra was downlinked or received from new horizons spacecraft on 15 july 2015 after flyby first detailed image of hydra taken from a distance of appeared to show brightness variations and a dark circular feature across highest resolution images of hydra were taken from a distance of with an image resolution of per pixel derived from those images hydra was given approximate size estimate of notes references external links hydra in depth by nasa s solar system
