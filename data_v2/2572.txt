as a truck driver his friend ronnie smith after playing a few local gigs with him suggested he contact eddie bond leader of smith s professional band which had an opening for a vocalist bond rejected him after a tryout advising presley to stick to truck driving because you re never going to make it as a singer phillips meanwhile was always on lookout for someone who could bring to a broader audience sound of black musicians on whom sun focused as keisker reported over and over i remember sam saying if i could find a white man who had negro sound and negro feel i could make a billion dollars in june he acquired a demo recording by jimmy sweeney of a ballad without you that he thought might suit teenage singer presley came by studio but was unable to do it justice despite this phillips asked presley to sing as many numbers as he knew he was sufficiently affected by what he heard to invite two local musicians guitarist winfield scotty moore and upright bass player bill black to work something up with presley for a recording session session held evening of july 5 proved entirely unfruitful until late in night as they were about to abort and go home presley took his guitar and launched into a 1946 blues number arthur crudup s that s all right moore recalled all of a sudden elvis just started singing this song jumping around and acting fool and then bill picked up his bass and he started acting fool too and i started playing with them sam i think had door to control booth open he stuck his head out and said what are you doing and we said we don t know well back up

interviewing presley on air phillips asked him what high school he attended in order to clarify his color for many callers who had assumed that he was black during next few days trio recorded a bluegrass number bill monroe s blue moon of kentucky again in a distinctive style and employing a jury rigged echo effect that sam phillips dubbed a single was pressed with that s all right on a side

as he performed his wide cut pants emphasized his movements causing young women in audience to start screaming moore recalled during instrumental parts he would back off from mike and be playing and shaking and crowd would just go wild black a natural showman and rode his bass hitting double licks that presley would later remember as really a wild sound like a jungle drum or something soon after moore and black left their old band starlite wranglers to play with presley regularly and dj promoter bob neal became trio s manager from august through october they played frequently at eagle s nest club and returned to sun studio for more recording sessions and presley quickly grew more confident on stage according to moore his movement was a natural thing but he was also very conscious of what got a reaction he d do something one time and then he would expand on it real quick presley made what would be his only appearance on nashville s grand ole opry stage on october 2 after a polite audience response opry manager jim denny told phillips that his singer was not bad but did not suit program louisiana hayride radio commercial and first television performances in november 1954 presley performed on louisiana hayride chief and more adventurous rival shreveport based show was broadcast to 198 radio stations in 28 states presley had another attack of nerves during first set which drew a muted reaction a more composed and energetic second set inspired an enthusiastic response house drummer d j fontana brought a new element complementing presley s movements with accented beats that he had mastered playing in strip clubs soon after show hayride engaged presley for a year s worth of saturday night appearances trading in his old guitar for 8 and seeing it promptly dispatched to garbage he purchased a martin instrument for 175 and his trio began playing in new locales including houston texas and texarkana arkansas many fledgling performers like minnie pearl

his singular product endorsement commercial for doughnut company which was never released recording a radio jingle in exchange for a box of hot glazed doughnuts elvis made his first television appearance on ksla tv television broadcast of louisiana hayride soon after he failed an audition for arthur godfrey s talent scouts on cbs television network by early 1955 presley s regular hayride

booked presley on snow s february tour when tour reached odessa texas a 19 year old roy orbison saw presley for first time his energy was incredible his instinct was just amazing i just didn t know what to make of it there was just no reference point in culture to compare it by august sun had released ten sides credited to elvis presley scotty and bill on latest recordings trio were joined by a drummer some of songs like that s all right were in what one memphis journalist described as r b idiom of negro field jazz others like blue moon of kentucky were more in country field but there was a curious blending of two different musics in both this blend of styles made it difficult for presley s music to find radio airplay according to neal many country music disc jockeys would not play it because he sounded too much like a black artist and none of rhythm and blues stations would touch him because he sounded too much like a hillbilly blend came to be known as rockabilly at time presley was variously billed as king of western bop hillbilly cat and memphis flash presley renewed neal s management contract in august 1955 simultaneously appointing parker as his special adviser group maintained an extensive touring schedule throughout second half of year neal recalled it was almost frightening reaction that came to elvis from teenaged boys so many of them through some sort of jealousy would practically hate him there were occasions in some towns in texas when we d have to be sure to have a police guard because somebody d always try to take a crack at him they d get a gang and try to waylay him or something trio became a quartet when hayride drummer fontana joined as a full member in mid october they played a few shows in support of bill haley whose rock around clock track had been a number one hit previous year haley observed that presley had a natural feel for rhythm and advised him to sing fewer ballads at country disc jockey convention in early november

seven recently recorded tracks were of a broad variety there were two country songs and a bouncy pop tune others would centrally define evolving sound of rock and roll blue suede shoes an improvement over perkins in almost every way according to critic robert hilburn and three r b numbers that had been part of presley s stage repertoire for some time covers of little richard ray charles and drifters as described by hilburn these were most revealing of all unlike many white artists who watered down gritty edges of original r b versions of songs in 50s presley reshaped them he not only injected tunes with his own vocal character but also made guitar not piano lead instrument in all three cases it became first rock and roll album to top billboard chart a position it held for 10 weeks while presley was not an innovative guitarist like moore or contemporary african american rockers bo diddley and chuck berry cultural historian gilbert b rodman argued that album s cover image of

training with jurgen it became a lifelong interest which he later included in his live performances fellow soldiers have attested to presley s wish to be seen as an able ordinary soldier despite his fame and to his generosity he donated his army pay to charity purchased tv sets for base and bought an extra set of fatigues for everyone in his outfit while in friedberg presley met 14 year old priscilla beaulieu they would eventually marry after a seven and a half year courtship in her autobiography priscilla said that presley was concerned that his 24 month spell as a gi would ruin his career in special services he would have been able to give musical performances and remain in touch with public but parker had convinced him that to gain popular respect he should serve his country as a regular soldier media reports echoed presley s concerns about his career but rca producer steve sholes and freddy of hill and range had carefully prepared for his two year hiatus armed with a substantial amount of unreleased material they kept up a regular stream of successful releases between his induction and discharge presley had ten top 40 hits including wear my ring around your neck best selling hard headed woman and one night in 1958 and now and then there s a fool such as i and number one a big hunk o love in 1959 rca also generated four albums compiling old material during

session two weeks later yielded a pair of his best selling singles ballads it s now or never and are you lonesome tonight along with rest of elvis is back album features several songs described by greil marcus as full of chicago blues menace driven by presley s own super miked acoustic guitar brilliant playing by scotty moore and demonic sax work from boots randolph elvis singing wasn t sexy it was pornographic as a whole record conjured up vision of a performer who could be all things in words of music historian john robertson a flirtatious teenage idol with a heart of gold a tempestuous

presley with juliet prowse in g i blues presley returned to television on may 12 as a guest on frank sinatra timex special ironic for both stars given sinatra s not so distant excoriation of rock and

of 24 local charities during a luncheon preceding event rca presented him with a plaque certifying worldwide sales of over 75 million records a 12 hour nashville session in mid march yielded nearly all of presley s next studio album something for everybody as described by john robertson it exemplifies nashville sound restrained cosmopolitan style that would define country music in 1960s presaging much of what was to come from presley himself over next half decade album is largely a pleasant unthreatening pastiche of music that had once been elvis birthright it would be his sixth number one lp another benefit concert raising money for a pearl harbor memorial was staged on march 25 in hawaii it was to be presley s last public performance for seven years lost in hollywood parker had by now pushed presley into a heavy film making schedule focused on formulaic modestly budgeted musical comedies presley at first insisted on pursuing higher roles but when two films in a more dramatic vein flaming star 1960 and wild in country 1961 were less commercially successful he reverted to formula among 27 films he made during 1960s there were a few further exceptions his films were almost universally panned critic andrew caine dismissed them as a pantheon of bad taste nonetheless they were virtually all profitable hal wallis who produced nine of them declared a presley picture is only sure thing in hollywood of presley s films in 1960s 15 were accompanied by soundtrack albums and another 5 by soundtrack eps films rapid production and release schedules he frequently starred in three a year affected his music according to jerry leiber soundtrack formula was already evident before presley left for army three ballads one medium tempo number one up tempo and one break blues boogie as decade wore on quality of soundtrack songs grew progressively worse julie parrish who appeared in paradise hawaiian style 1966 says that he disliked many of songs chosen for his films jordanaires gordon stoker describes how presley would retreat from studio microphone material was so bad that he felt like he couldn t sing it most of film albums featured a song or two from respected writers such as team of doc and mort shuman but by and large according to biographer jerry hopkins numbers seemed to be written on order by men who never really understood elvis or rock and roll regardless of songs quality it has been argued that presley generally sang them well with commitment critic dave marsh heard opposite presley isn t trying probably wisest course in face of material like no room to rumba in a sports car and rock a hula baby in first half of decade three of presley s soundtrack albums were ranked number one on pop charts and a few of his most popular songs came from his films such as can t help falling in love 1961 and return to sender 1962 viva las vegas title track to 1964 film was a minor hit as a b side and became truly popular only later but as with artistic merit commercial returns steadily diminished during a five year span 1964 through 1968 presley had only one top ten hit crying in chapel 1965 a gospel number recorded back in 1960 as for non film albums between june 1962 release of pot luck and november 1968 release of soundtrack to television special that signaled his comeback only one lp of new material by presley was issued gospel album how great thou art 1967 it won him his first grammy award for best sacred performance as marsh described presley was arguably greatest white gospel singer of his time and really last rock roll artist to make gospel as vital a component of his musical personality as his secular songs shortly before christmas 1966 more than seven years since they first met presley proposed to priscilla beaulieu they were married on may 1 1967 in a brief ceremony in their suite at aladdin hotel in las vegas flow of formulaic films and assembly line soundtracks rolled on it was not until october 1967 when clambake soundtrack lp registered record low sales for a new presley album that rca executives recognized a problem by then of course damage had been done as historians connie kirchberg and marc

stepped up for next two shows presley went onstage with a derringer in his right boot and a 45 pistol in his waistband but concerts succeeded without any incidents album that s way it is produced to accompany documentary and featuring both studio and live recordings marked a stylistic shift as music historian john robertson noted authority of presley s singing helped disguise fact that album stepped decisively away from american roots inspiration of memphis sessions towards a more middle of road sound with country put on back burner and soul and r b left in memphis what was left was very classy very clean white pop perfect for las vegas crowd but a definite retrograde step for elvis after end of his international engagement on september 7 presley embarked on a week long concert tour

begun collecting and to signify official sanction of his patriotic efforts nixon who apparently found encounter awkward expressed a belief that presley could send a positive message to young people

americanism presley and his friends previously had a four hour get together with beatles at his home in bel air california in august 1965 on hearing reports of meeting paul mccartney later said that

in u s where it won a 57 percent share of tv audience over time parker s claim that it was seen by one billion or more people would be broadly accepted but that figure appeared to have been sheer invention presley s stage costume became most recognized example of elaborate concert garb with which his latter day persona became closely associated as described by bobbie ann mason at end of show when he spreads out his american eagle cape with full stretched wings of eagle studded on back he becomes a god figure accompanying double album released in february went to number one and eventually sold over 5 million copies in united states it proved to be presley s last u s number one pop album during his lifetime at a midnight show same month four men rushed onto stage in an apparent attack security men came to presley s defense and he ejected one invader from stage himself following show he became obsessed with idea that men had been sent by mike stone to kill him though they were shown to have been only fans he raged there s too much pain in me stone must die his outbursts continued with such intensity that a physician was unable to calm him despite administering large doses of medication after another two full days of raging red west his friend and bodyguard felt compelled to get a price for a contract killing and was relieved when presley decided aw hell let s just leave it for now maybe it s a bit heavy 1973 1977 health deterioration and death medical crises and last studio sessions presley s divorce was finalized on october 9 1973 by then his health was in major and

since his comeback he had staged more live shows with each passing year and 1973 saw 168 concerts his busiest schedule ever despite his failing health in 1974 he undertook another intensive touring schedule presley s condition declined precipitously in september keyboardist tony brown remembered presley s arrival at a university of maryland concert he fell out of limousine to his knees people jumped to help and he pushed them away like don t help me he walked on stage and held onto mic for first thirty minutes like it was a post everybody s looking at each other like is tour gonna happen guitarist john wilkinson recalled he was all gut he was slurring he was so fucked up it was obvious he was drugged it was obvious there was something terribly wrong with his body it was so bad words to songs were barely intelligible i remember crying he could barely get through introductions wilkinson recounted that a few nights later in detroit i watched him in his dressing room just draped over a chair unable to move so often i thought boss why don t you just cancel this tour and take a year off i mentioned something once in a guarded moment he patted me on back and said it ll be all right don t you worry about it presley continued to play to sellout crowds as cultural critic marjorie garber describes he was now widely seen as a garish pop crooner in effect he had become liberace even his fans were now middle aged matrons and blue haired grandmothers on july 13 1976 vernon presley who had become deeply involved in his son s financial affairs fired memphis mafia bodyguards red west presley s friend since 1950s sonny west and david hebler citing need to cut back on expenses presley was in palm springs at time and some suggested that he was too cowardly to face three himself another associate of presley s john o grady argued that bodyguards were dropped because their rough treatment of fans had prompted too many lawsuits however presley s stepbrother david stanley claimed that bodyguards were fired because they were becoming more outspoken about presley s drug dependency rca which had enjoyed a steady stream of product from presley for over a decade grew anxious as his interest in spending time in studio waned after a december 1973 session that produced 18 songs enough for almost two albums he did not enter studio in 1974 parker sold rca on another concert record elvis recorded live on stage in memphis recorded on march 20 it included a version of how great thou art that would win presley his third and final competitive grammy award all three of his competitive grammy wins out of 14 total nominations were for gospel recordings presley returned to studio in hollywood in march 1975 but parker s attempts to arrange another session toward end of year were unsuccessful in 1976 rca sent a mobile studio to graceland that made possible two full scale recording sessions at presley s home even in that comfortable context recording process became a struggle for him for all concerns of his label and manager in studio sessions between july 1973 and october 1976 presley recorded virtually entire contents of six albums though he was no longer a major presence on pop charts five of those albums entered top five of country chart and three went to number one promised land 1975 from elvis presley boulevard memphis tennessee 1976 and moody blue 1977 story was similar with his singles there were no major pop hits but presley was a significant force in not just country market but on adult contemporary radio as well eight studio singles from this period released during his lifetime were top ten hits on one or both charts four in 1974 alone my boy was a number one adult contemporary hit in 1975 and moody blue topped country chart and reached second spot on adult contemporary chart in 1976 perhaps his most critically acclaimed recording of era came that year with what greil marcus described as his apocalyptic attack on soul classic hurt if he felt way he sounded dave marsh wrote of presley s performance wonder isn t that he had only a year left to live but that he managed to survive that long final months and death presley and linda thompson split in november 1976 and he took up with a new girlfriend ginger alden he proposed to alden and gave her an engagement ring two months later though several of his friends later claimed that he had no serious intention of marrying again journalist tony wrote that by early 1977 presley had become a grotesque caricature of his sleek energetic former self hugely overweight his

march 31 presley failed to perform in baton rouge unable to get out of his hotel bed a total of four shows had to be canceled and rescheduled despite accelerating deterioration of his health he stuck to most touring commitments according to guralnick fans were becoming increasingly voluble about their disappointment but it all seemed to go right past presley whose world was now confined almost entirely to his room and his spiritualism books a cousin billy smith recalled how presley would sit in his room and chat for hours sometimes recounting favorite monty python sketches and his own past escapades but more often gripped by paranoid obsessions that reminded smith of howard hughes way down presley s last single issued during his career was released on june 6 that month cbs filmed two concerts for a tv special elvis in concert to be aired in october in first shot in omaha on june 19 presley s voice guralnick writes is almost unrecognizable a small childlike instrument in which he talks more than sings most of songs casts about uncertainly for melody in others and is virtually unable to articulate or project two days later in rapid city south dakota he looked healthier seemed to have lost a little weight and sounded better too though by conclusion of performance his face was framed in a helmet of blue black hair from which sweat sheets down over pale swollen cheeks his

expose to detail presley s years of drug misuse he was devastated by book and tried unsuccessfully to halt its release by offering money to publishers by this point he suffered from multiple ailments glaucoma high blood pressure liver damage and an enlarged colon each magnified and possibly caused by drug abuse on evening of tuesday august 16 1977 presley was scheduled to fly out of memphis to begin another tour that afternoon ginger alden discovered him in an unresponsive state on a bathroom floor according to her eyewitness account elvis looked as if his entire body had completely frozen in a seated position while using commode and then had fallen forward in that fixed position directly in front of it it was clear that from time whatever hit him to moment he had landed on floor elvis hadn t moved attempts to revive him failed and his death was officially pronounced at 3 30 p m at baptist memorial hospital president jimmy carter issued a statement that credited presley with having

steal presley s body in late august remains of both presley and his mother were reburied in graceland s meditation garden on october 2 cause of death while an autopsy undertaken same day presley died was still in progress memphis medical examiner dr jerry francisco announced that immediate cause of death was cardiac arrest asked if drugs were involved he declared that drugs played no role in presley s death in fact drug use was heavily implicated in presley s death writes guralnick pathologists conducting autopsy thought it possible for instance that he had suffered anaphylactic shock brought on by codeine pills he had gotten from his dentist to which he was known to have had a mild allergy a pair of lab reports filed two months later strongly suggested that was primary cause of death one reported fourteen drugs in elvis system ten in significant quantity in 1979 forensic pathologist cyril conducted a review of reports and concluded that a combination of central nervous system depressants had resulted in presley s accidental death forensic historian and pathologist michael baden viewed situation as complicated elvis had had an enlarged heart for a long time that together with his drug habit caused his death but he was difficult to diagnose it was a judgment call competence and ethics of two of centrally involved medical professionals were seriously questioned dr francisco had offered a cause of death before autopsy was complete claimed underlying ailment was cardiac arrhythmia a condition that can be determined only in someone who is still alive and denied drugs played any part in presley s death before toxicology results were known allegations of a cover up were widespread while a 1981 trial of presley s main physician dr george nichopoulos exonerated him of criminal liability for his death facts were startling in first eight months of 1977 alone he had prescribed more than 10 000 doses of sedatives amphetamines and narcotics all in elvis name his license was suspended for three months it was permanently revoked in 1990s after tennessee medical board brought new charges of over prescription in 1994 presley autopsy report was reopened dr joseph davis who had conducted thousands of autopsies as miami dade county coroner declared at its completion there is nothing in any of data that supports a death from drugs in fact everything points to a sudden violent heart attack more recent research has revealed that dr francisco did not speak for entire pathology team other staff could say nothing with confidence until they got results back from laboratories if then that would be a matter of weeks one of examiners dr e eric muirhead could not believe his ears francisco had not only presumed to speak for hospital s team of pathologists he had announced a conclusion that they had not reached early on a meticulous dissection of body confirmed that elvis was chronically ill with diabetes glaucoma and constipation as they proceeded doctors saw evidence that his body had been wracked over a span of years by a large and constant stream of drugs they had also studied his hospital records which included two admissions for drug detoxification and methadone treatments writer frank coffey thought elvis death was due to a phenomenon called valsalva maneuver essentially straining on toilet leading to heart stoppage plausible because elvis suffered constipation a common reaction to drug use in similar terms dr dan warlick who was present at autopsy believes presley s chronic constipation result of years of prescription drug abuse and high fat high cholesterol brought on what s known as valsalva s maneuver put simply strain of attempting to defecate compressed singer s abdominal aorta shutting down his heart however in 2013 dr forest tennant who had testified as a defense witness in nichopoulos trial described his own analysis of presley s available medical records he concluded that presley s drug abuse had led to falls head trauma and overdoses that damaged his brain and that his death was due in part to a toxic reaction to codeine exacerbated by an undetected liver enzyme defect which can cause sudden cardiac arrhythmia dna analysis in 2014 of a hair sample purported to be presley s found evidence of genetic variants that can lead to glaucoma migraines and obesity a crucial variant associated with heart muscle disease hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was also identified later developments between 1977 and 1981 six of presley s posthumously released singles were top ten country hits graceland was opened to

presley top earning deceased celebrity for fifth straight year with a gross income of 45 million he placed second in 2006 returned to top spot next two years and ranked fourth in 2009 following year he was ranked second with his highest annual income ever 60 million spurred by celebration of his 75th birthday and launch of cirque du soleil s viva elvis show in las vegas in november 2010 viva elvis album was released setting his voice to newly recorded instrumental tracks as of mid 2011 there were an estimated 15 000 licensed presley products and he was again second highest earning deceased celebrity six years later he ranked fourth with earnings of 35 million up 8 million from 2016 due in part to opening of a new entertainment complex elvis presley s memphis and hotel guest house at graceland for much of his adult life presley with his rise from poverty to riches and massive fame had seemed to epitomize american dream in his final years and even more so after his death and revelations about its circumstances he became a symbol of excess and gluttony increasing attention for instance was paid to his appetite for rich heavy southern cooking of his upbringing foods such as chicken fried steak and biscuits and gravy in particular his love of calorie laden fried peanut butter banana and sometimes bacon sandwiches now known as elvis sandwiches came to stand for this aspect of his persona but elvis sandwich represents more than just unhealthy overindulgence as media and culture scholar robert thompson describes unsophisticated treat also signifies presley s enduring all american appeal he wasn t only king he was one of us since 1977 there have been numerous alleged sightings of presley a long standing conspiracy theory among some fans is that he faked his death adherents cite alleged discrepancies in death certificate reports of a wax dummy in his original coffin and accounts of presley planning a diversion so he could retire in peace an unusually large number of fans have domestic shrines devoted to presley and journey to sites with which he is connected however faintly every august 16 anniversary of his death thousands of people gather outside graceland and celebrate his memory with a candlelight ritual with elvis it is not just his music that has survived death writes ted harrison he himself has been raised like a medieval saint to a figure of cultic status it is as if he has been canonized by acclamation artistry influences presley s earliest musical influence came from gospel his mother recalled that from age of two at assembly of god church in tupelo attended by family he would slide down off my lap run into aisle and scramble up to platform there he would stand looking at choir and trying to sing with them in memphis presley frequently attended all night gospel singings at ellis auditorium where groups such as statesmen quartet led music in a style that guralnick suggests sowed seeds of presley s future stage act as a teenager presley s musical interests were wide ranging and he was deeply informed about both white and african american musical idioms though he never had any formal training he was blessed with a remarkable memory and his musical knowledge was already considerable by time he made his first professional recordings aged 19 in 1954 when jerry leiber and mike stoller met him two years later they were astonished at his encyclopedic understanding of blues and as stoller put it he certainly knew a lot more than we did about country music and gospel music at a press conference following year he proudly declared i know practically every religious song that s ever been written musicianship presley received his first guitar when he was 11 years old he learned to play and sing he gained no formal musical training but had an innate natural talent and could easily pick up music presley played guitar bass and piano while he couldn t read or write music and had no formal lessons he was a natural musician and played everything by ear presley often played an instrument in his recordings and produced his own music presley played rhythm acoustic guitar in most of his sun recordings and his 1950s rca albums presley played electric bass guitar in one of his recordings called you re so square baby i don t care after his bassist bill black had trouble with instrument presley played bass line including intro presley played piano in songs such as old shep and first in line from his 1956 album called elvis he is later credited with playing piano throughout some of later albums that he recorded such as from elvis in memphis and moody blue which he played piano in unchained melody which was one of last songs that he recorded presley played lead guitar in one of his successful singles called one night presley also played guitar on one of his successful singles called are you lonesome tonight in 68 comeback special elvis took over on lead electric guitar first time he had ever been seen with electric guitar instrument in public and played it performing songs such as baby what you want me to do miss and others elvis played back of his guitar in some of his hits such as all shook up don t be cruel let me be your teddy bear and others providing a percussion through his guitar playing by slapping on it to create a beat album elvis is back features presley playing a lot of acoustic guitar in songs such as i will be home again like a baby and others musical styles and genres thumb alt photo of elvis and jordanaires presley with his longtime vocal backup group jordanaires march 1957 presley was a central figure in development of rockabilly according to music historians rockabilly crystallized into a recognizable style in 1954 with elvis presley s first release on sun label writes craig morrison paul friedlander describes defining elements of rockabilly which he similarly characterizes as essentially an elvis presley construction raw emotive and slurred vocal style and emphasis on rhythmic feeling of blues with string band and strummed rhythm guitar of country in that s all right presley trio s first record scotty moore s guitar solo a combination of merle travis style country finger picking double stop slides from acoustic boogie and blues based bent note single string work is a microcosm of this fusion while katherine charlton likewise calls presley rockabilly s originator carl perkins has explicitly stated that sam phillips elvis and i didn t create rockabilly and according to michael campbell bill haley recorded first big rockabilly hit in moore s view too it had been there for quite a while really carl perkins was doing basically same sort of thing up around jackson and i know for a fact jerry lee lewis had been playing that kind of music ever since he was ten years old at rca presley s rock and roll sound grew distinct from rockabilly with group chorus vocals more heavily amplified electric guitars and a tougher more intense manner while he was known for taking songs from various sources and giving them a rockabilly rock and roll treatment he also recorded songs in other genres from early in his career from pop standard blue moon at sun to country ballad how s world treating you on his second lp to blues of santa claus is back in town in 1957 his first gospel record was released four song ep peace in valley certified as a million seller it became top selling gospel ep in recording history presley would record gospel periodically for rest of his life after his return from military service in 1960 presley continued to perform rock and roll but characteristic style was substantially toned down his first post army single number one hit stuck on you is typical of this shift rca publicity materials referred to its mild rock beat ernst jorgensen calls it upbeat pop number five she s not you 1962 integrates jordanaires so completely it s practically doo wop modern blues r b sound captured with success on elvis is back was essentially abandoned for six years until such 1966 67 recordings as down in alley and hi heel sneakers presley s output during most of 1960s emphasized pop music often in form of ballads such as are you lonesome tonight a number one in 1960 it s now or never which also topped chart that year was a classically influenced variation of pop based on neapolitan o sole mio and concluding with a full voiced operatic cadence these were both dramatic numbers but most of what presley recorded for his many film soundtracks was in a much lighter vein while presley performed several of his classic ballads for 68 comeback special sound of show was dominated by aggressive rock and roll he would record few new straight ahead rock and roll songs thereafter as he explained they were hard to find a significant exception was burning love his last major hit on pop charts like his work of 1950s presley s subsequent recordings reworked pop and country songs but in markedly different permutations his stylistic range now began to embrace a more contemporary rock sound as well as soul and funk much of elvis in memphis as well as suspicious minds cut at same sessions reflected his new rock and soul fusion in mid 1970s many of his singles found a home on country radio field where he first became a star vocal style and range developmental arc of presley s singing voice as described by critic dave marsh goes from high and thrilled in early days to lower and perplexed in final months marsh credits presley with introduction of vocal stutter on 1955 s baby let s play house when on don t be cruel presley slides into a that marks transition between first two verses he shows how masterful his relaxed style really is marsh describes vocal performance on can t help falling in love as one of gentle insistence and delicacy of phrasing with line shall i stay pronounced as if words are fragile as crystal thumb alt publicity photo of elvis playing guitar publicity photo for cbs program stage show january 16 1956 jorgensen calls 1966 recording of how great thou art an extraordinary fulfillment of his vocal ambitions as presley crafted for himself an ad hoc arrangement in which he took every part of four part vocal from bass intro to soaring heights of song s operatic climax becoming a kind of one man quartet guralnick finds stand by me from same gospel sessions a beautifully articulated almost nakedly yearning performance but by contrast feels that presley reaches beyond his powers on where no one stands alone resorting to a kind of inelegant bellowing to push out a sound that jake hess of statesmen quartet had in his command hess himself thought that while others might have voices equal of presley s he had that certain something that everyone searches for all during their lifetime guralnick attempts to pinpoint that something warmth of his voice his controlled use of both vibrato technique and natural falsetto range subtlety and deeply felt conviction of his singing were all qualities recognizably belonging to his talent but just as recognizably not to be achieved without sustained dedication and effort marsh praises his 1968 reading of u s male bearing down on hard guy lyrics not sending them up or overplaying them but tossing them around with that astonishingly tough yet gentle assurance that he brought to his sun records performance on in ghetto is according to jorgensen devoid of any of his characteristic vocal tricks or mannerisms instead relying on exceptional clarity and sensitivity of his voice guralnick describes song s delivery as of almost translucent eloquence so quietly confident in its simplicity on suspicious minds guralnick hears essentially same remarkable mixture of tenderness and poise but supplemented with an expressive quality somewhere between stoicism at suspected infidelity and anguish over impending loss music critic henry pleasants observes that presley has been described variously as a baritone and a tenor an extraordinary compass and a very wide range of vocal color have something to do with this divergence of opinion he identifies presley as a high baritone calculating his range as two octaves and a third from baritone low g to tenor high b with an upward extension in falsetto to at least a d flat presley s best octave is in middle d flat to d flat granting an extra full step up or down in pleasants view his voice was variable and unpredictable at bottom often brilliant at top with capacity for full voiced high gs and as that an opera baritone might envy scholar lindsay waters who figures presley s range as two and a quarter octaves emphasizes that his voice had an emotional range from tender whispers to sighs down to shouts grunts and sheer that could move listener from calmness and surrender to fear his voice can not be measured in octaves but in decibels even that misses problem of how to measure delicate whispers that are hardly audible at all presley was always able to duplicate open hoarse ecstatic screaming shouting wailing reckless sound of black rhythm and blues and gospel singers writes pleasants and also demonstrated a remarkable ability to assimilate many other vocal styles public image racial issues when dewey phillips first aired that s all right on memphis many listeners who contacted station by phone and telegram to ask for it again assumed that its singer was black from beginning of his national fame presley expressed respect for african american performers and their music and disregard for norms of segregation and racial prejudice then prevalent in south interviewed in 1956 he recalled how in his childhood he would listen to blues musician arthur crudup originator of that s all right bang his box way i do now and i said if i ever got to place where i could feel all old arthur felt i d be a music man like nobody ever saw memphis world an african american newspaper reported that presley rock n roll phenomenon cracked memphis segregation laws by attending local amusement park on what was designated as its colored night such statements and actions led presley to be generally hailed in black community during early days of his stardom in contrast many white adults according to billboards arnold shaw did not like him and condemned him as depraved anti negro prejudice doubtless figured in adult antagonism regardless of whether parents were aware of negro sexual origins of phrase rock n roll presley impressed them as visual and aural embodiment of sex despite largely positive view of presley held by african americans a rumor spread in mid 1957 that he had at some point announced only thing negroes can do for me is buy my records and shine my shoes a journalist with national african american weekly jet louie robinson pursued story on set of jailhouse rock presley granted robinson an interview though he was no longer dealing with mainstream press he denied making such a statement or holding in any way to its racist view i never said anything like that and people who know me know that i wouldn t have said it a lot of people seem to think i started this business but rock n roll was here a long time before i came along nobody can sing that kind of music like colored people let s face it i can t sing like fats domino can i know that robinson found no evidence that remark had ever been made and on contrary elicited testimony from many individuals indicating that presley was anything but racist blues singer ivory joe hunter who had heard rumor before he visited graceland one evening reported of presley he showed me every courtesy and i think he s one of greatest though rumored remark was wholly discredited at time it was still being used against presley decades later identification of presley with racism either personally or symbolically was expressed most famously in lyrics of 1989 rap hit fight power by public enemy elvis was a hero to most but he never meant shit to me straight up racist that sucker was simple and plain persistence of such attitudes was fueled by resentment over fact that presley whose musical and visual performance idiom owed much to african american sources achieved cultural acknowledgement and commercial success largely denied his black peers into 21st century notion that presley had stolen black music still found adherents notable among african american entertainers expressly rejecting this view was jackie wilson who argued a lot of people have accused elvis of stealing black man s music when in fact almost every black solo entertainer copied his stage mannerisms from elvis moreover presley also plainly acknowledged his debt to african american musicians throughout his career addressing his 68 comeback special audience he said rock n roll music is basically gospel or rhythm and blues or it sprang from that people have been adding to it adding instruments to it experimenting with it but it all boils down to that nine years earlier he had said rock n roll has been around for many years it used to be called rhythm and blues sex symbol thumb

sex symbol image presley s physical attractiveness and sexual appeal were widely acknowledged he was once beautiful astonishingly beautiful in words of critic mark feeney television director steve binder no fan of presley s music before he oversaw 68 comeback special reported i m straight as an arrow and i got to tell you you stop whether you re male or female to look at him he was that good looking and if you never knew he was a superstar it wouldn t make any difference if he d walked in room you d know somebody special was in your presence his performance style as much as his physical beauty was responsible for presley s eroticized image writing in 1970 critic george melly described him as master of sexual simile treating his guitar as both phallus and girl in his presley obituary lester bangs credited him as man who brought overt blatant vulgar sexual frenzy to popular arts in america ed sullivan s declaration that he perceived a soda bottle in presley s trousers was echoed by rumors involving a similarly positioned toilet roll tube or lead bar while presley was marketed as an icon of heterosexuality some cultural critics have argued that his image was ambiguous in 1959 sight and sounds peter john dyer described his onscreen persona as aggressively bisexual in appeal brett farmer places orgasmic gyrations of title dance sequence in jailhouse rock within a lineage of cinematic musical numbers that offer a spectacular if not of male image in analysis of yvonne tasker elvis was an ambivalent figure who articulated a peculiar feminised objectifying version of white working class masculinity as aggressive sexual display reinforcing presley s image as a sex symbol were reports of his dalliances with various hollywood stars and starlets from natalie wood in 1950s to connie stevens and ann margret in 1960s to candice bergen and cybill shepherd in 1970s june juanico of memphis one of presley s early girlfriends later blamed parker for encouraging him to choose his dating partners with publicity in mind presley never grew comfortable with hollywood scene and most of these relationships were insubstantial associates colonel parker and thumb alt photo of elvis and colonel tom parker presley and colonel tom parker 1969 once he became presley s manager colonel tom parker insisted on exceptionally tight control over his client s career early on he and his hill and range allies brothers jean and julian aberbach perceived close relationship that developed between presley and songwriters jerry leiber and mike stoller as a serious threat to that control parker effectively ended relationship deliberately or not with new contract he sent leiber in early 1958 leiber thought there was a mistake sheet of paper was blank except for parker s signature and a line on which to enter his there s no mistake boy just sign it and return it parker directed don t worry we ll fill it in later leiber declined and presley s fruitful collaboration with writing team was over other respected songwriters lost interest in or simply avoided writing for presley because of requirement that they surrender a third of their usual royalties by 1967 parker s contracts gave him 50 percent of most of presley s earnings from recordings films and merchandise beginning in february 1972 he took a third of profit from live appearances a january 1976 agreement entitled him to half of that as well priscilla presley noted that elvis detested business side of his career he would sign a contract without even reading it presley s friend marty lacker regarded parker as a hustler and a con artist he was only interested in now money get buck and get gone lacker was instrumental in convincing presley to record with memphis producer chips moman and his handpicked musicians at american sound studio in early 1969 american sound sessions represented a significant departure from control customarily exerted by hill and range moman still had to deal with publisher s staff on site whose song suggestions he regarded as unacceptable he was on verge of quitting until presley ordered hill and range personnel out of studio although rca executive joan was later full of praise for producer s song choices and quality of recordings moman to his fury received neither credit on records nor royalties for his work throughout his entire career presley performed in only three venues outside united states all of them in canada during brief tours there in 1957 in 1968 he remarked before too long i m going to make some personal appearance tours i ll probably start out here in this country and after that play some concerts abroad probably starting in europe i want to see some places i ve never seen before rumors that he would play overseas for first time were fueled in 1974 by a million dollar bid for an australian tour parker was uncharacteristically reluctant prompting those close to presley to speculate about manager s past and reasons for his evident unwillingness to apply for a passport after presley s death it was revealed that parker was born andreas cornelis van in netherlands having immigrated illegally to u s he had reason to fear that if he left country he would not be allowed back in again parker ultimately squelched any notions presley had of working abroad claiming that foreign security was poor and venues unsuitable for a star of his magnitude parker arguably exercised tightest control over presley s film career hal wallis said i d rather try and close a deal with devil than with parker fellow film producer sam katzman described him as biggest con artist in world in 1957 robert mitchum asked presley to costar with him in thunder road which mitchum was producing and writing according to george klein one of his oldest friends presley was also offered starring roles in west side story and midnight cowboy in 1974 barbra streisand approached presley to star with her in remake of a star is born in each case any ambitions presley may have had to play such parts were thwarted by his manager s negotiating demands or flat refusals in lacker s description only thing that kept elvis going after early years was a new challenge but parker kept running everything into ground prevailing attitude may have been summed up best by response leiber and stoller received when they brought a serious film project for presley to parker and hill and range owners for their consideration in leiber s telling jean aberbach warned them to never again try to interfere with business or artistic workings of process known as elvis presley memphis mafia in early 1960s circle of friends with whom presley constantly surrounded himself until his death came to be known as memphis mafia surrounded by ir parasitic presence as journalist john harris puts it it was no wonder that as he slid into addiction and torpor no one raised alarm to them elvis was bank and it had to remain open tony brown who played piano for presley regularly in last two years of presley s life observed his rapidly declining health and urgent need to address it but we all knew it was hopeless because elvis was surrounded by that little circle of people all those so called friends in memphis mafia s defense marty lacker has said presley was his own man if we hadn t been around he would have been dead a lot earlier larry geller became presley s hairdresser in 1964 unlike others in memphis mafia he was interested in spiritual questions and recalls how from their first conversation presley revealed his secret thoughts and anxieties i mean there has to be a purpose there s got to be a reason why i was chosen to be elvis presley i swear to god no one knows how lonely i get and how empty i really feel thereafter geller supplied him with books on religion and mysticism which presley read voraciously presley would be preoccupied by such matters for much of his life taking of books on tour legacy presley s rise to national attention in 1956 transformed field of popular music and had a huge effect on broader scope of popular culture as catalyst for cultural revolution that was rock and roll he was central not only to defining it as a musical genre but in making it a touchstone of youth culture and rebellious attitude with its racially mixed origins repeatedly affirmed by presley rock and roll s occupation of a central position in mainstream american culture facilitated a new acceptance and appreciation of black culture in this regard little richard said of presley he was an integrator elvis was a blessing they wouldn t let black music through he opened door for black music al green agreed he broke ice for all of us president jimmy carter remarked on his legacy in 1977 his music and his personality fusing styles of white country and black rhythm and blues permanently changed face of american popular culture his following was immense and he was a symbol to people world over of vitality rebelliousness and good humor of his country presley also heralded vastly expanded reach of celebrity in era of mass communication at age of 21 within a year of his first appearance on american network television he was one of most famous people in world presley s name image and voice are instantly recognizable around globe he has inspired a legion of impersonators in polls and surveys he is recognized as one of most important popular music artists and influential americans elvis presley is greatest cultural force in twentieth century said composer and conductor leonard bernstein he introduced beat to everything and he changed everything music language clothes it s a whole new social revolution sixties came from it in words of john lennon nothing really affected me until elvis bob dylan described sensation of first hearing presley as like busting out of jail thumb presley s star on hollywood walk of fame at hollywood blvd on 25th anniversary of presley s death new york times asserted all talentless impersonators and appalling black velvet paintings on display can make him seem little more than a perverse and distant memory but before elvis was camp he was its opposite a genuine cultural force elvis breakthroughs are underappreciated because in this rock and roll age his hard rocking music and sultry style have triumphed so completely not only presley s achievements but his failings as well are seen by some cultural observers as adding to power of his legacy as in this description by greil marcus elvis presley is a supreme figure in american life one whose presence no matter how banal or predictable brooks no real comparisons cultural range of his music has expanded to point where it includes not only hits of day but also patriotic recitals pure country gospel and really dirty blues elvis has emerged as a great artist a great rocker a great purveyor of schlock a great heart throb a great bore a great symbol of potency a great ham a great nice person and yes a great american achievements to
