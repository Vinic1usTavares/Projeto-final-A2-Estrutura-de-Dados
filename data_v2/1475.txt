moto features a comic style user interface created by axiom design jet moto was conceived as a science fiction motorcross developers chose to create jet motos instead of wheeled motorcycles due to concerns over polygon limitations travis hilton one of programmers for game designed jet motos physics engine due to hardware limitations of playstation only player used this physics system programmer jay was tasked with developing a simpler physics system to handle nineteen ai riders during development a set of courses set in a stadium were dropped as developers felt it did not fit theme of game developers originally intended for players to be permanently out of a race when falling far off a track however they came to realize that it was not fun for players to be forced to go slow or suffer an instant defeat an attempt was made to give three strikes to a rider once rider fell for third time they were out of race however once implemented developers noticed that number of racers remaining at end of race was too random to be deemed any fun in end decision was made to simply respawn character on track pc version was ported in large part by john olsen who worked on port as his first task at singletrac pc version also features 3dfx hardware acceleration which allows for higher resolution gameplay and visual enhancements such as reflective water axiom design created user interface shell for game which has a comic book inspired feel music for jet moto was produced by big idea music productions another singletrac game released for playstation at roughly same time twisted metal 2 allows

playstation version averaging 78 9 at gaming aggregator gamerankings due to game s popularity it was re released on sony s budget line playstation greatest hits in august 1998 game was most often criticized for its controls and unusual physics which some reviewers said never feel quite right no matter how long game is played both a next generation critic and air hendrix of gamepro likened overall sensation to riding through an atmosphere made of molasses controls along with opponent ai contributed to some reviewers concluding game had an excessively high degree of difficulty however grappling feature was praised for its innovation and for adding greater depth to challenge several reviewers commented that graphics are highly uneven looking impressive in some points and embarrassingly poor in others gamespot s review of pc port praised 3dfx support several reviewers praised soundtrack to game mark cooke of game revolution said spy film like title screen music in particular both sounded cool and was appropriate for game surf guitar was a strong point for electric playground s victor lucas who cited it as one of best video game soundtracks of 1996 gamespot reviewer shane mooney also praised energy of soundtrack however air hendrix said that though menu music is decent in game music is weak while lucas and gamespots glenn rubenstein compared jet moto unfavorably to wave race 64 next generations reviewer argued that in all fairness comparison isn t truly appropriate where wave race is based around an existing vehicle that provides a basis of reference there is no actual criterion for criticism on whether a jet moto game accurately emulates jet experience he concluded that despite its odd control and graphic characteristics jet moto remains a lot of fun with intense challenging races featuring twenty competitors on ten unique tracks it never fails to be compelling chris roper of ign called it one of best racing games available for playstation in contrast air hendrix assessed that it wipes out all over pavement with finicky mushy controls and painful gameplay lucas praised design of jet moto bikes stating design was imaginative and vibrant todd mowatt and joe rybicki of electronic gaming monthly gave game laudatory reviews saying track design is its best aspect rubenstein concluded that while devout racing game enthusiasts would be pleased at how long it takes to complete game general gamer would have more fun with a game that s easier to learn in its playstation 3 retro roundup ign opined game held up well to its direct competitors at time wave race 64 and wipeout series then stated jet moto was still a pretty fun experience more than 10 years after its original release legacy jet motos popularity would spawn two additional sequels jet moto 2 also developed by singletrac and jet moto 3 developed by pacific coast power light two other titles were cancelled during their development pacific coast power light was also developing jet moto 2124 for playstation set over a century after first three games however game was cancelled when jet moto 3 showed poor sales jet moto solar developed by redzone
