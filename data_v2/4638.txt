production conception and development a number of hollywood studios had contacted george r r martin about possibly adapting his book series a song of ice and fire into a film however martin expressed opinion books could not be made into a film as too much would have to be cut from books but thought it could be made into a television series in january 2006 david benioff happened to speak to martin s literary agent and agent sent first four books of a song of ice and fire to david benioff benioff read a few hundred pages of first book in series a game of thrones called d b weiss and said maybe i m crazy but i haven t had this much fun reading anything in about 20 years so take a look because i think it might make a great hbo series weiss who then read first book in two days was very enthusiastic about a possible television project based on books they arranged a meeting with martin who asked them if they knew who jon snow s real mother might be and was satisfied with their answer in march 2006 a few weeks after meeting martin benioff and weiss pitched show to showtime and then carolyn strauss of hbo latter of whom accepted their proposal hbo acquired rights to novels to turn them into a television series with benioff and weiss as writers and executive producers of series series went into development in january 2007 series would begin with first book from 1996 a game of thrones with intention that each novel in series would form basis for a season s worth of episodes however benioff and weiss had to resubmit a proposal after carolyn strauss stepped down as president of hbo in 2008 first and second drafts of pilot script written by benioff and weiss were submitted in august 2007 and june 2008 respectively while hbo found both drafts to their liking a pilot was not ordered until november 2008 writing right thumb series co creators david benioff and d b weiss wrote episode scripted by show creators david benioff and d b weiss first episode includes plot of book s chapters 1 9 and 12 prologue bran i catelyn i daenerys i eddard i jon i catelyn ii partial arya i bran ii daenerys ii changes in adaptation include sequence of events in prologue in books it is gared and not will who survives and is beheaded by eddard afterwards and arya s material is set before arrival of royal family new scenes showing lannister twins perspective and daenerys s wedding night showing drogo not waiting for her to consent to sex filming right upright thumb sean bean portrays ned stark in series tom mccarthy was chosen to direct pilot episode shot between october 24 and november 19 2009 on location in northern ireland scotland and morocco however pilot was deemed unsatisfactory and had to be reshot new pilot episode was filmed in 2010 by new director tim van patten and several actors appearing in original pilot did not return for series tamzin merchant was replaced as daenerys targaryen by emilia clarke and jennifer ehle was replaced as catelyn stark by michelle fairley additionally ian mcneice was replaced as magister illyrio by roger allam richard ridings as gared by dermot and jamie campbell bower as ser royce by rob ostlere another difference is that original pilot featured scenes shot in scotland and scenes in pentos were shot in morocco but in aired series winterfell was filmed in a combination of locations in northern ireland while scenes from pentos were from malta doune castle in scotland was originally used to recreate winterfell and its great hall was used for some interior shots some scenes survived but as it was not practical to return to scotland for reshoot an exact replica of doune s great hall was recreated in soundstage in belfast for series castle ward in northern ireland was used in reshoot to film king robert s entourage entry into winterfell castle a car park stood in for winterfell castle s courtyard and a wine cellar for stark family crypt tollymore forest park was used for opening scene of encounter with white walkers all scenes shot in morocco were reshot in malta original pilot reused sets of kingdom of heaven in morocco to stand in for pentos and site of drogo and daenerys s wedding in malta verdala palace 16th century summer palace of president of malta was used for exterior scenes at illyrio s mansion azure window was used as backdrop for wedding filming at azure window however caused some controversy when a protected ecosystem was damaged by a subcontractor in sex scene then pregnant lena headey was substituted by a body double production hid her pregnancy for rest of season in scene in which starks encounter a stag killed by a dire wolf as they return from execution an actual animal was used rather than a prop as stag had been dead for two days it stank so much that actors had to take much care not to let it show on their faces some scenes filmed were never aired for example a flashback to death of eddard stark s brother and death of jon arryn original pilot original pilot from 2009 was poorly received in a private viewing with friends one of whom craig mazin said to benioff and weiss you guys have a massive problem and said change everything when asked for ideas it was so disliked that kit harington joked that when he annoys benioff and weiss they threaten to release episode on youtube weiss said of viewing watching them watch pilot was a deeply humiliating painful experience because these are very smart individuals and it just clearly wasn t working for any of them on a very basic level for example it was never established that two major characters jaime and cersei lannister were in fact brother and sister a major plot point hbo did not make a decision for four months after pilot was delivered in march 2010 hbo s decision to greenlight series including pilot was announced with production of series scheduled to start june 2010 hbo however demanded extensive reshoot of pilot and wanted all scenes from morocco scrapped a cameo appearance by george rr martin as a nobleman at daenerys s wedding filmed in morocco was therefore also cut in all 90 percent of pilot was re shot in 2010 with some cast changes and a different director aired episode original pilot remained unaired although some footage from original pilot was used in first aired episode this includes sansa s scenes with catelyn michelle fairley s footage as catelyn was inserted over jennifer ehle s performance will s ride through woods retained though also portrayed by a different actor most of feast at winterfell and ned and robert s scene in crypt that scene is one of a few to be filmed on 35 mm film and consequently slight film grain can be seen in hd version of episode citing extra material of season 1 blu ray box set reception preview on april 3 2011 two

like sopranos or wire it had many things in common with those shows ign s matt fowler wrote that pilot effortlessly takes us along faithfully through book but it also manages to capture majestically
