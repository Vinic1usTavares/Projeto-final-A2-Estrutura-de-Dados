first anniversary of its establishment reserve received a message from president franklin d roosevelt in which he observed you have quickly and efficiently taken over scores of different kinds of duties that not long ago were considered strictly masculine assignments and in doing so you have freed a large number of well trained battle ready men of corps for action initially general thomas holcomb commandant of u s marine corps had been opposed to having women serve in marine corps before end of 1943 however he reversed himself saying like most marines when matter first came up i didn t

as well as men they do some work far better than men what is more they re real marines they don t have a nickname and they don t need one national archives p 51 holcomb rejected all acronyms or monikers for reserve he did not believe they were compulsory despite holcomb s dislike for nicknames several of them surfaced for reserve including wams bams dainty devil dogs women s leatherneck

from patriotism colonel streeter was interested to learn reasons why young women joined reserve a survey of 1 000 new enlistees was conducted at camp lejeune north carolina which asked this question results of this survey showed that 750 enlistees had had positive reasons for enlisting some had male relatives or friends in armed forces and some wanted revenge against enemy while others wanted experience it would bring to their lives remaining 250 acknowledged they were trying to escape from something a bad home life a broken marriage boredom or some personal disappointment indications were

wants you to look your best at all times uniforms you will wear have been designed to be comfortable practical and extremely attractive when you don them you will know pride of wearing a uniform that is a symbol of valor and bravery everywhere soderbergh p 104 reserve recruits were promised uniforms upon reaching boot camp but that was not always case in fact during summer of 1943 some recruits had to train in civilian clothing until summer uniforms were available when new uniforms arrived they turned out to be winter uniforms instead of summer uniforms expected seersucker summer uniforms had yet to be designed disputes about fabric cut and production had a delaying effect upon delivery in time these issues were resolved and most reserve members felt their uniforms were much better

facilities for all of reserve training but it soon realized advantage of having its own training schools although joint training with navy proved satisfactory it did not engender marine esprit that was expected consequently marine headquarters decided to consolidate all reserve training at camp lejeune north carolina marine corps opened its own schools for officer candidates and recruit training at camp lejeune in july 1943 under command of colonel john m arthur officer candidates and recruits in training at navy facilities were transferred to camp lejeune where nearly 19 000 women became

to actual weapon demonstrations reserve personnel observed demonstrations in hand to hand combat use of mortars bazookas flame throwers an assortment of guns and landing craft however they were not trained to use these weapons themselves stremlow p 11 leaving college campuses for camp lejeune training center was a change but it introduced officer candidates and recruits to real marine corps military environment what did not change from time at mount holyoke and hunter was hostile behavior of drill instructors towards women at lejeune they did not try to hide their resentment often referring to women as bams broad assed marines and using other crude references stremlow p p 47 in early days of reserve women were subjected to considerable verbal and psychological abuse soderbergh
