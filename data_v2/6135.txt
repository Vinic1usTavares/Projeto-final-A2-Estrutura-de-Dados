maximum sustained wind associated with a tropical cyclone is a common indicator of intensity of storm within a mature tropical cyclone it is found within eyewall at a distance defined as radius of maximum wind or unlike gusts value of these winds are determined via their sampling and averaging sampled results over a period of time wind measuring has been standardized globally to reflect winds at above earth s surface and maximum sustained wind represents highest average wind over either a one minute us or ten minute time span see definition below anywhere within tropical cyclone surface winds are highly variable due to friction between atmosphere and earth s surface as well as near hills and mountains over land over ocean satellite imagery determines value of maximum sustained winds within a tropical cyclone land ship aircraft reconnaissance observations and radar imagery can also estimate this quantity when available this value helps determine damage expected from a tropical cyclone through use of such scales as saffir simpson scale definition maximum sustained wind normally occurs at a distance from center known as radius of maximum wind within a mature tropical cyclone

during hurricane wilma 2005 retrieved on 2008 07 04 most weather agencies use definition for sustained winds recommended by world meteorological organization wmo which specifies measuring winds at a height of for 10 minutes and then taking average however united states national weather service defines sustained winds within tropical cyclones by averaging winds over a period of one minute measured at same height this is an important distinctions as value of highest one minute sustained wind is about 14 greater than a ten minute sustained wind over same period united states navy retrieved on

observations are also used when available in atlantic as well as central and eastern pacific basins reconnaissance aircraft are still utilized to fly through tropical cyclones to determine flight level winds which can then be adjusted to provide a fairly reliable estimate of maximum sustained winds a reduction of 10 percent of winds sampled at flight level is used to estimate maximum sustained
