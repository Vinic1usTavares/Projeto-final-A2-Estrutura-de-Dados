creation of a park constructed on site of an older manor house two large towers and various smaller buildings had been constructed by 1483 when hastings was executed by richard duke of gloucester hastings family used castle as their seat for several generations improving gardens and hosting royal visitors during english civil war of 1640s henry a younger son in hastings family became a royalist commander in midlands he based himself out of castle until he was forced to surrender it after a long siege a fresh rebellion occurred in 1648 leading parliament to slight castle in order to prevent it being used militarily two towers were badly damaged with gunpowder and undermining parts of remaining castle were turned into a new house and continued to be used by members of hastings family for many years although they moved their main residence to donington hall castle became famous after it featured in sir walter scott s novel ivanhoe in 1819 and its owner francis rawdon opened

carried out extensive repairs and opened castle gardens in 21st century castle is managed by english heritage as a tourist attraction receiving 15 164 visitors in 2015 historian john goodall considers site to be an outstanding example of a late medieval castle with its grounds forming one of best preserved and most important examples of an early tudor garden history 11th 15th centuries thumb carved fireplace in great hall decorated with images of angels and shields a manor had existed at ashby de la zouch from at least 1086 when location was known as lands were acquired by robert de beaumont count of meulan and later earl of leicester in 1100 he established belmeis family there as his tenants and after belmeis family line died out in 1160 earls of leicester reassigned estate to le zouch family from whom manor took its later name at some point during this period a manor house was constructed on same site as later castle with a hall and a solar a settlement grew up alongside house and by 1334 town was probably sixth largest in county by mid 1300s manor house reportedly included a hall a chamber a long house containing service facilities and was surrounded by a dovecote orchard and a rabbit warren accompanied by a deer park hall and solar were rebuilt by le during second half of 14th century but building remained what historian norman pounds has called a rather modest manor house le zouch line died out in 1399 leaving inheritance of family estates uncertain manor probably passed to sir hugh burnell and around 1420 onto james butler earl of ormond and wiltshire wars of roses broke out in england during 1455 between rival supporters of lancastrian and yorkist factions james a lancastrian was captured at battle of towton by yorkist leader edward iv in 1461 and executed crown seized his estates including manor of ashby de la zouch ashby de la zouch was converted into a castle by william lord hastings a favourite of edward iv as a minor nobleman he had fought alongside edward at towton but was then knighted and later became chamberlain of royal household and lieutenant of calais william acquired extensive estates across midlands during wars much of them confiscated from his enemies amongst these was ashby de la zouch which was given to william in 1462 his father sir leonard had maintained family seat at nearby kirby muxloe but after 1471 william began to use ashby de la zouch as his primary residence in 1474 edward granted william right to crenellate or fortify four of his manors and to build deer parks around them william set about developing old manorial complex at ashby de la zouch with new buildings and was authorised to create a huge park around it his intent appears to have been to construct a substantial castle similar to royal fortifications at tutbury and nottingham with four huge towers work appears to have already started on site year before permission was formally given although it is uncertain whether this referred to construction of castle s chapel or if william had already begun work on first tower gambling that king would subsequently approve it edward iv died in 1483 leaving kingdom to his young son edward v but his uncle richard duke of gloucester had his own ambitions for throne lord hastings was unwilling to support deposition of edward v and as a consequence richard summarily executed him that june ahead of his own coronation ashby de la zouch castle only partially completed and lord hastings other estates were then restored to his widow katherine 16th 17th centuries thumb upright great tower slighted after english civil war castle passed to william s son edward hastings who appears to have spent little time at property although he hosted a visit from henry viii in 1503 it was then inherited by his son george who was a royal favourite of henry viii and made earl of huntington in 1529 which led to him rebuilding parts of castle in brick and redesigning gardens henry hastings inherited castle in 1560 where he maintained a household of 77 servants henry hastings used it to imprison mary queen of scots in 1569 after she was accused of plotting against elizabeth i although he spent most of his time at york where he led council of north it passed onto his younger brother george who entertained queen anne and prince henry there in 1603 and onto george s grandson henry who hosted james i three times between 1612 and 1617 and charles i in 1634 gardens were redeveloped probably to provide a suitable venue for these royal visits by now however several generations of excessive expenditure meant that family estates had been much diminished and family was having trouble maintaining their lavish lifestyle and former prominence in region in 1642 english civil war broke out between supporters of charles i and parliament henry hasting briefly joined royalist cause before his death in 1643 but his eldest son ferdinando who inherited family earldom remained neutral during conflict ferdinando s younger brother henry however became a key royalist commander in midlands castle was strategically well placed linking royalist territories in north and west of england and giving easy access to river trent henry used castle as his base of operations across region protecting it by establishing smaller outposts near donnington and buildings in town of ashby de la zouch were pulled down to provide materiel to refortify castle and town tunnels were dug and an irish fort constructed to help protect castle in early 1643 parliament placed newark under siege and garrison at ashby was sent to relieve it as part of a larger force under prince rupert they forced surrender of parliamentary force by late 1644 war turned against king and parliamentary forces based at nearby coleorton had contained garrison in castle king charles passed through castle in may 1645 on his way to besiege leicester but following month his forces were defeated at battle of naseby king briefly stayed at castle once again as he retreated west by now royalist cause was largely lost henry returned to castle from leicester in september where another 600 royalist soldiers soon joined him and its 60 man garrison carrying out raids on parliamentary convoys and garrison at coleorton plague broke out at end of year forcing besiegers to retreat to leicester while garrison temporarily abandoned castle buildings and occupied neighbouring park once epidemic passed parliament began to raid town and henry worked through ferdinando to agree surrender of castle on good terms this was achieved in february 1646 and allowed for release of himself garrison and their weapons in may 1648 a royalist rebellion broke out in kent there were fresh parliamentary concerns about henry hastings and fears grew that he might reoccupy ashby de la zouch castle lord grey a rival of hastings family in leicestershire was put in charge of castle in august which was used to hold royalist prisoners including james hamilton duke of hamilton ashby p 87 parliamentary worries about security of castle persisted and possibly because of henry s involvement in recent rebellion william was ordered in november to slight castle to put it beyond military use he carried out his orders immediately demolishing one side of great tower and kitchen tower undermining foundations and deploying gunpowder charges hastings family suffered financially as a result of war and ferdinando was imprisoned for debt in 1653 family moved to donington hall although some of remains of castle were repaired to form a house called ashby place which lay on north side of site in old outer court selina hastings countess of huntingdon lived there after 1746 with deterioration of castle and departure of hastings neighbouring town also fell into decline with death of francis hastings in 1789 castle was inherited by francis rawdon who later became earl of moira 18th 21st centuries thumb depiction of castle in 1831 in 1819 sir walter scott s novel ivanhoe featured a scene involving a tournament at ashby de la zouch castle novel was immensely popular and made location famous edward francis rawdon s agent repaired castle ruins and opened them to visitors whom rawdon hoped to attract to ivanhoe baths which he opened nearby ashby place which had become used as a house of industry was pulled down in 1830 and a new house ashby manor was built in its place work continued throughout 19th century to repair castle ruins although they remained mostly covered in ivy a local architect thomas carried out first archaeological investigation of site in 1900 and extensive restoration work took place following years rawdon family were given a government grant for further repairs in 1912 and they began to start charging visitors for entry family found themselves unable to afford to maintain castle and by early 1930s walls had become unstable and dangerous castle was placed into guardianship of ministry of works in 1932 who carried out repairs replacing some stonework and opening up surrounding grounds to visitors in 21st century castle is managed by english heritage as a tourist attraction receiving

only half of these towers were completed by time of his death outer court that lay to north of surviving complex has been lost having been converted into first ashby place and then ashby manor it is now occupied by manor house preparatory school historian john goodall considers ashby de la zouch to form an outstanding example of a late medieval castle kitchen tower stands on north west corner of castle and was intended to supply lord hasting s large household tower only had two storeys as ground floor kitchen had a very high high vaulted ceiling and its walls were thick and made of yellow sandstone well lit kitchen had several hearths and an oven for cooking a well and a cellar for storage above kitchen was a large room probably used as a winter parlour one wall of tower was slighted in 1648 an underground passage probably dating from english civil war links great tower with kitchen tower alongside tower separated for fire safety by a roofed passageway was a two storey service range including a buttery and pantry castle s great hall was adapted from medieval original and would originally have been subdivided by a line of arches it was heated by a central heath and lord and his guests would have eaten on a raised dais at far end of hall building was raised in height given new windows and in second half of 17th century great chamber was a two storey building originally with a parlour on ground level with a chamber above it used for entertaining guests running north from great chamber was a range of buildings used by senior household staff large chapel and built of grey sandstone lies alongside great chamber and would originally had an altar on a dais at north end one corner of chapel remains in use as a burial site by modern hastings family an inner or chapel court would have been formed by a range of buildings since lost stretching between chapel and great tower historian anthony emery notes that castle would have formed a palace fortress with sizeable chapel and adjacent towers constituting symbols of hastings power and authority great tower was a large structure of grey sandstone tall formed of a four storey tower internally linked to a smaller seven storey tower or turret across ground floor contained basement and entrance way protected by a portcullis first floor held kitchen and had a fire proof stone vaulted roof upper floors consisted of a parlour and a separate great chamber for lord with a withdrawing chamber to one side all with grander windows than lower levels with excellent views of gardens and parkland beyond a treasure chamber accessible only from upper storeys using a ladder was built into first floor emery considers richness of upper rooms and tower s planning and design qualities to be outstanding and likens it to yellow tower of ghent at raglan castle gardens and parkland thumb earthworks in eastern part of garden probably intended to resemble bastions current gardens to south of castle date from around 1530 they occupy and include two sunken areas separated by a walkway eastern area may have been intended to imitate defensive bastion works and it originally featured a circular brick tower in middle of it site would originally have had a brick wall running all way around it of which only south east edge survives two brick towers survive at southern corners one resembling a clover leaf other with an octagonal design and would have originally been used as banqueting houses beyond gardens would have been an area planted with trees called wilderness and smaller compartmented garden and ponds a triangular building called mount was built in wilderness in early 17th century and is now a private house john goodall considers them to be one of best preserved and most important early tudor gardens in england original park probably lay just to south of castle incorporating current gardens it was probably expanded to around by william hastings and was later named little park original boundaries
