to give importance to each scene adding hot colors red orange or brown in action scenes and cold ones green or light blue in others so that readers could immediately have an emotional reaction series

example of andrea sorrentino s artwork from god of war 3 described as muddy god of war comic series received mixed reviews mike murphy of platform nation stated that although comic series serves as a good prequel to video game series story is bogged down by horrible art it s muddy confusing and consistently pulls you out of story as you try to figure out just what is going on from panel to panel rating it 5 out of 10 murphy said that he can t give this one a pass even to hardcore god of war fans who should skip it after reading god of war 1 joe juba of game informer said if you have a choice between reading this comic and doing something else you should do something else like play god of war iii again he said that story adds nothing of value and it is rough despite being written by marv wolfman he said story does not satisfy fans of video game series i didn t think story made much sense and it doesn t contribute to overall lore of universe it just seems to be setting kratos up for another fetch quest he also felt that writing was exceptionally low in quality comic vine said idea here screams comic books however results were a mixed offering reviewer stated that idea of kratos finding ambrosia to save calliope was a perfect comic book incentive however things started to disintegrate when distinction between present and past became unclear a four out of five star review from binary messiah praised comic series saying that it could be made into a full game that s one freaking awesome story that right there is a premise to a whole new god of war game they said that it does a good job showing hot headedness of kratos and his selfishness saying that comics do video game series justice for fans of god of war this should be in their comic collection gamespot stated that art appears moody but also said it is muddy with a heavy digital assist from photoshop although effects were sometimes stunning other times they were distracting or even chuckle inducing despite criticism over art gamespot said that art is distinctive and lends story a very specific tone and that it matches world of god of war well enough same way kratos anger overshadows any possible storytelling subtlety in video game series joe juba gave some praise to art stating that it is kind of neat and it s stylish if nothing else binary messiah was disappointed in art they said it is very murky and washed out with black although there is some realism in art it does not match art of games they also noted a mistake with flashback scenes as in these scenes it shows kratos with his ash white skin but this complexion did not occur until after he slayed his family they did praise it for being gory like games and said while art may be iffy it does have an excellent atmosphere of darkness and
