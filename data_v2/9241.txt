roon class was a pair of armored cruisers built for german kaiserliche marine imperial navy in 1900s two ships of class and closely resembled earlier s upon which they were based roon class incorporated slight incremental improvements including a pair of extra boilers ships were easily distinguished from their predecessors by addition of a fourth funnel though additional boilers were meant to increase ships speed both vessels failed to reach their designed top speed in addition ships had comparatively light armament and thin armor protection so they compared poorly with their foreign contemporaries particularly armored cruisers of their primary opponent british royal navy two ships served in i scouting group reconnaissance force of high seas fleet after they entered service in 1905 1906 during this period yorck and roon served stints as group flagship and deputy commander flagship respectively by early 1910s first german battlecruisers had begun to enter service and roon was decommissioned in 1911 and placed in reserve yorck joined her in 1913 both ships were reactivated after world war i broke out in july 1914 they were assigned to iii scouting group with roon as its flagship and tasked with screening for main body of german fleet in november german fleet made raid on yarmouth but on return to port at wilhelmshaven fleet encountered heavy fog and had to stop off schillig yorcks commander decided that visibility had improved so he ordered his ship to get underway again but she quickly struck two german mines and sank with heavy loss of life roon was transferred to baltic in april 1915 and participated in a series of offensive operations against russian forces including attack on libau in may battle of aland islands in july and battle of gulf of riga in august threat of british submarines led to her decommissioning in 1916 after which she was employed as a training ship and an accommodation vessel plans to convert her into a seaplane tender late in war came to nothing owing to germany s defeat in 1918 and she was stricken from naval register in 1920 and broken up following year design thumb left basis for roon design second naval law in germany passed in 1900 envisioned a force of fourteen armored cruisers for both service overseas in germany s colonial empire and as scouts for main battle fleet in german waters naval expansion program was primarily directed against british royal navy then world s preeminent naval force previous armored cruiser design provided basis for next pair of vessels to be built under program design for new ships completed in 1901 were slight improvements over prinz adalberts with primary changes being addition of two boilers which necessitated a longer hull and provided an increase by about design staff projected that ships would gain in speed over earlier cruisers but in service neither actually reached that speed this failure was primarily result of their length to breadth ratio which was result of limitations imposed by dock facilities in wilhelmshaven roon class ships shared many of same layout characteristics as contemporary german pre dreadnought battleships including a smaller main armament but heavier secondary battery than their foreign equivalents and as with all of preceding german armored cruisers they received less armor protection than their opposite numbers in british fleet as a result they compared unfavorably with their british contemporaries historian john taylor describes ships as poorly protected and not a successful class in service further they suffered same fate as many pre dreadnought type vessels completed in mid 1900s having been rendered obsolescent by advent of all big gun warships like british battlecruiser launched in 1907 despite their drawbacks provided basis for follow on which proved to be far better fighting ships more than a match for their british counterparts general characteristics and machinery thumb left plan and elevation of roon class ships of roon class were long at waterline and overall they had a beam of and a draft of roon and yorck displaced normally and at full load their hulls were constructed from transverse and longitudinal steel frames that formed a structure over which steel hull plates were riveted hulls contained twelve watertight compartments and a double bottom that ran for sixty percent of length of ship like preceding prinz adalbert class ships roon and yorck were good sea boats when fuel bunkers were full they had a gentle motion they also maneuvered well and were responsive to helm steering was controlled with a single rudder with rudder hard over ships lost up to 60 percent speed ships casemates were placed too low and as a result they were exceedingly wet which rendered them impossible to use in heavy seas ships had a metacentric height of their standard complements numbered some 35 officers and 598 enlisted men while serving as a squadron flagship crew was augmented by 13 officers and 62 men and as a second command ship by 9 officers and 44 sailors roon and yorck were powered by same engine system as preceding class three 3 cylinder vertical triple expansion engines each of which drove one of ships three screws central screw was in diameter and outer screws were steam was provided to engines by sixteen coal fired water tube boilers built by dusseldorf durr each boiler had 4 fireboxes apiece for a total of 48 boilers were ducted into four funnels propulsion system produced which had a rated top speed of though on trials neither ship reached that figure with roon making and yorck only ships had four turbo generators which provided 260 kilowatts at 110 volts armament and armor thumb forward turret of roon class cruisers carried same type ships primary armament consisted of four sk l 40 guns mounted in two twin gun turrets one fore and one aft in imperial german navy gun nomenclature sk schnelladekanone denotes that gun is quick firing while l 40 denotes length of gun in this case l 40 gun is 40 calibers meaning that gun is 40 times long as it is in diameter turrets were drl c 01 type turrets which were hydraulically operated and mounts provided a range of elevation from 5 to 30 degrees these guns fired a armor piercing shell at a muzzle velocity of for a maximum range of roon class ships carried 380 shells for main battery main battery was supported by a secondary battery of ten sk l 40 guns in single turrets and casemates clustered amidships these guns fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of they could be elevated to 30 degrees which provided a maximum range of for close range defense against torpedo boats ships carried a tertiary battery of fourteen 8 8 cm sk l 35 guns which were mounted in individual casemates and pivot mounts in superstructure 8 8 cm guns fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of these guns had a maximum elevation of 25 degrees and a range of each ship carried 1 600 rounds for 15 cm guns and 2 100 shells for 8 8 cm guns as was customary for warships of period ships were also equipped with four torpedo tubes these tubes were submerged in hull one in bow one in stern and one on each broadside c 03 torpedo carried a warhead and had a range of when set at a speed of and at roon and yorck were protected by krupp cemented steel armor at waterline their armored belt was thick amidships where ships vitals were located this was decreased slightly to on either end of central section of belt belt was backed by of teak planking at casemate deck side armor was also 100 mm thick armored deck ranged in thickness from and was connected to belt by sloped armor that was thick forward conning tower had thick sides and a thick roof rear conning tower was less well protected its sides were only 80 mm thick and its roof was thick main battery gun turrets were armored with 150 mm thick steel plates on sides and 30 mm thick roofs 15 cm turrets were protected by 100 mm thick sides and 80 mm thick gun shields planned conversion of roon in 1918 design staff prepared plans to convert roon into a seaplane tender based on earlier conversions that included light cruiser by this time roon had been disarmed proposal involved installation of a hangar aft of main superstructure with equipment to handle four seaplanes she would have been armed with a battery of six 15 cm l 45 guns and six 8 8 cm flak guns though this was never carried out due to end of war later that year construction thumb roon likely during her visit to united states in 1907

ludwig graf yorck von wartenburg 25 april 1903 14 may 1904 21 november 1905 service history on entering service yorck joined i scouting group reconnaissance squadron of high seas fleet she served as group flagship for much of her early career and when roon joined her in late 1906 latter vessel became flagship of deputy commander though roon alternated in this role with armored cruiser in 1907 roon was detached for a visit to united states to represent germany at jamestown exposition both vessels made long distance cruises in atlantic in late 1900s in company with i scouting group or entire high seas fleet apart from these voyages ships were primarily occupied with an uneventful routine of peacetime training exercises roon was decommissioned in september 1911 her place in squadron having been taken by more modern battlecruisers yorck was involved in a collision with torpedo boat in march 1913 that resulted in sinking of latter vessel yorck was decommissioned shortly thereafter with most of her crew being transferred to commission new battlecruiser world war i thumb left upright yorck underway c 1914 following outbreak of world war i in july 1914 both cruisers were mobilized and assigned to iii scouting group which was initially assigned to high seas fleet in north sea roon served as group flagship both ships were present in reconnaissance screen for high seas fleet when it sailed to provide distant support to i scouting group during raid on yarmouth in november on returning to wilhelmshaven on night of 3 november ships encountered heavy fog and were forced to anchor in schillig roadstead outside port to avoid running into defensive minefields laid outside harbor yorcks commander decided that visibility had improved enough to enter port but in haze he led ship into one of minefields yorck struck a pair of mines in quick succession and sank with heavy loss of life roon continued to operate with main fleet taking part in raid on scarborough hartlepool and whitby in december she briefly encountered a pair of british destroyers during operation but neither side opened fire by early 1915 it had become clear to german naval command that older vessels like roon were insufficiently armored to take part in an action with powerful british grand fleet and so iii scouting group was transferred to baltic sea in april where it was dissolved and its ships used to constitute reconnaissance forces of baltic with roon serving as deputy commander s flagship she thereafter took part in a series of offensive operations against russian forces beginning with a joint army navy assault on libau in may this was followed by several sweeps into central baltic in may and june to try to catch russian vessels which culminated in battle of aland islands in early july a group of russian cruisers attacked several german vessels on a minelaying operation and roon sortied to reinforce german ships roon engaged russian armored cruiser and scored a hit but was hit several times in return before germans disengaged roon participated in battle of gulf of riga in august 1915 and bombarded russian positions at zerel on sworbe peninsula in company with armored cruiser two cruisers surprised a group of russian destroyers and damaged one of them before russians fled by late 1915 increased threat of british submarines demonstrated by sinking of in october convinced german naval command to withdraw remaining armored cruisers still in service by this point just roon and prinz heinrich roon was disarmed in 1916 and used as a training ship and a floating barracks design work commenced in 1916 to convert ship into a seaplane tender work was planned to last from 1917 to 1918 during a period of 20 months ship was stricken from naval register on 25 november 1920 and
