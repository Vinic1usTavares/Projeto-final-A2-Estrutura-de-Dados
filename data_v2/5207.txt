thumb a drawing of a fusible plug showing tapered core a fusible plug is a threaded metal cylinder usually of bronze brass or gunmetal with a tapered hole drilled completely through its length this hole is sealed with a metal of low melting point that flows away if a pre determined high temperature is reached initial use of fusible plug was as a safety precaution against low water levels in steam engine boilers but later applications extended its use to other closed vessels such as air conditioning systems and tanks for transporting corrosive or liquefied petroleum gasses purpose thumb a modern fusible plug core of low melting point metal is visible a fusible plug operates as a safety valve when dangerous temperatures rather than dangerous pressures are reached in a closed vessel in steam engines fusible plug is screwed into crown sheet top plate of firebox typically extending about an inch 25mm into water space above it its purpose is to act as a last resort safety device in event of water level falling dangerously low when top of plug is out of water it overheats low melting point core melts away and resulting noisy release of steam into firebox serves to warn operators of danger before top of firebox itself runs completely dry which could result in catastrophic failure of boiler temperature of flue gases in a steam engine firebox can reach 1000 degf 550 degc at which temperature copper from which historically most fireboxes were made softens to a state which can no longer sustain boiler pressure and a severe explosion will result if water is not put into boiler quickly and fire removed or extinguished hole through plug is too small to have any great effect in reducing steam pressure and small amount of water if any that passes through it is not expected to have any great impact in quenching fire history device was invented in 1803 by richard trevithick proponent of high pressure as opposed to atmospheric steam engines in consequence of an explosion in one of his new boilers his detractors were eager to denounce whole concept of high pressure steam but trevithick proved that accident happened because his fireman had neglected to keep boiler full of water he publicised his invention widely without patent to counter these criticisms experiments experiments conducted by franklin institute boston in 1830s had initially cast doubt on practice of adding water as soon as escape of steam through device was noted a steam boiler was fitted with a small observation window of glass and heated beyond its normal operating temperature with water level below top of firebox when water was added it was found that pressure rose suddenly and observation glass shattered report concluded that high temperature of metal had added water too quickly and that an explosion was inevitable result staff of benjamin franklin institute of technology undated ca 1830 steam boiler explosions reprinted 2005 as explosions of steam boilers scholarly publishing office university of michigan library it was not until 1852 that this assumption was challenged thomas redmond one of institute s own inspectors specifically ruled out this theory in his investigation into boiler explosion on steam ship redstone on ohio river on 3 april that year a 1907 investigation in wales came to a similar conclusion a steam locomotive belonging to rhymney railway was inadvertently sent out with its safety valves wrongly assembled pressure in boiler built up to extent that injectors failed crown sheet became uncovered was weakened by heat of fire and violently blew apart investigation led by colonel druitt of railway inspectorate dismissed theory that enginemen had succeeded in starting injectors and that sudden flood of cold water had caused such a generation of steam that boiler burst he quoted results of experiments by manchester steam users association a national boiler certification and insurance body that proved that weight of copper present considered with its specific heat was insufficient to generate enough steam to raise boiler pressure at all indeed addition of cold water had caused pressure to fall from then on it was accepted that correct action in event of operation of fusible plug was to add water hewison 1983 116 117 cored fusible plugs thumb fusible plug with a core original design was a simple solid plug filled with a slug of low melting point alloy when this melts it first melts as a narrow channel through plug steam and water immediately begins to escape through this cored fusible plug was developed in 1860s to give a wide opening as soon as alloy softens this version has a solid brass or bronze centre soldered into place by a layer of low melting point alloy when overheated plug does not release any steam or water until alloy melts sufficiently to release centre plug plug now fails dramatically opening its entire bore immediately this full bore jet is then more likely to be noticed un noticed melted plugs a drawback to device was found on 7 march 1948 when firebox crown sheet of princess alexandra a coronation pacific of london midland and scottish railway failed while hauling a passenger train from glasgow to london enquiries established that both water gauges were defective and on a journey earlier that day one or both of fusible plugs had melted but this had gone unnoticed by engine crew because of strong draught carrying escaping steam away from them maintenance alloy composition investigation showed importance of alloy on plug ageing alloys were initially favoured as they offered lower eutectic melting points than pure metals it was found though that alloys aged poorly and could encourage development of a matrix of oxides on water surface of plug this matrix having a dangerously high melting point that made plug inoperable in 1888 us steamboat inspection service made a requirement that plugs were to be made of pure banca tin and replaced annually this avoided lead and also zinc contamination zinc contamination was regarded as so serious a problem that case of plugs was also changed from brass a copper zinc alloy to a zinc free copper tin bronze to avoid risk of zinc migrating from housing into alloy plug plug ageing in 1920s investigations by u s bureau of standards in conjunction with steamboat inspection service found that in use encrustation and oxidation above fusible core can increase melting point of device and prevent it from working when needed melting points in excess of 2000 degf 1100 degc in used examples have been found typical current practice in locomotives requires new plugs to be inspected after 15 to 30 working days dependent upon water condition and use of locomotive or at least once every six months depending on boiler operating pressure and temperature other applications principle of fusible plug is also applied to transport of liquefied petroleum gases where fusible plugs or small exposed patches of containers lining membrane are designed to melt or become porous if too high a temperature is reached a controlled release at a typical temperature of 250 degf 120 degc is preferable to an explosive release a at a higher temperature corrosive gas containers such as those used for liquid chlorine are fitted with one or more fusible plugs with an operating temperature of about 158 to 165 degf 70 74 degc fusible plugs are common in aircraft wheels typically in larger or high performance aircraft very large thermal loads imposed by abnormal landing and braking conditions and notably can cause already high pressure in tyres to rise to point that tyre might burst so fusible plugs are used as a relief mechanism vented gas may be directed to cool braking surfaces fusible plugs are sometimes fitted to receivers of air compressors as a precaution against ignition of any lubricating oil vapour that might be present should action of compressor heat air above a safe temperature core will melt and release pressure automobile air conditioning systems were commonly fitted with fusible plugs operating at 100 110 degc but from concerns about environmental effects of any released refrigerant gas
