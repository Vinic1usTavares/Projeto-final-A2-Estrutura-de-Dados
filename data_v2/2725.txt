under belgian law after king s death it was soon discovered that he had left caroline numerous properties items of high material value congolese bonds and other valuable sources of income all of which turned her into a multimillionaire for years belgian government and leopold s three estranged daughters attempted to recover some of this wealth with their success varying depending on case caroline

of french legation at bucharest another states that her father lived in bucharest to seek his fortune and she was born there as thirteenth child of her parents in her youth caroline worked as a barmaid various sources assert that caroline was a prostitute living in paris as a young woman she was mistress of antoine emmanuel durrieux a former officer in french army according to adam hochschild durrieux liked to support two of them by betting on horse races when his luck soured he became a form of pimp prostituting caroline to well born clients they undertook their schemes at elysee palace but frequently left debts unpaid one day in 1900 while residing in paris leopold ii of belgium heard of her attractions and felt interested in her modest beginnings a woman sent by leopold informed caroline madame i am sent to you by a gentleman who has noticed you he is a very high personage but his exalted position obliges me to withhold his name a meeting was arranged for following day caroline went to a secluded room where leopold arrived with two aides as leopold ii was unknown to her caroline was so flustered with encounter that she mixed up belgium and sweden in king s presence referring to him as his majesty oscar to his surprise and amusement two aides purpose soon became clear one sat on each side of her and began asking questions that required her to turn my head first to right then to left their only aim as i learned later being to show off my two profiles to mute personage according to her memoirs leopold confessed himself pleased and invited caroline to austria with him a large sum of money duly arrived next day along with some empty trunks as leopold was aware that she loved to buy clothes hochschild p 222 relationship with leopold ii reaction in press as a mere sixteen year old compared with leopold s age of 65 caroline s relationship with old king quickly became public knowledge causing leopold to be labeled lecherous and besotted though leopold had previously embarked upon affairs with other mistresses earning him nickname le roi des belges et des belles his affair with caroline was unique and belgian press in particular enjoyed publishing their affair for countless years her habit of accompanying leopold to fashionable spas in europe provoked further disbelief and outrage with some speculating that she perversely old king with use of strategically placed mirrors and special equipment young mistress became known as la reine du congo because great wealth she accumulated from leopold came from his colony she became his companion for last years of his life as his estranged wife queen marie henriette died in 1902 their relationship coincided with leopold s worsening international reputation which was result of his actions and orders concerning congo free state hochschild writes that their affair ironically lost leopold more popularity in belgium than any of his crimes in congo consequently few of his former allies were willing to defend him once he became target of international protest movement led by congo reform association belgian socialists in particular used affair to prove that because leopold was in his and under control of a rapacious and ambitious woman he was unfit to govern a wealthy mistress left thumb a postcard of caroline and leopold after marie henriette s death leopold s relationship with caroline became flagrantly open and he placed her across from his laeken mansion in villa even building a pedestrian bridge above ground and over fences of mansion so he could see her at will bridge reveals king s jealousy although this may have been justified as her former lover durrieux had been caught with her on several occasions caroline tried to pass him off as her brother when leopold caught two together one publication reported that she and durrieux had placed secret electric bells in all her residences so that servants could warn her when king was approaching hochschild pp 222 23 leopold spent vast sums of money on gifts and estates for his young mistress presenting for instance villa to caroline in 1902 she frequently traveled to paris to visit her dress and hat maker once bragging that she spent three million francs on dresses at a single store on one occasion hochschild p 223 caroline once complained to leopold that evening express train back to brussels gave her little time to shop causing leopold to arrange it so that train would leave an hour later when pregnant with their first child king and french government even split cost of constructing a new road close to her villa so that her ride would not be uncomfortable taking caroline with him everywhere king spent much of his time outside belgium on his various properties throughout western europe and was much resented by belgian people as a result much of this time was spent with caroline and their two sons at his estate at cap in southern france caroline also stayed at chateau de which leopold had rented for her he acquired french chateau de as well as a villa in brussels where caroline had no scruples in appearing in public though typically traveling incognito she accompanied leopold to funeral of queen victoria in 1901 causing a great scandal her unpopularity in belgium increased dramatically once it began to be realized that all of leopold s riches from congo were not benefiting his country but rather himself and his young mistress thumb a contemporary cartoon lampooning leopold s relationship with caroline a priest is exclaiming oh sire at your age and king answers try it for yourself as years went by and king became increasingly prone to outbursts of anger breaking with all his old relationships it was said that only in caroline and their sons company did leopold recapture some of his vitality and germanic humour pakenham p 662 caroline was described as having been above average in height plump but graceful with a beautiful complexion and skin with masses of chestnut hair in character she was haughty sharp irritable and ill educated and insisted on being treated with respect or else one would have to face king s displeasure she was also said to be in possession of vivid conversational powers and dazzling youthfulness caroline was well used to leopold s quirks such as his extreme hypochondria for instance when she needed free time for herself she coughed and pretended to have a cold she used this weapon to keep scheming female rivals from gaining favor with king as well telling leopold that they had colds rather than ignore their age difference caroline and leopold seemed to enjoy it she calling him tres vieux and he calling her tres belle marriage thumb upright left caroline lacroix about 1909 king became ill from an intestinal blockage at his home at laeken and his mistress and two sons rushed to his side hochschild p 265 five days before his death on 12 december 1909 king leopold married caroline in a religious ceremony performed by his personal chaplain marriage had no legal authority under belgian law as it was performed religiously not civilly it was recognized by vatican as their wedding was solemnized in accordance with catholic church s religious rites rappoport pp 267 68 marriage caused a great scandal in belgium as its citizens were shocked that church had not only sanctioned it but also allowed caroline to remain at his bedside even when priest was present despite their marriage caroline had to hide out of sight whenever a visitor arrived to see king though she stayed by his side otherwise leopold died in presence of caroline and two nurses his youngest legitimate child princess clementine who had been barred from entering his palace before was still not allowed to go into his room despite his weakening condition princesses louise and stephanie also traveled to brussels for a hoped for reconciliation with their father and changes to king s will but leopold turned them away caroline claimed that right before his passing leopold turned to his aide baron auguste and said i present you my widow i place her under your protection during few days she ll spend in belgium after my death hochschild p 266 hochschild speculates that it is likely king said this or something similar as he was well aware how much his daughters and public loathed her particularly when they discovered just how much he had left her and their sons issue caroline and leopold had two sons together lucien philippe marie antoine 9 february 1906 1984 duke of he married lucie gracieuse on 1 march 1927 philippe henri marie francois 16 october 1907 21 august 1914 count of ravenstein died young like caroline herself who was created baroness vaughan upon birth of their first son two boys were granted courtesy titles but no official royal decrees were ever issued by leopold belgian government or any other foreign state causing them to be merely honorary hochschild p 224 because of their parents legally invalid marriage their two sons were still deemed illegitimate upon each of their births they had been registered in france under caroline s name no mention of leopold or another potential father was made despite these facts there were fears in belgium that leopold would recognize his eldest son as heir to throne had leopold married in a legal civil ceremony boy could have indeed inherited throne because all classes were equal under belgian constitution and thus their marriage would not have been considered morganatic in 1910 two boys were adopted by antoine durrieux whom caroline married soon after leopold s death leopold was devoted to his sons and much of wealth caroline inherited went to two she once reportedly boasted that because she was able to marry king her sons were in better standings than charles beauclerk 1st duke of st albans illegitimate son of nell gwyn and charles ii of england because of these gifts caroline was loathed by belgian public on one occasion her carriage was stoned on streets of brussels their second son was born with a deformed hand leading a cartoon to depict leopold holding child surrounded by congolese corpses with their hands sliced off caption said vengeance from on high rappoport p 268 later years leopold gave his mistress vast sums of money by investing large sums in her name or confiding in trustees for her benefit he also arranged for his two sons to be well provided for after his death under belgian law his three remaining legitimate children were entitled to a considerable portion of his estate regardless of contents of his will however this applied only in belgium and not abroad consequently much of wealth he distributed for safekeeping was in foreign investments or in shape of paintings bric a brac and art treasures that could be easily converted into cash leopold transferred caroline a fortune in congo securities which were added to already vast sum of six million francs he had previously presented her princess louise soon went after these securities but with help of men loyal to king caroline was able to safely spirit away majority of her wealth to paris two of her estates in brussels and in france were boarded up however disallowing her from entering them exact degree of caroline s wealth was always problematic to trace as king had placed so much of it in different sources often difficult to locate and measure both during his lifetime and after his death one 1912 source for instance reported that out of king s estimated estate of 65 000 000 caroline received 7 000 000 while others stressed still higher numbers and that majority of it came from congo shares legal suits thumb princesses stephanie and louise who attempted to gain back their father s wealth from caroline old king s estrangement from his three daughters from his first marriage princesses louise stephanie and clementine spurred leopold to keep or give as much wealth away as possible in order to disinherit girls an austrian newspaper claimed that right before he died leopold personally gave caroline his large collection of personal letters as well as documents detailing information about various european royal figures which greatly worried his eldest daughter wheeler p 140 after his death three princesses sued his estate for several million francs although this was only a very small portion compared with fortune he accumulated fortune was so large that princesses were still attempting to recover some of caroline s wealth four years after their father s death claiming that caroline and durrieux had speedily ransacked one of leopold s properties in paris and seized important financial documents before belgian envoy to france appeared a trust of 10 000 000 king had placed in caroline and their two sons names became a target of princesses they and belgian government argued that trust formed part of leopold s private estate and thus all three girls and government had a right to their share as its funds had derived from congo free state belgian government s lawsuit succeeded allowing them to collect entire trust but it also diminished share princesses received as each collected a comparatively meager 1 000 000 belgian statesman emile later charged in an open letter that leopold had given caroline 6 000 000 worth of congo bonds which had been found to be previously missing when belgium annexed colony second marriage divorce and death an extremely rich widow leopold s gifts left her a multimillionaire caroline continued to appear in newspapers long after leopold s death she married antoine durrieux her former love and longtime friend in 1910 seven months after king s death he was formerly a non commissioned officer in french army and served as her chief agent at time of leopold s death helping her collect necessary papers to secure her inherited fortune because of durrieux s earlier role in prostituting caroline off for money adam hochschild speculates that if she had shared some of her riches with him their arrangement was surely one of most successful feats of of all time though durrieux recognized her two sons as his own offspring giving them his surname he disliked how caroline insisted he acknowledge their noble ranks when in their presence caroline and her second husband divorced soon after and she was able to keep bulk of her wealth intact though she settled on durrieux a sum of one million dollars in order to retain custody of her two sons various suitors often in her entourage such as count boni de and gaston bonnefoy were reported to be engaged or interested in her particularly after her divorce she never remarried caroline s younger son died in 1914 but elder lived a long quiet life on his inherited wealth dying in 1984 in 1937 caroline published her memoirs a commoner married a king as told by baroness de vaughan to paul faure in it she stated she had loved and was faithful to king and that he
