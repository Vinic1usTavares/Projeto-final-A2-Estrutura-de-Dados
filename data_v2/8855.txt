cloud gate is a public sculpture by indian born british artist sir anish kapoor that is centerpiece of at t plaza at millennium park in loop community area of chicago illinois sculpture and at t plaza are located on top of park grill between chase promenade and mccormick tribune plaza ice rink constructed between 2004 and 2006 sculpture is nicknamed bean because of its shape a name kapoor initially disliked but later grew fond of made up of 168 stainless steel plates welded together its highly polished exterior has no visible seams it measures and weighs kapoor s design was inspired by liquid mercury and sculpture s surface reflects and distorts city s skyline visitors are able to walk around and under cloud gate s high arch on underside is omphalos greek for navel a concave chamber that warps and multiplies reflections sculpture builds upon many of kapoor s artistic themes and it is popular with tourists as a photo taking opportunity for its unique reflective properties sculpture was result of a design competition after kapoor s design was chosen numerous technological concerns regarding design s construction and assembly arose in addition to concerns regarding sculpture s upkeep and maintenance various experts were consulted some of whom believed design could not be implemented eventually a feasible method was found but sculpture s construction fell behind schedule it was unveiled in an incomplete form during millennium park grand opening celebration in 2004 before being concealed again while it was completed cloud gate was formally dedicated on may 15 2006 and has since gained considerable popularity both domestically and internationally design lying between lake michigan to east and loop to west grant park has been chicago s front yard since mid 19th century its northwest corner north of monroe street and art institute east of michigan avenue south of randolph street and west of columbus drive had been illinois central rail yards and parking lots until 1997 when it was made available for development by city as millennium park for 2007 park was chicago s second largest tourist attraction trailing only navy pier in 1999 millennium park officials and a group of art collectors curators and architects reviewed artistic works of 30 different artists and asked two for proposals american artist jeff koons submitted a proposal to erect a permanent sculpture of a playground slide his glass and steel design featured an observation deck above ground that was accessible via an elevator committee chose second design by internationally acclaimed artist anish kapoor measuring and weighing proposal featured a seamless stainless steel surface inspired by liquid mercury sharoff p 61 this mirror like surface would reflect chicago skyline but its elliptical shape would distort and twist reflected image registration required for entire article as visitors walk around structure its surface acts like a fun house mirror as it distorts their reflections left thumb alt headshot of an indian man with gray hair and black shirt anish kapoor s design proposal was chosen over works by thirty different artists in underside of sculpture is omphalos an indentation whose mirrored surface provides multiple reflections of any subject situated beneath it gilfoyle p 203 apex of omphalos is above ground concave underside allows visitors to walk underneath to see omphalos and through its arch to other side so that they view entire structure gilfoyle p 261 during grand opening week in july 2004 press reports described omphalos as spoon like underbelly stainless steel sculpture was originally envisioned as centerpiece of lurie garden at southeast corner of park however park officials believed piece was too large for lurie garden and decided to locate it at at t plaza despite kapoor s objections skyscrapers to north along east randolph street including heritage smurfit stone building two prudential plaza one prudential plaza and aon center are visible reflected on both east and west sides of sculpture although kapoor does not draw with computers computer modeling was essential to process of analyzing complex form baume p 53 which created numerous issues since sculpture was expected to be outdoors concerns arose that it might retain and conduct heat in a way that would make it too hot to touch during summer and so cold that one s tongue might stick to it during winter extreme temperature variation between seasons was also feared to weaken structure graffiti bird droppings and fingerprints were also potential problems as they would affect aesthetics of surface most pressing issue was need to create a single seamless exterior for external shell a feat architect norman foster once believed to be nearly impossible gilfoyle p 202 while sculpture was being constructed public and media outlets nicknamed it bean because of its shape a name that kapoor described as completely stupid months later kapoor officially named piece cloud gate kapoor eventually accepted nickname of bean critical reviews describe sculpture as a passage between realms baume pp 123 132 three quarters of sculpture s external surface reflects sky and name refers to it acting as a type of gate that helps bridge space between sky and viewer gilfoyle pp 263 4 sculpture and plaza are sometimes referred to jointly as cloud gate on at t plaza it is kapoor s first public outdoor work in united states and is work by which he is best known in country according to financial times construction and maintenance thumb right alt a crane lifts a large oval shaped ring in front of several large buildings first of two internal support rings for sculpture is erected in millennium park at at t plaza british engineering firm atelier one and freelance engineer chris jones who later went on to form engineering firm in 2005 provided sculpture s structural design and performance structures inc psi was chosen to fabricate it because of their ability to produce nearly invisible welds project began with psi attempting to recreate design in miniature a high density polyurethane foam model was selected by kapoor which was then used to design final structure including interior structural components initially psi planned to build and assemble sculpture in oakland california and ship it to chicago through panama canal and st lawrence seaway however this plan was discarded after park officials deemed it too risky so decision was made to transport individual panels by truck and to assemble structure on site a task undertaken by mth industries sharoff p 55 sculpture s weight raised concerns estimating thickness of steel needed to create sculpture s desired aesthetics before fabrication was difficult gilfoyle p 165 cloud gate was originally estimated to weigh when completed gilfoyle p 402 however final figure was almost twice as heavy at this extra weight required engineers to reconsider sculpture s supporting structures roof of park grill upon which cloud gate sits had to be built strong enough to bear weight large retaining wall separating chicago s metra train tracks from north grant park garage supports much of weight of sculpture and forms back side of restaurant this wall along with rest of garage s foundation required additional bracing before piece was erected cloud gate is further buttressed by lateral members underneath plaza that are anchored to sculpture s interior structure by tie rods inside cloud gate s polished exterior shell are several steel structures that keep sculpture standing first structural pieces two type 304 stainless steel rings were put into place in february 2004 as construction continued crisscrossing pipe trusses were assembled between two rings trusses and supporting structures were only present for construction phases finished sculpture has no inner bracing sharoff p 51 supporting structural components were designed and constructed to ensure that no specific point was overloaded and to avoid producing unwanted indentations on exterior shell frame was also designed to expand and contract with sculpture as temperatures fluctuate as a result two large rings supporting sculpture move independently of each other allowing shell to move independently of rings when cloud gate s interior components were completed construction crews prepared to work on outer shell this comprises 168 stainless steel panels each thick and weighing they were fabricated using three dimensional modeling software computers and robots were essential in bending and shaping of plates which was performed by english wheel and a robotic scanning device sharoff p 56 metal stiffeners were welded to each panel s interior face to provide a small degree of rigidity about a third of plates along with entire interior structure were fabricated in oakland plates were polished to 98 percent of their final state and covered with protective white film before being sent to chicago via trucks once in chicago plates were welded together on site creating 2 442 linear feet 744 m of welded seams welders used keyhole welding machines rather than traditional welding guns plates were fabricated so precisely that no on site cutting or filing was necessary when lifting and fitting them into position when construction of shell began in june 2004 a large tent was erected around piece to shield it from public view construction began with omphalos where plates were attached to supporting internal steel structure from inside underside of sculpture downward to outermost surfaces gilfoyle p 204 this sequence caused structure to resemble a large sombrero when bottom was complete gilfoyle p 206 shell of cloud gate was fully erected for grand opening of millennium park on july 15 2004 although it was unpolished and thus unfinished because its assembly had fallen behind schedule piece was temporarily uncovered on july 8 for opening although kapoor was unhappy with this as it allowed public to see sculpture in an unfinished state original plan was to re erect tent around sculpture for polishing on july 24 but public appreciation for piece convinced park officials to leave it uncovered for several months tent was again erected in january 2005 as a 24 person crew from ironworkers local 63 polished seams between each plate in order to grind sand and polish seams six levels of scaffolding were erected around sides of sculpture while climbing ropes and harnesses were used to polish harder to reach areas when upper and side portions of shell were completed tent was once again removed in august 2005 on october 3 omphalos was closed off as workers polished final section every weld on cloud gate underwent a five stage process required to produce sculpture s mirror like finish stage name equipment used sandpaper type rough cut 4 1 2 inch 110 mm electric grinder 40 grit removed welded initial contour air driven belt sander 80 grit 100

that were left from sculpting polishing electric buffing wheel of rouge buffed and polished surface to a mirror like finish sculpture was finally completed on august 28 2005 and officially unveiled on may 15 2006 cost for piece was first estimated at 6 million this had escalated to 11 5 million by time park opened in 2004 with final figure standing at 23 million in 2006 no public funds were involved all funding came from donations from individuals and corporations kapoor s contract states that constructed piece should be expected to survive for 1 000 years lower of cloud gate is wiped down twice a day by hand while entire sculpture is cleaned twice a year with of liquid detergent daily cleanings use a windex like solution while semi annual cleanings use tide a notable february 2009 rare incident saw two names etched in letters about tall on northeast side of curved sculpture graffiti was removed by same firm that did original polishing reception thumb alt a large white tent sits

day of sculpture s dedication may 15 2006 to be cloud gate day kapoor attended celebration while local jazz trumpeter and bandleader davis and chicago jazz philharmonic played fanfare for cloud gate which davis composed public took an instant liking to sculpture affectionately referring to it as bean cloud gate has become a popular piece of public art and is now a fixture on many souvenirs such as postcards sweatshirts and posters sculpture has attracted a large number of locals tourists and art aficionados from around world sculpture is now piece by which kapoor is most identified in united states time describes piece as an essential photo opportunity and more of a destination than a work of art new york times writes that it is both a tourist magnet and an extraordinary art object while usa today refers to sculpture as a monumental abstract work chicago art critic edward lifson considers cloud gate to be among greatest pieces of public art in world american welding society recognized cloud gate mth industries and psi with group s extraordinary welding award time named millennium park one of ten best architectural achievements of 2004 citing cloud gate as one of park s major attractions when park first opened in 2004 metra police stopped a columbia college chicago journalism student who was working on a photography project in millennium park and confiscated his film because of fears of terrorism in 2005 sculpture attracted some controversy when a professional photographer without a paid permit was denied access to piece as is case for all works of art currently covered by united states copyright law artist holds copyright for sculpture this allows public to freely photograph cloud gate but permission from kapoor or city of chicago which has licensed art is required for any commercial reproductions of photographs city first set a policy of collecting permit fees for photographs these permits were initially set at 350 per day for professional still photographers 1 200 per day for professional videographers and 50 per hour for wedding photographers policy has been changed so permits are only required for large scale film video and photography requiring ten person crews and equipment in addition to restricting photography of public art closing a public park for a private event has also been controversial in 2005 and 2006 almost all of millennium park was closed for a day for corporate events on both occasions as one of park s primary attractions cloud gate was focus of controversy on september 8 2005 toyota motor sales usa paid 800 000 to rent most venues in park including cloud gate on at t plaza from 6 a m to 11 p m on august 7 2006 allstate paid 700 000 to rent park for this price allstate acquired visitation rights to a different set of features and only had exclusive access to cloud gate after 4 p m these corporate closures denied tourists access to kapoor s public sculpture and commuters who walk through park were forced to take alternative routes city officials stated that money would help finance free public programs in millennium park in 2015 a sculpture similar to cloud gate was reported in china at site of an oil discovery which according to eduardo dean of cornell law school very probably is a copyright infringement against cloud gate though designed to resemble an oil bubble kapoor hoped that legal action would be taken against what he termed a chinese knockoff mayor rahm emanuel was less concerned and said that it was a flattering imitation kapoor s cloud column in houston as well as thomas heatherwick s vessel in hudson yards new york city have been negatively contrasted to cloud gate artistic themes relevant kapoor themes anish kapoor has a reputation for creating spectacles in urban settings by producing works of extreme size and scale before creating cloud gate kapoor had created art that distorted images of viewer instead of portraying images of its own in so doing he acquired experience blurring boundary between limit and limitless gilfoyle p 267 kapoor drew on past experience to design cloud gate in particular designing of sky mirror 2001 a concave stainless steel mirror that also used a theme of distorted perception on a grand scale kapoor s objects often aim to evoke and spiritual an outcome he achieves either by carving dark voids into stone pieces or more recently through sheer shine and reflectivity of his objects this indian artist s works have no fixed identity but rather occupy an illusionary space that is consistent with eastern theologies shared by buddhism hinduism and taoism as well as albert einstein s views of a non three dimensional world kapoor explores theme of ambiguity with his works that place viewer in a state of in betweenness artist often questions and plays with such dualities as solidity emptiness or reality reflection which in turn allude to such paired opposites as flesh spirit here beyond east west sky earth etc that create conflict between internal and external superficial and subterranean and conscious and unconscious kapoor also creates a tension between masculine and feminine within his art by having concave points of focus that invite entry of visitors and multiplies their images when they are positioned correctly gilfoyle pp 271 2 cloud gate themes kapoor often speaks of removing both signature of artist from his works as well as any traces of their fabrication or what he refers to as traces of hand he aspires to make his works look like they have independent realities that he reveals rather than creates for him removing all seams from cloud gate was necessary in order to make sculpture seem as though it was perfect and ready made these effects increase viewer s fascination with it and makes them wonder what it is and where it came from his attempts to hide his works seams as an artist stand in contrast to frank gehry s architectural designs in park jay pritzker pavilion and bp pedestrian bridge which display their seams prominently cloud gate is described as a transformative iconic work baume p 9 it is similar to many of kapoor s previous works in themes and issues it addresses while sculpture s mirror effects are reminiscent of fun house fairground mirrors they also have a more serious intent they help dematerialize this very large object making it seem light and almost weightless cloud gate is considered kapoor s most ambitious use of complex mirrored form dynamics baume p 18 kapoor challenges his viewers to internalize his work through intellectual and theoretical exercise by reflecting sky visiting and non visiting pedestrians and surrounding architecture cloud gate limits its viewers to partial comprehension at any time interaction with viewer who moves to create his own vision gives it a spiritual dimension gilfoyle p 264 sculpture is described as a disembodied luminous form which is also how his earlier 1000 names 1979 80 was described when it addressed metaphysical and mystical gilfoyle p 265 viewer physically enters art when he walks underneath it into its navel omphalos is a warped dimension of fluid space in this dimension solid is transformed into fluid in a disorienting multiplicative manner that intensifies experience it is emblematic of kapoor s work to deconstruct empirical space and venture into manifold possibilities of abstract space experience is described as a displaced or virtual depth that is composed of multiplied surfaces baume p 26 according to project manager lou cerny of mth industries when light is right you can t see where sculpture ends and sky begins sharoff p 45 sculpture challenges perception by distorting and deforming surrounding architecture pp 120 122 skyscrapers along east randolph street to northeast two prudential plaza and aon center north one prudential plaza and northwest heritage crain communications building are reflected on cloud gate s surface when viewed from either east or west sculpture also warps viewers perception of time by changing speed of movements such as passing of clouds although in conventional sense cloud gate is not an opening that leads anywhere in same way that monumental gates do it frames a view and is celebratory in way it creates a ceremonial place work is credited with achieving a new level or understanding described as a transubstantiation of material reminiscent of that which artist experienced during a 1979 trip to india kapoor s 1000 names evolved immediately after this trip twenty five years later he created cloud gate an object that emerged from material forms to become immaterial kapoor often relies on tenets of hinduism in his art and says that experience of opposites allows for expression of wholeness primal dualities that are one such as lingam and yoni are important to indian culture and cloud gate represents both male and female in one entity by symbolizing both vagina and testicles thus it represents tension between masculine and feminine in popular culture sculpture has been used as a backdrop in commercial films notably in 2006 hollywood film break up which had to reshoot several scenes because sculpture was under cover for initial filming it is also prominently featured in ending scene of source code director duncan jones felt structure was a metaphor for movie s subject matter and aimed for it to be shown at beginning and end of movie sculpture served as an aesthetic and symbolic setting for 2012 film vow when lead characters share a kiss under it it also appears in video to homecoming a song by chicago native kanye west featuring chris martin of band coldplay sculpture is also featured in 2008 mumblecore film nights and weekends it was also featured in bollywood film dhoom 3 and 2014 movie
