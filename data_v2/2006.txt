western green mamba dendroaspis viridis also known as west african green mamba or hallowell s green mamba is a long thin and highly venomous snake of mamba genus dendroaspis this species was first described in 1844 by american herpetologist edward hallowell western green mamba is a fairly large and predominantly arboreal species capable of navigating through trees swiftly and gracefully it will also descend to ground level to pursue prey such as rodents and other small mammals western green mamba is a very alert nervous and extremely agile snake that lives mainly in coastal tropical rainforest thicket and woodland regions of western africa like all other mambas western green mamba is a highly venomous elapid species its venom is a highly potent mixture of rapid acting presynaptic and postsynaptic neurotoxins cardiotoxins and fasciculins some consider this species to not be a particularly aggressive snake but others have suggested that they are extremely nervous and are prone to attack aggressively when cornered conflict with humans is low compared to some other species found in region bites to people by this species are quite uncommon their mortality rate however is high many of recorded bites have been fatal rapid progression of severe life threatening symptoms are hallmarks of mamba bites bites with envenomation can be rapidly fatal taxonomy dendroaspis viridis was first described by american herpetologist and physician edward hallowell in 1844 as viridis specific name viridis is latin adjective green in addition to being called western green mamba this species is also commonly known as west african green mamba or hallowell s green mamba analysis of components of venom of all mambas places western green mamba as sister species to jameson s mamba description left thumb western green mamba is a long and very slender bodied snake with a long tapering tail average length of an adult snake of this species is between and some specimens of this species can grow to maximum lengths of head is narrow and elongate with a distinct canthus and slightly distinct from neck on rare occasions neck may be flattened when snake is aroused but there is no hood eyes are medium in size with round pupils and a yellow brown iris scalation dorsal surface body colour is vivid yellowish green to green with anterior margins of scales yellow in many specimens posterior body and tail are yellow in some specimens dorsal body scales are distinctly bordered with black forming chevron shaped markings black interstitial skin is clearly visible especially highlighting individual head scales and scales on tail head dorsum is similar to dorsal surface anterior body colour or slightly darker green laterally head scales particularly labials are distinctly black edged and colouration is usually paler than dorsum or slightly yellowish tinted when viewed from above black edging of scales and black interstitial skin result in a plaited appearance head venter throat ventral and subcaudal surface colour is pale yellowish to yellowish green head body and tail scalation of western green mamba dorsal at midbody 11 15 rarely 13 ventral 210 242 subcaudal 105 125 paired

mamba is native to west africa different sources give slightly different ranges but generally agree that it occurs from gambia and southern senegal to benin including intervening countries from west to east guinea bissau guinea sierra leone liberia cote d ivoire ivory coast ghana and togo in togo it has a known northern limit to its distribution in but it might occur in forests of more northerly kara region records from nigeria might be unreliable and its presence in central african republic is similarly unclear some sources mention it also from very southern tip of mali along border with cote d ivoire as well as from western cameroon and gabon western green mambas live mainly in coastal tropical rainforest thicket and woodland regions of western africa majority of records of western green mamba are from within continuous forest but gambia and guinea bissau records are from isolated forests species persists in areas where tree cover has been removed providing that sufficient hedges and thicket remain found in some suitably vegetated suburbs and towns and parklands therein it is largely confined to areas where rainfall exceeds in togo however its range extends into drier open forests of north guinean savannas of west and littoral zone conservation status this species is classified as least concern lc on iucn red list of threatened species v3 1 2011 conservation status of this species was last assessed in july 2012 and published in 2013 and it was classed as such due to a wide distribution fairly generalist habits stable population and lack of major threats behaviour and ecology this species is mostly diurnal but may be active at night as well it is an arboreal snake but it does commonly go to ground in fact it is equally at home hunting and feeding on prey on ground or in trees when it wants to sleep it seeks out tree branches that offer dense cover it is a very quick extremely agile alert and nervous snake when confronted it will quickly attempt to escape usually up a tree if possible and avoid any sort of confrontation if cornered western green mamba is highly dangerous and will show a fearsome display of aggression loudly hissing and striking repeatedly diet and predators western green mamba s natural prey consists mainly of birds and small mammals including rodents such as mice rats and squirrels other mammals include bats tree pangolins and shrews they also feed on lizards frogs and bird eggs this snake pursues its prey striking rapidly and often until prey succumbs to venom western green mamba as a large and highly venomous snake has very few natural predators but humans and birds of prey are this snake s main threats venom left thumb western green mamba s venom is similar to those of other members of mamba genus dendroaspis but differs from others in toxicity and composition of toxins venom consists mainly of both pre synaptic and post synaptic neurotoxins cardiotoxins and fasciculins toxicity of venom can vary tremendously depending on various factors including diet geographical location age dependent change and other factors sc and iv for this species is 0 79 mg kg and 0 71 mg kg respectively christensen and anderson 1967 one study determined ld50 of venom administered to mice via intraperitoneal ip route was 0 33 mg kg in another test using mice that were administered western green mamba s venom via intraperitoneal ip route ld50 was 0 045 mg kg another experimental iv ld50 toxicity of 0 5 mg kg has been reported with an average wet venom yield of 100 mg like other mamba species western green mamba venom is among most rapid acting venom of snakes human fatalities as a result of bites from this species are rare due to fact that this species does not often cross paths with humans but bites have occurred and majority of recorded bites have been fatal three species of green mambas including western green mamba have venom that are similar to and comparable to many species of cobras but green mamba bites often present with more severe and life threatening symptoms in a shorter period of time mortality rates are also higher among green mamba bite victims than with cobra bite victims although bites by dendroaspis viridis are not well documented and rate of bites envenoming and fatality is not well known it appears that bites attributed to this species produce more severe envenomation than bites caused by dendroaspis angusticeps eastern green mamba but far less severe than bites caused by dendroaspis polylepis black mamba when bitten symptoms rapidly begin to manifest usually within first 15 minutes or less extraordinary speed with which venom spreads through tissue and produces rapid manifestations of life threatening symptoms is unique to mambas common symptoms of a bite from a western green mamba include local pain and swelling although uncommon local necrosis can be moderate ataxia headache drowsiness difficulty breathing vertigo hypotension low blood pressure diarrhea dizziness and paralysis left untreated new and more severe symptoms rapidly progress all symptoms worsen and victim eventually dies due to suffocation resulting from paralysis of respiratory muscles bites with envenomation can be rapidly fatal which can be possible in 30 minutes references external links com green mamba video filmed in gabon category reptiles described in
