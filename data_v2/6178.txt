epaulette shark hemiscyllium ocellatum is a species of carpet shark family found in shallow tropical waters off australia and new guinea and possibly elsewhere common name of this shark comes from very large white black spot behind each pectoral fin which are reminiscent of military epaulettes a small species usually under 1 m 3 3 ft long epaulette shark has a slender body with a short head and broad paddle shaped paired fins caudal peduncle to which tail fin is attached comprises over half shark s length adults are light brown above with scattered darker spots and indistinct saddles epaulette sharks have nocturnal habits and frequent shallow water on coral reefs or in tidal pools this shark has evolved to cope with severe night time oxygen depletion hypoxia in isolated tidal pools by increasing blood supply to its brain and selectively shutting down non essential neural functions it is capable of surviving complete anoxia for an hour without ill effects and at a much higher temperature than most other hypoxia tolerant animals rather than swim epaulette sharks often walk by wriggling their bodies and pushing with their paired fins this species feeds on a wide range of small benthic invertebrates and bony fishes epaulette sharks are oviparous with females depositing pairs of egg capsules around every 14 days from august to december due to their hardiness and small size epaulette sharks are popular with both public and home aquaria international union for conservation of nature iucn has assessed this species as of least concern as outside of small aquarium trade it is of little interest to fisheries taxonomy and phylogeny epaulette shark was originally described as squalus ocellatus by french naturalist pierre joseph bonnaterre in 1788 tableau encyclopedique et methodique des trois de la nature name was later changed to currently valid hemiscyllium ocellatum type specimen was a 35 cm 14 in long immature male caught near cooktown queensland australia other common names for this species are shark and blind shark also used for goto s 2002 morphological analysis of carpet sharks showed genus hemiscyllium as a polytomy meaning that phylogenetic relationships between epaulette shark and its sister species could not be resolved distribution and habitat range of epaulette shark extends from southern coast of new guinea to northern coast of australia as far south as sydney bester c biological profiles epaulette shark florida museum of natural history ichthyology department retrieved on may 14 2009 capricorn bunker group of great barrier reef contains a particularly large population with thousands estimated to inhabit reefs around heron island alone additionally there are unsubstantiated reports of this species from malaysia sumatra and solomon islands epaulette sharks are found in shallow water to a maximum depth of 50 m 160 ft and are often seen in water barely deep enough to cover their bodies they prefer tidal pools coral flats and stands of staghorn coral description thumb left epaulette sharks are named for prominent black spot behind their pectoral fins epaulette shark has an elongated body over half of which is comprised by slender caudal peduncle snout is short and rounded with nares placed almost at tip along with a pair of tiny barbels there are grooves running from nares to mouth there are 26 35 tooth rows in upper jaw and 21 32 tooth rows in lower jaw teeth are small with broad bases and triangular cusps eyes are oval in shape and elevated with a large spiracle below each five pairs of gill slits are small with fourth and fifth very close together pectoral and pelvic fins are broad and rounded and are thickly muscled two similarly sized dorsal fins are placed well back on body anal fin is low and positioned just in front of caudal fin caudal fin has only an upper lobe which contains a prominent ventral notch near tip and is angled almost horizontally relative to body adult epaulette sharks are beige to brownish above with many widely spaced brown spots and subtle darker bands there is a very large black spot ringed in white located behind each pectoral fin this pair of spots are origin of this shark s common name juveniles have alternating light and dark bands over their body and fins which break up as they mature epaulette sharks are typically 70 90 cm 27 35 in long maximum reported length is 107 cm 42 in biology and ecology as an adaptation for navigating its complex reef environment epaulette shark moves by seemingly walking bending its body from side to side and pushing off of substrate with its paddle shaped pectoral and pelvic fins its gait is similar to that of salamanders an example of convergent evolution shark is capable of swimming but often prefers to walk along sandy or coral bottom even when water is deep enough to allow it to swim freely cartilaginous supports of epaulette shark s paired fins are reduced and separated when compared to other sharks allowing them to be rotated for use as limbs this mode of locomotion even enables shark to crawl out of water to access isolated tidal pools martin r a why do sharks expose their dorsal fins reefquest centre for shark research retrieved on october 4 2009 gait of epaulette shark is convergently similar to those of tetrapods such as salamanders suggesting that movements needed for walking on land may predate and facilitated evolution of first terrestrial vertebrates epaulette sharks are largely nocturnal and are most active in low water they often hide inside or below coral heads though it is enough for head to be covered even if rest of body is exposed sometimes they perch in open on sandy flats or atop reefs facing into current a form of orientation known as that may improve respiration or predator awareness epaulette sharks are preyed upon by larger fishes such as other sharks its coloration provides protective camouflage while its epaulette is speculated to be an eyespot for distracting or deterring predators epaulette sharks are almost all parasitized by praniza parasitic larval stage of isopods larvae feed on blood and mostly attach to skin around cloaca and claspers though they are also found inside mouth and on gills these parasites cause little damage and are not believed to adversely affect health of shark other parasites of this species include a species of myxosporean in genus which infests skeletal muscles protozoan haemogregarina which infects blood ostracod sheina orri which attaches to gills and nematode australis which infests stomach hypoxia tolerance thumb epaulette sharks can survive for hours with little oxygen and can clamber over land to reach nearest suitable area of water at night shallow reef platforms inhabited by epaulette shark often become isolated from ocean by receding tide amount of dissolved oxygen in pool can drop 80 or more overnight from combined respiration of all organisms within pool epaulette shark has evolved to cope with these hypoxic conditions being able to survive for over three hours in 5 of atmospheric o2 level without losing behavioral responsiveness in laboratory epaulette sharks have survived for an hour without any oxygen at 30 degc 86 degf which is also unusual in that most animals capable of tolerating oxygen deprivation do so at low temperatures physiological responses of epaulette shark to low oxygen are mediated by nucleoside adenosine in hypoxic conditions heart and ventilation rates drop sharply shark s blood pressure falls by half as blood vessels dilate to deliver more blood to brain and heart unlike in bony fishes and tetrapods blood flow rate remains constant and there is no elevation of blood glucose levels brains of sharks only consume a third as much atp as those of teleosts epaulette shark is able to lower this energy demand further by reducing metabolism of certain areas of its brain e g keeping sensory nuclei functional while deactivating motor nuclei this allows shark to supply enough atp to prevent neuron death while still remaining alert to its environment feeding epaulette shark is an opportunistic predator of benthic crustaceans worms and small bony fish off heron island over 90 of epaulette shark s diet consists of polychaete worms and crabs with juveniles taking mostly former and adults mostly latter it hunts most actively at dawn and dusk though feeding can occur at any time during day martin r a intertidal zone epaulette shark reefquest centre for shark research retrieved on may 14 2009 this shark relies mainly on its olfactory and electroreceptive senses to locate hidden prey it is capable of sucking prey into its mouth by expanding its muscular buccal cavity while searching for food epaulette shark sometimes turns over debris with its snout or thrusts its head into sand swallowing food items while expelling sand grains through its gill slits unlike most sharks epaulette shark may chew its food for up to 5 10 minutes its teeth can be depressed to form a flat surface for crushing hard shelled prey life history mating in epaulette shark takes place from july to december though in captivity reproduction occurs continuously courtship may be initiated by female following and biting male male then holds onto pectoral fin of female with his mouth and lies alongside her while inserting one of his claspers into her cloaca copulation lasts about one and a half minutes epaulette sharks readily breed in aquariums even in tanks as small as 135 gallons http www advancedaquarist com 2004 6 fish but larger tanks are recommended to allow room for hatched offspring this species is oviparous with females depositing eggs from august to december female drops egg capsules two rarely four at a time every 14 days producing a total of 20 50 eggs per year each egg case measures 10 cm 3 9 in long and 4 cm 1 6 in wide young emerge after 120 130 days at a length of 14 16 cm 5 5 6 3 in growth rate of young is slow at first but increases to about 5 cm 2 in per year after three months both males and females mature sexually at a length of 54 64 cm 21 25 in corresponding to an age of at least seven years human interactions thumb an epaulette shark on display in a public aquarium epaulette sharks are harmless to humans though if handled they may nip their captors they are easily observed and handled by beachgoers as they move slowly whilst out of water and show little fear of humans shark is often injured by these encounters this species adapts readily to captivity and is displayed by many public aquariums in united states canada and australia in an article for aquarium fish magazine scott w michael referred to epaulette shark as best shark for home aquarium they will breed in captivity even in tanks as small as 510 l 135 gal though full grown sharks are best housed in tanks of 680 l 180 gal or more they are not compatible with community tanks as they will eat other fish international union for conservation of nature iucn has assessed epaulette shark as of least concern this species is common in australian waters where it is not captured by either commercial or recreational fisheries and is minimally affected by collection for aquarium trade and fishery bycatch much of its australian habitat is encompassed by protected marine parks off new guinea epaulette shark has been assessed as near threatened as there it faces habitat degradation destructive fishing practices and over exploitation by artisan fishers in 2015 behaviour of an epaulette shark was filmed in detail by
