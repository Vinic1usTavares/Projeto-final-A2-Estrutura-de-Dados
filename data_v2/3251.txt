angulimala pali language lit finger necklace is an important figure in buddhism particularly within theravada tradition depicted as a ruthless brigand who completely transforms after a conversion to buddhism he is seen as example par excellence of redemptive power of buddha s teaching and buddha s skill as a teacher angulimala is seen by buddhists as patron saint of childbirth and is associated with fertility in south and southeast asia angulimala s story can be found in numerous sources in pali sanskrit tibetan and chinese angulimala is born ahimsaka he grows up as an intelligent young man in savatthi and during his studies becomes favorite student of his teacher however out of jealousy fellow students set him up against his teacher in an attempt to get rid of angulimala teacher sends him on a deadly mission to find a thousand human fingers to complete his studies trying to accomplish this mission angulimala becomes a cruel brigand killing many and causing entire villages to emigrate eventually this causes king to send an army to catch killer meanwhile angulimala s mother attempts to interfere almost causing her to be killed by her son as well buddha manages to prevent this however and uses his power and teachings to bring angulimala to right path angulimala becomes a follower of buddha and to surprise of king and others becomes a monk under his guidance villagers are still angry with angulimala but this is improved somewhat when angulimala helps a mother with childbirth through an act of truth scholars have theorized that angulimala may have been part of a violent cult before his conversion indologist richard gombrich has suggested that he was a follower of an early form of tantra but this claim has been debunked buddhists consider angulimala a symbol of spiritual transformation and his story a lesson that everyone can change their life for better even least likely people this inspired official buddhist prison chaplaincy in uk to name their organization after him moreover angulimala s story is referred to in scholarly discussions of justice and rehabilitation and is seen by theologian john thompson as a good example of coping with moral injury and an ethics of care angulimala has been subject of movies and literature with a thai movie of same name choosing to depict him following earliest sources and book buddha and terrorist by satish kumar adapting story as a non violent response to global war on terror textual sources and epigraphical findings alt monk giving texts to a more senior monk thumb buddhaghosa commentator from 5th century ce depicted at right story of angulimala is most well known in theravada tradition two texts in early discourses in pali language are concerned with angulimala s initial encounter with buddha and his conversion and are believed to present oldest version of story first is theragatha probably oldest of two and second is angulimala sutta in majjhima nikaya both offer a short description of angulimala s encounter with buddha and do not mention much of background information later incorporated into story such as angulimala being placed under oath by a teacher apart from pali texts life of angulimala is also described in tibetan and chinese texts which originate from sanskrit sanskrit collection called from early mulasarvastivada school has been translated in two chinese texts in century ce by early sarvastivada and schools and also contains versions of story a text translated in chinese from sanskrit ekottara agama by mahasamghika school is also known furthermore three other chinese texts dealing with angulimala have also been found of unknown origin but different from first three chinese texts apart from these early texts there are also later renderings which appear in commentary to majjhima nikaya attributed to buddhaghosa 5th century ce and theragatha commentary attributed to dhammapala 6th century ce two commentaries do not appear to be independent of one another it appears that dhammapala has copied or closely paraphrased buddhaghosa although adding explanation of some inconsistencies earliest accounts of angulimala s life emphasize fearless violence of angulimala and by contrast peacefulness of buddha later accounts attempt to include more detail and clarify anything that might not conform with buddhist doctrine for example one problem that is likely to have raised questions is sudden transformation from a killer to an enlightened accounts try to explain this later accounts also include more miracles however and together with many narrative details this tends to overshadow main points of story early pali discourses do not provide for any motive for angulimala s actions other than sheer cruelty later texts may represent attempts by later commentators to rehabilitate character of angulimala making him appear as a fundamentally good human being entrapped by circumstance rather than as a vicious killer in addition to discourses and verses there are also jataka tales and parts of monastic discipline that deal with angulimala as well as later mahavamsa chronicle later texts from other languages that relate angulimala s life include avadana text called sataka as well as a later collection of tales called discourse on wise and fool which exists in tibetan and chinese there are also travel accounts of chinese pilgrims that mention angulimala briefly in addition to descriptions of life of angulimala there is a mahayana discourse called sutra which gautama buddha addresses to angulimala this is one of sutras a group of discourses that deal with buddha nature there is another sutra with same name referred to in chinese texts which was used to defend buddhist stance against alcoholic beverages this text has not been found however apart from textual evidence early epigraphic evidence has also been found one of earliest reliefs that depicts angulimala dates from approximately 3rd century bce story previous incarnations texts describe a previous incarnation before angulimala met buddha gautama in this life he was born as a man eating king turned yaksha a sort of demon in some texts called saudasa saudasa develops an interest in consuming human flesh when he is served flesh of a dead baby when he asks for more his subjects start to fear for their children s safety and he is driven from his own kingdom growing into a monster saudasa meets a deity that promises saudasa can retrieve his status as king if he sacrifices one hundred other kings having killed 99 kings a king called sutasoma changes saudasa s mind and makes him a religious man and he gives up all violence texts identify sutasoma with a previous incarnation of buddha and saudasa with a previous incarnation of angulimala according to ekottara agama however in a previous incarnation angulimala is a crown prince whose goodness and virtue irritate his enemies when his enemies kill him he takes a vow just before his death that he may avenge his death and attain nirvana in a future life under guidance of a master this version makes it look as though angulimala s killing is justified youth remains of taxila current day pakistan thumb alt most texts angulimala is born in savatthi in brahman priest caste of clan his father bhaggava being chaplain of king of kosala and his mother called according to commentarial texts omens seen at time of child s birth flashing of weapons and appearance of constellation of thieves in sky indicate that child is destined to become a brigand as father is interpreting omens for king king asks whether child will be a lone brigand or a band leader when bhaggava replies that he will be a lone brigand king decides to let it live buddhaghosa relates that father names child ahimsaka meaning harmless one this is derived from word ahimsa non violence because no one is hurt at his birth despite bad omens commentary by dhammapala states that he is initially named harmful one by worried king but that name is later changed having grown up ahimsaka is handsome intelligent and well behaved his parents send him to taxila to study under a well known teacher there he excels in his studies and becomes teacher s favorite student enjoying special privileges in his teacher s house however other students grow jealous of ahimsaka s speedy progress and seek to turn his master against him to that end they make it seem as though ahimsaka has seduced master s wife unwilling or unable to attack ahimsaka directly teacher says that ahimsaka s training as a true brahman is almost complete but that he must provide traditional final gift offered to a teacher and then he will grant his approval as his payment teacher demands a thousand fingers each taken from a different human being thinking that angulimala will be killed in course of seeking this grisly prize according to buddhaghosa ahimsaka objects to this saying he comes from a peaceful family but eventually teacher persuades him but according to other versions ahimsaka does not protest against teacher s command in another version of story teacher s wife tries to seduce ahimsaka when latter refuses her advances she is spiteful and tells teacher ahimsaka has tried to seduce her story continues in same way life as a brigand following his teacher s bidding angulimala becomes a highwayman living on a cliff in a forest called where he can see people passing through and kills or hurts those travelers he becomes infamous for his skill in seizing his victims when people start to avoid roads he enters villages and drags people from their homes to kill them entire villages become abandoned he never takes clothes or jewels from his victims only fingers to keep count of number of victims that he has taken he strings them on a thread and hangs them on a tree however because birds begin to eat flesh from fingers he starts to wear them as a sacrificial thread thus he comes to be known as angulimala meaning necklace of fingers in some reliefs he is depicted as wearing a headdress of fingers rather than a necklace meeting buddha thumb painting at chedi temple thailand upright 0 villagers migrate from area and complain to pasenadi king of kosala pasenadi responds by sending an army of 500 soldiers to hunt down angulimala meanwhile angulimala s parents hear about news that pasenadi is hunting an outlaw since angulimala was born with bad omens they conclude it must be him although father prefers not to interfere mother disagrees fearing for her son s life she sets out to find her son warn him of king s intent and take care of him buddha perceives through meditative vision that angulimala has slain 999 victims and is desperately seeking a thousandth if buddha is to encounter angulimala that day latter will become a monk and subsequently attain however if angulimala is to kill his mother instead she will be his thousandth victim and he will be since matricide in buddhism is considered one of five worst actions a person can commit buddha sets off to intercept angulimala despite being warned by local villagers not to go on road through forest of kosala angulimala first sees his mother according to some versions of story he then has a moment of reconciliation with her she providing food for him after some deliberation however he decides to make her his thousandth victim but then when buddha also arrives he chooses to kill him instead he draws his sword and starts running towards buddha but although angulimala is running as fast as he can he cannot catch up with buddha who is walking calmly buddha is using some supernatural accomplishment that affects angulimala one text states buddha through these powers contracts and expands earth on which they stand thus keeping a distance of angulimala this angulimala so much that he calls to buddha to stop buddha then says that he himself has already stopped and that it is angulimala who should stop angulimala asks for further explanation after which buddha says that a good monk should control his desires angulimala is impressed by buddha s courage and struck with guilt about what he has done after listening to buddha angulimala reverently declares himself converted vows to cease his life as a brigand and joins buddhist monastic order he is admitted in jetavana monastery life as a monk and death thumb angulimala sitting down respectfully in front of buddha painting in wat in southern thailand upright 0 5 meanwhile king pasenadi sets out to kill angulimala he stops first to pay a visit to buddha and his followers at jetavana monastery he explains to buddha his purpose and buddha asks how king will respond if he were to discover that angulimala had given up life of a highwayman and become a monk king says that he would salute him and offer to provide for him in his monastic vocation buddha then reveals that angulimala is sitting only a few feet away his hair and beard shaven off a member of buddhist order king astounded but also delighted addresses angulimala by his clan and mother s name and offers to donate robe materials to angulimala angulimala however does not accept gift because of an ascetic training he observes in end king chooses not to persecute angulimala this passage would agree with buddhologist andre bareau s observation that there was an unwritten agreement of mutual non interference between buddha and kings and rulers of time later angulimala comes across a young woman undergoing difficult labor during a childbirth angulimala is profoundly moved by this and understands pain and feels compassion to an extent he did not know when he was still a brigand he goes to buddha and asks him what he can do to ease her pain buddha tells angulimala to go to woman and say angulimala points out that it would be untrue for him to say this to which buddha responds with this revised stanza buddha is here drawing angulimala s attention to his choice of having become a monk describing this as a second birth that contrasts with his previous life as a brigand jati means birth but word is also glossed in pali commentaries as clan or lineage thus word jati here also refers to lineage of buddhas i e monastic community after angulimala makes this act of truth woman safely gives birth to her child this verse later became one of protective verses commonly called angulimala paritta monastics continue to recite text during blessings for pregnant women in theravada countries and often memorize it as part of monastic training thus angulimala is widely seen by devotees as patron saint of childbirth changing from a murderer to a person seen to ensure safe childbirth has been a huge transformation this event helps angulimala to find peace after performing act of truth he is seen to bring life rather than death to townspeople and people start to approach him and provide him with however a resentful few cannot forget that he was responsible for deaths of their loved ones with sticks and stones they attack him as he walks for alms with a bleeding head torn outer robe and a broken alms bowl angulimala manages to return to monastery buddha encourages angulimala to bear his torment with equanimity he indicates that angulimala is experiencing fruits of karma that would otherwise have condemned him to hell having become an enlightened disciple angulimala remains firm and invulnerable in mind according to buddhist teachings enlightened disciples cannot create any new karma but they may still be subject to effects of old karma that they once did effects of his karma are inevitable and even buddha cannot stop them from occurring after having admitted angulimala in monastic order buddha issues a rule that from now on no criminals should be accepted as monks in order buddhaghosa states that angulimala dies shortly after becoming a monk after his death a discussion arises among monks as to what angulimala s afterlife destination is when buddha states that angulimala has attained nirvana this surprises some monks they wonder how it is possible for someone who killed so many people to still attain enlightenment buddha responds that even after having done much evil a person still has a possibility to change for better and attain enlightenment analysis thumb angulimala s stupa part of jetavana monastery at shravasti in uttar pradesh india upright 1 3 historical custom of giving of goodbye gifts to one s teacher was customary in ancient india there is an example in book of of vedic epic mahabharatha here teacher sends his disciple uttanka away after uttanka has proven himself worthy of being trustworthy and in possession of all vedic and teachings uttanka says to his teacher indologist friedrich wilhelm maintains that similar phrases already occur in book of manu ii 111 and in institutes of vishnu by taking leave of their teacher and promising to do whatever their teacher asks of them brings according to vedic teachings enlightenment or a similar attainment it is therefore not unusual that angulimala is described to do his teacher s horrible bidding although being a good and kind person at heart in knowledge that in end he will reap highest attainment alt chinese monk walking with large thumb idea that angulimala was part of a violent cult was already suggested by chinese pilgrim xuan zang depicted here upright 0 richard gombrich has postulated that story of angulimala may be a historical encounter between buddha and a follower of an early saivite or shakti form of tantra gombrich reaches this conclusion on basis of a number of inconsistencies in texts that indicate possible corruption and fairly weak explanations for angulimala s behavior provided by commentators he notes that there are several other references in early pali canon that seem to indicate presence of devotees of saiva kali and other divinities associated with sanguinary violent tantric practices textual inconsistencies discovered could be explained through this theory idea that angulimala was part of a violent cult was already suggested by chinese pilgrim xuan zang 602 64 ce in his travel accounts xuan zang states that angulimala s was taught by his teacher that he would be born in brahma heaven if he killed a buddha a chinese early text gives a similar description stating that angulimala s teacher followed gruesome instructions of his guru to attain immortality xuan zang s suggestion was further developed by european translators of xuan zang s travel accounts in early twentieth century but partly based on translation errors regardless gombrich is first recent scholar to postulate this idea however gombrich s claim that tantric practices existed before finalization of canon of buddhist discourses two to three centuries bce goes against mainstream scholarship scholarly consensus places arising of first tantric cults about a thousand years later and no corroborating evidence has been found whether textual or otherwise of earlier sanguinary tantric practices though gombrich argues that there other similar antinomian practices going against moral norms which are only mentioned once in buddhist scriptures and for which no evidence can be found outside of scriptures buddhist studies scholars and von dismiss these as incorrect examples they also take issue with gombrich s metrical arguments thus disagreeing with gombrich s hypotheses with regard to angulimala they do consider it possible however that angulimala s violent practices were part of some kind of historical cult buddhist studies scholar l s cousins has also expressed doubts about gombrich s theory in chinese translation of by hui chiao as well as in archaeological findings angulimala is identified with mythological hindu king or saudasa known since vedic times ancient texts often describe saudasa s life as angulimala s previous life and both characters deal with problem of being a good brahman studying art depictions in gandhara region archeologist maurizio taddei theorizes that story of angulimala may point at an indian mythology with regard to a yaksa living in wild in many depictions angulimala is wearing a headdress which taddei describes as an example of dionysian like iconography art historian pia brancaccio argues however that headdress is an indian symbol used for figures associated with wild or hunting she concurs with taddei that depictions of angulimala especially in gandhara are in many ways reminiscent of dionysian themes in greek art an mythology and influence is highly likely however brancaccio argues that headdress was essentially an indian symbol used by artists to indicate angulimala belonged to a forest tribe feared by early buddhists who were mostly urban doctrinal among buddhists angulimala is one of most well known stories not only in modern times in ancient times two important chinese pilgrims travelling to india reported about story and reported about places they visited that were associated with angulimala s life from a buddhist perspective angulimala s story serves as an example that even worst of people can overcome their faults and return to right path commentaries uphold story as an example of good karma destroying evil karma buddhists widely regard angulimala as a symbol of complete transformation and as a showcase that buddhist path can transform even least likely initiates buddhists have raised angulimala s story as an example of compassion and supernatural accomplishment of buddha angulimala s conversion is cited as a testimony to buddha s capabilities as a teacher and as an example of healing qualities of teaching of buddha dharma through his reply buddha connects notion of refraining from harming with stillness which is cause and effect of not harming furthermore story illustrates that there is spiritual power in such stillness as buddha is depicted as outrunning violent angulimala though this is explained as being result of buddha s supernatural accomplishment deeper meaning is that spiritually still person can move faster than conventionally active person in other words spiritual achievement is only possible through non violence furthermore this stillness refers to buddhist notion of liberation from karma as long as one cannot escape from endless law of karmic retribution one can at least lessen one s karma by practicing non violence texts describe this as form of stillness as opposed to continuous movement of karmic retribution other alt painting of king planting tree thumb king pasenadi planting a bodhi tree in honor of buddha story of angulimala illustrates how criminals are affected by their psycho social and physical environment jungian analyst dale mathers theorizes that ahimsaka started to kill because his meaning system had broken down he was no longer appreciated as an academic talent his attitude could be summarized as i have no value therefore i can kill if i kill then that proves i have no value summarizing life of angulimala mathers writes who bridges giving and taking life similarly referring to psychological concept of moral injury theologian john thompson describes angulimala as someone who is betrayed by an authority figure but manages to recover his eroded moral code and repair community he has affected survivors of moral injury need a clinician and a community of people that face struggles together but deal with those in a safe way similarly angulimala is able to recover from his moral injury due to buddha as his spiritual guide and a monastic community that leads a disciplined life tolerating hardship thompson has further suggested angulimala s story might be used as a sort of narrative therapy and describes ethics presented in narrative as inspiring responsibility story is not about being saved but rather saving oneself with help from others ethics scholar david loy has written extensively about angulimala s story and implications it has for justice system he believes that in buddhist ethics only reason offenders should be punished is to reform their character if an offender like angulimala has already reformed himself there is no reason to punish him even as a deterrent furthermore loy argues that story of angulimala does not include any form of restorative or transformative justice and therefore considers story flawed as an example of justice former politician and community health scholar mathura shrestha on other hand describes angulimala s story as p first concept of transformative justice citing angulimala s repentance and renunciation of his former life as a brigand and pardon he eventually receives from relatives of victims writing about capital punishment scholar damien notes that rehabilitation is main theme of angulimala s story and that witnessing such rehabilitation is reason why king pasenadi does not persecute angulimala in sri lankan pre birth rituals when angulimala sutta is chanted for a pregnant woman it is custom to surround her with objects symbolizing fertility and reproduction such as parts of coconut tree and earthen pots scholars have pointed out that in southeast asian mythology there are links between bloodthirsty figures and fertility motifs shedding of blood can be found in both violence and childbirth which explains why angulimala is both depicted as a killer and a healer with regard to childbirth with regard to passage when buddha meets angulimala feminist scholar liz wilson concludes that story is an example of cooperation and interdependence between sexes both buddha and angulimala s mother help to stop him similarly thompson argues that mothers play an important role in story also citing passage of mother trying to stop angulimala as well as angulimala healing a mother giving childbirth furthermore both buddha and angulimala take on motherly roles in story although many ancient indian stories associate women with qualities like foolishness and powerlessness angulimala s story accepts feminine qualities and buddha acts as a wise adviser to use those qualities in a constructive way nevertheless thompson does not consider story feminist in any way but does argue it contains a feminine kind of ethics of care rooted in buddhism in modern culture alt man standing in forest thumb satish kumar upright 0 8 throughout buddhist history angulimala s story has been depicted in many art forms some of which can be found in museums and buddhist heritage sites in modern culture angulimala still plays an important role in 1985 british born theravada monk founded angulimala a buddhist prison chaplaincy organization in uk it has been recognized by british government as official representative of buddhist religion in all matters concerning british prison system and provides chaplains counselling services and instruction in buddhism and meditation to prisoners throughout england wales and scotland name of organization refers to power of transformation illustrated by angulimala s story according to website of organization story of angulimala teaches us that possibility of enlightenment may be awakened in most extreme of circumstances that people can and do change and that people are best influenced by persuasion and above all example in popular culture angulimala s legend has received considerable attention story has been main subject of at least three movies in 2003 thai director tannirat attempted to release a film named angulimala over 20 conservative buddhist organizations in thailand launched a protest however complaining that movie distorted buddhist teachings and history and introduced hindu and theistic influences not found in buddhist scriptures thai film censorship board rejected appeals to ban film stating it did not distort buddhist teachings they did insist that director cut two scenes of violent material conservative groups were offended by depiction of angulimala as a brutal murderer without including history which led him to become such a violent brigand tannirat defended himself however arguing that although he had omitted interpretations from commentaries he had followed early buddhist discourses precisely tannirat s choice to only use early accounts rather than popular tales from commentaries was precisely what led to protests angulimala has also been subject of literary works in 2006 peace activist satish kumar retold story of angulimala in his short book buddha and terrorist books deals with global war on terror reshaping and combining various accounts of angulimala who is described as a terrorist book emphasizes passage when buddha accepts angulimala in monastic order effectively preventing king pasenadi from punishing him in kumar s book this action leads to backlash from an enraged public who demand to imprison both angulimala and buddha pasenadi organizes a public trial in presence of villagers and royal court in which assembly can decide what to do with two accused in end however assembly decides to release two when angulimala admits to his crimes and pasenadi gives a speech emphasizing forgiveness rather than punishment this twist in story sheds a different light on angulimala whose violent actions ultimately lead to trial and a more non violent and just society writing about buddhist texts and kumar s book thompson reflects that ahimsa in buddhism may have different shades of meaning in different contexts and often does not mean passively standing by or non violence as
