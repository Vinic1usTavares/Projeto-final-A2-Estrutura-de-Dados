armillaria luteobubalina commonly known as australian honey fungus is a species of mushroom in family physalacriaceae widely distributed in southern australia fungus is responsible for a disease known as armillaria root rot a primary cause of eucalyptus tree death and forest dieback it is most pathogenic and widespread of six armillaria species found in australia fungus has also been collected in argentina and chile fruit bodies have cream to tan coloured caps that grow up to in diameter and stems that measure up to long by thick fruit bodies which appear at base of infected trees and other woody plants in autumn march april are edible but require cooking to remove bitter taste fungus is dispersed through spores produced on gills on underside of caps and also by growing vegetatively through root systems of host trees ability of fungus to spread vegetatively is facilitated by an system that allows it to efficiently diffuse oxygen through rhizomorphs rootlike structures made of dense masses of hyphae armillaria luteobubalina was first described in 1978 after having been discovered several years earlier growing in a eucalyptus plantation in southeastern australia it distinguished itself from other known australian armillaria species by its aggressive pathogenicity it may take years for infected trees to show signs of disease leading to an underestimation of disease prevalence studies show that spread of disease in eucalypt forests is associated with infected stumps left following logging operations although several methods have been suggested to control spread of disease they are largely economically or environmentally unfeasible phylogenetic analyses have determined that a luteobubalina is closely related to a montagnei and that both of these species are in turn closely related to brazilian species a paulensis distribution of a luteobubalina suggests that it is an ancient species that originated before separation of precursor supercontinent gondwana history and phylogeny armillaria luteobubalina was first described in 1978 by mycologists roy watling and glen kile who studied its effects on a fast growing plantation of eucalyptus regnans near traralgon victoria plantation established in 1963 consisted largely of trees with a mean height of about a cluster of dead and dying trees discovered in 1973 suggested attack by a virulent primary pathogen that is one capable of infecting a host before invasion by other secondary pathogens this finding was inconsistent with pathogenic behaviour of known armillaria species in australia at time a mellea and a elegans further study over next few years showed that fungus spread by growth of underground mycelia in root systems expanding outward from initial infected stump at an average of per year most australian records of armillaria infections referred to a mellea based on presence of black rhizomorphs for over one hundred years a mellea was thought to be a occurring in various distinct forms species with a widespread distribution and host range and variable pathogenicity which led to great confusion among taxonomists and plant pathologists alike in 1973 veikko reported a technique to distinguish between armillaria species by growing them together as single spore isolates on petri dishes and observing changes in morphology of cultures using similar techniques mycologists eventually determined that armillaria mellea species complex in europe and north america in fact consisted of five and ten distinct biological species respectively watling and kile compared macroscopic and microscopic characters of pathogenic armillaria with a now known as a obscura a mellea a limonea and a novae zelandiae and found sufficient differences between them to warrant designating species as new its specific epithet is derived from latin lutea yellow and was chosen to highlight an important distinguishing characteristic strong yellow colour of cap and lack of reddish or brown tones in stem typical of other resident armillaria a phylogenetic study of south american armillaria species concluded that a luteobubalina is in a lineage that includes a montagnei and these are sister to a lineage containing a paulensis a species known from a single specimen collected in sao paulo brazil although they are very similar specimens of a luteobubalina have smaller spores than argentinian specimens of a montagnei and their distinctness is well supported with phylogenetic analysis based on analysis of enzymes a luteobubalina is closely related to a limonea a species found in new zealand this result corroborates phylogenetic analyses reported in 2003 and 2006 molecular analysis of 27 collections of a luteobubalina from southwest western australia and one from traralgon revealed four distinct polymorphic groups genetic variety suggests it is native to australia description thumb mushroom caps are covered with tiny scales and have an umbo up to in diameter cap is convex to flattened in shape with a central umbo a rounded elevation and is various shades of cream yellow and tan cap surface is covered with darker scales and feels rough to touch cap edge or margin is rolled inward in young specimens crowded gills are sinuate and white to cream in colour initially brownish cream or pinkish brown in maturity and sometimes with yellow or rust coloured marks close to margins stem is central that is it joins cap in centre and is up to long by thick it is slightly thicker at its base than its apex sometimes almost bulb like stem surface is streaked with fibrils that run up and down its length it has a floppy yellow wool like ring which may develop irregular jagged edges with time flesh is white and in stem has a woolly or stringy consistency although it has a hot bitter taste armillaria luteobubalina is edible and cooking removes bitterness microscopic characteristics spore print is white when fresh but becomes more cream coloured when dry smooth spores are oval to ellipsoid hyaline translucent non amyloid meaning they do not absorb iodine from melzer s reagent and typically measure 6 5 7 5 by 4 5 5 5 mm basidia spore bearing cells are thin walled hyaline and lack clamp connections at their bases they are usually four spored but occasionally two spored with sterigmata projections that attach to spores up to 4 mm long cheilocystidia cystidia that occur on edge of a gill are mostly club shaped thin walled hyaline and measure 15 30 by 6 10 mm similar species five other armillaria species are found in australia within range of a luteobubalina a is restricted to gully habitats a is a rarer species found only in poorly drained or seasonally wet locations a luteobubalina and a montagnei share cap features and a similar unpleasant flavour but latter species has an olive tinged cap larger spores 9 5 11 by 5 5 7 um compared to 6 5 7 5 by 4 5 5 5 um and a more conspicuous annulus than those found in a luteobubalina morphology of vegetative structures of a limonea is distinctly different than a luteobubalina and can be used to distinguish two species a novae zelandiae has a sticky more flattened cap and stem below ring and is found in wet forests and a is a species with cream gills maturing to pale pink found in tropical australia arising from dead tree stumps or roots of dead or living trees a luteobubalina is only armillaria species which occurs in western australia distinguishing australian species is economically important because a luteobubalina is more pathogenic than other members of genus a molecular diagnostic test developed in 2002 can accurately identify each species using dna extracted from its mycelia before this species identification was limited to times when fruit bodies were in season this technology also revealed a variation in molecular material of a luteobubalina that suggested sexual reproduction habitat and distribution thumb left a luteobubalina grows in karri forests like this one in pemberton western australia armillaria luteobubalina has been recorded in southeastern australia from southeastern corner of queensland through eastern new south wales and across victoria into southeastern south australia it also occurs in tasmania and southwestern western australia those of karri forests consisting largely of species e diversicolor of southwest have paler and yellower caps than those in jarrah forests which contain predominantly eucalyptus marginata further north fruit bodies arise on wood especially on stumps or around base of trees and often in huge numbers they usually appear between april and july although most production occurs in second half of may abundant in woodlands it can invade gardens and orchards where it can attack many woody plants honey fungus infected and killed many plants near tuart trees eucalyptus gomphocephala which had been cut down near kings park in suburban perth armillaria luteobubalina is commonly found in eucalyptus forests in australia and is thought to be most pathogenic and most widespread armillaria species in major western australian forest types mushroom has also been reported from southern south america in argentina and chile a 2003 study of molecular phylogenetics and pattern of its distribution in south america and australia indicate that a luteobubalina is an ancient species originating before separation of precursor supercontinent gondwana genetic differences between isolates in south american and australian populations indicate a long period of geographical separation and authors suggest that they later might be regarded as independent taxa root rot thumb young fruit body found in forest in southeastern tasmania australia appearance of infected trees trees that are infected by a luteobubalina show characteristic symptoms both above and below ground above ground base of tree develops inverted v shaped lesions and infected wood undergoes white rot a fungal wood decay process where cellulose and lignin of sapwood are both broken down leaving wood stringy bark of stem dies and becomes discoloured up to above ground clusters of fruit bodies appear at base of tree in autumn crowns may show gradual deterioration or tree death may occur suddenly below ground characteristic symptoms of infections include rotting ends of tree roots white rotted sapwood and presence of fan shaped areas of white mycelium below dead or infected bark occurrence in selectively logged eucalypt forests in central highlands of victoria it has been estimated that about 3 5 of forest area is moderately to severely affected by armillaria root rot caused by a luteobubalina a review of eucalypt plantations planted in new south wales from 1994 to 2005 found that infection by a luteobubalina was rare and only accounted for 1 of mortality in total in this instance cases had been restricted to eucalyptus nitens on dorrigo plateau unlike other armillaria species found in australia s native forests which require a host tree to become weakened by prior infection by a different species a luteobubalina is a primary pathogen and can infect healthy trees tree roots may be infected for years before showing above ground symptoms making it difficult to accurately assess true extent of disease in a forest stand surveys are usually conducted in autumn to coincide with appearance of fruit bodies infection is assessed by presence of basal scars on trees and appearance of fruit bodies several factors however such as cost variable on site conditions and non symptomatic diseased trees make it difficult for such surveys to reliably detect all infections one study showed that above ground examinations detected only 50 of trees actually infected leading to underestimation of incidence of true infection by 20 40 study used more intensive surveying methods to determine that 25 to 30 year old karri regrowth forests in western australia showed an average of 40 45 incidence of infection disease spread thumb left a dense cluster of fruit bodies growing on a rotting stump several studies have shown that spread of armillaria root rot in eucalypt forests is associated with infected stumps that remain after an area has been logged armillaria luteobubalina can persist on these stumps using them as a source of food for up to 25 or more years in one case reported in ovens victoria disease was spread to blueberry plants vaccinium species via buried fragments of infected eucalyptus that remained following preparation of previously forested site for planting in individual forest stands a forest stand may be defined as a group of trees occupying a given area and sufficiently uniform in species composition age structure site quality and condition so as to be distinguishable from forest on adjoining areas from fungal infection is usually found in discrete disease patches separated by stands of healthy trees a discontinuous distribution large scale aerial photography can be used to identify regions of forest infected by species species also causes damage to trees and bushes in coastal dune woodlands shrubland and heath communities it can be found on a wide range of hosts but is most commonly associated with in order of decreasing frequency jarrah eucalyptus marginata bull banksia banksia grandis marri e calophylla and acacia saligna it has also infected scattered populations of wandoo e wandoo fungus has also been reported to infect nothofagus species in argentina and pinus radiata in chile armillaria luteobubalina uses an elaborate sophisticated aeration system that enables it to efficiently deliver oxygen into rhizomorphs helping it thrive in low oxygen environments when grown in culture mycelium develops into a continuous region of tissue with a perforated crust this tissue is hydrophobic and resistant to becoming waterlogged rhizomorphs develop beneath clusters of so called air pores near perforations these gas spaces connect atmosphere with central canal of rhizomorph to facilitate diffusion of oxygen and satiate organism s high oxygen requirement during growth this aeration system is thought to be an important factor in organism s pathogenicity allowing it to grow on wet or waterlogged root surfaces and send hyphae or rhizomorphs into live roots or cut stumps where conditions may be hypoxic rhizomorphs have a dichotomous branching pattern so that they split or at various intervals experiments and field observations have shown that this allows fungus to be a more aggressive and virulent pathogen than armillaria species whose rhizomorphs branch where lateral branches grow from a main stem although structure of a luteobubalina rhizomorphs is specialised for spread in potentially anaerobic conditions soil mycelium is adaptive and can amplify absorptive surface of peripheral hyphae in response to presence of nutrient rich soil control methods for controlling spread of armillaria root rot include physical removal of infected trees stumps and large roots fumigation of soil around infected hosts and injection of directly into infected hosts these methods are often not practical due to high cost introduction of toxic chemicals that affect other organisms or health and safety issues for operator biological control is another method that has been investigated to control root rot caused by a luteobubalina in one study thinning stumps of eucalyptus diversicolor were simultaneously inoculated with a luteobubalina and one of saprobic wood decay fungi versicolor stereum hirsutum and all three fungi significantly reduced infection by a these results were echoed in another study of stumps in karri regrowth forests where it was shown that presence of other wood decay fungi suppressed growth
