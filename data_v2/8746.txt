increased capacity history illicit distilleries were commonplace throughout speyside area from 1700s but were largely made redundant with passing of excise act in 1823 it was under this legislation that legal distilleries could be formed subject to holding a license alexander gordon 4th duke of gordon was allegedly instrumental in passing of this legislation although there is no historical record of his involvement in issue his tenant george smith who was operating an illicit distillery on his upper drummin farm at time became first person in scotland to apply for and receive a license to legally produce spirit glenlivet comprehensive yet concise history of scotch glenlivet single malt whisky george smith s decision would prove to be an unpopular decision every other distiller was operating illegally at time and hoping new excise act would be repealed something which would not happen if some distillers accepted new law threats were made against smith so george gordon provided smith with two pistols to be used to ensure both his own safety and that of distillery in 1824 glenlivet distillery was established at upper drumin by george and his youngest son john gordon smith george smith established a second distillery during 1849 named cairngorm delnabo distillery but by 1855 or 1856 both distilleries were running at full capacity and were unable to meet rising demand operation of two separate sites was also proving difficult and expensive so plans were formed around same time to build a new larger distillery further down hill at minmore construction of this new distillery was underway when old upper drumin distillery was destroyed by fire during 1858 construction of new minmore distillery was sped up and salvageable equipment from upper drumin distillery was transferred to new distillery delnabo distillery was closed at same time and best parts of equipment were also transferred to minmore plant production commenced at new plant during 1859 and it was around same time legal entity of george j g smith ltd was formed george smith died in 1871 and his son john gordon smith inherited distillery quality of product from their distillery had resulted in other distilleries in area renaming their products to glenlivet and by time of george s death several distillers were doing so j g smith decided to take legal action and tried to claim ownership on glenlivet name this legal action was only partially successful verdict forced other distillers in area to stop calling their whisky glenlivet and gave j g smith and blender andrew usher sole permission to use brand but permitted other distilleries to their distillery name with glenlivet name which resulted in new distillery names such as glen moray glenlivet distillery a distillery which
