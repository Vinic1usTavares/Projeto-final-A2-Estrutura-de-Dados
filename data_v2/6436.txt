religion reflects effect of vedic rudra puranic shiva worshipped as linga in brahmanical religion and nath and lingayat sects khandoba may be a product of vedic rudra who like khandoba was associated with robbers horses and dogs sontheimer in hiltebeitel pp 301 2 sayana traces name malhari to taittiriya samhita malhari is explained as enemy ari of malha prajapati an epithet of rudra who is considered a rival to deity prajapati according to stanley khandoba originated as a mountain top god solar deity and a regional guardian and then assimilated into himself gods of various regions and communities according to stanley khandoba inherits traits from both sun god surya as well as shiva who is identified with moon stanley describes khandoba as a moon god who has become a sun god emphasizing on how moon imagery of shiva transforms into solar iconography of khandoba in malhari mahatmya as per r c dhere two stone inscriptions in 1063 c e and 1148 c e mentioning folk deities mailara and his consort which suggests that mailara gained popularity in karnataka in this period soon royals of this region started erecting temples to this folk deity upsetting elite class of established religion who vilified mailara initially by an incarnation of shiva mailara was denounced by basava founder of shiva worshipping lingayat sect who would later promote deity swami c 1270 founder of sect sheikh muhammad also criticized god varkari poet saint eknath also wrote disparagingly about khandoba s cult worship but after him open criticism of khandoba stopped but barbaric practices of his cult were still targeted sontheimer suggests that khandoba was primarily a god of herdsmen and that cult of khandoba is at least older than 12th century which can be determined by references in jain and lingayat texts and inscriptions a 12th century jain author claims that a jain who died in battle after a display of his valour was later named as mailara by 13th century wide worship of malhari or mailara is observed by kings brahmins simple folk and warriors with rise of muslim empire classical hindu temples fell into ruin giving rise to folk religion such as of khandoba remarks by end of kali yuga temples of vishnu and shiva will be destroyed but those of mailara will stay a 1369 ad inscription at near warangal tells an account of mallari different from malhari mahatmya shiva helped epic hero arjuna kill demon malla thus acquiring title of mallari mailara was family deity of kakatiya dynasty 1083 1323 ad a text from their rule records self torture rituals of mailara devotees and describes deity throughout his development mailara is looked upon as a lower manifestation of ishvara god by lingayat and maharashtrian bhakti saints sontheimer in bakker pp 106 7 malhari mahatmya states that khandoba first appeared on which was a sunday at which identified as pember near bidar marathi traditions tell that khandoba came originally from now pember in karnataka then went to naldurg pali and finally to jejuri sontheimer suggests that cult of mailara may have originated in pember and then spread to maharashtra merging with cult of patron yaksha demi god of paithan giving it its distinct characteristics call god khanderaya god from karnataka cult possibly was spread by lingayat jain and other merchants associated with mailara khandoba to other parts of deccan besides mailara khandoba is identified with other deities of karnataka and andhra pradesh and is called as mallanna and mallu khan sontheimer in bakker pp 108 9 other traditions like shakta cults of folk goddesses were assimilated into khandoba cult identifying goddesses with khandoba s wives mhalsa or banai marathi literature has a mixed reaction to cult of khandoba 1790 in stotra hymn dedicated to khandoba calls him an illustrious king with rich clothes and a horse with a saddle studded with jewels who was once an ascetic beggar who ride an old bull and carried an ant bitten club a humorous take on puranic shiva in another instance 1855 he is called a ghost by a christian missionary and brahmin in a debate against deshastha brahmin another brahmin remarks with scorn about impurity of khandoba temple visited by sudras and whose priests are non brahmin guravs marathi term khel khandoba which is taken to mean devastation in general usage refers to possession of devotee by
