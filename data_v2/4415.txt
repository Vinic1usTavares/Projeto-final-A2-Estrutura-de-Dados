certain symbols drawn on slate and will respond to them creatures also retrieve slate and return it to its original space if player drops it slate symbols can cause environmental changes such as rain or increased wind which may be necessary for solving puzzles slate cannot be carried everywhere due to its size for example player will have to leave slate behind if they want to climb a ladder end of ages has several features designed to help players complete puzzles to recall clues or important items players can use a camera feature to take screenshots which are then placed in a journal player

thank player and speak of a new chapter for d ni people esher is handed over to bahro to be punished for his crimes game ends on a visit to releeshahn development robyn and rand miller mysts creators had initially decided against creating sequels to 1997 s riven however publishing rights to series later transferred to ubisoft who commissioned two sequels myst iii exile and myst iv revelation myst v end of ages was officially announced at 2005 macworld expo by myst and rivens developer cyan worlds in announcement cyan stated that game would be final installment in series whereas most previous myst titles had forgone 3d graphics rendered in real time in favor of interactive prerendered environments rand miller decided that technology had advanced to point that end of ages could use real time graphics without sacrificing player immersion over years myst games have become increasingly sophisticated culminating in myst v where we offer striking graphics that players can walk smoothly through miller stated in an interview miller emphasized that goal of game remained for players to become immersed in mysts alternate worlds a focus in development was to make end of ages more accessible than previous myst games which had often stymied uninitiated players with their puzzles learning from control scheme used in another real time myst game a remake of original entitled realmyst cyan decided to develop multiple control methods to allow new players to quickly learn controls as well as provide a familiar interface for franchise veterans esher s experiences with player s quest allowed a hint system to be built into story miller wanted to make a significant change from previous games in series in that player s actions decide fate of characters when asked about ending miller explained future of civilization is down to this point and choices you make determine where it goes myst games had typically used chroma key to insert footage of actors into digital backgrounds models of end of agess characters were instead computer generated but cyan did not want to lose warmth and feeling provided by using a live actor instead cyan developed a device mounted to actors faces that captured video of actors while they spoke their lines video was then manipulated and used as a facial texture that was mapped onto 3d characters and facial movement was also tracked and used to animate faces of characters in game motion capture of body was also used to ensure lifelike movement cyan staff were worried that audio synching for animation would not be finished in time for e3 unveiling of game but were happy with end results critical reaction to game previews and impressions at e3 was highly positive miller was relieved stating that when mostly shooter game dominated showcase declared that end of ages might be best game in series that feels good audio composer tim larkin a sound designer and audio director at cyan who had previously worked on realmyst and uru ages beyond myst was given task of developing myst vs musical score larkin stated that whereas earlier myst games had been constrained by technological limitations available technology allowed end of ages to have a more dynamic environment with music changing with various timings of different sound effects surround sound provided a more realistic and immersive gameplay experience a major challenge in writing music was that score had to be flexible enough to match non linear gameplay events games are totally interactive experiences larkin explained you don t guide a player through since you can t count on being at a certain place at a certain time i can t write cue music to get player to do this this and then this one player might hear cue and run other way larkin had to step away from what he had learned as a jazz composer and musician writing pieces with a definite beginning and end instead creating music with less arc and structure larkin admitted that some myst fans would have preferred a musical style similar to robyn miller s scores for myst and riven but replied by saying that change happens and players would find something to like in new music if they kept an open mind due to a tight budget larkin was unable to hire an orchestra to perform music all instruments in soundtrack aside from larkin s own trumpet playing are sampled instruments larkin used a variety of synthesizers samplers and computers to create score working at his home studio and cyan s offices larkin found that biggest challenge with score was finishing it on time for game to ship soundtrack was released in cd format on october 25 2005 release end of ages was packaged in two different retail versions for release in september 2005 to coincide with 12th anniversary of franchise s debut a standard edition containing only game was released for windows based pcs in a cd rom format limited edition contained original soundtrack a collector s lithograph strategy guide and a bonus dvd with a making of retrospective on myst franchise video was made by gametap a subsidiary of turner broadcasting system behind scenes feature was first game related documentary developed by turner limited edition was shipped on hybrid mac os x windows dvds with macintosh conversion provided by quebec based developer beenox this was only commercial option for macintosh players shortly before end of ages was released cyan announced layoff of most of staff and that company would be ceasing software development reason for sudden closure was a failure to gain financial backing for a new project after end of agess development part of blame for company s financial troubles were placed on commercial disappointment of uru ages beyond myst company was according to rand miller able to pull a rabbit out of a hat and rehire almost all employees a few weeks later after backing for a new project was secured with release of end of ages cyan stated that their next game would have nothing to do with myst series while pitching an unnamed online game to publishers cyan produced cosmic osmo s hex isle with online content site reception overall end of ages was well received by critics game was judged a fitting end to series and in combination with other games in series sold more than 12 million copies by november 2007 it placed sixth for week of october 9 on npd techworld s sales rankings as with previous games visuals of end of ages were widely praised switch to real time rendering was generally seen as a positive step game s music was lauded gamespot s review noted use of music in end of ages was sparse but little audio present set proper tone for different ages a few reviewers such as charles herold of new york times felt that graphics fell short of what was possible especially compared to prerendered visuals of myst iv revelation while greg kasavin of gamespot felt that though visuals were on par with previous games end of ages was missing several elements which made myst iv more immersive only important story driving items could be interacted with for example and player makes no sounds or footsteps in game characters of myst occasionally ridiculed in previous games were well received in end of ages publications such as gamespot and ign praised voice acting and switch to character models castro of ign stated that though player could not interact directly with characters rendered characters wound up feeling more genuine and real than in previous games speaking with genuine conviction and animation special praise was given to david ogden stiers for bringing esher to life a dissenting opinion was presented by reviewer mark saltzman who thought that players might become bored by overly dramatic character dialogue critics warmly received addition of slate and its related puzzles oliver clare of eurogamer called slate system a welcome addition to myst formula although he felt that recognition of symbols was occasionally too precise paul presley of computer and video games felt that slate concept could have been explored further while gamespot enjoyed environmental effects created by slates end of ages won several awards upon release including ign s editor s choice larkin s music was nominated under best interactive score category at 2006 game audio network guild awards and won 2006 game industry news award for best soundtrack it was a nominee for
