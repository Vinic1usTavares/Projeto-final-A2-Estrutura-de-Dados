was an honest and upstanding citizen in a time when not many ballplayers could say same however he was also a domineering dictatorial captain with a violent streak team discipline did improve in his first season but his overbearing ways proved divisive causing team to bicker amongst themselves ferguson s temper would flare up often even when team was winning chicago tribune reported that if anyone on hartford nine committed an error ferguson would swear until everything looks blue he was particularly rough on second baseman jack burdock who on more than one occasion heard his captain publicly threaten to ram his fist down burdock s throat some players tolerated his behavior others however refused to comply shortstop tom carey and center fielder jack remsen did not hesitate to yell back while burdock and pitcher candy cummings on other hand often sulked situation in hartford came to a head after a tough loss to red stockings a game in which ferguson had committed several errors hartford s main pitcher tommy bond suggested that ferguson was crooked ferguson denied charge and bond quickly retracted his statement claiming that he said it in anger bond then requested that he be able to leave team because he could not play for ferguson a request that was granted by league president morgan bulkeley a former owner of dark blues hartford finished third in both of its two seasons in national league and when team folded ferguson became new chicago white stockings player manager it would be his only season in chicago al spalding had hired ferguson to captain his chicago team because of his reputation openly saying that he admired ferguson s style and leadership that made hartford teams successful ferguson personally had his most successful season as a player that season as he batted 351 which was third in league led league in on base percentage tied for fourth in runs batted in and ranked fourth in hits unfortunately white stockings finished at 500 and in spalding s memoirs he called ferguson tactless and hopelessly lacking any knowledge of subtle science of handling men by strategy rather than by force cap anson would eventually take over that role in 1879 ferguson again moved on this time accepting player manager role with new troy trojans team who began their time in national league in 1879 and would stay in that role until team folded after 1882 season in 1883 he became first manager in history of philadelphia phillies franchise which was known at time as quakers but was relieved of command when team won only four of its first 17 games on august 21 of that season his quakers traveled to providence rhode island to play grays to increase ticket sales he gave day s pitching duty to rhode island native art hagan in hopes that hagan s appearance would attract more locals to come watch game strategy worked but hagen surrendered 28 runs and quakers made 20 errors behind him and did not score a run financially sound decision as it was a bad decision for public relations as ferguson was labeled a sadist for not relieving hagen american association ferguson s last two managerial positions were in american association he was player
