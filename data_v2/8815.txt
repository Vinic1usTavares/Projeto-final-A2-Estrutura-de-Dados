uss california bb 44 was second of two s built for united states navy between her keel laying in october 1916 and her commissioning in august 1921 tennessee class was part of standard series of twelve battleships built in 1910s and 1920s and were developments of preceding they were armed with a battery of twelve guns in four three gun turrets california served as flagship of battle fleet in pacific ocean for duration of her peacetime career she spent 1920s and 1930s participating in routine fleet training exercises including annual fleet problems and cruises around americas and further abroad such as a goodwill visit to australia and new zealand in 1925 california was moored in pearl harbor on 7 december 1941 when japanese attacked port bringing united states into world war ii ship was moderately damaged by a pair of torpedoes and a bomb but a fire disabled ship s electrical system preventing pumps from being used to keep ship afloat california slowly filled with water over following three days and eventually sank her crew suffered heavy casualties in attack and four men were awarded medal of honor for their actions during attack she was raised in april 1942 repaired and heavily rebuilt and returned to service in january 1944 ship thereafter supported amphibious operations conducted during pacific war including mariana and palau islands campaign though she was damaged in a collision with and thus missed battle of peleliu and philippines campaign during which she took part in battle of surigao strait she was hit by a kamikaze during invasion of lingayen gulf in january 1945 after repairs joined fleet supporting troops fighting on okinawa during battle of okinawa her crew took part in occupation of japan after end of war and after returning to united states via indian and atlantic oceans was laid up in philadelphia in 1946 she remained in fleet s inventory until 1959 when she was broken up for scrap design two tennessee class battleships were authorized on 3 march 1915 and they were in most respects repeats of earlier s primary differences being enlarged bridges greater elevation for main battery turrets and relocation of secondary battery to upper deck california was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of she displaced as designed and up to at full combat load ship was powered by four shaft general electric turbo electric transmission and eight oil fired babcock wilcox boilers rated at generating a top speed of ship had a cruising range of at a speed of her crew numbered 57 officers and 1 026 enlisted men as built she was fitted with two lattice masts with spotting tops for main gun battery ship was armed with a main battery of twelve 50 caliber guns 50 caliber refers to length of gun in terms of caliber length of a 50 caliber gun is 50 times its bore diameter in four three gun turrets on centerline placed in two superfiring pairs forward and aft of superstructure unlike earlier american battleships with triple turrets these mounts allowed each barrel to elevate independently secondary battery consisted of fourteen 51 caliber guns mounted in individual casemates clustered in superstructure amidships initially ship was to have been fitted with twenty two of guns but experiences in north sea during world war i demonstrated that additional guns which would have been placed in hull would have been unusable in anything but calm seas as a result casemates were plated over to prevent flooding secondary battery was augmented with four 50 caliber guns in addition to her gun armament california was also fitted with two torpedo tubes mounted submerged in hull one on each broadside main armored belt was thick while main armored deck was up to thick main battery gun turrets had thick faces on barbettes conning tower had thick sides service history pre war service thumb left at high speed 1921 californias keel was laid down on 25 october 1916 at mare island naval shipyard in vallejo california work was halted for a short time during world war i while shipyard focused on outfitting smaller craft she was launched 20 november 1919 and commissioned on 10 august 1921 on entering service she joined battle fleet serving as its flagship for duration of her peacetime career california was occupied with routine training exercises including joint army navy maneuvers and annual fleet problems on night of 11 november 1924 lieutenant dixie kiefer took off from ship first night aircraft launch in history further experimentation with aircraft continued in early 1925 when ships of battle fleet received a squadron of curtiss ts 1 floatplanes on 31 march in mid 1925 battle fleet crossed pacific ocean on a goodwill cruise to australia and new zealand on way ships stopped in pago pago american samoa california underwent a refit at puget sound navy yard at bremerton washington later that year in 1926 california had an aircraft catapult installed on one of her main battery turrets and she carried up to three vought uo 1 floatplanes she participated in a naval review for president calvin coolidge held off hampton roads virginia on 4 june 1927 in late 1929 and early 1930 ship received a new battery of eight 25 cal guns on anti aircraft mounts in place of old 3 inch guns she took part in fleet problem x conducted in caribbean sea from 10 to 15 march 1930 fleet problem xi followed again in caribbean from 14 to 18 april after conclusion of exercises california steamed north to new york city thereafter joining a naval review for president herbert hoover off virginia capes on 20 may ship then returned to pacific and after arriving visited port angeles washington from 7 to 11 july she operated off puget sound through 11 august before steaming south to san francisco where she stayed from 17 to 24 august in early 1931 she and rest of battle fleet steamed south to panama canal zone thumb left firing a broadside fleet problem xii took place from 15 to 21 february in waters off canal exercises consisted of an attack by a fleet reliant on aircraft carriers against canal zone which was defended by california and battleships of battle fleet maneuvers revealed critical limitations in endurance and armament of carrier aircraft of day and battleships were easily able to defeat carrier force from 1 july to 16 august california was stationed in puget sound and later in august she steamed south to san francisco and then to san pedro ship took part in gunnery practice in early 1932 off san nicolas island in march 1933 frigate then on a tour of united states arrived in california a fleet of 130 ships including california welcomed vessel on her arrival in long beach on 9 march next day 1933 long beach earthquake occurred causing significant damage to city and killing around 120 people fleet sent some 4 000 men ashore to assist in relief effort including crewmen from california in 1934 california was assigned to battleship division batdiv 4 though she retained her role as fleet flagship following fleet problem xv held from 19 april to 12 may in caribbean fleet visited haiti for two weeks on 25 may ships steamed north for another naval review off new york on 31 may attended by president franklin d roosevelt on its return to pacific over course of 27 october to 9 november battle fleet conducted exercises as it passed through canal and steamed to san pedro including nighttime attacks by accompanying destroyers maneuvers culminated in an attack by a force of simulated battleships played by a group of light cruisers carrier and several submarines thereafter california and several other vessels participated in amphibious assault training on san clemente island on 15 november for fleet problem xvi held from 29 april to 10 june 1935 fleet conducted a series of maneuvers in eastern pacific ranging from alaskan waters down to midway island and hawaii in mid 1937 california transferred to batdiv 2 and on 7 july ships of division visited hawaii returning to california on 22 august california and her sister transited panama canal in early 1938 for a visit to ponce puerto rico which lasted from 6 to 11 march in 1939 navy decided to acquire six experimental xaf radar sets on being delivered to navy they were designated as cxam radar one set was installed aboard california in 1940 with other five going to carrier and three heavy cruisers in april and may california participated in fleet problem xx which was again held in eastern pacific following conclusion of maneuvers roosevelt ordered battle fleet to remain in hawaii permanently new forward deployment was calculated to deter japanese aggression in pacific as tensions rose owing to world war ii in europe and second sino japanese war in asia navy cancelled fleet problem xxii which had been scheduled for 1941 early that year ship underwent an overhaul that concluded on 15 april after which ship made a visit to san francisco world war ii pearl harbor attack thumb california sunk in shallow water at pearl harbor after attack on morning of 7 december 1941 california was moored on southeastern side of ford island southernmost ship along battleship row at time ship had two of her 5 inch guns and two of her 50 cal machine guns designated as ready guns with fifty 5 inch shells and four hundred 50 cal rounds at guns immediately after japanese attack on pearl harbor began californias first lieutenant lieutenant commander marion little who was senior officer aboard ship at time issued order to general quarters little ordered guns into action and prepared to get ship underway at 08 03 crews of ready guns began to engage japanese aircraft which included mitsubishi a6m zero fighters that strafed ship gunners quickly expended ready ammunition however and magazines had to be unlocked before they could be resupplied while this effort was going on a pair of nakajima b5n torpedo bombers approached and dropped their torpedoes toward california both hit ship at 08 05 one forward and other further aft former detonated below armor belt at frame 52 between number 2 turret and bridge creating a hole high and long deforming first torpedo bulkhead and transverse stiffeners between frames 47 and 60 and holing second bulkhead with fragments latter tore a hole that was long below belt armor interior torpedo bulkheads nevertheless held and helped to contain flooding ship had been prepared for inspection at time of attack so watertight doors had all been opened crew was still in process of closing doors when torpedoes struck and flooding began many of portholes and exterior doors were also open for inspection which allowed water to enter ship particularly as ship took on water from torpedo hits as uncontrolled flooding started to spread throughout ship california began to list to port of 5 to 6 degrees little ordered damage control teams to counter flood on starboard side to keep list to 4 degrees but flooding on port side continued to spread torpedo blasts had also ruptured forward fuel tanks which allowed water to enter fuel system contamination shut down ship s electrical system hindering efforts of damage control teams between 08 15 and 09 15 ship was repeatedly attacked by aichi d3a dive bombers one bomb hit on starboard side and a near miss on port side caused minor damage anti aircraft gunners aboard ship claimed to have shot down two of bombers though credit for downed aircraft is difficult to establish owing to chaotic situation at 08 45 commander earl stone ship s executive officer boarded ship and took command of vessel at same time california was struck by a bomb which may have been one of modified armor piercing shell near forwardmost casemate on starboard side after penetrating upper deck bomb ricocheted off second deck and detonated in ship s interior where it caused extensive damage started a serious fire and killed around 50 men at around same time boiler room crew got four of boilers restarted which restored power by 09 15 fire had spread to casemates no 3 5 and 7 by which time captain joel bunkley and vice admiral william s pye battle fleet commander had returned to ship smoke from fire eventually reached forward engine room at 10 00 and forced men inside to evacuate area this ended pumping efforts though after end of attack other vessels came alongside to first battle blaze and then to pump water out portable pumps used by these vessels lacked power necessary to counteract flooding and ship eventually settled into mud as hull slowly filled with water over next three days in course of attack 98 men were killed and 61 were wounded several men were awarded medal of honor for their actions during attack jackson c pharris one of ship s gunners organized a group of men to carry ammunition up from magazines and rescued several sailors who had been overcome by fuel oil fumes herbert c jones and thomas reeves both organized similar parties to carry ammunition but both were killed during attack robert r scott was also killed after he refused to leave his battle station salvage repair and return to service thumb left one of californias guns being raised from ship to lighten her before being raised c february 1942 over next several months salvage efforts proceeded as workers patched hull and pumped out water finally re floating ship on 25 march 1942 on 5 april ship suffered an accidental explosion at 13 15 most likely result of a mixture of fuel oil vapor and hydrogen sulfide gas explosion dislodged patch that had been used to cover forward hole in hull and damaged watertight doors which caused serious flooding over next few days salvage team had to re patch hull and pump out hull again on 9 april california was able to enter dry dock no 2 in pearl harbor after completing initial repairs she was re floated on 9 june and remained in port for several months on 10 october california departed pearl harbor and met destroyer at sea two vessels proceeded to puget sound where california would undergo permanent repairs and a major modernization this work lasted from 20 october 1942 to 31 january 1944 all of ship s guns save her main battery were removed and her superstructure was razed completely in preparation for reconstruction her hull was widened to improve underwater protection scheme and increase stability new fire control systems which had been diverted from light cruisers that were converted into light aircraft carriers were installed and her cxam radar was removed and installed on oahu her secondary battery was replaced with sixteen 5 inch 38 cal dual purpose guns in new twin turrets and she received a large number of close range anti aircraft guns in total she was fitted with forty bofors guns in ten quadruple mounts and forty three oerlikon guns horizontal protection was considerably strengthened to improve her resistance to air attack 3 inches of special treatment steel sts was added to deck over magazines and of sts was added elsewhere in place of her original conning tower she received one of towers that had been removed from s that had recently been rebuilt california also had her old cage masts removed with a modern tower mast installed in place of forward cage mast changes doubled ship s crew to a total of 114 officers and 2 129 enlisted men on 31 january 1944 california departed puget sound and began a series of sea trials followed by a shakedown cruise off san pedro ship was then occupied with a variety of training to prepare crew many of whom were fresh from initial training for combat operations in pacific while in san francisco ship underwent another machinery overhaul in april and on 5 may ship departed to join fleet that was assembling in central pacific for marianas campaign she proceeded first to hawaiian islands where she took part in shore bombardment practice off she departed area on 31 may bound for anchorage at roi namur in marshall islands california arrived there on 8 june where she joined task group tg 52 17 fire support group 1 under command of rear admiral jesse b oldendorf central pacific campaigns thumb california after rebuilding california and rest of fleet steamed to mariana islands to begin mariana and palau islands campaign fleet arrived off initial target saipan late on 13 june next morning california and other ships of tg 52 17 moved into their bombardment positions launched their spotting aircraft and began shelling japanese positions on island california opened fire at 05 58 at a range of engaging targets in area around capital garapan a japanese shell from a field gun struck ship at 09 10 aft of fire control platform killing one man and injuring ten ship s air search radar was disabled by hit which started a fire that was quickly contained by damage control teams later in day california left area for night returning next morning at 09 54 american observers spotted a group of japanese type 95 and type 97 tanks in garapan and california engaged them destroying at least one of tanks ship then helped to suppress a battery of japanese guns on island that had been engaging battleship california bombarded japanese positions throughout day withdrawing for night at 18 30 on morning of 15 june american 2nd marine division went ashore and california supported assault opening fire at 06 12 first at garapan and then at landing beaches as dug in defenders attempted to repel landing ship also attacked japanese artillery on point which had been shelling marines she remained off shore overnight and after establishing radio communications with marines ashore provided fire support to break up japanese night time counterattacks california remained on station for several days bombarding japanese defenses as marines pushed inland on 17 june she and maryland shot down a kawasaki ki 61 fighter and next day california came under attack from ki 61 but was not damaged apart from one of 5 inch guns that was accidentally shot by one of 40 mm guns on 22 june california withdrew to replenish ammunition and stores at eniwetok in marshalls thumb left california off guam in july 1944 after arriving in eniwetok she underwent repairs from 25 june to 16 july thereafter returning to saipan which had by that time been secured next target guam was to be attacked in operation stevedore on arrival in marianas california joined tennessee and four destroyers to form task unit 53 1 16 which arrived off guam on 19 july ships joined preparatory bombardment that day as ships sought to neutralize japanese defenses around invasion beaches shelling continued over course of next day before landings on 21 july with california concentrating her fire on areas around tumon and agana california provided initial support to amphibious assault that began at 08 30 but left later that day at 15 00 bound for saipan california replenished her ammunition at saipan and then proceeded to tinian next island to attacked in campaign california and tennessee arrived on 23 july and began a bombardment of san jose on southern end of island as a diversion from actual landing beaches on further north two battleships fired a total of 480 shells from their main guns and 800 rounds from their 5 inch guns completely obliterating town at 17 00 two ships checked their fire and withdrew for night next morning they returned to support marines as they landed on island fighting raged for next several days during which time california patrolled off island shelling japanese forces ship s role in battle culminated in a last stand by japanese defenders on 31 july during which california and other bombardment ships fired a terrific barrage against their positions california then departed area and returned to guam to support troops still fighting there until 9 august when she left to replenish ammunition and fuel at eniwetok on 19 august california departed eniwetok as part of a task force of battleships cruisers and destroyers bound for espiritu santo while underway on 23 august tennessee suffered a steering malfunction that caused her to turn out of line and collide with california tearing a hole in latter s bow seven crewmen aboard california were killed in accident and several were trapped in their berthing compartment by bent bulkheads that had to be cut through to free them damage control teams shored up damaged bulkheads and were able to pump water out of hull tennessee suffered more serious damage and she had to leave group for repairs at pearl harbor california continued with convoy and after arriving at their destination entered floating drydock for repairs that lasted from 25 august to 10 september collision prevented ship from taking part in battle of peleliu philippines campaign thumb map showing movements of american and japanese fleets during battle of surigao strait california left espiritu santo on 17 september and passed along coast of new guinea where crewmen observed battles between japanese and australian forces during new guinea campaign ship arrived in manus on 22 september where preparations for next operation began california again part of oldendorf s bombardment group which now included maryland tennessee and departed on 12 october bound for philippines philippines campaign began five days later with initial landings by 6th ranger battalion on islands of and latter attack made japanese aware of impending assault on philippines leading to activation of operation sho go 1 planned riposte to an allied landing allied minesweepers then began clearing channels into leyte gulf in preparation for main landings at leyte on 19 october bombardment of island began continuing next day as troops went ashore a zero fighter dove toward ship later that day one of first kamikazes but heavy anti aircraft fire sent plane off course and it crashed harmlessly off starboard bow battle of leyte gulf over following days california remained off invasion beach pounding japanese positions as american forces pushed their way inland during this period japanese fleet began moving into position for their counterattack allied reconnaissance aircraft and submarines reported sightings of fleet as it approached area prompting bombardment group to withdraw to southern leyte every night in anticipation of a japanese attack on amphibious assault ships on 24 october reports of japanese naval forces approaching area led oldendorf s ships to prepare for action at exit of surigao strait vice admiral shoji nishimura s southern force steamed through surigao strait to attack invasion fleet in leyte gulf his force comprised battleship division 2 battleships and heavy cruiser and four destroyers and vice admiral kiyohide shima s second striking force heavy cruisers and light cruiser and four more destroyers as nishimura s flotilla passed through strait on night of 24 october they came under attack from american pt boats followed by destroyers initiating battle of surigao strait one of these destroyers torpedoed fuso and disabled her though nishimura continued on toward his objective at 03 12 california picked up japanese ships with her sg radar at a range of eight minutes later her forward mk 8 fire control radar began tracking ships range having fallen to by that time west virginia opened fire first at 03 52 followed by most of other american battleships california engaged leading japanese vessel at a range of with a six gun salvo after initial phase of battle american battle line turned about but california misinterpreted vague order to turn one five meaning to turn 150 degrees captain henry burnett read it as an instruction to turn 15 degrees and turned incorrectly passing across tennessees bow by now realizing his mistake burnett ordered california to turn hard to starboard while tennessee hauled out of line two ships narrowly avoided each other but in confusion california masked tennessee and blocked her from firing for several minutes though california continued firing during this period ship suffered a misfire in right gun of her rearmost turret and concussion from third salvo disabled rear mk 8 radar and damaged scope for forward radar but nevertheless continued to accurately direct guns sixteen minutes after opening fire california checked her fire as surviving japanese ships turned and fled by this time several torpedoes launched by japanese vessels approached american line but none of them struck battleships in course of action california fired a total of 63 shells from her main battery japanese had lost both battleships and four destroyers in battle in meantime main japanese fleet central force under vice admiral takeo kurita had passed through san bernardino strait under cover of darkness and arrived early on 25 october japanese battleships and cruisers attacked taffy 3 a force of escort carriers and destroyers guarding invasion fleet in battle off samar prompting its commander rear admiral clifton sprague to make urgent calls for help oldendorf immediately turned his ships northward to join battle and while en route ships came under japanese air attack californias 5 inch and 40 mm guns attempted to engage aircraft but did not score any hits by time bombardment group arrived on scene kurita had disengaged having been convinced by taffy 3 s heavy resistance that he was instead facing far more powerful fast carrier task force with battle over ships of bombardment group resumed their ground support operations for next month battle of lingayen gulf on 20 november she departed for manus for repairs that lasted from 25 november to 15 december she then proceeded to kossol roads in palau where she remained until 1 january 1945 when she got underway to return to leyte gulf after rejoining bombardment group fleet steamed to western luzon to make next major assault in lingayen gulf on western side of island japanese aircraft attacked fleet while en route though california was not damaged in attacks fleet arrived off gulf on 5 january and entered it following morning early that morning california launched her floatplanes to spot for her guns before opening fire on santiago island on western side of gulf to silence any japanese artillery that might threaten allied forces once they entered lingayen gulf fleet s minesweepers then swept channels further into gulf which california helped to cover with oldendorf aboard she led bombardment group into gulf to begin bombardment to prepare for invasion of lingayen gulf shortly after 17 15 that day a pair of zero kamikazes approached ship californias gunners shot one of them down but other struck her on port side abreast of mainmast gasoline from plane s fuel tanks started a fire and a 5 inch shell from another ship accidentally hit one of californias 5 inch guns exploded inside turret and started another fire both fires were suppressed within twelve minutes but kamikaze inflicted significant casualties 44 men were killed and another 155 were injured temporary repairs were made while ship remained on station continuing to bombard japanese positions troops from us sixth army went ashore on 9 january and from 10 to 18 january california left gulf to patrol south china sea to guard against a possible attack by japanese fleet she then returned to lingayen gulf but departed on 22 january for ulithi arriving there on 28 january california departed ulithi and continued on to pearl harbor where she stayed from 6 to 8 february thereafter departing for puget sound for permanent repairs and modifications on 24 april california got underway for a brief set of trials before steaming south to long beach on 29 april further work was done there from 2 to 10 may during which time she also underwent a shakedown cruise on 10 may she departed california to return to fleet then preparing for attack on okinawa while en route she stopped in pearl harbor from 16 to 29 may and in ulithi from 9 to 12 june after which she turned north to ryukyu islands final operations california anchored off okinawa on 15 june by which time american forces had been fighting on island for more than two months japanese had launched a major kamikaze campaign during operations on and around okinawa and these attacks continued while california was on station on 17 and 18 june she and heavy cruisers and bombarded japanese positions on dake and dake ridges in support of 96th infantry division heavy fog hampered efforts by ship s floatplanes to locate concealed japanese positions but california nevertheless conducted a heavy bombardment of area over two days she thereafter patrolled off island until 14 july to prevent any japanese naval forces from attacking invasion fleet from 15 to 22 july she lay at replenishing fuel and stores thereafter joining task force 95 which was sent into east china sea to clear mines on 8 august she was detached from tf 95 for maintenance at san pedro bay in philippines work lasting from 11 to 15 august while there californias crew received word of japanese surrender once work was
