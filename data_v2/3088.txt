thumb gandhi picked up grains of salt at end of his on march behind him is his second son manilal gandhi and petit salt march also known as salt satyagraha dandi march and dandi satyagraha was an act of nonviolent civil disobedience in colonial india led by mohandas karamchand gandhi 24 day march lasted from 12 march 1930 to 6 april 1930 as a direct action campaign of tax resistance and nonviolent protest against british salt monopoly mahatma gandhi started this march with 80 of his trusted volunteers walking ten miles a day for 24 days march spanned over 240 miles from sabarmati ashram 240 miles 384 km to dandi which was called navsari at time now in state of gujarat growing numbers of indians joined them along way when gandhi broke salt laws at 6 30 am on 6 april 1930 it sparked large scale acts of civil disobedience against british raj salt laws by millions of indians mass civil disobedience throughout india followed as millions broke salt laws from dalton s introduction to gandhi s civil disobedience gandhi and dalton p 72 after making salt by evaporation at dandi gandhiji continued southward along coast making salt and addressing meetings on way congress party planned to stage a satyagraha at dharasana salt works 25 miles south of dandi however gandhiji was arrested on midnight of 4 5 may 1930 just days before planned action at dharasana dandi march and ensuing dharasana satyagraha drew worldwide attention to indian independence movement through extensive newspaper and newsreel coverage satyagraha against salt tax continued for almost a year ending with gandhi s release from jail and negotiations with viceroy lord irwin at second round table conference dalton p 92 over 60 000 indians were jailed as a result of salt satyagraha johnson p 234 however it failed to result in major concessions from british ackerman p 106 salt satyagraha campaign was based upon gandhi s principles of non violent protest called satyagraha which he loosely translated as truth force its root meaning is holding onto truth hence truth force i have also called it love force or soul force gandhi 2001 p 6 literally it is formed from sanskrit words satya truth and agraha insistence in early 1930 indian national congress chose satyagraha as their main tactic for winning indian sovereignty and self rule from british rule and appointed gandhi to organise campaign gandhi chose 1882 british salt act as first target of satyagraha salt march to dandi and beating by british police of hundreds of nonviolent protesters in dharasana which received worldwide news coverage demonstrated effective use of civil disobedience as a technique for fighting social and political injustice martin p 35 satyagraha teachings of gandhi and march to dandi had a significant influence on american activists martin luther king jr james bevel and others during civil rights movement for civil rights for african americans and other minority groups in 1960s march was most significant organised challenge to british authority since non cooperation movement of 1920 22 and directly followed purna swaraj declaration of sovereignty and self rule by indian national congress on 26 january 1930 it gained worldwide attention which gave impetus to indian independence movement and started nationwide civil disobedience movement declaration of sovereignty and self rule thumb right mahatma gandhi and sarojini naidu during march at midnight on 31 december 1929 indian national congress raised tricolour flag of india on banks of ravi at lahore indian national congress led by gandhi and jawaharlal nehru publicly issued declaration of sovereignty and self rule or purna swaraj on 26 january 1930 literally in sanskrit purna complete swa self raj rule so therefore complete self rule declaration included readiness to withhold taxes and statement we believe that it is inalienable right of indian people as of any other people to have freedom and to enjoy fruits of their toil and have necessities of life so that they may have full opportunities of growth we believe also that if any government deprives a people of these rights and oppresses them people have a further right to alter it or abolish it british government in india has not only deprived indian people of their freedom but has based itself on exploitation of masses and has ruined india economically politically culturally and spiritually we believe therefore that india must sever british connection and attain purna or complete sovereignty and self rule congress working committee gave gandhi responsibility for organising first act of civil disobedience with congress itself ready to take charge after gandhi s expected arrest ackerman p 83 gandhi s plan was to begin civil disobedience with a satyagraha aimed at british salt tax 1882 salt act gave british a monopoly on collection and manufacture of salt limiting its handling to government salt depots and levying a salt tax dalton p 91 violation of salt act was a criminal offence even though salt was freely available to those living on coast by evaporation of sea water indians were forced to buy it from colonial government choice of salt as protest focus initially gandhi s choice of salt tax was met with incredulity by working committee of congress dalton p 100 jawaharlal nehru and sahoo were ambivalent sardar patel suggested a land revenue boycott instead nehru who had been skeptical about salt as primary focus of campaign realized how wrong he was johnson p 32 gandhi gopalkrishna great dandi march eighty years after hindu 5 april 1930 statesman a prominent newspaper wrote about choice it is difficult not to laugh and we imagine that will be mood of most thinking indians british establishment too was not disturbed by these plans of resistance against salt tax viceroy himself lord irwin did not take threat of a salt protest seriously writing to london at present prospect of a salt campaign does not keep me awake at night letter to london on 20 february 1930 ackerman p 84 however gandhi had sound reasons for his decision an item of daily use could resonate more with all classes of citizens than an abstract demand for greater political rights salt tax represented 8 2 of british raj tax revenue and hurt poorest indians most significantly gandhi and dalton p 72 explaining his choice gandhi said next to air and water salt is perhaps greatest necessity of life in contrast to other leaders prominent congress statesman and future governor general of india c rajagopalachari understood gandhi s viewpoint in a public meeting at tuticorin he said suppose a people rise in revolt they cannot attack abstract constitution or lead an army against proclamations and statutes civil disobedience has to be directed against salt tax or land tax or some other particular point not that that is our final end but for time being it is our aim and we must shoot straight gandhi felt that this protest would dramatise purna swaraj in a way that was meaningful to every indian he also reasoned that it would build unity between hindus and muslims by fighting a wrong that touched them equally after protest gathered steam leaders realised power of salt as a symbol nehru remarked about unprecedented popular response it seemed as though a spring had been suddenly released satyagraha gandhi had a long standing commitment to nonviolent civil disobedience which he termed satyagraha as basis for achieving indian sovereignty and self rule gandhi s ideas about satyagraha and swaraj moreover galvanised thinking of congress cadres most of whom by 1930 were committed to pursuing sovereignty and self rule by nonviolent means ackerman p 108 dalton pp 9 10 referring to relationship between satyagraha and purna swaraj gandhi saw an inviolable connection between means and end as there is between seed and tree hind swaraj gandhi and dalton p 15 he wrote if means employed are impure change will not be in direction of progress but very likely in opposite only a change brought about in our political condition by pure means can lead to real progress forward to volume of gokhale s speeches gopal krishna from johnson p 118 satyagraha is a synthesis of sanskrit words satya truth and agraha insistence on for gandhi satyagraha went far beyond mere passive resistance and became strength in practising nonviolent methods in his words truth satya implies love and firmness agraha engenders and therefore serves as a synonym for force i thus began to call indian movement satyagraha that is to say force which is born of truth and love or nonviolence and gave up use of phrase passive resistance in connection with it so much so that even in english writing we often avoided it and used instead word satyagraha satyagraha in south africa 1926 from johnson p 73 his first significant attempt in india at leading mass satyagraha was non cooperation movement from 1920 to 1922 even though it succeeded in raising millions of indians in protest against british created rowlatt acts violence broke out at chauri chaura where a mob killed 22 unarmed policemen gandhi suspended protest against opposition of other congress members he decided that indians were not yet ready for successful nonviolent resistance dalton p 48 bardoli satyagraha in 1928 was much more successful it succeeded in paralysing british government and winning significant concessions more importantly due to extensive press coverage it scored a propaganda victory out of all proportion to its size dalton p 93 gandhi later claimed that success at bardoli confirmed his belief in satyagraha and swaraj it is only gradually that we shall come to know importance of victory gained at bardoli bardoli has shown way and cleared it swaraj lies on that route and that alone is cure collected works of mahatma gandhi 41 208 p 94 gandhi recruited heavily from bardoli satyagraha participants for dandi march which passed through many of same villages that took part in bardoli protests dalton p 95 this revolt gained momentum and had support from all parts of india preparing to march thumb right upright 1 15 gandhi on salt march on 5 february newspapers reported that gandhi would begin civil disobedience by defying salt laws salt satyagraha would begin on 12 march and end in dandi with gandhi breaking salt act on 6 april gandhi chose 6 april to launch mass breaking of salt laws for a symbolic reason it was first day of national week begun in 1919 when gandhi conceived of national hartal strike against rowlatt act dalton p 113 gandhi prepared worldwide media for march by issuing regular statements from sabarmati at his regular prayer meetings and through direct contact with press expectations were heightened by his repeated statements anticipating arrest and his increasingly dramatic language as hour approached we are entering upon a life and death struggle a holy war we are performing an all embracing sacrifice in which we wish to offer ourselves as oblation dalton p 108 correspondents from dozens of indian european and american newspapers along with film companies responded to drama and began covering event dalton p 107 for march itself gandhi wanted strictest discipline and adherence to satyagraha and ahimsa for that reason he recruited marchers not from congress party members but from residents of his own ashram who were trained in gandhi s strict standards of discipline dalton p 104 24 day march would pass through 4 districts and 48 villages route of march along with each evening s stopping place was planned based on recruitment potential past contacts and timing gandhi sent scouts to each village ahead of march so he could plan his talks at each resting place based on needs of local residents dalton p 105 events at each village were scheduled and publicised in indian and foreign press ackerman p 85 on 2 march 1930 gandhi wrote to viceroy lord irwin offering to stop march if irwin met eleven demands including reduction of land revenue assessments cutting military spending imposing a tariff on foreign cloth and abolishing salt tax his strongest appeal to irwin regarded salt tax if my letter makes no appeal to your heart on eleventh day of this month i shall proceed with such co workers of ashram as i can take to disregard provisions of salt laws i regard this tax to be most iniquitous of all from poor man s standpoint as sovereignty and self rule movement is essentially for poorest in land beginning will be made with this evil gandhi s letter to irwin gandhi and dalton p 78 as mentioned earlier viceroy held any prospect of a salt protest in disdain after he ignored letter and refused to meet with gandhi march was set in motion gandhi remarked on bended knees i asked for bread and i have received stone instead eve of march brought thousands of indians to sabarmati to hear gandhi speak at regular evening prayer an american academic writing for nation reported that 60 000 persons gathered on bank of river to hear gandhi s call to arms this call to arms was perhaps most remarkable call to war that has ever been made miller herbert a 23 april 1930 gandhi s campaign begins nation dalton p 107 march to dandi thumb original footage of gandhi and his followers marching to dandi in salt satyagraha on 12 march 1930 gandhi and 80 satyagrahis many of whom were from scheduled castes set out on foot for coastal village of dandi gujarat over from their starting point at sabarmati ashram salt march was also called white flowing river because all people were joining procession wearing white khadi according to statesman official government newspaper which usually played down size of crowds at gandhi s functions 100 000 people crowded road that separated sabarmati from weber p 140 statesman 13 march 1930 first day s march of ended in village of aslali where gandhi spoke to a crowd of about 4 000 at aslali and other villages that march passed through volunteers collected donations registered new satyagrahis and received resignations from village officials who chose to end co operation with british rule weber pp 143 144 as they entered each village crowds greeted marchers beating drums and cymbals gandhi gave speeches attacking salt tax as inhuman and salt satyagraha as a poor man s struggle each night they slept in open only thing that was asked of villagers was food and water to wash with gandhi felt that this would bring poor into struggle for sovereignty and self rule necessary for eventual victory ackerman p 86 thousands of satyagrahis and leaders like sarojini naidu joined him every day more and more people joined march until procession of marchers became at least two miles long to keep up their spirits marchers used to sing hindu bhajan raghava raja ram while walking at surat they were greeted by 30 000 people when they reached railhead at dandi more than 50 000 were gathered gandhi gave interviews and wrote articles along way foreign journalists and three bombay cinema companies shooting newsreel footage turned gandhi into a household name in europe and america at end of 1930 time magazine made him man of year new york times wrote almost daily about salt march including two front page articles on 6 and 7 april dalton p 221 near end of march gandhi declared i want world sympathy in this battle of right against might collected works of mahatma gandhi 43 180 wolpert p 148 upon arriving at seashore on 5 april gandhi was interviewed by an associated press reporter he stated i cannot withhold my compliments from government for policy of complete non interference adopted by them throughout march i wish i could believe this non interference was due to any real change of heart or policy wanton disregard shown by them to popular feeling in legislative assembly and their high handed action leave no room for doubt that policy of heartless exploitation of india is to be persisted in at any cost and so only interpretation i can put upon this non interference is that british government powerful though it is is sensitive to world opinion which will not tolerate repression of extreme political agitation which civil disobedience undoubtedly is so long as disobedience remains civil and therefore necessarily non violent it remains to be seen whether government will tolerate as they have tolerated march actual breach of salt laws by countless people from tomorrow jack pp 238 239 following morning after a prayer gandhi raised a lump of salty mud and declared with this i am shaking foundations of british empire he then boiled it in seawater producing illegal salt he implored his thousands of followers to likewise begin making salt along seashore wherever it is convenient and to instruct villagers in making illegal but necessary salt jack p 240 first 80 marchers 79 marchers accompanied gandhi on his march most of them were between ages of 20 and 30 these men hailed from almost all parts of country march gathered more people as it gained momentum but following list of names were first 79 marchers who were with gandhi from beginning of dandi march until end most of

illegally all over coast of india a pinch of salt made by gandhi himself sold for 1 600 rupees equivalent to 750 at time in reaction british government arrested over sixty thousand people by end of month what had begun as a salt satyagraha quickly grew into a mass satyagraha salt satyagraha in meantime grew almost spontaneously into a mass satyagraha habib p 57 british cloth and goods were boycotted unpopular forest laws were defied in maharashtra karnataka and central provinces gujarati peasants refused to pay tax under threat of losing their crops and land in midnapore bengalis took part by refusing to pay tax habib p 57 british responded with more laws including censorship of correspondence and declaring congress and its associate organisations illegal none of those measures slowed civil disobedience movement correspondence came under censorship congress and its associate organizations were declared illegal and their funds made subject to seizure these measures did not appear to have any effect on movement habib p 57 there were outbreaks of violence in calcutta now spelled kolkata karachi and gujarat unlike his suspension of satyagraha after violence broke out during non co operation movement this time gandhi was unmoved appealing for violence to end at same time gandhi honoured those killed in chittagong and congratulated their parents for finished sacrifices of their sons a warrior s death is never a matter for sorrow wolpert p 149 during first phase of civil disobedience movement from 1929 to 1931 there was a labour government in power in britain beatings at dharasana shootings at peshawar floggings and hangings at solapur mass arrests and much else were all presided over by a labour prime minister ramsay macdonald and his secretary of state william wedgwood benn government was also complicit in a sustained attack on trade unionism in india an attack that sarkar has described as a massive capitalist and government counter offensive against workers rights qissa bazaar massacre thumb upright khan abdul ghaffar khan with mahatma gandhi in peshawar satyagraha was led by a muslim pashto disciple of gandhi ghaffar khan who had trained 50 000 nonviolent activists called khudai khidmatgar habib p 55 on 23 april 1930 ghaffar khan was arrested a crowd of khudai khidmatgar gathered in peshawar s qissa kahani storytellers bazaar british

in nonviolence willingly facing bullets as troops fired on them one british indian army soldier chandra singh garhwali and troops of renowned royal garhwal rifles refused to fire at crowds entire platoon was arrested and many received heavy penalties including life imprisonment vedaranyam salt march thumb left c rajagopalachari leading march while gandhi marched along india s west coast his close associate c rajagopalachari who would later become sovereign india s first governor general organized vedaranyam salt march in parallel on east coast his group started from tiruchirappalli in madras presidency now part of tamil nadu to coastal village of vedaranyam after making illegal salt there he too was arrested by british women in civil disobedience civil disobedience in 1930 marked first time women became mass participants in struggle for freedom thousands of women from large cities to small villages became active participants in satyagraha gandhi had asked that only men take part in salt march but eventually women began manufacturing and selling salt throughout india it was clear that though only men were allowed within march that both men and women were expected to forward work that would help dissolve salt laws usha mehta an early gandhian activist remarked that even our old aunts and great aunts and grandmothers used to bring pitchers of salt water to their houses and manufacture illegal salt and then they would shout at top of their voices we have broken salt law growing number of women in fight for sovereignty and self rule was a new and serious feature according to lord irwin a government report on involvement of women stated thousands of them emerged from seclusion of their homes in order to join congress demonstrations and assist in picketing and their presence on these occasions made work police was required to perform particularly unpleasant johnson p 33 though women did become involved in march it was clear that gandhi saw women as still playing a secondary role within movement but created beginning of a push for women to be more involved in future sarojini naidu was among most visible leaders male or female of pre independent india as president of indian national congress and first woman governor of free india she was a fervent advocate for india avidly mobilizing support for indian independence movement she was also first woman to be arrested in salt march impact british documents show that british government was shaken by satyagraha nonviolent protest left british confused about whether or not to jail gandhi john court curry a british police officer stationed in india wrote in his memoirs that he felt nausea every time he dealt with congress demonstrations in 1930 curry and others in british government including wedgwood benn secretary of state for india preferred fighting violent rather than nonviolent opponents dharasana satyagraha and aftermath gandhi himself avoided further active involvement after march though he stayed in close contact with developments throughout india he created a temporary ashram near dandi from there he urged women followers in bombay now spelled mumbai to picket liquor shops and foreign cloth he said that a bonfire should be made of foreign cloth schools and colleges should become empty for his next major action gandhi decided on a raid of dharasana salt works in gujarat south of dandi he wrote to lord irwin again telling him of his plans around midnight of 4 may as gandhi was sleeping on a cot in a mango grove district magistrate of surat drove up with two indian officers and thirty heavily armed constables jack pp 244 245 he was arrested under an 1827 regulation calling for jailing of people engaged in unlawful activities and held without trial near poona now pune dharasana satyagraha went ahead as planned with abbas a seventy six year old retired judge leading march with gandhi s wife at his side both were arrested before reaching dharasana and sentenced to three months in prison after their arrests march continued under leadership of sarojini naidu a woman poet and freedom fighter who warned satyagrahis you must not use any violence under any circumstances you will be beaten but you must not resist you must not even raise a hand to ward off blows soldiers began clubbing satyagrahis with steel tipped lathis in an incident that attracted international attention ackerman pp 87 90 united press correspondent webb miller reported that not one of marchers even raised an arm to fend off blows they went down like ten pins from where i stood i heard sickening whacks of clubs on unprotected skulls waiting crowd of watchers groaned and sucked in their breaths in sympathetic pain at every blow those struck down fell sprawling unconscious or writhing in pain with fractured skulls or broken shoulders in two or three minutes ground was quilted with bodies great patches of blood widened on their white clothes survivors without breaking ranks silently and doggedly marched on until struck down finally police became enraged by non resistance they commenced savagely kicking seated men in abdomen and testicles injured men writhed and in agony which seemed to inflame fury of police police then began dragging sitting men by arms or feet sometimes for a hundred yards and throwing them into ditches webb miller s report from may 21 martin p 38 patel former speaker of assembly watched beatings and remarked all hope of reconciling india with british empire is lost forever wolpert p 155 miller s first attempts at telegraphing story to his publisher in england were censored by british telegraph operators in india only after threatening to expose british censorship was his story allowed to pass story appeared in 1 350 newspapers throughout world and was read into official record of united states senate by senator john j blaine salt satyagraha succeeded in drawing attention of world millions saw newsreels showing march time declared gandhi its 1930 man of year comparing gandhi s march to sea to defy britain s salt tax as some new englanders once defied a british tea tax civil disobedience continued until early 1931 when gandhi was finally released from prison to hold talks with irwin it was first time two held talks on equal terms gandhi and dalton p 73 and resulted in gandhi irwin pact talks would lead to second round table conference at end of 1931 long term effect thumb upright 1 6 a 2005 stamp sheet of india dedicated to salt march salt satyagraha produced scant progress toward dominion status or self rule for india and did not win any major concessions from british ackerman p 106 made scant progress toward either dominion status within empire or outright sovereignty and self rule neither had they won any major concessions on economic and mundane issues that gandhi considered vital it also failed to attract muslim support dalton p 119 120 congress leaders decided to end satyagraha as official policy in 1934 nehru and other congress members drifted further apart from gandhi who withdrew from congress to concentrate on his constructive programme which included his efforts to end untouchability in harijan movement johnson p 36 even though british authorities were again in control by mid 1930s indian british and world opinion increasingly began to recognise legitimacy of claims by gandhi and congress party for sovereignty and self rule indian british and world opinion increasingly recognized legitimate claims of gandhi and congress for indian independence johnson p 37 satyagraha campaign of 1930s also forced british to recognise that their control of india depended entirely on consent of indians salt satyagraha was a significant step in british losing that consent ackerman p 109 old order in which british control rested comfortably on indian acquiescence had been sundered in midst of civil disobedience sir charles innes a provincial governor circulated his analysis of events to his colleagues england can hold india only by consent he conceded we can t rule it by sword british lost that consent nehru considered salt satyagraha high water mark of his association with gandhi and felt that its lasting importance was in changing attitudes of indians of course these movements exercised tremendous pressure on british government and shook government machinery but real importance to my mind lay in effect they had on our own people and especially village masses non cooperation dragged them out of mire and gave them self respect and self reliance they acted courageously and did not submit so easily to unjust oppression their outlook widened and they began to think a little in terms of india as a whole it was a remarkable transformation and congress under gandhi s leadership must have credit for it johnson p 37 more than thirty years later satyagraha and march to dandi exercised a strong influence on american civil rights activist martin luther king jr and his fight for civil rights for blacks in 1960s like most people i had heard of gandhi but i had never studied him seriously as i read i became deeply fascinated by his campaigns of nonviolent resistance i was particularly moved by his salt march to sea and his numerous fasts whole concept of satyagraha satya is truth which equals love and agraha is force satyagraha therefore means truth force or love force was profoundly significant to me as i delved deeper into philosophy of gandhi my skepticism concerning power of love gradually diminished and i came to see for first time its potency in area of social reform re enactment in 2005 to commemorate great salt march mahatma gandhi foundation re enacted salt march on its 75th anniversary in its exact historical schedule and route followed by mahatma and his band of 80 marchers event was known as international walk for justice and freedom what started as a personal pilgrimage for mahatma gandhi s great grandson tushar gandhi turned into an international event with 900 registered participants from 9 nations and on a daily basis numbers swelled to a couple of thousands there was extensive reportage in international media start of march on 12 march 2005 in ahmedabad was attended by sonia gandhi chairperson of united progressive alliance as well as several indian cabinet ministers many of whom joined march at different locations along route and walked part of way participants halted at dandi on night of 5 april with commemoration ending on 7 april at finale in dandi
