story follows mario as he pursues koopa king bowser into outer space where he has imprisoned princess peach and taken control of universe using power stars and grand stars mario must travel across various galaxies to recover power stars in order to travel to center of universe and rescue princess peach game was originally planned as an updated version of super mario galaxy this version would have been called super mario galaxy more it was later decided that game was to be developed as a fleshed out sequel when development staff continued to build upon game with dozens of new ideas and so development time expanded to two and a half years among additions are dynamic environments new power ups and ability to ride yoshi upon release super mario galaxy 2 was met with widespread critical acclaim and is regarded by many to be one of greatest video games of all time as well as one of highest rated video games on review aggregator websites it is one of best selling games on wii with over seven million copies sold worldwide gameplay gameplay of super mario galaxy 2 is similar to super mario galaxy with a focus on platforming based on and around 3d planets referred to in game as galaxies with varying themes sizes landscapes and climates player controls mario or later in game his brother luigi though using him is optional who has special abilities such as spin attack long jump wall jumps and a variety of somersaults as in original objective of game is to travel to various galaxies and collect power stars which are awarded by completing levels and accomplishing tasks and are used to gain access to later levels game retains some gameplay mechanics introduced in original such as blue star pointer that allows player to collect star bits and shoot them at enemies levels that restrict movement to a 2d plane balance ball levels and gravity reversing background arrows setting and level design game provides player access to game s galaxies through means of a map system similar to that in previous mario games such as super mario world and new super mario bros wii this is navigated via a mobile planet called starship mario that serves as a hub world which can be visited anytime and is expanded when new abilities or levels are unlocked game contains forty nine galaxies allotted among seven different regions in universe called worlds general difficulty progressively increasing in each world first six worlds end with a boss level in which object is to defeat bowser or bowser jr former being in even numbered worlds and latter being in odd numbered worlds which then allows player to access next world when player collects all 120 power stars 120 green star levels are unlocked these levels containing green stars that are hidden or placed in hard to reach areas require intense exploration and precision and may cause instant death if player fails super mario galaxy 2 contains 242 unique power stars to collect overall most of levels in super mario galaxy 2 offer a unique task based around its theme and many focus on dynamic environments that change or alternate between various states for example some environments change to beat of background music such as sudden shifts in direction of gravity or appearance or disappearance of platforms and others feature a special switch that temporarily slows down time prankster comets which were featured in original game and cause variation and tougher challenges in levels no longer appear randomly in visited galaxies but instead require collection of a comet medal in that galaxy in order for it to appear in addition prankster comets have become more general and offer any number of variations while super mario galaxy offered only five mutually exclusive variations prankster comets in super mario galaxy 2 range to any number of challenges that often mix or overlap these include destroying all enemies collecting 100 purple coins completing level within a time limit completing level with only one maximum health unit or avoiding cosmic clones doppelgangers of mario that imitate player s actions as a result both dynamic environments and prankster comets often create challenges with puzzle elements requiring precision and strategy in order to overcome them power ups right thumb cloud mario is one of new power ups in game mario is using power up creating temporary platforms in midair to get to out of reach places all original transformations in super mario galaxy return except for ice mario and flying mario along with some new power ups and items these include spin drill which allows player to burrow through planets and emerge out other side rock mario which allows player to smash through obstacles such as boulders and enemies and cloud mario which allows player to create temporary platforms in midair mario is able to ride dinosaur yoshi in certain levels when riding yoshi player s blue star pointer is replaced by a red dot which allows player to point at various objects and manipulate them with yoshi s tongue yoshi can also use his tongue to swing across gaps pull levers and swallow enemies with option to spit them back out as projectiles in addition yoshi allows player to double jump there are also three different power up fruits available for yoshi to eat that grant him temporary abilities these are dash pepper blimp fruit and bulb berry dash pepper allows yoshi to run quickly giving him ability to run up walls and run on water blimp fruit allows yoshi to float in air and bulb berry allows yoshi to reveal secret pathways if player takes damage while riding yoshi player will fall off and yoshi will run away until player gets back on him if player does not get back on yoshi will retreat into his egg guides and multiplayer because of game s increased difficulty over original super mario galaxy 2 offers some features that assist inexperienced or frustrated players most notable is cosmic guide similar to new super mario bros wii s super guide feature who takes form of rosalina cosmic guide appears if player has failed during a particular level a certain number of times and allows player to give computer control over mario to complete level drawback is that player is awarded a bronze star requiring player to complete level without using cosmic guide to earn a golden power star there are also monitors called hint tvs that will demonstrate how to perform a specific move or optimal ways of using a power up multiplayer gameplay has also been expanded upon over original in super mario galaxy another player could use a second wii remote to control a second star pointer and assist mario by grabbing enemies or collecting and shooting star bits in super mario galaxy 2 second player now controls an orange luma who retains all original abilities but can also physically attack enemies and collect items power ups and 1 ups making player s involvement more useful story princess peach invites mario to share cake at star festival a time when star bits rain down from skies over mushroom kingdom on his way mario finds a lost baby luma who immediately befriends him and grants him ability to spin shortly thereafter mario s nemesis bowser who has grown to an immense size after swallowing grand stars attacks princess peach s castle kidnapping princess bowser escapes into outer space to recreate his empire at center of universe after launching into outer space mario is given control of starship mario a mobile planetoid in shape of his head made by a crafty luma mechanic called lubba powered by power stars and piloted by other lumas his mission is to fly across universe in pursuit of bowser and princess along way mario meets new lumas and joins up with his companion yoshi toad brigade from original super mario galaxy and his brother luigi upon collecting enough power stars mario reaches bowser s giant starship fortress draining energy from what appears to be a comet mario infiltrates starship and defeats bowser retrieving last grand star rosalina and her comet observatory from first super mario galaxy appear before mario and peach rosalina thanks mario for watching over baby luma that he had found and baby luma returns to comet observatory taking mario s hat with him mario and his friends return to mushroom kingdom and celebrate their victory game ends with starship mario sitting above princess peach s castle with comet observatory streaking across sky development after nintendo finished super mario galaxy shigeru miyamoto approached development team and suggested that a follow up be produced game was originally planned to just do variations on original game s planets and call game super mario galaxy more and was dubbed super mario galaxy 1 5 during early development with a projected development time of approximately a year first elements that were implemented were anything that was scrapped from original game either to ensure game balance or simply because of time constraints such as yoshi and concept of a planet shaped like mario s head over time more and more new elements and ideas were brought into game and it was decided that game would be a fleshed out sequel rather than a slightly modified follow up thus development took two and a half years takeshi hayakawa lead programmer for super mario galaxy 2 created a development tool that allowed different staff members including visual and sound designers to easily design and create stages without waiting for programmers many of which were incorporated into final game in order to help distinguish super mario galaxy 2 from its predecessor staff originally wanted whole game to revolve around concept of switching in which game s environments would dramatically change under certain conditions this concept ended up being particularly difficult to implement full scale so was relegated to only certain levels another idea that came up early on were cameo inclusions by other nintendo characters specifically donkey kong and pikmin idea however was nixed by miyamoto who stated that pikmin characters wouldn t work within mario universe and that there was no reason for other such cameos game tutorials were confined to an optional system called tip network in order to benefit players already familiar with original game miyamoto compared super mario galaxy 2 to legend of zelda majora s mask in that both games use same engines as their predecessors yet build upon their foundations game was revealed at electronic entertainment expo 2009 on june 2 in miyamoto s private conference it was stated that game was very far along in development but its release was held back to mid 2010 because of new super mario bros wiis release in late 2009 miyamoto also stated that game has 95 99 new features with rest being previous features introduced in super mario galaxy with regard to original game nintendo of america president and ceo reggie fils aime stated in an interview that sequel would be more challenging and miyamoto said in a wired interview that game would have less focus on plot miyamoto initially hinted that game might utilize super guide feature introduced in new super mario bros wii into game and this was confirmed by nintendo s senior manager of product managing bill who claimed that feature was implemented differently compared to what new super mario bros wii offered feature is called cosmic guide where cosmic spirit rosalina takes control of mario game made its playable debut at nintendo media summit 2010 on february 24 2010 when a second trailer for game was released and its north american release date on may 23 2010 was finally announced japanese european and australian versions of game came packaged with an instructional dvd manual explaining basic controls as well as showing advanced play voice actors from super mario galaxy reprise their roles for its sequel including additional voices by dex manley who played lubba in january 2015 late nintendo president satoru iwata announced at nintendo direct presentation that super mario galaxy 2 alongside other wii games such as punch out and metroid prime trilogy would be re released for download on wii u s nintendo eshop it was released on january 14 2015 music as with original super mario galaxy super mario galaxy 2 features a musical score written for and performed by a symphony orchestra known as mario galaxy orchestra in credits super mario galaxy 2 staff roll early in development process when concept of super mario galaxy 1 5 was being considered there were no plans to use different music from first super mario galaxy however as game evolved sound team headed by mahito yokota realized they needed new music that fit with new gameplay mechanics that were being added although they were hesitant to use a symphony orchestra again because of recording difficulties general producer shigeru miyamoto gave permission immediately according to yokota miyamoto felt that players would be expecting an orchestral soundtrack miyamoto also apparently suggested that players would want to hear arrangements from super mario galaxy which is why soundtrack is a mixture of brand new pieces and arrangements of themes from original galaxy as well as many past installments in mario series such as super mario world and super mario 64 ryo who worked previously on mario kart wii wii sports resort and new super mario bros wii contributed nine pieces to soundtrack koji kondo recruited sixty musicians for orchestra ten more than number of musicians used for original game s score with an additional ten musicians providing a big band style of music with trumpets trombones saxophones and drums for a grand total of seventy players orchestral performances were conducted by renowned for his work with super smash bros concert in 2002 while kondo served as a supervisor while also contributing five pieces to soundtrack soundtrack was available as a 2 disc set to japanese club nintendo members reception and legacy reviews like its predecessor super mario galaxy 2 received universal acclaim from major video game critics with numerous reviews praising game for its creativity and technical improvements over original most reviewers agreed that game either lived up to or surpassed original super mario galaxy it has an average critic score of 97 at gamerankings and 97 100 at metacritic making it one of highest rated games on sites tom mcshea from gamespot called it a new standard for platformers giving it a perfect 10 0 making it seventh game in site s history to earn that score other perfect scores came from edge stating this isn t a game that redefines genre this is one that rolls it up and locks it away and ign s craig harris who felt that game perfectly captures that classic videogame charm reason why most of us got into gaming from start ign later placed super mario galaxy 2 4th on their top modern games list ign also listed super mario galaxy 2 as greatest wii game of all time escapist editor susan arendt echoed this view by stating it doesn t tinker with established formula very much but we didn t really want it to while gametrailers commented that there s something tremendous for just about everyone and games that we can truly recommend to almost everyone are rare ryan scott at gamespy regards it a much better game than first super mario galaxy stating for a series that s explored every conceivable angle of its genre mario games keep coming up with ways to challenge our notions of what a platformer can and should do giant bomb s ryan davis particularly praised improved level designs commenting that designers were bolder and more willing to take some weird risks with planetoids and abstract platforming that set tone in original galaxy while chris kohler from wired commented that level concepts alone could be made into full games on their own additionally 1up com s justin haywald noted expanded soundtrack as sweeping gamesradar praised graphics saying that despite wii s technical limitations galaxy 2 understands how to get most out of aging technology that nearly all graphical flaws are smoothed over or covered up leaving you with wii s best looking title to date x play editor andrew awarded super mario galaxy 2 a 5 5 calling it culmination of 20 years of mario gaming into one fantastically designed and creative platformer despite this praise some critics raised complaints over increased difficulty and game s similarity to original super mario galaxy chris scullion from official nintendo magazine called it new best game on wii but said it lacked original s impact though they admitted extreme difficulty of this due to quality of original game informer editor matt helgeson was concerned with some of challenges being potentially frustrating particularly towards end of game similarly ben from gamepro remarked that increased difficulty and high proficiency requirement may turn new fans off however editor chris praised game s difficulty stating perhaps most positively of all there are very few sequences where death will feel like a result of bad design instead of player error which helps keep frustration down sales in japan super mario galaxy 2 sold 143 000 copies on its first day of release and 340 000 copies in its first week about 90 000 more
