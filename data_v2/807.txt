thumb right henry viii of england who devised statute as a way of alleviating his financial problems statute of uses 27 hen 8 c 10 was an act of parliament of england that restricted application of uses in english property law statute was originally conceived by henry viii of england as a way to rectify his financial problems by simplifying law of uses which moved land outside royal tax revenue traditionally gathered through seisin his initial efforts which would remove uses almost completely were stymied at 1529 parliament by members of house of commons many of whom were landowners who would lose money and lawyers who benefited in fees from confusing law on uses academics disagree on how commons were brought around but an eventual set of bills introduced in 1535 was passed by both lords and commons in 1536 eventual bills invalidated all uses that did not impose an active duty on trustees with beneficiaries of use being held as legal owners of land meaning they had to pay tax statute partially led to pilgrimage of grace and more importantly development of trusts but academics disagree as to its effectiveness while most agree that it was important with eric ives writing that effect which its provisions had upon development of english land law was revolutionary some say that by allowing uses and devises in certain areas it not only failed to remove fraudulent element from land law but actively encouraged it background common law of england did not provide for a way to dispose of land held by feudal tenure through wills only urban land turner 1968 p 198 and instead uses were applied which allowed a landowner to give his land to one or more feoffees to dispose of it or treat it as original landowner provided it was viewed with distrust due to possibility of abuse edward coke wrote that there were two inventors of uses fear and fraud fear in times of troubles and civil wars to save their inheritances from being forfeited and fraud to defeat due debts lawful actions wards escheats etc ives 1967 p 674 with as many as 13 of such feoffees there was much confusion over title to land following a lord s death as evidenced by case of sir john which lasted from 1459 to 1476 turner 1916 p 441 while this was a problem that needed correcting actual motivation of statute was not to do so but instead to bolster finances of henry viii for several years prior to statute henry had been struggling with need to raise revenue his royal lands did not provide enough loans and would have destroyed his personal popularity as a result simply increasing size of his royal lands was best option he turned his attention to land law arguably most well developed and complex parts of common law and sought to reform it to further his aims this was well aimed since it was uses that were destroying his income royal revenue was traditionally gathered through seisin which uses completely ignored holdsworth 1912 p 108 two bills were drawn up to be submitted to parliament in 1529 first which took note of grate and for of tenements and other as well by as by uses and of false evidence was a radical and drastic act bill that would have removed uses completely unless registered at court of king s bench or court of common pleas and abolished entails so that all manner of possessions be in state of fee simple from this day forward for ever although barons and above were allowed entails in addition nobody was allowed to buy such land without king s licence these measures were to obtain support of nobility for second bill which gave king wardship over all land held by noble orphans when orphan came of age and asked for return of lands king was to have a year s revenue from a third of those lands holdsworth 1912 p 110 while this plan was acceptable to barons and other senior nobles it required passing by house of commons large landowners in commons felt that it prohibited them from making secure wills while lawyers saw it as stripping valuable business away from them by simplifying such cases with these groups making up majority of parliament these plans came to nothing holdsworth 1912 p 111 parliament of 1532 saw another attempt by henry to push bill through but it again met resistance while support of nobility was valuable it was useless in commons henry instead sought to appeal to one of two opposition groups and picked lawyers many lawyers admitted that uses made fraud easy and open and in addition lawyers of common law were jealous of court of chancery s equitable jurisdiction and sought to strip it away holdsworth 1912 p 112 as a result henry decided to bring them over to his side by frightening them listening to a petition against court procedure and lawyers fees and openly musing about putting a clause in draft bills that would fix amount they could charge holdsworth argues that this was reason lawyers chose to ally with henry and reason for statute s passage holdsworth 1912 p 113 john bean disagrees arguing first that many lawyers were landowners and would have lost more personally than any reduction in fees could have produced and second that even if they had been convinced it is unlikely that lawyers made up a majority of commons and could have pushed a bill through alone bean 1968 p 272 passage and text of statute in 1535 three draft bills were presented to parliament concerning uses and wills along with one concerning enrolments holdsworth 1912 p 114 it is from these bills that statute of uses and succeeding statute of enrolments came holdsworth 1912 p 115 three bills on uses suggested two different ways to deal with problem first proposed severely limiting situation in which uses could arise with uses having no legal effect apart from that expressed when they were created no contract or bargain over land could change use of that land anyone who suffered from breach of such a contract had limited remedies in courts while this scheme would have prevented most of evils of uses it would also have submitted property law to common law and limited other beneficial developments it would also not stop practice of getting rid of land through a devise doing nothing to alleviate king s financial concerns holdsworth 1912 p 116 second and more complex suggestion was contained in other two bills on uses this simply removed idea of an equitable interest in land leaving only idea of a legal interest and left uses maintaining elastic and variable nature of property law rather than submitting it to more rigid standards of common law holdsworth 1912 p 118 parliament eventually accepted second idea and bill was passed in april 1536 as statute of uses 27 hen 8 c 10 ives 1967 p 675 as such all uses were invalid except for those that imposed an active duty on a trustee 2008 p 87 and beneficiaries of use were held to be legal owners paying tax as a result gough 1985 p 25 statute of uses also provided that a widow was not to have both jointure and dower as was made possible by statute impact and aftermath most immediately statute partially led to pilgrimage of grace where rebels demanded not only an end to henry s religious changes but an abandonment of statute ives 1967 p 679 more importantly statute led to development of trust as a replacement durfee 1918 p 87 while statute is believed to have led to abolition of devises and this was certainly king s intent robert megarry argues that it failed in doing so megarry 1941 p 354 a feoffment to use of such person and persons and of such estate and estates as i shall appoint by my will produced a use without formally creating a legal estate land was held on a lease rather than freehold mossman 2004 p 313 as a result it was unaffected by statute of uses which banned all other methods megarry 1941 p 356 because of this megarry argues that not only did it keep devises intact it gave it power in common law as well as under equity megarry 1941 p 360 precise aims of statute that law of property be made more open was reversed by its impact which made it far easier to convey property secretly digby 2005 p 347 academic assessment of statute was initially disparaging with some saying that it added at most three words to a conveyance but it was understood to be important by lawyers of time and in modern era decades later both francis bacon and edward coke gave readings on it while william holdsworth called it perhaps most important addition that legislature has ever made to our private law with eric ives writing that importance of statute of uses is beyond doubt effect its provisions had on english land law development was revolutionary and from it have grown crucial doctrines of trust ives 1967 p 673 repeal whole act was declared by section 1 of and schedule 1 to law of property amendment act 1924 to have been repealed by law of property act 1922 whole act was repealed by section 207 of and schedule 7 to law of property act 1925 repeal of statutes of uses did not affect operation thereof in
