mars reconnaissance orbiter mro is a multipurpose spacecraft designed to conduct reconnaissance and exploration of mars from orbit spacecraft was built by lockheed martin under supervision of jet propulsion laboratory jpl mission is managed by california institute of technology at jpl in pasadena california for nasa science mission directorate washington d c it was launched august 12 2005 and attained martian orbit on march 10 2006 in november 2006 after five months of aerobraking it entered its final science orbit and began its primary science phase mro contains a host of scientific instruments such as cameras spectrometers and radar which are used to analyze landforms stratigraphy minerals and ice of mars it paves way for future spacecraft by monitoring mars daily weather and surface conditions studying potential landing sites and hosting a new telecommunications system mro s telecommunications system will transfer more data back to earth than all previous interplanetary missions combined and mro will serve as a highly capable relay satellite for future missions it has enough propellant to keep functioning into 2030s pre launch thumb diagram of instrumentation aboard mro one of two missions considered for 2003 mars launch window mro proposal lost against what became known as mars exploration rovers orbiter mission was rescheduled for launch in 2005 and nasa announced its final name mars reconnaissance orbiter on october 26 2000 mro is modeled after nasa s highly successful mars global surveyor to conduct surveillance of mars from orbit early specifications of satellite included a large camera to take high resolution pictures of mars in this regard james b garvin mars exploration program scientist for nasa proclaimed that mro would be a microscope in orbit satellite was also to include a visible near infrared spectrograph on october 3 2001 nasa chose lockheed martin as primary contractor for spacecraft s fabrication by end of 2001 all of mission s instruments were selected there were no major setbacks during mro s construction and spacecraft was moved to john f kennedy space center on may 1 2005 to prepare it for launch mission objectives thumb left 250px infographic may 2019 mro science operations were initially scheduled to last two earth years from november 2006 to november 2008 one of mission s main goals is to map martian landscape with its high resolution cameras in order to choose landing sites for future surface missions mro played an important role in choosing landing site of phoenix lander which explored martian arctic in green valley initial site chosen by scientists was imaged with hirise camera and found to be littered with boulders after analysis with hirise and mars odysseys themis instrument a new site was chosen mars science laboratory a highly maneuverable rover also had its landing site inspected mro provided critical navigation data during their landings and acts as a telecommunications relay mro is using its onboard scientific equipment to study martian climate weather atmosphere and geology and to search for signs of liquid water in polar caps and underground in addition mro was tasked with looking for remains of previously lost mars polar lander and beagle 2 spacecraft beagle 2 was found by orbiter at beginning of 2015 after its main science operations are completed probe s extended mission is to be communication and navigation system for landers and rover probes launch and orbital insertion thumb 100px left launch of atlas v carrying mars reconnaissance orbiter 11 43 00

2005 to december 31 2007 on august 12 2005 mro was launched aboard an atlas v 401 rocket from space launch complex 41 at cape canaveral air force station centaur upper stage of rocket completed its burns over a fifty six minute period and placed mro into an interplanetary transfer orbit towards mars mro cruised through interplanetary space for seven and a half months before reaching mars while en route most of scientific instruments and experiments were tested and calibrated to ensure proper orbital insertion upon reaching mars four trajectory correction maneuvers were planned and a fifth emergency maneuver was discussed however only three trajectory correction maneuvers were necessary which saved of fuel that would be usable during mro s extended mission thumb right animation of mars reconnaissance orbiters trajectory around mars from march 10 2006 to september 30 2007 mro began orbital insertion by approaching mars on march 10 2006 and passing above its southern hemisphere at an altitude of all six of mro s main engines burned for 27 minutes to slow probe from helium pressurization tank was colder than expected which reduced pressure in fuel tank by about reduced pressure caused engine thrust to be diminished by 2 but mro automatically compensated by extending burn time by 33 seconds completion of orbital insertion placed orbiter in a highly elliptical polar orbit with a period of approximately 35 5 hours shortly after insertion periapsis point in orbit closest to mars was from surface from planet s center apoapsis point in orbit farthest from mars was from surface from planet s center when mro entered orbit it joined five other active spacecraft that were either in orbit or on planet s surface mars global surveyor mars express 2001 mars odyssey and two mars exploration rovers spirit and opportunity this set a new record for most operational spacecraft in immediate vicinity of mars mars global surveyor and rovers spirit and opportunity have since ceased to function 2001 mars odyssey mars express and mro remain operational and have been joined by maven and trace gas orbiter in orbit and curiosity and insight on surface raising record to seven active spacecraft thumb artwork of mro aerobraking on march 30 2006 mro began process of aerobraking a three step procedure that cuts in half fuel needed to achieve a lower more circular orbit with a shorter period first during its first five orbits of planet one earth week mro used its thrusters to drop periapsis of its orbit into aerobraking altitude this altitude depends on thickness of atmosphere because martian atmospheric density changes with its seasons second while using its thrusters to make minor corrections to its periapsis altitude mro maintained aerobraking altitude for 445 planetary orbits about five earth months to reduce apoapsis of orbit to this was done in such a way so as to not heat spacecraft too much but also dip enough into atmosphere to slow spacecraft down after process was complete mro used its thrusters to move its periapsis out of edge of martian atmosphere on august 30 2006 in september 2006 mro fired its thrusters twice more to fine tune its final nearly circular orbit to approximately above martian surface with a period of about 112 minutes sharad radar antennas were deployed on september 16 all of scientific instruments were tested and most were turned off prior to solar conjunction that occurred from october 7 to november 6 2006 after conjunction ended primary science phase began on november 17 2006 nasa announced successful test of mro as an orbital communications relay using nasa rover spirit as point of origin for transmission mro acted as a relay for transmitting data back to earth timeline thumb tectonic fractures within candor

cost of spacecraft was us 720 million structure is made of mostly carbon composites and aluminum honeycombed plates titanium fuel tank takes up most of volume and mass of spacecraft and provides most of its structural integrity spacecraft s total mass is less than with an unfueled dry mass less than power systems thumb mars reconnaissance orbiter solar panel mro gets all of its electrical power from two solar panels each of which can move independently around two axes up down or left right rotation each solar panel measures and has covered with 3 744 individual photovoltaic cells its high efficiency triple junction solar cells are able to convert more than 26 of sun s energy directly into electricity and are connected together to produce a total output of 32 volts at mars each of panels produces more than 1 000 watts of power in contrast panels would generate 3 000 watts in a comparable earth orbit by being closer to sun mro has two rechargeable nickel hydrogen batteries used to power spacecraft when it is not facing sun each battery has an energy storage capacity of 50 ampere hours 180 kc full range of batteries cannot be used due to voltage constraints on spacecraft but allows operators to extend battery life a valuable capability given that battery drain is one of most common causes of long term satellite failure planners anticipate that only 40 of batteries capacities will be required during lifetime of spacecraft electronic systems mro s main computer is a 133 mhz 10 4 million transistor 32 bit rad750 processor this processor is a radiation hardened version of a powerpc 750 or g3 processor with a specially built motherboard rad750 is a successor to this processor may seem underpowered in comparison to a modern pc processor but it is extremely

memory module consisting of over 700 memory chips each with a 256 mbit capacity this memory capacity is not actually that large considering amount of data to be acquired for example a single image from hirise camera can be as large as 28 gb telecommunications system thumb mro high gain antenna installation telecom subsystem on mro is best digital communication system sent into deep space so far and for first time used capacity approaching turbo codes electra communications package is a uhf software defined radio sdr that provides a flexible platform for evolving relay capabilities it is designed to communicate with other spacecraft as they approach land and operate on mars system consists of a very large antenna which is used to transmit data through deep space network via x band frequencies at 8 ghz and it demonstrates use of at 32 ghz for higher data rates maximum transmission speed from mars is projected to be as high as 6 mbit s a rate ten times higher than previous mars orbiters spacecraft carries two 100 watt x band amplifiers one of which is a backup one 35 watt ka band amplifier and two small deep space transponders two smaller low gain antennas are also present for lower rate communication during emergencies and special events such as launch and mars orbit insertion these antennas do not have focusing dishes and can transmit and receive from any direction they are an important backup system to ensure that mro can always be reached even if its main antenna is pointed away from earth ka band subsystem was used for demonstration purposes due to lack of spectrum at 8 41 ghz x band future high rate deep space missions will use 32 ghz ka band nasa deep space network dsn implemented ka band receiving capabilities at all three of its complexes goldstone canberra and madrid over its 34 m beam waveguide antenna during cruise phase spacecraft ka band telemetry was tracked 36 times by these antennas proving functionality at all antennas ka band tests were also planned during science phase but during aerobraking a switch failed limiting x band high gain antenna to a single amplifier if this amplifier fails all high speed x band communications will be lost ka downlink is only remaining backup for this functionality and since ka band capability of one of sdst transponders has already failed and other might have same problem jpl decided to halt all ka band demonstrations and hold remaining capability in reserve by november 2013 mro had passed 200 terabits in amount of science data returned data returned by mission is more than three times

spacecraft uses a fuel tank filled with of hydrazine fuel pressure is regulated by adding pressurized helium gas from an external tank seventy percent of propellant was used for orbital insertion and it has enough propellant to keep functioning into 2030s mro has twenty rocket engine thrusters on board six large thrusters each produce of thrust for a total of meant mainly for orbital insertion these thrusters were originally designed for mars surveyor 2001 lander six medium thrusters each produce of thrust for trajectory correction maneuvers and attitude control during orbit insertion finally eight small thrusters each produce of thrust for attitude control during normal operations four reaction wheels are also used for precise attitude control during activities requiring a highly stable platform such as high resolution imaging in which even small motions can cause blurring of image each wheel is used for one axis of motion fourth skewed wheel is a backup in case one of other three wheels fails each wheel weighs and can be spun as fast as 100 hz or 6 000 rpm in order to determine spacecraft s orbit and facilitate maneuvers sixteen sun sensors eight primaries and eight backups are placed around spacecraft to calibrate solar direction relative to orbiter s frame two star trackers digital cameras used to map position of catalogued stars provide nasa with full three axis knowledge of spacecraft orientation and attitude a primary and backup miniature inertial measurement unit mimu provided by honeywell measures changes to spacecraft attitude as well as any non gravitationally induced changes to its linear velocity each mimu is a combination of three accelerometers and three ring laser gyroscopes these systems are all critically important to mro as it must be able to point its camera to a very high precision in order to take high quality pictures that mission requires it has also been specifically designed to minimize any vibrations on spacecraft so as to allow its instruments to take images without any distortions caused by vibrations discoveries and photographs water ice in ice cap measured results published in 2009 of radar measurements of north polar ice cap determined that volume of water ice in cap is equal to 30 of earth s greenland ice sheet ice exposed in new craters thumb water ice excavated by an impact crater that formed between january and september 2008 ice was identified spectroscopically using crism an article in journal science in september 2009 reported that some new craters on mars have excavated relatively pure water ice after being exposed ice gradually fades as it sublimates away these new craters were found and dated by ctx camera and identification of ice was confirmed with compact imaging spectrometer crism on board mars reconnaissance orbiter ice was found in a total of five locations three of locations are in cebrenia quadrangle these locations are and two others are in quadrangle and ice in lobate debris aprons thumb lobate debris apron in montes cebrenia quadrangle debris apron is probably mostly ice with a thin covering of rock debris so it could be a source of water for future martian colonists scale bar is radar results from sharad suggested that features termed lobate debris aprons ldas contain large amounts of water ice of interest from days of viking orbiters these are aprons of material surrounding cliffs they have a convex topography and a gentle slope this suggests flow away from steep source cliff in addition lobate debris aprons can show surface lineations just as rock glaciers on earth sharad has provided strong evidence that ldas in hellas planitia are glaciers that are covered with a thin layer of debris i e rocks and dust a strong reflection from top and base of ldas was observed suggesting that pure water ice makes up bulk of formation between two reflections based on experiments of phoenix lander and studies of mars odyssey from orbit water ice is known to exist just under surface of mars in far north and south high latitudes chloride deposits thumb chloride deposits in terra using data from mars global surveyor mars odyssey and mars reconnaissance orbiter scientists have found widespread deposits of chloride minerals evidence suggests that deposits were formed from evaporation of mineral enriched waters research suggests that lakes may have been scattered over large areas of martian surface usually chlorides are last minerals to come out of solution carbonates sulfates and silica should precipitate out ahead of them sulfates and silica have been found by mars rovers on surface places with chloride minerals may have once held various life forms furthermore such areas could preserve traces of ancient life other aqueous minerals in 2009 a group of scientists from crism team reported on 9 to 10 different classes of minerals formed in presence of water different types of clays also called phyllosilicates were found in many locations identified included aluminum smectite iron magnesium smectite kaolinite prehnite and chlorite rocks containing carbonate were found around isidis basin carbonates belong to one class in which life could have developed areas around valles marineris were found to contain hydrated silica and hydrated sulfates researchers identified hydrated sulfates and ferric minerals in terra meridiani and in valles marineris other minerals found on mars were jarosite alunite hematite opal and gypsum two to five of mineral classes were formed with right ph and sufficient water to permit life to grow avalanches mars reconnaissance orbiter ctx and hirise cameras have photographed a number of avalanches off scarps of northern polar cap as they were occurring other spacecraft flowing salty water on august 4 2011 sol nasa announced that mro had detected what appeared to be flowing salty water on surface or subsurface of mars on september 28 2015 this finding was confirmed at a
