making walter and bell appear younger was produced by zoic studios fringes visual effects supervisor jay worth explained guys at zoic had to walk a fine line between too stretched morph effects and something that naturalistically looks younger during filming for brown betty noble described episode in an interview grey matters was a very important episode for walter because it helped to explain to some degree his apparent behavior his eccentricity his obsessiveness his forgetfulness because we found out that he had certain memory parts of his brain removed in a deleted scene set after end of episode walter talks with first patient joseph slater who wonders why he was chosen to have a piece of walter s brain walter responds it was a matter of circumstance as slater shared his blood type
