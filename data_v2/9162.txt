traditional malay literature with favourites including historical texts such as hikayat hang syair siti and hikayat amir likewise read works of arabic persian and hindu literature as a result he had an extensive vocabulary poet laurens koster considers poems included in nyanyi sunyi as having been written between 1933 and 1937 while dutch scholar of indonesian literature a teeuw dates poems to 1936 and 1937 time was one of great emotional turmoil for hamzah who was required to marry daughter of sultan of langkat who had funded his studies in java at time amir had reportedly fallen in love with a javanese woman while studying and was forced to leave her contents njanji sunji consists of twenty four titled pieces and an untitled quatrain indonesian literary documentarian h b jassin

american poet and translator burton raffel translates as a flower floating in a loose knot of hair gave birth to my sorrowful poems poems within collection are untitled poems untitled quatrain sunyi itu duka silence is sorrow titled poems padamu jua for you too perhaps hanya satu only one your games aku but i karena because of your love dikau because of you doa prayer aku i float taman dunia world park terbuka bunga open flowers climb to sky panji banners in my sight dikau praising you gift doa prayer of my ancestors kembali descend again batu belah split stone in darkness my mother before aware subuh morning prayers hari harvest day astana rela palace of resignation form poems in nyanyi sunyi unlike much of amir s earlier work generally did not follow traditional and syair format of four lines of four words teeuw notes that some such batu belah followed traditional european forms such as ballad others were more free form leaning towards prose poetry amir s diction depends heavily on old malay terms which saw little contemporary use he also borrows heavily from other indonesian languages particularly javanese and choice of words was influenced by need for rhythm and metre as well as symbolism related to particular terms ultimately however amir is freer in his language use than traditional poets indonesian critic bakri siregar writes that result is a beautiful wordplay translator john m echols writes that poems are difficult reading even for indonesians while poet chairil anwar described works as obscure poetry which could not be understood by persons without an understanding of islam and malay history indonesian literary scholar muhammad balfas notes that work also has many allusions to religious texts both islamic and christian anwar opined that amir through nyanyi sunyi brought a new style to indonesian language with its compactly violent sharp and yet short sentences in a 1945 article he wrote translation by raffel before amir hamzah one could call old poetry a destructive force but what a bright light he shone on new language themes religion and god are omnipresent throughout collection as evidenced from first poem padamu jua amir often uses word tuhan god however unlike his earlier poems which used it in a similar manner to dewa deity in nyanyi sunyi word is used as understood in abrahamic religions such as amir s own islam amir shows influences from sufism in some cases writes teeuw amir treats god almost as a lover using familiar terms such as you to address him however amir recognises that he cannot be one with god jassin writes that amir seems aware of his own smallness before god acting as a puppet for god s will teeuw notes that amir recognises that he would not exist if god did not this is not to say that amir accepts his lower position in relation to god in several cases jassin writes amir shows a feeling of dissatisfaction over his own lack of power and protests god s absoluteness teeuw likewise notes a sense of dissatisfaction throughout poems writing that amir seems to treat god as an entity that only toys with humans allowing them to be pushed aside and erased elsewhere teeuw writes that amir questions fate and need for him to separate from his love aside from themes of god and religion amir also shows an awareness of his own humanity recognising his own instincts and drives jassin writes that amir s song is song of a man s soul showing sadness and joy which do not acknowledge class or creed teeuw notes a sense of distrust a feeling that having once lost his love there is no reason amir will not lose his next lover indonesian critic zuber usman meanwhile discusses theme of love lost in relation to religion writing that loss of his javanese lover led amir closer to god jassin writes that amir uses sunyi silence as a way to address his worldly problems regarding time his own identity god and love according to jassin by end of compilation physical love has drifted towards a spiritual one with answers supplied originating from supernatural ultimately however jassin concludes that amir s soul has not reached maturity he considers collection s last poem astana rela as but a temporary escape jassin finds that theme of religion is likewise meant as an escape from amir s worldly sorrows an opinion echoed by usman publication nyanyi sunyi was first published in november 1937 issue of poedjangga baroe a literary magazine which amir had helped establish it was later published as a standalone book and by 1949 it had seen its third printing in 1941 amir published another collection of poems entitled buah rindu fruits of longing which consisted mostly of his earlier works jassin notes that works in nyanyi sunyi appear more developed and mature than those in later collection teeuw notes that later collection was more explicitly about romantic love rather than religious love of nyanyi sunyi references explanatory notes footnotes works cited
