siege of porto ferrajo was a french attempt to force surrender of tuscan fortress town of porto ferrajo now on island of elba following french occupation of mainland tuscany in 1801 during french revolutionary wars tuscan garrison was heavily outnumbered but received significant support from british royal navy forces who controlled mediterranean sea and ensured that supplies reached garrison and that french supply convoys were intercepted french began siege with 1 500 men in may 1801 later reinforced to more than 5 000 but could not make an impression on fortress s defences instead seeking to starve defenders into submission with support of a squadron of french navy frigates operating off coast presence of a small british naval squadron in region rendered this plan impractical and additional british reinforcements under rear admiral sir john borlase warren and lieutenant colonel george airey strengthened defenders to point that sallies could be made against french offensive positions french subsequently lost all of frigates sent to blockade port to patrolling british warships in a series of one sided engagements giving british local dominance that allowed them to maintain fortress despite a number of naval actions and one significant land engagement siege dragged on inconclusively for summer and early autumn of 1801 and when first articles of treaty of amiens were signed in october town was still under tuscan control although provisions of final agreement signed in march 1802 granted island to france background in 1800 french first consul napoleon bonaparte advanced into italy achieving victories against austrian empire at battle of marengo after a year of warfare french and austrians signed treaty of luneville on 9 february 1801 which divided northern italy between states and awarded grand duchy of tuscany to french chandler p 258 included in this division was island of elba in ligurian sea off western italian coast which at that time was shared between tuscany and kingdom of naples on 28 march 1801 treaty of florence was signed between naples and france officially turning entirety of elba over to french control although it had not yet been surrendered by its neapolitan and tuscan commanders gardiner p 75 although ligurian sea was by this stage largely french territorial waters after royal navy had destroyed french mediterranean fleet at battle of nile off egypt in 1798 british in fact controlled it and whole mediterranean sea gardiner p 39 by 1801 british bases at gibraltar menorca and malta allowed british naval forces to cruise throughout sea largely unopposed their presence forced remnants of french fleet based at toulon to make short journeys between french bases to avoid interception and capture it was therefore not until a large french squadron under rear admiral honore ganteaume briefly asserted regional naval superiority that a french expeditionary force was able to secure elba woodman p 159 invasion of elba they sailed from piombino on 2 may 1801 with 1 500 men under general jean victor tharreau who landed unopposed at neapolitan town of porto longone clowes p 450 invasion force rapidly spread across island meeting no resistance as entire neapolitan portion and almost all of tuscan region surrendered before them soon all that remained in tuscan hands was fortress port town of porto ferrajo on northern coast this was a powerful defensive position and tuscan commander carlo de fisson rejected tharreau s demands that he surrender presence of two british frigates hms phoenix and hms mermaid off port buttressed de fisson s position james p 95 siege tharreau responded by laying siege to fortress sudden departure of two frigates in face of ganteaume s squadron which bombarded town on 6 may before being forced to retire following outbreak of typhus on board squadron encouraged tharreau musteen p 32 small french frigate badine subsequently blockaded porto ferrajo with intention of starving defenders into surrender three more frigates carrere bravoure and succes under overall command of captain jacques francois ignace bretel soon arrived to augment blockade reinforcements for next three months siege continued with little significant activity on either side until arrival at end of july of general francois watrin with 5 000 additional men and instructions from general joachim murat to prosecute siege more vigorously james p 96 however arrival off porto ferrajo on 1 august of a powerful british squadron under rear admiral sir john borlase warren in hms renown whose ship chased bravoure and succes as far as leghorn and reopened sea passage into port almost immediately frustrated watrin s ambitions at same time a small british force under captain gordon landed at porto ferrajo to augment tuscan garrison then at 14 30 on 3 august three of warren s patrolling frigates phoenix under captain lawrence halsted under captain edward leveson gower and under captain samuel james ballard discovered a sail off western shore of elba and gave chase ship was 38 gun carrere under captain claude pascal morel beaulieu carrying 300 barrels of powder and escorting a convoy of small coastal vessels carrying military supplies from porto to porto longone clowes p 451 although carrere turned away from british pursuit and actively engaged lead ship pomone with her stern chasers cannon mounted in rear of frigate carrere was too laden to escape her opponents after a ten minute chase as pearl cut off route to porto longone and pomone manoeuvered into a firing position captain morel beaulieu surrendered losses on pomone were limited to two killed and four wounded two of whom subsequently died carrere had suffered tolerably severe casualties in engagement from a complement of 352 delay caused by brief chase however had allowed coastal ships to disperse and flee so that all of them avoided capture and some even reached porto longone carrere was a modern ship seized from republic of venice after treaty of campo formio in 1797 royal navy took her into service under her existing name although admiralty retired her from active service within a year although warren departed soon afterwards leaving just a frigate squadron behind siege continued throughout august french forces dominated elba but were unable to make an impression on walls of fortress while royal navy forces controlled access to island by sea providing supplies for defenders and denying them to french halsted and phoenix maintained a blockade of port of piombino on italian mainland ensuring interception of french supplies at end of august watrin learned that phoenix was alone off port and sent a message to leghorn where remainder of french squadron still lay at anchor instructing them to attack isolated british warship succes and bravoure sailed on 31 august and arrived off piombino at 06 30 on 2 september to discover that frigates pomone and under captain george cockburn had joined phoenix halsted had received an intelligence report detailing watrin s demand that french ships sail from leghorn and had summoned reinforcements minerve was closest to arriving french vessels and immediately gave chase cockburn signalling to halsted and leveson gower to join him on sighting british frigates bretel turned back northwards towards leghorn but by 09 00 all three british warships were gaining on his small squadron unable to escape pursuit and with minerve rapidly approaching bretel drove succes ashore at vada beach near in hope of luring minerve away from bravoure but cockburn instead simply fired on grounded vessel in passing before continuing towards remaining ship while bretel surrendered to pomone james p 97 captain louis auguste made desperate attempts to reach leghorn before he was overtaken but a northerly wind drove him back repeatedly and eventually he was forced to drive his frigate ashore under battery south of leghorn harbour waves battered bravoure causing all three masts to fall overboard and ship to become a total wreck small british force under lieutenant william kelly that boarded bravoure was only able to bring off a few prisoners before heavy fire from batteries ashore forced them to quit her kelly ignored his instructions to burn bravoure in order to spare lives of many french sailors still trapped on ship to south british dragged succes off beach french had captured her in february 1801 and after repairs she returned to service in royal navy under her former name of counter attack with french threat by sea eliminated royal navy was free to go on offensive and command of porto ferrajo garrison was placed in hands of lieutenant colonel george airey while warren had returned with his powerful squadron plans were then drawn up for a force of seamen royal marines and tuscan auxiliaries to launch an amphibious operation against french batteries that overlooked mouth of harbour british assembled a landing party of 449 marines and 240 seamen from renown hms gibraltar hms dragon hms alexander hms genereux hms stately pomone pearl and brig hms vincejo all under command of captain george long of vincejo and captain john chambers white of renown approximately 1 000 tuscan troops joined them clowes p 452 landings took place on morning of 14 september troops then moved inland against batteries in two columns while dragon and genereux bombarded a fortified tower at marciana james p 98 attack began well as british destroyed several batteries and took 55 prisoners of war but soon greater french numbers began to tell and landing parties were pushed back to their beachheads in some confusion having lost 32 killed including captain long 61 wounded and 105 missing of which 15 dead 33 wounded and 77 missing were british troops general watrin claimed this as a victory inflating numbers engaged and inaccurately claiming to have caused 1 200 casualties to allies as well as having captured 200 men watrin also claimed to have dismasted a frigate and destroyed several smaller craft with fire from his batteries none of british warships reported any damage although warren departed region soon afterwards with most of his squadron watrin was still unable to make an impression on walls of porto ferrajo and airey held town against french for last few weeks of war until news arrived of ceasefire that accompanied provisional signing of treaty of amiens on 1 october aftermath on 11 october volunteers from maltese light infantry arrived to relieve garrison at porto ferrajo in march 1802 under article xi of final terms of treaty british turned over entire island to french and elba remained in french hands throughout napoleonic wars maltese detachment returned to malta in april
