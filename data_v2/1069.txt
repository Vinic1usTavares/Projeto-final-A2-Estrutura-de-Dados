occupied high ground above fort and nearly surrounded defenses these movements precipitated occupying continental army an under strength force of 3 000 under command of general arthur st clair to withdraw from ticonderoga and surrounding defenses some gunfire was exchanged and there were some casualties but there was no formal siege and no pitched battle burgoyne s army occupied fort ticonderoga and mount independence extensive fortifications on vermont side of lake without opposition on 6 july advance units pursued retreating americans uncontested surrender of ticonderoga caused an uproar in american public and in its military circles as ticonderoga was widely believed to be virtually impregnable and a vital point of defense general st clair and his superior general philip schuyler were vilified by congress both were eventually exonerated in courts martial but their careers were adversely affected schuyler had already lost his command to horatio gates by time of court martial and st clair held no more field commands for remainder of war background in september 1775 early in american revolutionary war american continental army embarked on an invasion of quebec invasion ended in disaster in july 1776 with army chased back to fort ticonderoga by a large british army that arrived in quebec in may 1776 a small continental navy fleet on lake champlain was defeated in october 1776 battle of valcour island delay required by british to build their fleet on lake champlain caused general guy carleton to hold off on attempting an assault on ticonderoga in 1776 although his advance forces came within three miles of ticonderoga lateness of season and difficulty of maintaining supply lines along lake in winter caused him to withdraw his forces back into quebec pancake 1977 pp 34 37 british forces thumb right upright general john burgoyne portrait by joshua reynolds general john burgoyne arrived in quebec in may 1777 and prepared to lead british forces assembled there south with aim of gaining control of ticonderoga and hudson river valley dividing rebellious provinces nickerson 1967 pp 91 92 102 his british army troops consisted of 9th 20th 21st 24th 47th 53rd and 62nd regiments along with flank companies of other regiments left as a garrison in quebec light infantry and flank companies formed army s advance force and were commanded by

forces consisted of riedesel specht barner regiments along with one regiment of grenadiers and another of dragoons from brunswick army and regiment and s jager corps from hesse hanau army pancake 1977 pp 114 115 most of these forces had arrived in 1776 and many participated in campaign that drove american army out of quebec pancake 1977 p 36 total size of burgoyne s regular army was about 7 000 in addition to regulars there were about 800 indians and a relatively small number of canadiens and loyalists who acted primarily as scouts and screening reconnaissance pancake 1977 p 116 army was also accompanied by more than 1 000 civilians including a pregnant woman and baroness riedesel with her three small children including these non military personnel total number of people in burgoyne s army was more than 10 000 pancake 1977 p 118 burgoyne and general carlton re sited troops at fort saint jean near northern end of lake champlain on 14 june by 21 june armada carrying army was on lake and they had arrived at unoccupied fort crown point by 30 june pancake 1977 p 119 indians and other elements of advance force laid down such an effective screen that american defenders at ticonderoga were unaware of either exact location or strength of force moving along lake nickerson 1967 pp 119 120 while en route burgoyne authored a proclamation to americans written in turgid pompous style for which he was well known and frequently criticized and parodied nickerson 1967 p 122 american defences thumb left upright general arthur st clair portrait by charles willson peale american forces had occupied forts at ticonderoga and crown point since they captured them in may 1775 from a small garrison in 1776 and 1777 they undertook significant efforts to improve defenses surrounding ticonderoga a peninsula on east side of lake renamed mount independence was heavily fortified to north of old fort ticonderoga americans built numerous redoubts a large fort at site earlier french fortifications and a fort on mount hope a quarter mile long floating bridge was constructed across lake to facilitate communication between ticonderoga and mount independence nickerson 1967 pp 130 131 command at ticonderoga went through a variety of changes early in 1777 until 1777 general philip schuyler had headed continental army s northern department with general horatio gates in charge of ticonderoga in march 1777 continental congress gave command of whole department to gates schuyler protested this action which congress reversed in may at which point gates no longer willing to serve under schuyler left for philadelphia command of fort was then given to general arthur st clair who arrived only three weeks before burgoyne s army nickerson 1967 p 136 entire complex was manned by several under strength regiments of continental army and militia units from new york and nearby states a war council held by generals st clair and schuyler on 20 june concluded that number of troops now at this post which are under 2 500 effectives rank and file are greatly inadequate to defense and that it is prudent to provide for a retreat pancake 1977 pp 120 121 consequently plans were made for retreat along two routes first was by water to skenesboro southernmost navigable point on lake second was overland by a rough road leading east toward hubbardton in new hampshire grants present day vermont pancake 1977 p 121 sugar loaf a height called sugar loaf now known as mount defiance overlooked both ticonderoga and independence and large cannons on that height would make fort impossible to defend this tactical problem had been pointed out by john trumbull when gates was in command nickerson 1967 p 131 it was believed to be impossible for british to place cannons on heights even though trumbull anthony wayne and an injured benedict arnold climbed to top and noted that gun carriages could probably be dragged up nickerson 1967 p 132 defence or lack thereof of sugar loaf was complicated by widespread perception that fort ticonderoga with a reputation as gibraltar of north had to be held neither abandoning fort nor garrisoning it with a small force sufficient to respond to a feint but not to an attack in strength was viewed as a politically viable option defending fort and associated outer works would require all troops currently there leaving none to defend sugar loaf nickerson 1967 pp 136 137 furthermore george washington and congress were of opinion that burgoyne who was known to be in quebec was more likely to strike from south moving his troops by sea to new york city nickerson 1967 p 138 following war council of 20 june schuyler ordered st clair to hold out as long as he could and to avoid having his avenues of retreat cut off schuyler took command of a reserve force of 700 at albany and washington ordered four regiments to be held in readiness at peekskill further down hudson river nickerson pp 138 140 battle british advance thumb right detail of a 1780 map

away burgoyne had deployed fraser s advance force and right column on west side of lake hoping to cut off defences at mount hope riedesel and german column were deployed on east side of lake where their objective was mount independence and road to hubbardton burgoyne gave order to advance on 2 july pancake 1977 pp 121 122 on morning of 2 july st clair decided to withdraw men occupying defence post at mount hope which was exposed and subject to capture detachment there set fire to works and retreated to old french lines so called because they were site of french defence in 1758 battle of carillon getting away not long before arrival of burgoyne s advance guard that afternoon a company of british soldiers and indians came toward those lines but not near enough to do significant damage and opened fire st clair ordered his men to hold their fire until enemy was closer but james wilkinson fired at a british soldier spurring untrained defenders to follow suit soldier wilkinson fired at fell and british troops fled when man was captured it turned out he was uninjured and that he had fallen down because he was drunk through deception of placing him with a man posing as a captured loyalist st clair learned nature of opposing forces pancake 1977 p 122 fraser s advance forces occupied mount hope on 3 july burgoyne ordered some of scouts and indians over to east side of lake for reconnaissance ahead of german column and brought some of germans over to west side some of british camp was placed close enough to american lines that they were harassed by gunfire this did not prevent british from making repairs to bridges on portage road between ticonderoga and lake george nickerson 1967 p 143 british engineers discovered strategic position of sugar loaf and realized that american withdrawal from mount hope gave them access to it starting on 2 july they began clearing and building gun emplacements on top of that height working carefully to avoid notice by americans they spent several days drawing some of their larger guns up slope burgoyne s objective was to spring trap only when riedesel s germans were in position to cut off american retreat nickerson 1967 p 144 american retreat on 4 july americans held a quiet celebration with some toasts to commemorate previous year s declaration of independence that night british lost their element of surprise when some indians lit fires on sugar loaf alerting americans to their presence there ketchum 1997 p 171 on morning of 5 july st clair held a war council in which decision was made to retreat since their position was completely exposed they delayed departure until nightfall when their movements would be concealed nickerson 1967 p 145 in a conversation with one of his quartermasters st clair observed that he could save his character and lose army by holding fort or save army and lose his character if he retreated giving a clear indication of political reaction he was expecting to his decision all possible armaments as well as invalids camp followers and supplies were loaded onto a fleet of more than 200 boats that began to move up lake toward skenesboro accompanied by colonel pierse long s regiment ketchum 1997 pp 174 180 owing to a shortage of boats four invalids were left behind as were very largest cannons and a variety of supplies everything from tents to cattle ketchum 1997 p 177 rest of army crossed to mount independence and headed down hubbardton road which riedesel s forces had not yet reached a handful of men were left at pontoon bridge with loaded cannons to fire on british attempts to cross it but they were drunk when british arrived next morning nickerson 1967 p 146 british occupied forts without firing a single shot and detachments from fraser s and riedesel s troops set out in pursuit of retreating americans on hubbardton road while burgoyne hurried some of his troops up lake toward skenesboro nickerson 1967 p 147 aftermath at least seven americans were killed and 11 wounded in skirmishing prior to american retreat british casualties were not tallied but at least five were killed in skirmishes ketchum 1997 p 170 americans made good time on hubbardton road most of force reached castleton a march of on evening of 6 july nickerson 1967 p 148 british pursuit resulted in battle of hubbardton when they caught up with rear guard on morning of 7 july but this enabled main american body to escape eventually joining forces with schuyler at fort edward pancake 1977 p 125 smaller american force that had fled by boat to skenesboro fought off burgoyne s advance force in battle of fort anne but was forced to abandon equipment and many sick and wounded in skirmishing at skenesboro nickerson 1967 p 155 confrontation at ticonderoga did not substantially slow burgoyne s advance but he was forced to leave a garrison of more than 900 men in ticonderoga area and wait until 11 july for dispersed elements of his army to regroup at skenesboro pancake 1977 p 124 he then encountered delays in traveling heavily wooded road between skenesboro and fort edward which general schuyler s forces had effectively ruined by felling trees across it and destroying all its bridges in swampy terrain pancake 1977 pp 125 127 burgoyne s campaign ultimately failed and he was forced to surrender after battles of saratoga nickerson 1967 p 398 general gates reported to governor george clinton on 20 november that ticonderoga and independence had been abandoned and burned by retreating british nickerson 1967 pp 405 406 political and public outcry thumb right upright

until we shoot a general and george washington said it was an event of chagrin and surprise not apprehended nor within compass of my reasoning rumors circulated that st clair and schuyler were traitors who had taken bribes in exchange for retreat nickerson 1967 p 161 schuyler was eventually removed as commander of northern department replaced by general gates fall of ticonderoga was among reasons cited ketchum 1997 p 356 st clair was removed from his command and sent to headquarters for an inquiry he maintained that his conduct had been honorable and demanded a review by court martial smith 1882 p 93 court martial was not held until september 1778 due to political intrigues against washington st clair was completely exonerated although he was never given another field command nickerson 1967 p 426 schuyler was also cleared of any wrongdoing by a court martial smith 1882 p 95 news made headlines in europe king george is reported to have burst into chambers of scantily clad
