mammillaria spinosissima also known as spiny pincushion cactus is a species of flowering plant in cactus family endemic to central mexican states of guerrero and morelos where they grow at elevations of approximately species was described in 1838 by james forbes gardener of duke of bedford botanist david hunt collected a specimen in 1971 when he located one near sierra de tepoztlan mexico cylindrical and elongated plants grow up to tall and wide they reach full height after five to ten years spines are red brown or white with cream colored radials and pink funnel shaped flowers that grow in a ring around apex of stem to approximately long it grows low to ground in solitary or in clusters and its flowers produce generally bright red berries that are club shaped smooth and juicy m spinosissima thrive in well drained soils that are sandy or loam with a ph ranging from acidic to neutral they prefer low humidity and full filtered sun plants are typically watered once every two or three weeks and kept nearly dry during winter months they require no pruning and make good patio and container plants they are relatively disease resistant but susceptible to pests such as mealybugs synonyms of m spinosissima include mammillaria centraliplumosa mammillaria haasii and mammillaria virginis taxonomy left thumb alt a color picture of a mountain from town sierra de tepoztlan carl linnaeus designated mammillaria as a type genus for cactus in 1753 in 1838 james forbes gardener of duke of bedford listed and described a species he called from a group of cacti he had acquired in europe three years earlier nathaniel lord britton and joseph nelson rose believe that forbes was given that name by ludwig karl georg pfeiffer but plant was actually mammillaria spinosissima pfeiffer had published first infrageneric division of mammillaria in 1837 dividing genus into two groups based on distinct spine characteristics in 1845 joseph zu salm dyck based on work by frederick scheer expanded classification into eight groups with at least 145 recognized species it is one of largest and most morphologically variable genera in cactus family others estimate there are as many as two hundred species of mammillaria including sixty two cultivated species from india though larger genus opuntia is less popular with gardeners and mammillaria was previously thought to be monophyletic but phylogenic analysis indicates that is embedded within a core group of mammillaria species a specimen of mammillaria spinosissima was collected by botanist david hunt in september 1971 when he located one in mexico near morelos cuernavaca toll road in sierra de tepoztlan at an altitude of similar species subspecies and synonyms species similar to mammillaria spinosissima include mammillaria

spinosissima also known as spiny pincushion cactus are cylindrical plants that grow up to tall and wide they reach full height after five to ten years spines are red brown or white with cream colored radials and pink funnel shaped flowers that grow in a ring around apex of stem to approximately long relatively small cacti are globular or elongated and flowers produce generally bright red berries that are club shaped smooth and juicy mammillaria species tend to grow low to ground in solitary or grouped in clusters genus is marked by its dimorphic areoles spine bearing or vegetative areoles are located on apex of tubercle and flowering areoles are located inside axils of tubercles stem is woolly and covered with bristles native habitat genus mammillaria native habitat ranges from colombia and venezuela to southwestern united states its diversity is greatest in mexico species have also been documented in west indies m spinosissima is endemic to central mexico and concentrated in states of guerrero and morelos where they grow at elevations of approximately they prefer dry tropical forests and xerophilous scrub subspecies pilcayensis is named for its occurrence in barranca de in guerrero cultivation britton and rose believe that m spinosissima has been in cultivation since at least 1835 species thrives in well drained soils that are sandy or loam with a ph that is acidic alkaline or neutral they prefer low humidity and grow well under glass with full filtered sun from south north and east plants are typically watered once every couple of weeks and kept nearly dry during winter months propagation is facilitated by offsets of seeds sown in early spring in weather they require no pruning and make good patio and container plants they are disease resistant but are
