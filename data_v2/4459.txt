in 1933 next landing occurred in 1948 and island has been subject to some scientific research and a limited amount of tourism island became subject to antarctic treaty in 1961 since 1987 there has been an automated meteorological station on island three amateur radio dx peditions have visited island and there are sporadic landings by tourists history first sighting of peter i island was made on 21 october 1821 by fabian gottlieb von bellingshausen s expedition rubin 2005 180 who commanded ships vostok and under russian flag he named island for tsar peter i great of russia drift ice made it

for scientific investigations as well as a limited number of ships that have successfully landed tourists on island in 1987 norwegian polar institute sent five scientists to spend eleven days on island main focuses were aerial photography and topographical measurements to allow an accurate map of island to be produced second important area was marine biological investigations although also geological biological and other surveys were conducted team also built an automatic weather station barr 1987 68 three dx peditions have been sent to island in 1987 1994 and 2006 geography thumb alt

and only during short period of year in which island is not surrounded by pack ice these landings take place on west side at kapp ingrid christensen a peninsula which divides bays norvegiabukta and on cape are some narrow strips of beach which are suitable for landing beach in norvegiabukta is just wide and is entered via natural arch on west side is a plateau while north and south coasts feature ice shelves eastern side is steepest and features two rock columns with flat tops in sea island is a shield volcano although it is not known if it is still active and it has been categorized as either holocene or historic based on date samples ranging from years ago summit lars christensen peak is a wide circular crater an ultra prominent peak at elevation it is named after lars christensen it is not known whether this volcano is extinct or not because upper part is apparently unmodified by glaciation indicating an eruption several centuries ago 1990 512 environment thumb upright 1 2 map of island island s vegetation consists exclusively of mosses and lichens which have adapted to extreme antarctic climate island has a very harsh climate with strong winds and freezing temperatures steady snowfall keeps vegetation to a minimum island is a breeding ground for a few seabirds particularly southern fulmars but also wilson s storm petrels and antarctic terns penguins including adelie and chinstrap penguins visit island infrequently there are numerous seals particularly crabeater seals leopard seals and smaller numbers of southern elephant seals politics peter i island is one of norway s two territorial claims in antarctica other being queen maud land peter i island is only claim within 90degw and and is also only claim which is not a sector kyvik et al 2008 57 being south of 60degs island is subject to antarctic treaty treaty ensures free access to island for any scientific investigation and states that it can be used only for peaceful purposes norway australia france new zealand and united kingdom have all mutually recognized each other s claims in antarctica norwegian administration of island is handled by polar affairs department of ministry of justice and public security located in oslo annexation of island is regulated by dependency act of 24 march 1933 it establishes that norwegian criminal law private law and procedural law applies to island in addition to
