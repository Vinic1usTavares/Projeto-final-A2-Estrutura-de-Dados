bike association decided to nominate just one competitor for new zealand olympic team team was announced on 16 april 1996 and lynch s name came up this was by no means a foregone conclusion and lynch

had a hole in bottom bracket and neutral tech support insisting that she couldn t ride it her old frame was couriered over with two days to spare life in village was unpleasant due to constant security checks and athletes who had completed their event partying all night lynch moved out and shared accommodation with jacqui nelson in a suburb whilst this required a two hour bus ride to mountain bike venue it made for a more pleasant stay and sufficient sleep mountain bike course overlapped with equestrian venue and was not open for mountain bike training until two days prior to race
