parliament in 2009 minister for law k shanmugam said that right to vote could not be a mere privilege as this would imply existence of an institution superior to body of citizens that is empowered to

issue court might infer existence of right to vote in constitution from its text and structure and from fact that it is an adaptation of westminster system of democracy if right to vote were to be found to be implicit in constitution judiciary would be better able to protect right when issues arise before courts parliamentary elections act and presidential elections act regulate exercise of

vote one of an individual s personal rights which are a species of property of most sacred kind right to vote forms foundation of representative democracy that is democracy based on principle of citizens electing a group of people to represent their interests various models of government that fall under general term representative democracy namely protective participatory and elite models are all based upon underlying principle of equality of rights including right to vote popular government was referred to by john stuart mill as where supreme controlling power is vested in entire aggregate of community while edmund burke argued that it has desirable consequence of establishing a government that has a unified public interest with its citizens absent of personal prejudices except for that of public good also published in right to vote then provides means for individuals to voice their support of or opposition to government their aggregated choices enable will of people to control extent of power and perpetuity of governments thus protecting society s rights and interests also published in thomas paine one of founding fathers of united states said that right to vote is critical in protection of individual freedoms he called it one of an individual s personal rights which are a species of property of most sacred kind and expressed view that t o take away this right is to reduce a man to slavery subject to will of another t o any class of men is as criminal as proposal to take away property paine pp 334 and 336 paine s view was that there is no justification for one part of a community to deny another its right to vote on any basis whether class race religion or political creed his view survives in various international instruments such as article 21 1 of universal declaration of human rights art 21 1 of universal declaration of human rights general assembly resolution iii u n g a o r 3d sess supp no 13 u n doc a 180 1948 p 71 declares

chief justice earl warren wrote reynolds pp 555 and 561 562 term representative democracy does not appear in constitution of singapore however an analogy may be drawn from approach taken by high court of australia to australian constitution in lange v australian broadcasting corporation 1997 court inferred that constitution embodies a system of representative and responsible government from various provisions including those requiring periodic elections to choose members of senate and house of representatives lange pp 557 559 similarly singapore constitution prescribes that parliament may be

in parliament on 16 may 2001 upon an adjournment motion introduced by non constituency member of parliament joshua benjamin jeyaretnam jeyaretnam argued that since marking of a ballot paper is an

minister for law k shanmugam who stated in parliament on 13 february 2009 that right to vote is an implied constitutional right heading of section 38 of parliamentary elections act pea is registers of electors to be conclusive evidence of right to vote subsection 1 provides that current register of electors is conclusive evidence for determining whether a person is entitled to vote at an election and subsection 2 states that a person s right and duty of voting is not prejudiced if there is an appeal pending as to whether his or her name is properly on register status of right to vote was again considered in parliament in 2009 during debates on ministry of law s annual budget on 12 february nominated member of parliament thio li ann asked if right to vote is a constitutional right and part of fundamental law of land or merely a statutory right regulated by ordinary law replying to thio following day minister for law k shanmugam referred to 2001 debate on matter and confirmed that having conferred with attorney general in government s view right to vote is an implied constitutional right arising from various provisions of constitution including articles 65 and 66 article 65 sets out requirements for prorogation and dissolution of parliament articles 65 2 to 65 3a explain when prime minister may dissolve parliament while article 65 4 specifically provides that parliament has a fixed term parliament unless sooner dissolved shall continue for 5 years from date of its first sitting and shall then stand dissolved article 66 states there shall be a general election at such time within 3 months after every dissolution of parliament as president shall by proclamation in gazette appoint minister also said as regards high court s view in taw cheng kong minister noted that it could not be treated as a precedent since t he legal nature of citizens right to vote was not an issue in that case and was not specifically argued thio li ann has commented that minister s clarification dealt quietus est to high court s odd pronouncement in taw cheng kong v public prosecutor quietus est means he is discharged proposals to express right in constitution 1966 constitutional commission on 18 january 1966 shortly after singapore s independence president appointed a constitutional commission led by chief justice wee chong jin to consider how rights of racial linguistic and religious minorities in nascent nation should be protected in its report on 27 august 1966 reproduced in commission recommended entrenching right to vote as a fundamental right in form of right to elect a government of their choice as expressed in general elections held at reasonable periodic intervals by secret vote report of constitutional commission 1966 para 43 chief justification for this proposal was relatively infant or immature culture of democracy in a newly independent nation that was barely one year old thio westminster constitutions and implied fundamental rights p 410 report noted that citizens had only exercised right to vote twice in general elections in 1959 and 1963 respectively hence however parliament decided not to entrench right to vote instead relegating voting rights to statutory regulation under parliamentary elections act 2009 parliamentary debate during 2009 parliamentary debate on right to vote s status thio li ann proposed that to avoid doubt right should be specifically set out in constitution she argued that entrenching right to vote through an article in constitution would provide opportunity to protect details of right currently voting is regulated by pea as it is an ordinary statute it can be altered with a simple parliamentary majority by future governments seeking to amend or restrict voting rights thio said that expressing right to vote clearly in constitution would allow aspects of that right such as voter secrecy and universality and equality of votes to be protected from unjust manipulation thumb left a copy of 1999 reprint of constitution of singapore however minister for law said government was of opinion that as right to vote is an implied right in constitution it was unnecessary for constitution to be amended to expressly mention right articles 65 and 66 of constitution would be entrenched once article 5 2a is brought into force that article which has remained in abeyance since it was introduced in 1991 provides that a bill that seeks to amend among other things article 65 or 66 must be supported at a national referendum by not less than two thirds of votes cast unless president consents to amendment shanmugam went on to state that concerns of 1966 constitutional commission were now moot as singapore had since experienced ten general elections with a 95 voter turnout each time therefore it could be assumed that idea and experience of voting were deeply ingrained in singaporean voters furthermore some countries choose to draft their constitutions in great detail while others like singapore set out a basic philosophy this view was repeated by chong wan press secretary to minister for law in a letter to today newspaper she stated that singapore s legal heritage was a broadly worded constitution he noted that countries such as north korea and myanmar were among those that had set out right to vote within their constitutions shanmugam concluded that what was fundamental to protecting right to vote was a government committed to rule of law following parliamentary debate in a 2009 article thio elaborated that entrenching right to vote in constitution would make it significantly more difficult for any corrupt government that came into power to curtail it as a super majority of at least two thirds of all elected members of parliament would be needed before a constitutional amendment could be made constitution art 5 2 otherwise with control over a simple majority of parliament constitution art 57 1 subject to this constitution all questions proposed for decision in parliament shall be determined by a majority of votes of members present and voting a ruling party if it chose to could direct amendments to pea or create new legislation to provide some citizens with say double number of votes and protect this from constitutional challenge using a notwithstanding clause that is a provision stated to have legal effect despite existence of other inconsistent laws by not protecting such an important right freedom of singapore s electoral system could be progressively curtailed thio westminster constitutions and implied fundamental rights pp 425 426 a similar point has been made by singapore management university constitutional law professor jack lee who noted that since article 66 does not define term general election thio also argued that without a constitutionally expressed right to vote judiciary is handicapped in interpreting this implied right given its conservative approach to reading constitution and fact that it is unlikely to appeal to normative ideas such as representative democracy judicial implication of right in constitution despite government s unequivocal view that right to vote is an implied constitutional right in singapore it is courts that ultimately determine meaning of constitution thio li ann has suggested that since right s status is not likely to be brought before courts in a dispute cabinet should refer matter to constitution of republic of singapore tribunal pursuant to article 100 of constitution for an authoritative opinion thio westminster constitutions and implied fundamental rights p 419 thio has argued that a court convened to determine whether right to vote exists in constitution would give serious weight to minister of law s pronouncements on status of right as to agree with it would affirm rather than challenge executive or legislative power also section 9a of interpretation act requires a purposive interpretation of written law including constitution to promote purpose or object underlying written law interpretation act s 9a 1 sections 9a 3 c and d identify ministerial speeches made at second readings of bills or any relevant material in any official record of debates in parliament as appropriate aspects of interpretive matrix thio westminster constitutions and implied fundamental rights pp 419 420 court might then take one or both of following approaches originalist interpretation courts may choose to establish an imputed intention or traditional understanding of existence of a right to vote derived from drafting style associated with drafters of westminster constitutions rather than drafted text as it is thio has said that framers of constitution worked with certain assumptions which they did not make explicit in hinds v queen 1975 privy council said that hinds p 212 court in hinds held that as a rule of construction applicable to constitutional instruments adopting westminster system absence of express words did not prevent judicial powers of new state being exclusively exercised by judicature similarly right to vote was necessarily implied into constitution through its genesis as an adaptation of westminster system of democracy thio westminster constitutions and implied fundamental rights pp 421 422 interpretation based on text and structure thio has also argued that courts may find that an implied right to vote can be derived from existing structure of constitution and a purposive reading of articles 65 and 66 according to this reading a constitutional right to vote must be logically or practically necessary for preserving integrity of that structure as constitutionally established in articles 25 and 26 of constitution appointment of prime minister requires that he commands confidence of majority of members of parliament as constitution places emphasis on need for democratic legitimacy as well as general elections it may be reasonable to infer that structure of constitution provides for a right to vote as a fundamental instrument of democratic legitimacy thio westminster constitutions and implied fundamental rights p 423 exercise of vote parliamentary elections act regulates exercise of vote and sets out procedures for parliamentary elections in singapore right to vote in singapore extends only to singapore citizens who are ordinarily resident in singapore and not less than 21 years s 5 1 when preparing or revising a register of electors a singapore citizen who has been issued an identity card on or before 1 january is presumed unless contrary is proved to have been ordinarily resident

lived in country for a total of 30 days during three years immediately before that date even if on 1 january person is not resident in country pea s 5 1a whether people are entitled to vote at a presidential election also depends on whether they are entitled to have their names entered or retained in a register of electors maintained under pea s 21 singapore has a one person one vote system plural voting that is voting more than once in electoral division that one is assigned to or voting in more than one electoral division is illegal pea s 7 following a relative swing in votes against ruling people s action party government in general election of 1984 prime minister lee kuan yew raised possibility of modifications to one person one vote system and said it is necessary to try and put some safeguards into way in which people use their votes to bargain coerce to push to jostle and get what they want without running risk of losing services of government because one day by mistake they will lose services of government subsequently in an interview to us magazine foreign affairs in january 1994 lee now senior minister suggested that a person between ages of 40 and 60 with a family should be given two votes because he is likely to be more careful voting also for his children he is more likely to vote in a serious way than a capricious young man under 30 but we haven t found it necessary yet if it became necessary we should do it i m not intellectually convinced that one man one vote is best we practise it because that s what british bequeathed us and we haven t really found a need to challenge that see also in a later media interview published in straits times on 8 may 1994 lee said lee suggested that such a change should perhaps be implemented in 15 to 20 years if singapore s birth rate had not increased as policies might then be disproportionately influenced by people aged 60 and over however he emphasized that these were his personal views and had not been discussed by cabinet see also to date no such modification to voting system has been made overseas voting prior to may 2001 voters who were overseas on polling day could not vote operational concerns such as insufficient singapore missions around world possibility that last known addresses of singapore citizens overseas might not be current and difficulty of keeping track of citizens who were abroad were cited for this restriction some commentators took view that such logistical issues should not deprive singaporeans of their sacred right to vote lua sim koh p 279 thumb left upright

and worked abroad due to economic globalization thus it had decided to introduce overseas voting on a small scale at next general elections at that time law generally required overseas voters to have resided in singapore for an aggregate of two years during five year period before prescribed date however singaporeans whom government had posted abroad were exempted from this requirement and so were their families pea 1999 rev ed s 5 1a a inserted by parliamentary elections amendment act 2001 s 3 a minister explained that this requirement for residence in singapore was a necessary pre condition
