fortress in 1887 during world war i complex was largest defensive structure in entire state occupying fortress was battle tested in 1915 when germany attacked russian empire and withstood eleven days of assault before capture after world war i fortress military importance declined as advances in weaponry rendered it increasingly obsolete it was used by various civil institutions and as a garrison during world war ii parts of fortress complex were used by nazi germany for detention interrogation and execution about 50 000 people were executed there including more than 30 000 victims of holocaust some sections have since been restored ninth fort houses a museum and memorial devoted to victims of wartime mass executions complex is most complete remaining example of a russian empire fortress background thumb an 1879 edict issued by tsar alexander ii ordered construction of kaunas fortress city of kaunas is located at confluence of two rivers neman and neris which link lithuania s interior and its capital vilnius to baltic sea baltic peoples had created significant domains by 1st century and came into conflict with scandinavians and slavs teutonic order began targeting lithuanian lands at beginning of 13th century since lithuania was heavily wooded and its lands were often impassable its interior was most approachable along its rivers when frozen and during short dry harvest season in late summer in response to this vulnerability defensive structures including a brick castle in kaunas were in place at various points on nemunas river by 14th century city was first mentioned in written sources in 1361 it received magdeburg rights regulating its autonomy and establishing trade protocols from vytautas great in 1408 an outpost of hanseatic league was created there in 1441 by end of 16th century kaunas had become a major regional trade center but plagues fires and wars adversely affected country and city during 17th and 18th centuries following partitions of polish lithuanian commonwealth at end of 18th century lithuania was incorporated into russian empire two major 19th century projects contributed to city s revival augustow canal completed in 1832 linked neman to black sea and a rail line linking saint petersburg warsaw and germany via kaunas was completed in 1862 it was part of a limited network of western russian railways russia s western borders needed support and fortresses existed or were being built in latvia ukraine and belarus concept of building a fortress in lithuania was discussed without result in 1796 but became a critical concern after french invasion of russia in 1812 led by napoleon grande armee managed to cross nemunas near kaunas on its drive towards moscow without major difficulties an increasingly unified germany troubled empire during second half of century a fortress in kaunas would present an obstacle to attacks from west preventing further incursions towards riga and vilnius in order to control region attackers would need to first neutralize kaunas facing this possibility and evaluating natural advantages of city russian officials decided to construct a fortress there after several delays on july 7

encompassed a huge site consisting of seven forts and nine defensive batteries arranged in concentric loops plan included support buildings and infrastructures such as barracks new roads and an ammunition depot construction began in 1882 about 4 000 workers were mustered for project principal structures were concentrated in freda and new section of city project significantly affected daily life of kaunas residents and there were plans to detach fortress into an independent administrative unit governed by a military board its commandant wrote that there is no city of kaunas there is only fortress of kaunas first forts were built using bricks reinforced with thick ramparts of earth which were incorporated into surrounding relief making them harder to breach they were symmetrical usually having five faces with positions for infantry and artillery these forts were built according to standard russian brick fort design of time therefore first seven forts were very similar they differed only in layout of their interiors their integration into surrounding relief and in some construction details they would also be renovated in slightly different ways batteries were built between adjacent forts these were fortifications containing various types of artillery located along fortress outer lines and usually erected on hills first construction phase was completed in 1887 fortress was designated first class in that year marking its importance and defensive capabilities and otto klem was named its first commandant at same time administrative rules were established to manage fortress impact on city and its surrounding areas height of fortress civil buildings was restricted thumb one of longest tunnels in ninth fort during 1890 work began on eighth fort known as linkuva new construction techniques were introduced particularly reinforced concrete linkuva fort became most modern entrenchment equipped with electricity sewerage and casemates for a garrison of 1 000 personnel at same time massive were laid along with additional defensive structures effecting complete enclosure of city center between rivers nemunas and neris by 1890 seven forts had been completed supporting roads had been constructed and a railroad bridge over nemunas had been adapted for military transport by now expenditures on fortress had amounted to over nine million rubles first bricks for a church that would serve garrison were laid in 1891 it was completed in 1893 following year construction began on a dedicated narrow gauge railway ninth fort begun in 1903 was first of its kind in empire structure was a trapezoid encompassing one infantry rampart and was equipped with two armored watchtowers electricity and ventilation walls of its cannon casemates were covered with cork to reduce firing noise cost of this single fort was 850 000 rubles thumb left shooting embrasure for cannons complex of forts and defensive structures was divided into four sectors first followed left bank of nemunas to its confluence with jiesia river and included three earliest forts second sector extended from jiesia to monastery and included two forts third extended from right to left bank of nemunas this sector also contained two forts fourth and last sector stretched from right bank of neris to left bank of nemunas comprising two forts including newest ninth fort as new building and weapons technologies developed fortress was repeatedly renovated in order to maintain its military effectiveness in 1912 an expansion and reconstruction initiative was launched this project called for twelve new forts along with batteries support buildings and defensive structures its completion was scheduled for 1917 older forts were to be completely encircled by new construction which was meant to employ newest military technologies during early realization of plan new defensive entrenchments were built and old forts were strengthened with concrete however when action began on eastern front during world war i work on fortress was halted in 1915 only one fort ninth conformed with new technological criteria while tenth fort was only partially built complex then covered about and contained a internal railway power plant water supply system mill bakery brewery food bank and telegraph despite fact that fortress renovations and new construction had not been finished it presented a formidable challenge to its attackers world war i thumb second fort after german german gamma gerat gun german artillery played key role in offensive in 1915 germany and central powers began an offensive against russia and advanced towards lithuania and kaunas german army reached kaunas fortress in july 1915 at that time about 90 000 soldiers commanded by vladimir grigoriev manned fortress to attack fortress germans brought four divisions to operation which were placed under command of karl to support this attack germans constructed a railroad to transport their gamma gerat howitzer howitzer s shell weighed about 1 ton with a range of several days into siege more guns of various calibers were deployed german army concentrated its attack on first second and third forts which were complex s oldest structures army did not surround entire fortress and its defense was able to regroup and resupply on august 8 germans intensified their bombardment but fortress garrison withstood several attempts to breach defensive perimeter several days afterward bombardment of fortress reached its peak its defenders sustained heavy casualty rates of 50 to 75 on august 14 over 1 000 defending troops were killed but germans were unable to completely overcome fortress defenses however on next day gamma gerat shells destroyed first fort and germans transferred their attentions to second fort fight was now within confines of greater fortress complex at cost of many casualties third fort s defenders delayed advance of germans but were forced to evacuate and retreat later same day next day fourth fort was abandoned and fifth fort was conquered soon afterwards in a chain reaction other forts began capitulating commander grigoriev abandoned his post and escaped to when germans crossed nemunas river they captured sixth and seventh forts remaining two forts were captured soon afterwards after eleven days of fighting fortress had been taken thumb left remaining parts of first fort defensive forces sustained 20 000 casualties and about 1 300 weapons were captured by germans grigoriev was arrested by russian authorities tried and sentenced to fifteen years in prison for failure to properly perform his duties he also suffered revocation of all his awards military degrees and honors germans used materials from fortress elsewhere during their war against russia researchers have identified factors contributing to relatively rapid fall of fortress it had not been completely renovated its defenders were inexperienced crew had been frequently rotated and had not been able to familiarize themselves with surrounding area and with fortress although most of their experience lay in defense of fortress interior they were dispatched to fight on open ground when combat moved outside fortress communication lines were disrupted by german bombardment and fortress defense was unable to restore complete communication with command center or with other forts absence of external support was a crucial factor in its fall interwar thumb reconstructed ninth fort lithuania regained its independence on february 16 1918 and old fortress was placed under engineering staff supervision those materials that had not been taken by germans were used to resupply lithuanian military needs and for construction of armored train gediminas named after 14th century grand duke of lithuania gediminas in 1920 kaunas fortress board was formed and charged with task of administering fortress due to development of new military technologies its reconstruction was seen as a vast and inappropriate expense fortress armament was dismantled and trenches were filled with scrap iron sections of fortress were given to various civil institutions while army occupied barracks of former 28th division sixth and ninth forts were used as prisons and central archive was located in seventh fort republic s official radio station was based in fortress a gas chamber was installed in gunpowder depot of first fort and used to execute condemned prisoners some sections were used as housing for poor as city of kaunas expanded near complex its roads became public streets structures and layouts of new sections were influenced by presence of fortress world war ii thumb left a tall memorial to victims adjustments to secret protocols of 1939 molotov ribbentrop pact assigned lithuania to soviet sphere of influence and it was occupied by ussr in june 1940 fortress was then used to conduct interrogations and house political prisoners pact was broken when germany invaded ussr on june 22 1941 german forces entered kaunas on june 24 sixth fort became a pow camp for red army soldiers kaunas s jewish population numbered between 35 000 and 40 000 few would survive holocaust in lithuania nazis aided by lithuanian auxiliaries began massacring jewish population on july 6 acting under orders of ss lithuanian auxiliary police units shot nearly 3 000 jews at seventh fort on august 18 in what came to be known as intellectuals action over 1 800 jews were shot at fourth fort on october 28 great action took place residents of kaunas ghetto were summoned and over 9 000 men women and children were taken to ninth fort and executed during later course of occupation over 5 000 jewish deportees from central europe would be executed at this fort about 60 escaped in december 1943 they had been assigned to excavate and burn bodies of earlier victims as part of aktion 1005 thirteen of these escapees were able to document aktion s attempt to hide evidence of mass murders when germany began losing war and battlefront approached lithuania german defense began attempts to prepare a defensive in kaunas including use of fortress nemunas river was labelled line of catastrophe and adolf hitler called for its defense at any price on august 1 1944 kaunas was captured by red army remaining fortress structures were used for military needs and several of original structures were demolished or redeveloped number of deaths at fortress during world war ii vary by source united states holocaust museum gives detailed descriptions of deaths of about 18 500 holocaust victims other sources mention 30 000 jewish deaths with total number 50 000 post war thumb headquarters of fortress commandant currently housing headquarters of lithuanian air force lithuania remained a soviet socialist republic until 1990 in 1948 headquarters of 7th guards cherkassy airborne division was established in fortress commandant s headquarters barracks were used by 108th paratroopers regiment and fifth fort served air defense regiment most of forts however served as depots or housed farming organizations during postwar expansion and development of city parts of fortress were dismantled as part of construction of kaunas polytechnic institute ground level entrenchments of one defensive sector were destroyed in 1958 ninth fort was dedicated as a museum during 1959 its first exhibition was opened memorializing crimes that had taken place there museum later expanded its scope to cover fortress entire history a tall memorial to victims was constructed there in 1984 however soviet military occupied most of fortress until lithuania re established its independence after withdrawal of soviet forces completed in 1993 lithuanian military bases were established at several forts thumb left museum in ninth fort as of early 2007 only ninth fort had been partly renovated it is now devoted to holocaust and lithuania s occupations by germans and soviets museum which holds
