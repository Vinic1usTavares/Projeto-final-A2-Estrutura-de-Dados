capitulation to german demands for sudetenland in aftermath of german occupation of rump czechoslovakia he became an enthusiastic collaborator realigning his political worldview towards fascism he committed suicide in final days of world war ii unlike some other officials of short lived protectorate government whose reputations were rehabilitated in whole or in part after war moravec s good reputation did not survive his tenure in office and he has been widely derided as a czech quisling early life and education moravec was born in prague son of a modest merchant family originally from kutna hora he graduated from a vocational school and found employment as a clerk at a prague company at outbreak of world war i moravec was conscripted into austro hungarian army and dispatched with

at war school and promoted to colonel in his writings moravec had become increasingly emphatic about growing ambitions of nazi germany he called for czechoslovakia to form an alliance with poland and italy against what he saw as a rising german threat moravec came to be seen as one of czechoslovakia s leading geopolitical strategists and caught attention of president tomas garrigue masaryk moravec wrote preface to a printed edition of one of masaryk s addresses to czechoslovak army in it he signaled his support for creation of democratic state of czechoslovakia that had come out of world war i as well as his personal loyalty to masaryk when masaryk died in 1935 moravec served as one of pallbearers at his funeral in 1938 moravec warned that if czechoslovakia should fall france would find herself politically on european periphery moravec argued that head of danube basin was guarded by what he described as fortress of bohemia land barrier that marked natural border between eastern and western europe if a state were to take czechoslovakia it would therefore control head of danube basin and be free to strike against either france or poland with ease although moravec was concerned with german political and military aims he generally rejected some of more extreme aspects of anti german thought taking a cautiously receptive approach to emanuel s thesis which posited existence of an irrational czech racism towards germans munich agreement in 1938 german demands for sudetenland came to a head in september general jan syrovy inspector general of czechoslovak army was installed by president edvard benes as prime minister in response to german ultimatum syrovy declared that further concessions from our side are no longer possible 42 czechoslovak divisions were mobilized in preparation for an expected german invasion by end of september with czechoslovakia abandoned by france and britain and territorial demands piled on from poland benes backtracked on czechoslovakia s refusal to accept further german requests at this time as well as holding his army post moravec was serving as a member of committee for defense of republic a nationalist pressure group led by son of former czechoslovak finance minister alois in that capacity he sought an audience with benes during last week of september on eve of munich ratification during a two hour confrontation with benes moravec pleaded with president to declare war against germany and not capitulate to german demands his pleas went unheeded second czechoslovak republic munich agreement left moravec disillusioned with both western democracies and benes diplomatic competence according to moravec apostles without courage had led czechoslovakia to capitulation he expressed anger at government s evocation of national ideals in its announcement of agreement declaring that a state unwilling to defend its ideals should not boast of them in same way a whore has no right to boast of her honor as a further expression of his contempt for government he mockingly requested leave to join army of el salvador during short lived second czechoslovak republic with prague actively seeking to appease germany to avoid further territorial losses moravec was forced to quit teaching at military academy moreover he found himself prohibited by government from writing for newspapers due to concerns that incendiary anti german

abroad his offer of service was rejected moravec was particularly concerned that his earlier denunciations of germany and his reputation as a strident anti german polemicist might make him a target of new regime he was surprised therefore when new german authorities informed him he could resume writing books and newspaper columns moravec returned to writing with gusto and a reoriented editorial line declaring our nation could have died in war with germany now whole nation will die of fright and fear writing in v uloze mourenina ceskoslovenska tragedie 1938 most popular of his works moravec sought to more fully reconcile his support for germans with his earlier calls for resistance he indicted benes and intelligentsia for czechoslovakia s defeat and declared it was unwillingness of elite to confront germany militarily that demonstrated democracy s moral decay thereby ultimately justifying its termination in 1941 moravec helped found board of trustees for education of youth a fascist youth group and served as its chairman following year reinhard heydrich who in his role as berlin appointed deputy protector of bohemia and moravia held penultimate day to day authority in

save humanity from judaism moravec publicly blamed jews for pre war tensions between former czechoslovakia and germany he claimed that jewish capitalist interests hitched themselves to anglo french strategic interests and entirely artificially and cunningly escalated czech hatred of german nation to a state of unbounded fury in tatsachen und irrtumer facts and errors moravec declared that
