line extension from green park to stratford a variety of underground and main line services have operated over sub surface tracks but original station was completely rebuilt in conjunction with construction of deep level platforms and portcullis house which sits above station history sub surface station thumb left ordnance survey map showing westminster station in 1878 station was opened as westminster bridge on 24 december 1868 by steam operated district railway dr now district line when railway opened first section of its line from south kensington it was originally eastern terminus of dr and station cutting ended at a concrete wall buffered by timber sleepers approach to station from west runs in cut and cover tunnel under roadway of broad sanctuary and diagonally under parliament square in broad sanctuary tunnel is close to westminster abbey and st margaret s church and care was required to avoid undermining their foundations when excavating in poor ground found there original station building was a temporary structure positioned over tracks and platforms were sheltered with individual awnings rather than all over glazed roof provided at dr s other stations access to station was via a passageway from bridge street and a pedestrian subway under road on 30 may 1870 railway was extended to blackfriars dr connected to metropolitan railway mr later metropolitan line at south kensington and although two companies were rivals each company operated its trains over other s tracks in a joint service known as inner circle on 1 february 1872 dr opened a northbound branch from its station at earl s court to connect to west london extension joint railway wlejr now west london line at addison road now kensington olympia from that date outer circle service began running over dr s tracks service was run by north london railway nlr from its terminus at broad street now demolished in city of london via north london line to willesden junction then west london line to addison road and dr to mansion house at that time eastern terminus of dr from 1 august 1872 middle circle service also began operations through south kensington running from moorgate along mr s tracks on north side of inner circle to paddington then over hammersmith city railway h cr track to latimer road then via a now demolished link on wlejr to addison road and dr to mansion house service was operated jointly by h cr and dr on 30 june 1900 middle circle service was shortened to terminate at earl s court and on 31 december 1908 outer circle service was withdrawn from dr tracks as part of efforts to improve competitiveness dr s tracks were electrified during 1905 and new electric rolling stock was brought into use in 1907 station was given its present name westminster by mid 1890s station entrance had been incorporated into a larger building maps of period show it thus for example 1896 os map in 1922 a new entrance and canopy was designed for bridge street entrance by charles holden and in 1924 he designed a plainly rendered replacement elevation for eastern entrance on to embankment these were first of many projects by architect for london electric railway main forerunner of london transport and transport for london station platforms were also refurbished with new wall tiling in green blue black and white tiling scheme used later by holden on many stations of period and still visible at neighbouring st james s park station in 1949 metropolitan line operated inner circle route was given its own identity on tube map as circle line between late 1962 and early 1964 east ends of platforms were extended to allow longer 8 car trains to be operated this involved carefully enlarging tunnels under metropolitan police s original headquarters at new scotland yard now norman shaw buildings station was completely rebuilt to incorporate new deep level platforms for jubilee line when it was extended to london docklands in 1990s during works level of sub surface platforms was lowered to enable ground level access to portcullis house this was achieved in small increments which were carried out when line was closed at night deep level station thumb upright escalators stacked above one another supported on structural columns within depths of deep level station when first section of jubilee line was planned in 1970s second phase of project was intended to continue line eastwards from terminus at charing cross to city of london woolwich and thamesmead westminster station would not have been on this planned route but need to provide transport infrastructure for redevelopment of london docklands in east and south east london led to a redirection of route to run via westminster to connect waterloo and london bridge stations with new developments for jubilee line extension buildings around station were demolished and sub surface station was completely reconstructed together with erection of a parliamentary office building portcullis house which sits above station both projects were designed by michael hopkins partners construction of deep level station involved excavation of a deep void around and beneath sub surface station to house escalators to jubilee line platforms void known as station box was deepest ever excavation in central london and was carried out between thick reinforced concrete diaphragm walls stiffened and braced horizontally for stability under bridge street on south side of station box two jubilee line platform tunnels are arranged with westbound platform below eastbound depth of station box excavation and proximity of tunnels represented a significant risk to stability of foundation of houses of parliament s clock tower popularly known as big ben which stands only from edge of station box to protect foundation and manage settlement in sub soil a series of long steel tubes was installed horizontally around and beneath clock tower s thick foundation tubes were provided with a control system through which grout was injected into ground to compensate for settlement detected from detailed measurements of clock tower s position as excavation of station box and tunnels took place grout was injected on 22 occasions between january 1996 and september 1997 process limited movement of clock tower to an acceptable maximum of without grout injection movement would have been at least causing cracking to structure of tower and houses of parliament jubilee line platforms were opened on 22 december 1999 although trains had been running through station without stopping since 20 november 1999 thumb left platform edge doors on eastbound jubilee line platform station s architecture is an austere combination of concrete and stainless steel with stacked banks of escalators supported from cross bracing structures spanning station box and routes for passengers entering or leaving station separated from those changing between lines as with other underground stations on extension jubilee line platforms feature platform edge doors to improve airflow through system and increase safety station design won a number of awards including civic trust awards in 2000 and 2002 royal fine art commission millennium building of year award in 2000 and riba award for architecture in 2001 both projects were jointly short listed in 2001 for riba s prestigious stirling prize design
