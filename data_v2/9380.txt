history pontoon bridge proposals thumb mf hordaland at skjersholmane in early 1990s first recorded proposal for a connection between bomlo and stord was made in 1960s by sheriff and later mayor of fitjar finn christened island road he proposed a series of eleven bridges and causeways which would run from in fitjar via to in bomlo while local politicians were not opposed to plan recent municipal merger between bomlo and made them prioritize other sectors and project was abandoned without any official investigations hauge 32 a new route was launched by bomlo mayor who proposed a pontoon bridge which would cross stokksundet he was inspired by plans to build what would become bridge north of bergen in 1973 municipal councils of bomlo stord and fitjar decided to launch a planning process which concluded that a pontoon bridge between sorstokken and foldroyholmen would be optimal report also considered bridges across fitjar archipelago and a crossing via spissoy and foyno there were protests from wichmann who were concerned about their operations if sound was closed for shipping traffic similar protests also came from shipping industry who wished to continue using stokksundet protests were not remedied by plans including a suspension bridge across foldroysundet to illustrate their point one shipowner let two of his ships cross in middle of foldroysundet hauge 33 shipping industry received support from norwegian coastal administration and plans were abandoned in 1974 in early 1980s plans for stord airport sorstokken were launched bridge plans across stokksundet were again brought up in 1982 as industry on bomlo wanted to not have use a ferry to reach airport a committee with representatives from all three municipalities was established in may 1983 to look into possibilities for a bridge led by bomlo mayor arne m it issued engineer harald task to author a report and recommendation he made three proposals a pontoon or suspension bridge between and a suspension bridge between and which would terminate just south of new airport and a combined fixed link between spissoy and digernes without passing via fitjar archipelago latter was first time a fixed link to mainland was proposed norwegian civil aviation administration protested against a possible suspension bridge near airport but stated that one closer further away would be fine hauge 34 mapping of traffic patterns on bomlo was undertaken by hordaland public roads administration in 1984 and based on this and other feedback a pontoon bridge between foldroyholmen and sorstokken was recommended it was estimated to cost nok 190 million in addition to auxiliary roads for nok 40 million following opening of vardo tunnel in 1982 first subsea tunnel in norway engineer finn d e proposed a fixed link which involved a combined bridge road and tunnels between islands including a suspension bridge over digernessundet a causeway and low bridge onwards to a subsea tunnel under spissoysundet and a low bridge over gassasundet in addition a long tunnel would have had to be constructed from foyno to in sveio thumb left mf at skjersholmane in late 1990s company johannes sorlie launched an all tunnel proposal in 1985 which would cost nok 700 million and give of subsea tunnel connecting bomlo to stord and mainland committee was positive to proposals while josef director of hordaland public roads administration stated that project was unrealistic sveio municipality was subsequently invited as a member of planning committee on 14 may 1985 committee voted to encourage municipal councils to pass planning which involved a bridge across sorstokken and aimed to get plans into norwegian road plan 1990 1993 committee continued its work until it dissolved itself in october 1986 and was replaced by limited company sunnhordland bru og tunnelselskap as sbt company was owned by municipalities of bomlo stord fitjar and sveio hordaland county municipality and banks bergen bank sparebanken vest haugesund bank and christiania bank hauge 35 a new master plan for project was completed by public roads administration in december 1986 it proposed four main routes via fitjar archipelago via with a pontoon bridge to sorstokken a suspension bridge from to or via spissoy and foyno to digernes they recommended choosing pontoon bridge sbt stated that this was only to be a first stage and that a second stage should involve a tunnel to mainland in a sbt and representatives for shipping industry at end of 1986 it was decided that sbt would start working for a mainland connection that would not hinder sailing hauge 36 a report published by sbt in 1987 looked at details for a subsea tunnel to mainland it was first official document to use triangle link term although this had previously been used by press a delegation traveled to washington state in united states and british columbia in canada to look at their seven pontoon bridges while seismic surveys were undertaken in bomlafjorden sbt changed its name to sunnhordland bru og tunnelselskap and a majority of board shifted towards being in favor of a fixed link issue became subject of major local debate and was supplemented by a demand from residents in southern bomlo that they did not want to lose their ferry service which would be faster than driving via fixed link hauge 37 opposition coastal administration stated that they would not allow a pontoon bridge hauge 38 sbt decided on 26 june 1987 to work towards receiving permission to collect advanced tolls on ferry services hauge 39 on 16 september they unanimously supported triangular proposal which was estimated to cost nok 660 million hauge 40 this was criticized by hordaland public roads administration who stated that it would take longer time to plan and thus complete triangle link hauge 42 a poll from january 1988 showed that 78 6 percent of population of bomlo wanted triangle link while 8 6 percent wanted pontoon bridge on 6 january sbt started negotiating loans with various banks to receive financial guarantees for triangle link and by february sufficient funding had been secured hauge 44 from 1988 environmentalists started actively opposing triangle link most active was local chapter of norwegian society for conservation of nature which stated that road would have serious consequences for local boat traffic to recreational islands of foyno and nautoy instead they recommended that municipalities chose a pontoon bridge hauge 49 an action group was established hallgeir stated that stord had a lack of beaches and that two islands were last low forested islands in area after paradise had been converted to an industrial area for aker stord during 1970s hauge 50 he further stated that environmentalists were skeptical to floating bridges but that in this case it would be lesser of two evils stord society for conservation of nature applied for municipal grants to make a critical report but this was rejected by majority of municipal council by june a new chapter had been established on bomlo and group stated that it was irresponsible to build a link which would result in a massive increase in car use future in our hands started a petition which collected 1 600 signatures a poll from 1990 showed that in stord 35 percent were in favor of project while 36 7 percent were opposed given that ferry service was improved among other things with night ferries and increased comfort another opponent to project was action committee against a hasty construction of triangle link who wanted to delay decision until after 1991 municipal elections to ensure that municipal councils had backing in public hauge 51 tjong was another opponent who stated that risk in project was large and that it was uncertain how long tolls would last they could just as well last 60 as 15 years instead he wanted to use advanced tolls and fuel fees place income in bank and then pay whole fixed link with accumulated funds most of opposition against project was from stord while in bomlo there was overwhelming support however in southern bomlo there were concerns that they would lose their ferry as they would have a much longer rout to haugesund via triangle link some also stated that it was necessary to keep a ferry for people with fear of tunnels hauge 52 political processes thumb entrance to bomlafjord tunnel from mainland bomlo municipal council voted unanimously in favor of triangle link on 22 february 1988 two days later issue was discussed in stord municipal council olav at first proposed supporting pontoon bridge but after a trial vote he withdrew proposal and also stord supported triangle link following week sveio municipal council voted in favor triangle link without either a debate or dissent in council fitjar municipal council voted on 15 march to work with both proposals hauge 45 hordaland public roads administration still supported a pontoon bridge and stated that two and a half years of work on a master plan had been wasted a new master plan for triangle link was published in early 1989 estimating costs at nok 890 million it recommended that langevag buavag ferry remain but other four ferry services be terminated hauge 46 report concluded that maintenance costs of fixed link would be lower than subsidies of ferry that project would be economical of society and would reduce emissions hauge 47 during late 1989 advance tolls on ferries were approved by municipal councils and county council who recommended that collection start from 1 july 1990 but this was not immediately supported by government on 18 and 19 september 1990 standing committee on transport and communications visited region and looked at proposed areas of triangle link hardanger bridge and folgefonna tunnel by then it had been established that triangle link would not need state grants as it could be entirely financed with tolls tore haugen conservative parliamentarian from akershus proposed that project be considered independent of regular national road plans however lars gunnar lie minister of transport and communications from christian democratic party stated that he planned a single report to parliament for all three projects hauge 48 in 1991 master plan was appealed by norwegian society for conservation of nature to ministry of transport and communications appeal was seconded by norwegian directorate for nature management in 1991 municipal election socialist left party was only party which was opposed to fixed link and they received a large increase in votes hauge 54 increasing for 7 to 21 percent in stord same year dag hareide in norwegian society for conservation of nature started lobbying up towards national politicians in an attempt to stop issue in parliament high profile people who were opposed to project included per stale and kenneth issue of advanced tolls was reviewed by county council on 23 october 1991 where 64 voted in favor and 19 were opposed latter representing socialist left party red electoral alliance and progress party in june 1992 county council was asked to prioritize between hardanger bridge and triangle link as there would not be sufficient state grants to build both projects both would require between nok 200 and 300 million and it would not be possible to start both projects in period from 1994 to 1997 hauge 57 in council meeting on 18 june 1992 a proposal to waiver prioritization was rejected council then with 44 against 30 votes chose to prioritize hardanger bridge which received most votes from labour and centre party conservative party was only party for which all votes were cast in favor of triangle link socialist left party s proposal to build neither received 11 votes hauge 58 in july master plan was passed by council of state hauge 59 on 10 december 1992 parliament approved advanced payment of tolls on ferry which were made effective from 1 january 1993 ticket prices increased with between nok 10 and 12 this resulted in protests from ferry employees who stated that they would have to collect tolls which would remove their jobs norwegian seafarers union representatives stated that they considered suing state hauge 60 work on development plan started in 1992 it included safety and environmental improvements which increased project s cost by nok 200 million in may 1994 it was made subject to consultative statements norwegian road plan 1994 97 was considered by parliament during 1993 minister of transport and communications kjell opseth of labour party stated that he wanted to equally prioritize triangle link and hardanger bridge but that it would be unrealistic to build both in same period at a county council meeting on 21 april 1993 council decided with 60 against 20 votes that county would not prioritize between two projects hauge 61 opseth subsequently stated that in his opinion triangle link should be prioritized in 1995 a report on coastal highway e39 was presented which recommended that skjersholmane valevag ferry be removed hauge 62 particularly within labour party there was disagreement about whether or not to build hardanger bridge hauge 63 in addition to crossing hardangerfjord there were concerns that bridge would increase traffic through hardangervidda national park and that it subsequently would result in an all year road being built with subsequent negative impact on nature and wildlife prime minister gro harlem brundtland of labour party stated on 10 october 1995 that government was in favor of triangle link and opposed to hardanger bridge when standing committee visited two projects in 1996 they were met by demonstrators in favor of bridge in hardanger and demonstrators in opposition to fixed link in sunnhordland in may sbt proposed building a culvert on digernes as a compromise for a proposal from labour party and christian democratic party to consider other solution which could have postponed project several years parliament decided on 11 june 1996 with 144 against 20 votes to build triangle link folgefonna tunnel was also passed while hardanger bridge was put aside hauge 64 construction construction started on 15 february 1997 before first blast could be taken by county mayor representatives for and youth and people s movement against triangle link had to be moved only police officer at festivities was sheriff reidar faerestrand who was not dressed in his police uniform and had not brought with him his badge demonstrators did not move until a police boat had been sent with necessary documentation and faerestrand could prove his identity as a law enforcer elin lerum boasson of nature and youth stated that it was a day of sorrow hauge 66 thumb left stord bridge with stord to left core samples showed that tunnel would have to be built deeper than originally planned to avoid deposits hauge 67 tunneling was undertaken by ncc eeg henriksen from foyno side and by norwegian public roads administration from sveio side hauge 108 construction from sveio started on 16 september 1997 and from foyno on 6 march 1998 hauge 156 tunnel was built at an average speed of per week with record being lowest point was reached on 5 may 1999 and breakthrough took place on 2 september five months before schedule sixty people participated in a course to master fear of tunnels organized by toll company hauge 90 when it opened tunnel was longest and second deepest subsea tunnel in europe and norway after tunnel stord and bomla bridges were both constructed using same method and by same contractors triangle contractor a joint venture between ncc eeg henriksen and steel structures hauge 77 construction started on stord bridge on 20 february 1999 after pylons were completed hauge 105 two catwalks were erected between them with constructors choosing a continual catwalk instead of three separate ones cables were spun on site using a reel this also allowed for cost savings as reels could be used two times cables were spun using air spinning with controlled tension which allowed spinning with little space use and with a crew with limited experience with spinning hauge 80 two bridges were first time that on site spinning was used in norway fastening poles were delivered five weeks after schedule a new mounting method was developed which allowed them to be installed in a quarter of time in part by using a helicopter and whole five week delay was eradicated this allowed deck sections to be installed as scheduled hauge 82 decks were produced in schiedam netherlands for stord bridge and in italy for bomlo bridge these were sent by barge to sunnhordland hauge 86 section length was different between two bridges stord bridge having them in lengths of and bomla bridge in sections of this was to accommodate latter s smaller vertical curvature hauge 83 entire project cost nok 1 814 million costs were distributed to nok 476 million for bomlafjord tunnel nok 433 million for stord bridge nok 336 million for bomla bridge nok 46 million for spissoy bridge nok 36 million for digernes tunnel nok 325 million for roadways and nok 172 for administration and common

general of norway criticized western norway public roads administration in 2001 for a total cost overrun of nok 900 million in three projects triangle link laerdal tunnel and parts of national road 555 majority of cost overruns were tied to triangle link as a consequence minister of transport torild skogsholm stated that future large road investments would have an external quality assurance before being presented to parliament opening and operation thumb bomla bridge first part of link between stord and sveio including stord bridge and bomlafjord tunnel was taken into use on 27 december 2000 official opening and national road 542 opening took place on 30 april 2001 opening of first stage allowed two ferry services to be replaced skjersholmane valevag ferry which connected stord to
