mycena overholtsii commonly known as snowbank fairy helmet or fuzzy foot is a species of fungus in family mycenaceae mushrooms produced by fungus are relatively large for genus mycena with convex grayish caps up to in diameter and stems up to long gills on underside of cap are whitish to pale gray and initially closely spaced before becoming well spaced at maturity after cap enlarges mushrooms are characterized by dense covering of white hairs on base of stem m overholtsii is an example of a snowbank fungus growing on well decayed conifer logs near snowbanks during or just after snowmelt formerly known only from high elevation areas of western north america particularly rocky mountain and cascade regions it was reported for first time in japan in 2010 edibility of mushroom is unknown m overholtsii can be distinguished from other comparable species by differences in location or spore size history and naming species was first described by mycologists alexander h smith and wilhelm solheim in 1953 on basis of specimens collected in medicine bow mountains of albany county wyoming specific epithet honors early 20th century american mycologist lee oras overholts it is commonly known as snowbank fairy helmet or fuzzy foot although it shares latter name with and campanella m overholtsii has been given japanese name description mycena overholtsii produces some of largest mushrooms of genus mycena they have caps that are in diameter and convex in shape developing an umbo a central protrusion resembling a nipple in maturity cap surface is smooth moist and marked with radial striations caps are somewhat hygrophanous and depending on age and state of hydration range in color from brown or grayish brown to dark or bluish gray mushroom flesh is thin and watery with a light gray color gills have an adnate adnexed or shallowly decurrent attachment to stem and are initially closely spaced before becoming well spaced at maturity they have a whitish to pale gray color and will stain gray when they are bruised there are three or four tiers of lamellulae short gills that do not extend fully from cap margin to stem interspersed between gills stem is long by thick and tapers upward so that stem apex is slightly thinner than base it can be straight or curved has cartilage like flesh and is hollow in maturity when growing on soft well decayed wood stem often penetrates deeply into substrate stem is pinkish brown in color and lower half is tomentose densely covered with white woolly hairs mushroom has a yeast like odor and a mild taste its edibility is unknown but it is not considered poisonous microscopic characteristics viewed in deposit as with a spore print spores appear white microscopically spores are roughly elliptical sometimes appearing bean shaped with dimensions of 5 5 7 0 by 3 0 3 5 mm they are thin walled and smooth and bear an indistinct hilar appendage spores are amyloid meaning they will absorb iodine and turn black to blue black when stained with melzer s reagent basidia spore bearing cells are four spored cheilocystidia cystidia on gill edge which are scattered and interspersed with basidia are roughly cylindric to fusoid spindle shaped smooth hyaline translucent and measure 45 65 by 2 5 5 mm pleurocystidia cystidia on gill face are uncommon and similar in appearance to cheilocystidia cap cuticle is an ixocutis a fungal tissue type in which hyphae are gelatinous and lie flat with mostly smooth hyphae that are 1 5 3 5 mm in diameter cap flesh is dextrinoid meaning it will turn reddish brown in melzer s reagent clamp connections are present in hyphae of m overholtsii similar species other similar that grow in clusters on wood include m maculata and m galericulata fruit bodies of m maculata often develop red stains as they mature but this characteristic is inconsistent and cannot be reliably used for identification its spores are larger than that of m overholtsii measuring 7 10 by 4 6 mm m galericulata is very similar in appearance to m maculata but does not undergo reddish staining its spores are 8 12 by 5 5 9 mm another similar species is m which can be distinguished by its bleach like odor an eastern north american distribution fruiting season during summer and autumn and small spores measuring 4 5 by 2 5 3 mm habitat and distribution this species is sometimes found singly but more often in clusters on well rotted conifer logs and stumps often douglas fir near melting snowbanks or sometimes in moist snow chambers formed by receding snow cool nighttime temperatures reduce snowmelt rate and help ensure that spores released by mushroom will be dispersed into soil mushroom is common in western north america particularly pacific northwest rocky mountains and cascade mountains it has been reported in four us states south dakota california washington and wyoming but is not known in oregon it is also found in western canada mushroom is restricted to areas with minimum elevations of in 2010 it was reported growing in boreal coniferous forests of hokkaido japan in plantations of sakhalin fir abies sachalinensis as well as in natural forests dominated by both sakhalin fir and spruce picea in north america mushroom usually appears between march and july japanese collections were made in may fruiting period can be prolonged especially in areas with heavy snowfall or at high elevations where snowmelt is delayed references external links category fungi described in 1953 overholtsii category fungi of asia category fungi of north america category snowbank
