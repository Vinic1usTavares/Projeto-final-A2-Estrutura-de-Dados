constructed a consistent theory of value price cost and production in context of emphasizing time valuational element in all consumption and production choices ebeling richard book review 15 great austrian economists freedom daily june 2000 future of freedom foundation according to jeffrey herbener fetter asserted that just as price of each consumer good is determined solely by subjective value rate of interest is determined solely by time preference likewise herbener explains this led fetter to also conclude that t he rental price of each producer good is imputed to it by entrepreneurial demand and is equal to its discounted marginal value product capital value of each durable good is equal to discounted value of its future rents fetter s contribution to austrian subjectivist

interest that fisher had earlier espoused in his 1907 book rate of interest a tome which had heavily influenced fetter as murray rothbard recounts upon further review of fisher s earlier work fetter discovered that seeds of error were in fisher s publication of 1907 fisher had stated that valuations of present and future goods imply a preexisting money rate of interest thereby suggesting that a pure time preference explanation of interest involves circular reasoning by way of contrast and in course of explaining his own pure time preference or capitalization theory of interest fetter showed that time valuation is prerequisite to determination of market rate of interest rothbard murray n fetter radical introduction to capital interest and rent institute for humane studies kansas city
