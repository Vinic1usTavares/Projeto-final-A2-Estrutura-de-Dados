8 1981 district judge lee roy west recused himself from case being an alumnus of university of oklahoma for both his undergraduate and law degrees judge juan guerrero burciaga of new mexico was then appointed to hear case at 1 during trial ncaa claimed that it was a voluntary organization and if plaintiffs or other schools did not wish to abide by ncaa rules they were free to terminate their membership it was shown that amount of money paid by abc to teams appearing on television was established by thomas c hansen ncaa television program director universities were not allowed to negotiate their own terms burciaga pointed out an example of control and price fixing by noting that in 1981 oklahoma and university of southern california both then ranked in top 5 of ap poll and coaches poll appeared on 200 stations in a regional broadcast on same weekend abc televised a game between citadel and appalachian state on four stations all four teams received same amount of money for appearing burciaga found that not only did ncaa engage in price fixing they acted to limit production by restricting number of games that could be broadcast ncaa further threatened universities with a group boycott if they did not agree to terms dictated by ncaa he noted that abc had encouraged ncaa to seek an exemption from antitrust laws from congress but that ncaa did not believe that they could obtain exemption burciaga then examined conduct of ncaa under both rule and rule of reason finding that ncaa violated antitrust laws under both evaluations burciaga issued both a declaratory judgment and a permanent injunction prohibiting ncaa from interfering with individual universities television contracts and declaring ncaa abc contract null and void ncaa then appealed decision to tenth

arico at 437 circuit court of appeals tenth circuit heard case before chief judge james e barrett and judges james k logan and stephanie k seymour in appeal ncaa argued that oklahoma and georgia did not have standing to bring suit claiming that schools suffered no actual injury logan who wrote opinion flatly rejected that argument ncaa ii 707 f 2d at 1147 court then turned to whether case should be evaluated under rule or rule of reason deciding on rule court rejected ncaa arguments that television plan promoted live attendance that it promoted balanced athletic competition and that televised football competed with other non sports programs court noted that ncaa plan restricted output and affirmed trial court s ruling while also holding that district court erred in ruling television plan and contract constituted a group boycott bd of regents 468 u s at 85 ncaa ii 707 f 2d at 1147 arico at 437 chief judge barrett dissented believing that restraints were reasonable under rule of reason and that ncaa has an overwhelming interest in preserving amateur nature of intercollegiate athletics he would have reversed district court quashed injunction and held that there was no antitrust violation ncaa again appealed and supreme court granted to hear case bd of regents 468 u s at 85 opinion of court arguments frank h easterbrook argued case for ncaa and andy coats represented oklahoma and georgia united states solicitor general rex e lee filed an brief in support of oklahoma and georgia and argued cause to court other briefs were filed by national federation of state high school associations supporting ncaa and association of independent television stations supporting oklahoma and georgia majority opinion thumb right alt portrait of justice john paul stevens justice john p stevens author of majority opinion justice john paul stevens delivered opinion of court stevens stated that there can be no doubt that challenged practices of ncaa constitute a restraint of trade but noted not all restraints of trade were unreasonable and that only an unreasonable restraint was prohibited by sherman antitrust act stevens noted that a league governing body was necessary for sporting events to take place and determined that rule of reason not rules applied to case arico at 437 stevens determined that since ncaa restrained price and output it created a system that was unrelated to a free and competitive market 1 1 52 1 1 53 supp 2004 since ncaa television plan constituted a restraint of trade on its face it placed burden on ncaa of establishing an affirmative defense that would justify deviation from a free market bd of regents 468 u s at 85 arico at 437 hartley at 76 81 stevens then went through justifications that were offered by ncaa first although ncaa claimed that television plan was a joint venture he noted that unlike broadcast music inc v columbia broadcast system inc broadcast music inc v columbia broadcast system inc ncaa was not acting as a selling agent and that sales occurred in a noncompetitive market stevens evaluated ncaa s claim that television plan enhanced competitiveness of college football since district court found no efficiencies from arrangement stevens rejected this justification he also said that there was no need to penetrate market against competitors stevens likewise rejected defense that television plan was designed to protect live attendance stating ncaa s argument that its television plan is necessary to protect live attendance is not based on a desire to maintain integrity of college football as a distinct and attractive product but rather on a fear that product will not prove sufficiently attractive to draw live attendance when faced with competition from televised games bd of regents 468 u s at 85 arico at 437 hartley at 76 81 ncaa position that an interest in maintaining a competitive balance justified television plan was also rejected while agreeing with desire to maintain such a balance stevens noted that there was no evidence that plan succeeded in that effort decision of circuit court was affirmed bd of regents 468 u s at 85 hartley at 76 81 seiken at 56 62 dissent thumb left alt portrait of justice byron white justice byron white author of dissent justice byron white joined by justice william rehnquist dissented from majority opinion white a former college football star at colorado stated that while intercollegiate athletics bore a superficial resemblance to professional sports it was clear that other non commercial goals played main role its actions are based on unique nature of college athletics and white felt that restrictions were reasonable he would have overturned circuit court white did not find majority s deference to district court s economic findings and was not convinced that oklahoma nor georgia had shown either an increase in prices or a decrease in output bd of regents 468 u s at 85 arico at 437 hartley at 76 81 seiken at 56 62 subsequent developments as a direct result of this ruling more games were televised which had initial effect of driving television revenues down koch at 9 this trend reversed and by 2005 notre dame had signed a contract with nbc to broadcast all home games for a five year period seiken at 56 62 in 2009 10 university of texas at austin reported profits of almost 69 million just from football most of this money was earned in television contracts before ut added its own longhorn network which will pay approximately 15 million per year 183 85 2012 major conferences have reshuffled multiple times most dramatically in early 2010s and landscape of college football has changed significantly individual universities their associated athletic conferences and individual bowl games continue to
