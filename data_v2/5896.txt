as part of 1935 40 new works programme misaligned tunnels of central section on central line that slowed running speeds were corrected and platforms lengthened to accommodate longer trains bakerloo line thumb left bakerloo line platform 1906 in november 1891 notice was given of a private bill that would be presented to parliament for construction of baker street and waterloo railway bs wr now bakerloo line railway was planned to run entirely underground from marylebone to elephant castle via baker street and waterloo route was approved in 1900 construction commenced in august 1898 under direction of sir benjamin baker w r galbraith and r f church works were carried out by perry company of works bow oxford circus was altered below ground following a board of trade inspection at end of 1905 first test trains began running official opening of bs wr by sir edwin cornwall took place on 10 march 1906 first section of bs wr was between baker street and lambeth north then known as kennington road victoria line a proposal for a new underground railway running from victoria to walthamstow was first proposed by a working party set up by british transport commission in 1948 though that largely followed a 1946 plan for an east croydon to finsbury park line a route was approved in 1955 with future extensions to be decided later though funding for construction was not approved by government until 1962 construction began in 1962 on initial walthamstow to victoria section where cross platform interchange were to be provided at oxford circus victoria line platforms opened on 7 march 1969 station opened as part of a second extension from warren street to victoria cross platform interchange between bakerloo and victoria lines was provided by constructing victoria line platforms parallel to bakerloo ones incidents and accidents on 13 february 1976 a bomb left in a case at station by provisional ira was discovered and safely defused station at height of afternoon rush hour was evacuated on 23 november 1984 during renovation works station suffered a severe fire which burned out northbound victoria line platform it is believed that fire was caused by smoking materials being pushed through a ventilation grille into a storeroom where they set several materials on fire this caused victoria line between warren street and victoria to be suspended until 18 december same year this incident also led to a smoking ban being introduced on trains in july 1984 on 3 march 1997 a train derailment caused northbound bakerloo line service between piccadilly circus and oxford circus to be suspended for 12 days on 11 august 2017 a fire occurred on a bakerloo line train which was evacuated at oxford circus services were suspended between elephant and castle and paddington station building bakerloo and central lines clr and had separate surface buildings and lift shafts station buildings which remain today as exits from station were built on very confined plots on either side of argyll street on south side of oxford street just east of circus itself stations as originally built were entirely separate but connecting passages were soon provided at platform level surviving central london railway building to east of argyll street is best surviving example of stations designed by harry bell measures and bakerloo line building to west is a classic leslie green structure both are grade ii listed since 20 july 2011 thumb busy central line platform as seen in december 2004 showing its narrow width almost from outset overcrowding has been a constant problem and there have been numerous improvements to facilities and below ground arrangements to deal with this after much discussion between then two separate operators a major reconstruction began in 1912 this entailed a new ticket hall serving both lines being built in basement of bakerloo station with bakerloo lifts removed and new deep level escalators opened down to bakerloo line level access to clr was by way of existing deep level subways new works came into use on 9 may 1914 with clr lifts still available for passengers by 1923 even this rearrangement was unable to cope so a second rebuilding began this involved a second set of escalators being built directly down to central line and clr station building becoming exit only on 2 october 1928 a third escalator leading to bakerloo platforms was opened unusually lifts came back into prominence at an underground station when in 1942 a set of high speed lifts came into use largely used as an exit route from central line platforms directly to argyll street exit building station was closed between 31 august and 20 november 1939 to facilitate flood protection works for preparation of second world war although street access was closed trains still called and interchange between bakerloo and central lines was still possible within station victoria line station reconstruction to accommodate victoria line was described as most time consuming for victoria line project to handle additional victoria line passenger loads a new ticket hall was constructed directly under road junction separate banks of escalators to each line were to be built with existing structure to be used as exits with lifts to be removed a new one way interchange subways system was to be built between bakerloo victoria lines and central line to excavate new ticket hall below roadway traffic was diverted for five and a half years august 1963 to easter 1968 onto a temporary bridge like structure known as umbrella covering regent street oxford street intersection it consisted of 245 pieces of separate prefabricated steel work deck plates were placed on top of a system of steel girders which in turn rested on 25 cylindrical 3 ft diameter concrete foundations sunk from 43 up to 73 ft deep at night cylindrical piles had to clear sites of main and secondary roof beams of new ticket hall and various low level obstructions piles had to be built with wide footings to avoid them from collapsing service tunnels were constructed to carry water mains and telecom cables past new ticket hall umbrella deck was extended eastwards along oxford street to facilitate construction of a connecting passageway between old and new ticket halls during weekend of august bank holiday in 1966 construction of victoria line station tunnels with their platforms new escalator shafts and linking passages to central line platforms was carried out from access shafts sunk from nearby cavendish square upper regent street and argyll street for construction of southbound victoria line platform tunnel a special design of tunnel segment fabricated with mild steel was adopted as there was limited space available for construction of platform tunnel a pre stressed concrete raft was constructed below peter robinson s third basement level as an extra precaution against settlement before driving platform tunnel interchange passageway between central line and bakerloo line in area of former junction with bakerloo line lift landing was replaced by southbound victoria line platform tunnel from there a pilot tunnel ventilation systems were rearranged with a new ventilation plant installed in former bakerloo line lift shaft a new substation for bakerloo line was built at bottom of shaft with additional escalators in place one way circulation scheme was introduced and remaining lifts were removed station today in 2007 station underwent a major modernisation removing murals installed on central and bakerloo line platforms in 1980s and replacing them with plain white tiles in a style similar to those used when station opened in 1900 wall tiling on bakerloo line platforms featured station name and an individual geometric pattern and colour scheme designed by leslie green one 1980s mural remains on one of platforms central line platform works were substantially complete and a new station operations room at top level opened this enabled entire cctv system to be switched over to new digital technology original motifs designed by hans unger on victoria line platforms were restored which were originally installed in 1969 these motifs symbolise circle of oxford circus junction with criss crossed lines as bakerloo central and victoria lines oxford circus station has 14 escalators major escalator refurbishment took place in 2010 11 platform humps were also installed at station to provide step free access from platforms onto trains victoria line humps resemble in form harrington hump
