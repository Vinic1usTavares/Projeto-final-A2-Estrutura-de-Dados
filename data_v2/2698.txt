on task of establishing a beachhead and unloading stores this task was made more difficult though by a torrential downpour on 6 november nevertheless they were eventually able to establish themselves around pal mal mal plantation and patrols were sent out to locate japanese by 10 november patrols reached river and after contacting locals it was found that japanese were withdrawing towards gazelle peninsula where it was estimated that about 93 000 japanese were stationed due to size of japanese garrison as rest of 5th division began to arrive on island it was decided that australians would
