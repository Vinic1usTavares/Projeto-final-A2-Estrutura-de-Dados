release at 1997 tokyo game show sega announced project sonic a promotional campaign aimed at increasing market awareness of sonic hedgehog brand yuji naka creator of sonic hedgehog declared that phase one of project would introduce sonic jam as a compilation of games with several improvements rather than being direct ports at time of tokyo game show game was 88 complete according to naka purpose of project sonic was not only to increase consumer awareness but to renew excitement world once had regarding sega as sonic hedgehog was only initially successful outside of japan development began after release of nights into dreams in july 1996 after sonic team received letters from fans asking who sonic was sonic creators naka and naoto ohshima thought it was important to introduce people to sonic character which was basis for introducing project sonic to public until release of sonic jam studio had not worked on a sonic game since sonic knuckles in 1994 naka thought that sonic team had had a period to recharge our batteries and had new ideas sonic world was part of an experiment to see how a sonic hedgehog game would work in full 3d and served as a prototype for first fully 3d sonic game sonic adventure which began development for saturn but was moved to its successor dreamcast sonic world uses same engine as nights naka s refusal to share nights engine with sega technical institute sti team developing sonic x treme a factor in latter s cancellation may have been motivated by his preference for sonic team to create an original 3d sonic game naka later expressed relief that x treme was cancelled naka and ohshima said most difficult process was gathering game specific information in sonic world as there are so many games we have never even heard of sega s a big company and before we knew it lots of different game systems had sprung up including game gear master system and pico sonic jam was released in japan on 20 june 1997 and saturn version of sonic 3d island was

an average score of 77 at gamerankings based on an aggregate of four reviews game s 3d environment sonic world received mixed reviews lee nutter of sega saturn magazine said that it featured some of most astounding graphics witnessed on saturn rivalling those of super mario 64 he praised lack of clipping or glitching and commended 3d engine as truly remarkable glenn rubenstein from gamespot however was not impressed feeling it did not look as smooth as super mario 64 or crash bandicoot rubenstein praised unlockable content in particular ability to view japanese versions of sonic hedgehog cartoons and adverts electronic gaming monthly described 3d world as innovative and fun but too small to serve as anything more than a preview lead reviewer called it best game select screen ever created and emphasized that no one should buy compilation for 3d world alone game revolution found 3d graphics of interactive museum impressive but setup mundane they commended inclusion of sonic hedgehog commercials colin williamson of allgame said 3d presentation was gorgeous but felt overall experience was not as fun compared to super mario 64 and crash bandicoot special k from gamepro felt sonic jam served as a great permanent record of original sonic games steve o learly from hyper praised detailed graphics of sonic world saying that it showed saturn did perform well if programmed correctly although he thought that it did not appear as polished as super mario 64 reviewers largely praised inclusion of four sonic hedgehog genesis mega drive games nutter acknowledged that compilation may not be everyone s cup of tea and recommended that sonic jam was not worth purchasing if player already owned included games although he praised its value for money rubenstein criticised fact that game did not include sonic cd or sonic spinball stating that sega could have made a far more complete sonic collection by including more derivative games that were released he summarised that sonic jam was not a definitive sonic experience asserting that it had only been six years since original sonic hedgehog was released and perhaps most of us aren t quite nostalgic about it yet game revolution s reviewer echoed that compilation was merely a solid set of games that we ve seen before saying that game was not recommended if consumer was tired of rehashes but well worth thirty or forty bucks electronic gaming monthly team described games as old and outdated but still fun although williamson noted that there was a lot of exploring for player to do in sonic jam he expressed scepticism that majority of game was from yesterday and there were not enough new innovations o learly praised faithful and accurate replication of original games though he felt they were dated by contrast ed lomas of computer and video games considered it amazing how well games have aged in a 2014 retrospective staff of gamesradar praised sonic jam s loving presentation noting this
