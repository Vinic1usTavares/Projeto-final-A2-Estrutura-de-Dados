rock band fluffy band formed in london in late 1994 by singer and guitarist amanda rootes guitarist bridget jones bassist helen storer and drummer angie adams unsatisfied with britpop invasion at time band sought to recapture punk rock phenomenon according to rootes we want to infiltrate and conquer masses it s like americans think english music s shit cause it is we want england to gain a little respect that we haven t had for a while band also felt more comfortable in north america than in uk because british press can t handle concept of a sexually frank all girl band name of band comes from a lesbian novel titled fluffy butch which rootes thought was funny after turning down a number of record labels band signed to enclave a record label run by a r executive tom zutaut who had previously signed guns n roses to geffen rootes felt that zutaut was great very american very cool very into his artists black eye was recorded at metropolis studios in london and produced by punk rock veteran bill price who had recorded albums by sex pistols and clash album was recorded live in studio and music was not arranged by producer in order to achieve a rough live sound according to rootes price just recorded us live while we were playing we did things like putting different guitar tracks on top and stuff like that i did vocals at different times but we really wanted to get a live sound drums were recorded in a stone room using a basic kit that was modeled after a ringo starr reissue model which resulted in a slightly distorted sound album was mastered by george marino at sterling sound in new york city music and lyrics musically black eye was described by carrie of billboard as pure hardcore punk delivered with a raunchy abrasive vocal assault from rootes aaron axelsen music director at modern rock kits opined that band is a real indie edgy version of elastica but not britpop they fit into that hole l7 salt edgy thing band however felt insulted when journalists compared them to elastica because they think sound of elastica is too clean as rootes recalls i admit every time me and bridged cleaned our house we put elastica on despite this she considers elastica along with sex pistols and buzzcocks as only uk bands among her favorites band cited sex pistols new york dolls and stooges as their musical influences they also preferred sex pistols over clash according to rootes sex pistols are political in a great teenage fuck you way clash are political in a mature way like they ve done politics in a levels lyrics of black eye deal with sexual and abuse topics nothing you will likely hear on radio rootes explained song hypersonic named after best selling vibrator in england celebrates joys of vibrator use title track black eye is about domestic violence rootes remarked when i was up my dad was really violent i knew it was something i had to write a song about to get it out of my system song inspired album cover which depicts a cat holding a mouse in its jaw rootes explained that mouse s black eye represents a moment of serenity before it dies similarly song scream deals with rape issues while dirty old bird is about spousal abuse track technicolour yawn is about unpleasant effect of a hangover psychofudge is about drug usage and cheap deals with one s loss of virginity and subsequent feel of becoming sort of cheap and common not all songs from album explore social issues songs i wanna be your lush and too famous use satire to criticise superior attitudes of male musicians while husband disapproves gruff and pushy boyfriends band also clarified that they have nothing against men as rootes notes men are great we love them we re talking about dickhead men not all men band considered themselves more of a pro girl band than a feminist band rootes told select so many girls are afraid to be girls apart from courtney love who s really feminine and uses her sexuality and is a strong woman i don t think women should dress like boys that s what s great about pj harvey she was boyish and now she s gone really glam she looks amazing and she s become an icon a real woman promotion and release thumb 240px right prior to album release fluffy

for black eye under direction of floria sigismondi critical reception upon release black eye received mixed to positive reviews from music critics tom sinclair writing for entertainment weekly stated that album barrels forward with such high spirited hookiness that it s possible to forgive shameless pandering of lyrics like i wanna be your kitten caress my fur in a very positive review prominent music critic robert christgau felt that most of songs live up to underlining and considered album to be best punk debut since ones by ramones sex pistols clash and wire allmusic reviewer tom demalon praised loud guitar playing of both rootes and jones and opined that lack of dynamic diversity makes black eye somewhat of a one trick pony but it s a trick that makes album s strongest tracks a joy nick duerden of q magazine remarked that black eye sounds like a cross between stooges and courtney love and despite boasting musical dexterity of status quo it s a short sharp shock that dispatches its venom with a tireless guile similarly critic roy wilkinson of select compared some songs favourably to stooges and early siouxsie and banshees however he noted that band seems intent on falling short of pj harvey s black bordered presence when was last time you heard yeovil delta blues sound enlivened by such carry on riffing isms as i ve rocketed to uranus nothing and when kids scream there is a racket you ve got a magnificent packet too famous in a negative review darren of drop d magazine criticised lyrics for their vague observations about obvious truths stating only shocking thing about black eye lies in a band trying to pass themselves off as riot when in fact they pack as much grrr as a slightly vexed yorkshire terrier in contrast colin weston of drowned in sound commented thing about fluffy is they aren t most lyrically challenging of bands but their music more makes up for it and what they do say you understand immediately not messing about with deep and meaningful lyrics these girls have got something to say and say it only way they know how in your face although black eye was not ranked in top 40 of village voices pazz jop critics poll for 1996 christgau placed it at number 3 in his own dean s list track listing personnel credits are adapted from album s liner notes fluffy amanda rootes vocals guitar bridget jones guitar helen storer bass angie adams
