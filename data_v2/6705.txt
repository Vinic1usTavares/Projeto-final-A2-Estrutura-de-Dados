and writing in 1938 french film industry was booming and renoir was at height of his career he had had three consecutive hit films and la grande illusion had won awards from new york film critics national board of review and venice film festival financial success of la bete humaine made it easy for renoir to secure enough financial backing to form his own production company in 1938 he founded nouvelle edition francaise nef with his brother claude renoir together with andre zwobada oliver and camille francois all five invested 10 000 francs into company and intended to produce two films per year company was modeled after american film production company united artists which was formed in 1919 as a film distribution company for independent artists by charlie chaplin douglas fairbanks d w griffith and mary pickford renoir rallied his friends in film industry around company and got financial support from rene clair julien duvivier jean gabin and simone simon nef s headquarters on rue la grange was sublet from marcel pagnol s production company on december 8 1938 georges published a press release in paris soir announcing that renoir and pagnol were about to sign an agreement to procure a large theatre where they would publicly screen films that they would direct from then on rules of game was only film produced by company in may 1938 renoir completed historical drama la marseillaise and wanted to make a comedy he was also anxious about munich agreement and strong possibility of another world war and wanted to film a happy dream to subdue his pessimism he wrote a synopsis for a film called les millions d which had characters similar to those in rules of game when conceiving film renoir was inspired by classical french art such as works of pierre de marivaux pierre augustin caron de beaumarchais and especially alfred de musset s les caprices de marianne renoir initially intended to adapt classic french play les caprices de marianne nef first announced film as an adaptation of it renoir later said he never intended to directly adapt les caprices de marianne but only to re read it and other classics of french literature for inspiration after returning from lecturing in london in january 1939 renoir left paris to work on a script he told a reporter that his next film would be a precise description of bourgeois of our age renoir carl koch and zwoboda went to marlotte to work on script because renoir wanted to allow actors to improvise their dialogue only one third of film was scripted and rest was a detailed outline renoir later said that his ambition when i made film was to illustrate this remark we are dancing on a volcano renoir called film a divertissement for its use of baroque music and aspects of classical french comedies renoir s initial inspiration by les caprices de marianne led to film s four main characters correlating with those of play a virtuous wife a jealous husband a despairing lover and an interceding friend in both play and film interceding friend is named octave octave is also only of four characters inspired by play that shares traits with its counterpart in both works octave is a sad clown full of self doubt and self pity characters names constantly changed between versions of script renoir said that in an early draft andre jurieux was an orchestra conductor rather than an aviator casting right thumb 187px nora gregor in 1932 renoir re wrote character christine for austrian actress and reportedly fell in love with her during pre production renoir originally wanted entire cast of la bete fernand ledoux simone simon jean gabin and julien film gabin was offered role of andre but rejected it and accepted a role in marcel carne s le jour se leve instead he was replaced by roland toutain simon was offered role of christine but wanted 800 000 francs which was a third of film s entire budget simon s salary request was vetoed by nef administrator camille francois ledoux was offered role of schumacher he was married to simon at time he declined when her salary request was denied and instead took a role in maurice tourneur s volpone he was replaced by gaston modot claude dauphin was offered role of marquis de la chesnaye he refused it and instead acted with simon in raymond bernard s cavalcade d amour renoir then cast marcel dalio as marquis years later dalio asked renoir why he had been cast after having typically played burlesque or traitorous roles renoir told dalio he was opposite of cliche of what a marquis was and that dalio was only actor he knew that could portray character s insecurity renoir s brother pierre was cast as octave and carette was cast as marceau francois suggested newly famous stage actress michele alfa for role of christine and renoir went with his wife marguerite and zwobada to see her perform in a play while at play renoir noticed nora gregor in a box seat in audience and asked about her during intermission he learned that gregor was wife of prince ernst rudiger von stahremberg an austrian nobleman renoir became friends with gregor and her husband getting to know them over several dinners in paris stahremberg was forced to resign his leadership role in paramilitary fascist gregor was jewish and he was anti fascist when germany annexed austria in march 1938 gregor and stahremberg fled to france renoir said they were in a state of great disarray everything they believed in was collapsing gregor was an actress from viennese burgtheater and had appeared in some films including carl theodor dreyer s michael gregor s first husband had been concert pianist nikisch son of renowned conductor arthur nikisch of leipzig opera and according to film theorist charles a possible inspiration for some characteristics of octave despite objections from his nef colleagues renoir hired gregor for role of christine she was older than original character and he made changes to character based on gregor s personality and on their dinner conversations such as making christine daughter of an austrian conductor many of renoir s friends believed he fell in love with gregor shortly after casting her zwoboda said gregor had that which renoir loved above all an incontestable class a style gestures and bearing of a great distinction renoir said he cast gregor because of her austrian accent which he believed would create a little barrier between her and her surroundings and because of her appearance which he considered birdlike and sincere renoir finished casting remaining roles by late january 1939 when asked who main character of film was renoir answered there isn t any my conception at at to make a film d ensemble a film representing a society a group of persons almost a whole class and not a film of personal affairs filming filming for exterior scenes set in country began on february 15 1939 in sologne and outside chateau de la ferte saint aubin renoir later said he chose sologne because his father pierre august renoir regretted that he had never been able to paint it how well i understand sincerity of those regrets before these beautiful landscapes of sologne in astonishing colors of a grace so melancholy yet so gentle renoir said sologne s mist took me back to happy days of my childhood cast and crew arrived in sologne between february 6 and 15 dvd production history renoir s son alain

but simon was busy with other projects renoir finally cast himself later saying that he was just waiting for moment when pierre would say why don t you play role yourself jean he didn t have to ask me twice he added that after having gained experience and confidence as a director his most stubborn dream has been to be an actor renoir rewrote role of octave to better suit himself since he and pierre were physically and personally very different to raise additional funding for over running production zwoboda had used success of la bete humaine to sell advanced screening rights in large theatres to jean jay director of gaumont film company when shooting in sologne finally began progress was slow because of constant improvisations of renoir gregor s struggles with her role jay visited set and was

shortly afterwards several of film s electricians and technicians left to join army set designer eugene lourie left because he was jewish and a communist and max douy took over as film s set designer dvd max douy during filming renoir became disappointed by gregor s performance he began to cut her scenes and add new scenes for paulette dubost and mila parely film historian gerald mast found gregor

with a patriotic documentary about french history audience at screening consisted of members of right wing organisations who booed after a while into screening paulette dubost said people at screening fought and one person tried to set fire to theatre renoir said he depicted pleasant sympathetic characters but showed them in a society in process of disintegration so that they were defeated at onset

ended its run at colisee theatre after three weeks because of poor attendance it was later shown at aubert palace in paris renoir said of attendance i was utterly dumbfounded when it became apparent

release in france claude surveyed reviews of rules of game published in paris and said twelve were unqualifiedly unfavorable thirteen were favorable with reservations and ten were favorable many reviews criticized film for being unpatriotic frivolous and incomprehensible one mixed review came from nino frank of pour vous who called it a copious work even too much so very complex and profoundly intelligent from one end to other le figaro called it a bizarre spectacle which was one long succession of errors a heavy handed fantasy with wooly dialogue in 1943 edition of histoire du cinema robert brasillach wrote that rules of game was among renoir s most jumbled and confused films but applauded biting satire which he considered brasillach also praised technical variation employed by director and said film was an unrealized masterpiece in united states a negative review from variety said renoir attempts to crowd too many ideas into 80 minutes of film fare resulting in confusion according to francois truffaut film was very disconcerting to audiences at time because of its peculiar atmosphere which explains its commercial failure right thumb 250px nora gregor jean renoir pierre nay and pierre magnier during rabbit hunt scene renoir cut most of his own performance as octave after film s negative reception while film itself received mostly unfavorable reviews

point resulted in misconception that film has an alternative ending this was first reported by roger manvell after he watched it at its london premiere in 1946 at one point jean jay told renoir to restore film to 100 minute version to avoid commercial disaster but none of shorter versions improved its reception or attendance figures when asked about film s poor reception with audience members renoir said i thought i was gentle with them and they thought i was laughing at them in october 1939 rules of game was officially banned in france for being depressing morbid immoral and having an undesirable influence over young other films that were similarly banned included marcel carne s le quai des brumes and le jour se leve ministry of foreign affairs stated we are especially anxious to

on french society a sharp criticism of social pretenses reconstructed version of film was exhibited in france on april 23 1965 it won 1966 bodil award for best non american film best european film bedste europaeiske film in denmark themes rules of game is remembered as a commentary on moral callousness of european upper class and their servants just before beginning of world war ii while making film renoir knew a new world war was coming he later said there was a sense of it in film and wrote it is a war film and yet there is no reference to war this sense of doom began just before shooting started in january when barcelona fell to franco and throughout production when prime minister of france edouard daladier recognized francoist spain italy annexed albania and adolf hitler prepared his polish invasion renoir articulated this unmentioned theme of film by saying what is interesting about this film perhaps is moment when it was made it was shot between munich and war and i shot it absolutely impressed absolutely disturbed by state of mind of a part of french society a part of english society a part of world society and it seemed to me that a way of interpreting this state of mind to world hopefully was not to talk of that situation but tell a frivolous story i looked for inspiration to beaumarchais to marivaux to classical authors of comedy thumb 187px renoir s father pierre august renoir painted him in portrait of jean renoir as a hunter 1910 jean considered hunting to be cruel and did not film rules of games hunting scene himself renoir wanted to depict people as they truly were at that point in history he said rules of game was a reconstructed documentary a documentary on condition of a society at a given moment he believed this depiction was reason behind film s disastrous premiere saying audience s reaction was due to my candour marriage of figaro an inspiration for film had also been considered controversial for its attack on class system rules of game remained controversial with french public shortly after world war ii when it was once again banned renoir s biographer ronald bergan said film hit a raw nerve with public by depicting people who might have had an influence in shaping world but did nothing to prevent an advance of fascism some of whom indeed actually welcomed it rabbit hunt scene is often compared to senseless death that occurs during war renoir said he wanted to show a certain class of people killing for no reason renoir himself had never killed an animal and called hunting an abominable exercise in cruelty bergan saw analogy to world events and wrote in great set piece of hunt callous cruelty of guests is laid bare as they fire at any rabbit and bird that moves after have led game to slaughter film s most quoted line of dialogue spoken by octave is you see in this world there is one awful thing and that is that everyone has his reasons renoir s sentiment of objective humanism for film s characters is articulated by octave s remark and shows his empathy for people he was simultaneously criticizing richard roud praised renoir s role in film observing that renoir s honesty compelled him to include his own role in his social criticism he did not wish to stand outside and renoir octave serves as standard against which reality and fiction can be measured in his original outline for film renoir said he intended all characters to be sincere and that film would have no villains dvd notes p 11 renoir said andre was victim who trying to fit into a world in which he does not belong fails to respect rules of game and that andre thought he could shatter rules by a world flight while christine thought she could do same by following her heart dvd notes p 10 rules of film s title are its only villain renoir said world is made up of cliques each of these cliques has its customs its mores indeed its own language to put it simply each has its rules and these rules determine game renoir said all human activity is subject to social protocols that are less apparent than but just as strict as those practiced by louis xiv renoir s son alain said film continues to be relevant and popular because it shows artificial joy of modern age in contrast to rules of that or any age style filming emile zola s la bete humaine inspired renoir to make a break and perhaps get away from naturalism completely to try to touch on a more classical more poetic genre while shooting renoir began listening to baroque music by louis couperin jean philippe rameau jean baptiste lully and andre gretry he later said little by little my idea took shape and subject got simpler i kept living on baroque rhythms and after a few more days subject became more and more precise he also said he began imagining simone simon moving to spirit of music this preoccupation with baroque music during filming led to renoir s original idea of adapting les caprices de marianne into a film rules of game is known for its early and elaborate use of deep focus cinematography renoir said he and his cinematographer jean bachelet ordered some special lenses very fast lenses but ones that still gave us considerable depth so that we could keep our backgrounds in focus almost all time this depth of field in his shots allowed renoir to shoot in large rooms and long corridors in chateau sequences and characters were able to move freely between background and foreground approximately half of shots in film have camera movements in many shots camera moves stops in place changes direction and circles around subjects film critic david thomson said one has impression of a camera that is always moving to cover as much as possible one does not notice cuts one delights in a continuity which is often on verge of chaos and finally leads to tragedy in intrusion of subplot into plot of theatrical into real and of disaster into balances renoir used few close ups or reverse shots and most of shots are two shots hunt scene differs from rest of film it uses rapid editing whereas most of film uses long takes of dialogue or action renoir wanted to shoot film in color to take advantage of beauty of sologne in winter but he was unable to secure funding from jean jay one week before filming began renoir tried to persuade technicolor to fund color cinematography but company refused sound in film was complex for its time it included dialogue spoken over ambient noises such as crowds at airport and gunfire during hunt film director jean prat said film s soundtrack was of a perfection never equaled by any french film characters often talk at once or talk over each other s lines one example of dense soundtrack is party scene which includes dialogue over screams gunfire and music except for opening credits and very end of film all of music heard in film is incidental sound engineer was joseph de bretagne music used in film includes mozart s three german dances s le louis leon garnier and eugene rimbault s strauss s die saint saens s danse macabre chopin s minute waltz and scotto s a barbizon music was arranged by joseph and roger desormiere film s set designers eugene lourie and max douy built one of most expensive sets in french film history at joinville studio according to douy they were based on script and were not reproductions of interior of chateau de la ferte saint aubin where exterior scenes were shot music boxes used in film were borrowed from several sources and some are now in a museum in neuilly sur seine renoir thought musical organ scene and dalio s performance in it was best scene he had ever filmed he shot scene several times before he was satisfied with it costumes for film were designed by coco chanel legacy since its restoration rules of game has come to be regarded

in a perfect rococo frame but also an act of historical testimony its themes have been analyzed by film scholar and renoir s biographer leo who observed that film embodies a social world in which there are rules but no values if you don t know rules you are crushed but if you do know rules you are cut off from your own nature dudley andrew described film s complex social criticism dvd notes pp 5 6 while kenneth notes p 32 and peter cowie wrote about its sense of humanity dvd notes p 34 other critics have written about film s darker themes andrew sarris praised its depiction of class differences complexity of renoir s storytelling techniques have been examined by roger ebert who called it so simple and so labyrinthine so guileless and so angry so innocent and so dangerous that you
