pair skating is a figure skating discipline defined by international skating union isu as skating of two persons in unison who perform their movements in such harmony with each other as to give impression of genuine pair skating as compared with independent single skating s p id 2018 p 111 isu also states that a pairs team must consist of one lady and one man pair skating along with men s and women s single skating has been an olympic discipline since figure skating oldest winter olympic sport was introduced at 1908 summer olympics in london isu world figure skating championships introduced pair skating in 1908 like other disciplines pair skating competitions consist of two segments short program and free skating program there are seven required elements in short program which lasts 2 minutes and 40 seconds for both junior and senior pair teams free skating for pairs consists of a well balanced program composed and skated to music of pair s own choice for a specified period of time s p id 2018 p 117 it also should contain especially typical pair skating moves such as pair spins lifts partner assisted jumps spirals and other similar moves linked harmoniously by steps and other movements its duration like other disciplines is 4 minutes for senior teams and 3 1 2 minutes for junior teams pair skating required elements include lifts twist lifts throw jumps jumps spin combinations death spirals step sequences and choreographic sequences elements performed by pairs teams must be linked together by connecting steps of a different nature and by other comparable movements and with a variety of holds and positions pair skaters must only execute prescribed elements if they do not extra or unprescribed elements will not be counted in their score violations in pair skating include falls time music and clothing pair skating is most dangerous discipline in figure skating it has been compared to playing in national football league pair skaters have more injuries than skaters in other disciplines and women pair skaters have more injuries than male pair skaters background right thumb 150px german pair team madge syers and edgar syers at 1908 olympics

one man and that attention should be paid to selection of an appropriate partner pair skating along with men s and women s single skating has been an olympic discipline since figure skating oldest winter olympic sport was introduced at 1908 summer olympics in london isu world figure skating championships introduced pair skating along with women s singles also in 1908 according to writer ellyn kestnbaum rising popularity of skating during 19th century led to development of figure skating techniques especially various forms of hand in hand skating that would become basis of pair skating kestnbaum pp 61 62 madge syers first female figure skater to compete and win internationally stated that from beginning of introduction of pair skating in international competitions it was a popular sport for audiences to watch and that if pair are well matched and clever performers it is undoubtedly most attractive to watch syers stated that viennese skaters were responsible for pair skating s popularity at beginning of 20th century syers also credited austrians for adding dance moves to pair skating german pair skater heinrich burger in his article in irving brokaw s art of skating 1915 stated that he and his partner anna hubler inserted figures skated by single skaters into our several dances according to music until figures became more complicated and developed into a different appearance as burger put it fundamental character of figure however has remained same hubler and burger were first olympic gold medalists in pair skating in 1908 they also won 1908 and 1910 world championships in 1936 maxi herber and ernst won gold medal at olympics and went on to win world championships from 1936 1939 hines p 6 soviet and russian domination in pair skating began in 1950s and continued throughout rest of 1900s only five non soviet or russian teams won world championships after 1965 until 2010 hines p 191 soviet pair teams won gold medals in seven consecutive olympics from 1964 in innsbruck to 1988 in calgary kestnbaum credited soviets for emphasizing ballet theater and folk dance in all disciplines of figure skating noting influence of soviet pair team and married couple liudmila belousova and oleg protopopov protopopovs as they were called won gold medals at 1964 and 1968 olympics as well as 1968 world championships raised by several degrees level of translating classical dance to ice kestnbaum p 112 irina rodnina with her partner alexei and later alexander also from soviet union dominated pair skating throughout 1970s and led trend of female pair skaters as risk taking athletes pair skating which has never included a compulsory phase like other figure skating disciplines did not require a short program until early 1960s when isu instituted a short program of required moves as first part of pair competitions arrangement of specific moves also unlike compulsory figures for single skaters and compulsory dance for ice dancers were up to each pair team short programs introduced in single men and women competitions in 1973 were modeled after pair skating short program and structure of competitions in both single and pair competitions have been identical since elimination of compulsory figures in 1990 kestnbaum p 325 a judging scandal at 2002 winter olympics in salt lake city utah ushered in sweeping reforms in scoring system of figure skating competitions scandal which centered around canadian pair team jamie sale and david pelletier and russian pair team elena and anton brought about end of 6 0 scoring system and implementation of isu judging system starting in 2004 according to caroline silby a consultant with u s figure skating pair teams as well as ice dance teams have added challenge of strengthening partnerships and ensuring that teams stay together for several years silby states conflict between partners that is consistent and unresolved can often lead to early demise or break up of a team silby p 92 challenges for both pairs and dancers which can make conflict resolution and communication difficult include fewer number of available boys for girls to find partnerships different priorities regarding commitment and scheduling differences in partners ages and developmental stages differences in family situations common necessity of one or both partners moving to train at a new facility and different skill levels when partnership is formed silby pp 92 93 silby estimates that due to lack of effective communication among pairs teams there is a six fold increase in risk of national level figure skating teams splitting silby p 93 teams with strong skills in communication and conflict resolution however tend to produce highest placing finishers at national championship events

groups three four and five require that full extension of lifting arm or arms be accomplished s p id 2018 p 112 if senior pair teams execute two lifts with take offs that have different natures lifts are categorized as group five lifts if they are same second lift is not a group five lift judges look for following when evaluating pair lifts speed of entry and exit control of woman s free leg when she is exiting out of lift with goal of keeping leg high and sweeping position of woman in air man s footwork quick and easy changes of position and maintenance of flow throughout lift pair lift groups groups position notes one armpit hold position two waist hold position if lift is accomplished with a simple loop type take off and woman position is vertical with her head up facing either direction and with no other variations lift is categorized as a group two position any other position by woman is categorized as a group three position tech panel p 21 three hand to hip or upper part of leg above knee position four hand to hand position press lift type woman during group four lifts can only rotate together with man five hand to hand position lasso lift type woman must rotate around man or in relation to him during lifting process between take off and fully extended position judges begin counting how many revolutions pair teams execute from moment when woman leaves ice until when man s arm or arms begin to bend after he has made a full extension and woman begins to descend if he is in a spread eagle position or in another sideways position rotation count is determined by position of his front foot at moment woman leaves ice tech panel p 22 when man changes direction of rotation of lift it must include one rotation before and after change and only once per program a complete pair skating lift must include full extension of lifting arm or arms if required for type of lift being performed small lifts or ones in which man does not raise his hands higher than his shoulders or lifts that include movements in which man holds woman by legs are also allowed small lifts can be either descending and ascending or rotational in character man must complete at least one revolution a simple take off includes but is not limited to a change of hand hold during ascent a difficult take off includes but is not limited to following a somersault take off a one hand take off an ina bauer a spread eagle spirals as entry curve executed by one or both partners or a dance lift followed immediately by a pair lift take off but when woman does not touch ice between each lift simple landings include a change of hold during descent difficult landings include but are not limited to following somersaults one hand landings variations in holds and spread eagle positions of man during dismounting but only if spread eagle lasts long enough from moment man starts bending his arms till moment lady is placed on ice left thumb 150px east germans mandy and

allowed changes of hold or going from one of grips to another or from one hand to another in a one hand hold during lifts there must be one full revolution after a change of hold is made for it to count towards a team s score but man can change holds from his left to right arms or from his right to left arms with at least one revolution in each hold teams earn fewer points if woman s position and a change of hold is executed at same time they earn more points if execution of woman s position and change in hold are significantly different from lift to lift teams can increase difficulty of lifts in any group by using a one hand hold there are three types of positions performed by woman upright or when her upper body is vertical star or when she faces sideways with her upper body parallel to ice and platter or when her position is flat and facing up or down with her upper body parallel to ice lifts ends when man s arm or arms begins to bend after he completes a full extension and when woman begins to descend if woman changes position from upright with her head upwards to upright with her head downwards or from platter to platter star to star with half a rotation of lady in any direction tech panel p 20 pair teams earn more points if variation of woman s position in air significantly impacts balance of lady in lift or requires specific strength and or flexibility and only if variations are significantly different from lift to lift tech panel p 23 carry lifts are defined as simple carrying of a partner without rotation and do not count as overhead lifts instead they are considered as transition elements they occur when man makes at least one continuous revolution although only first carry counts towards their score carry lifts do not count as features in short program and count towards score only first time they are performed during free skate only half a revolution made by man is allowed on carry lift s take off and or exit there are no restrictions of holds in carry lifts and carrying of one partner by other on back shoulders or knees is allowed a simple carry lift lasts at least three seconds a difficult carry includes at least one of following features for at least three seconds man skates on one foot he performs crossovers or he holds his partner on one arm and he performs spread eagles or similar moves twist lifts left thumb 150px tong jian and pang qing from china perform a twist lift at 2010 olympics skate canada calls twist lifts sometimes most thrilling and exciting component in pair skating they can also be most difficult movement to perform correctly according to isu lady must be caught in air at waist by man prior to landing and be assisted to a smooth landing on ice on a backward outside edge on one foot s p id 2018 p 113 during a twist lift in their short programs both senior and junior pair teams can perform two or three rotations in air but woman can only perform either a flip or lutz during her take off s p

judges look for following when evaluating twist lifts speed at entry and exit whether or not woman performs a split position while on her way to top of twist lift her height once she gets there clean rotations a clean catch by male accomplished by placing both hands at woman s waist and without any part of her upper body touching him and a one foot exit executed by both partners pair teams can earn more points if woman executes a split position each leg is at least 45deg from her body axis and her legs are straight or almost straight before rotating they also earn more points when man s arms are sideways and straight or almost straight after he releases woman they lose points for not having enough rotations one half a rotation or more first quadruple twist lift performed in international competition was by russian pair team marina and sergei at european championship in 1977 hines p 57 solo jumps and throw jumps solo jumps pair teams both juniors and seniors must perform one solo jump during their short programs it can include a double flip or double axel for juniors or any kind of double or triple jump for seniors in free skate both juniors and seniors must perform only one solo jump and only one jump combination or sequence a jump sequence consists of two jumps with no limitations on number of revolutions per jump it starts with any type of jump immediately followed by an axel type jump skaters must during a jump combination make sure that they land on same foot they took off on and that they execute a full rotation on ice between jumps they can however execute an euler between two jumps when euler is performed separately it is considered a non listed jump tech panel p 15 junior pairs during their short programs earn no points for solo jump if they perform a different jump than what is required both junior and senior pairs earn no points if during their free skating programs they repeat a jump with over two revolutions tech panel p 17 all jumps are considered in order in which they were performed if partners do not execute same number of revolutions during a solo jump or part of a jump sequence or combination which can consist of two or three jumps only jump with fewer revolutions will be counted in their score s p id 2018 pp 113 118 double axel and all triple and quadruple jumps which have more than two revolutions must be different from one another although jump sequences and combinations can include same two jumps extra jumps that do not fulfill requirements are not counted in team s score teams are allowed however to execute same two jumps during a jump combination or sequence if they perform any or both jump or jumps incorrectly only incorrectly done jump is not counted and it is not considered a jump sequence or combination both partners can execute two solo jumps during their short programs but second jump is worth less points than first a jump attempt in which one or both partners execute a clear preparation for a take off but step to entry edge or place their skate s toe pick into ice and leave ice with or without a turn counts as one jump element if partners execute an unequal number of rotations during a solo jump or as part of a jump combination or sequence jump with lesser number of revolutions will be counted they receive no points if they perform different types of jumps a small hop or a jump with up to one half revolution considered decoration is not marked as a jump and called a transition instead non listed jumps do not count as jumps either but can also be called a transition and can be used as a special entrance to jump tech panel p 16 if partners execute a spin and a jump back to back or vice versa they are considered separate elements and team is awarded more points for executing a difficult take off or entry they lose points if partners fall or step out of a jump during a jump sequence or combination throw jumps left thumb 150px rena inoue and john baldwin jr in 2004 throw jumps are partner assisted jumps in which lady is thrown into air by man on take off and lands without assistance from her partner on a backward outside edge skate canada says male partner assists female into flight many pair skaters consider throw jump a jump rather than a throw throw jump is also considered an assisted jump performed by woman man supports woman initiates her rotations and assists her with her height timing and direction types of throw jumps include throw axel throw salchow throw toe loop throw loop throw flip and throw lutz speed of team s entry into throw jump and number of rotations performed increases its difficulty as well as height and or distance they create pair teams must perform one throw jump during their short programs senior teams can perform any double or triple throw jump and junior teams must perform a double or triple toe loop flip or lutz if throw jump is not done correctly including if it has wrong number of revolutions it receives no value pair teams must perform at least two different throw jumps with a different number of revolutions in their free skating programs a throw jump is judged as a jump with a higher number of revolution if it is over rotated more than a quarter revolution for example if a pair attempts a double throw jump but over rotates it judges record it as a downgraded triple throw jump tech panel p 18 first throw triple axel jump performed in competition was by american pair team rena inoue and john baldwin jr at 2006 u s championships they also performed it at four continents championships in 2006 and 2006 winter olympics throw triple axel is a difficult throw to accomplish because woman must perform three and one half revolutions after being thrown by man a half revolution more than other triple jumps and because it requires a forward take off spins thumb right east german pair skaters sabine and tassilo performing a pair spin 1979 thumb right tatiana and stanislav morozov from russia perform a side by side spin 2007 solo spin combinations solo spin combination must be performed once during short program of pair skating competitions with at least two revolutions in two basic positions both partners must include all three basic positions in order to earn full points possible there must be a minimum of five revolutions made on each foot tech panel p 7 spins can be commenced with jumps and must have at least two different basic positions and both partners must include two revolutions in each position a solo spin combination must have all three basic positions camel spin sit spin and upright positions performed by both partners at any time during spin to receive full value of points and must have all three basic positions performed by both partners to receive full value for element a spin with less than three revolutions is not counted as a spin rather it is considered a skating movement if a skater changes to a non basic position it is not considered a change of position number of revolutions in non basic positions which may be considered difficult variations are counted towards team s total number of revolutions only positions whether basic or non basic must be performed by partners at same time if a skater falls while entering into spin he or she can perform another spin or spinning movement immediately after fall to fill time lost from fall but it is not counted as a solo spin combination a change of foot in form of a jump or step over is allowed and change of position and change of foot can be performed separately or at same time pair teams require significant strength skill and control to perform a change from a basic position to a different basic position without performing a position first they also have to execute a continuous movement throughout change without jumps to execute it and they must hold basic position for two revolutions both before and after change they lose points if they take a long time to reach necessary basic position tech panel p 10 pair teams earn more points for performing difficult entrances into their spins difficult flying entrances count although backward entry into spin and a flying camel do not all entrances must have a significant impact on spin s execution balance and control and intended spin position must be achieved within team s first two revolutions rules surrounding difficult variations which also apply to single skaters and to both partners are also worth more points there are 11 categories of difficult solo spin variations spin combinations both junior and senior pair teams must perform one pair spin combination which may begin with a fly spin during their free skating programs tech panel p 12 pair spin combinations must have at least eight revolutions which must be counted from entry of spin until its exit s p id 2018 p 119 if spins are done with less than two revolutions pairs receive zero points if they have less than three revolutions they are considered a skating movement not a spin pair teams cannot except for a short step when changing directions stop while performing a rotation spins must have at least two different basic positions with two revolutions in each position performed by both partners anywhere within spin full value for pair spin combinations are awarded only when both partners perform all three basic positions a spin executed in both clockwise and counter clockwise directions is considered one spin when a team simultaneously performs spins in both directions that immediately follow each other they earn more points but they must execute a minimum of three revolutions in each direction without any changes in position tech panel p 14 both partners must execute at least one change of position and one change of foot although not necessarily done simultaneously if not element will have no value s p id 2018 pp 113 119 like solo spin combination spin combination has three basic positions camel spin sit spin and upright spin also like solo spin combination changes to a non basic position is counted towards team s total number of revolutions and are not considered a change of position a change of foot must have at least three revolutions before and after change and can be any basic or non basic position in order for element to be counted tech panel p 13 fluctuations of speed and variations of positions of head arms or free leg are allowed difficult variations of a combined pair spin must have at least two revolutions they receive more points if spin contains three difficult variations two of which can be non basic positions although each partner must have at least one difficult variation same rules apply for difficult entrances into pair spin combinations as they do for solo spin combinations except that they must be executed by both partners for element to count towards their final score a difficult exit in which skaters exit spin in a lift or spinning movement is defined as an innovative move that makes exit significantly more difficult if one or both partners fall while entering a spin they can execute a spin or a spinning movement to fill up time lost during fall death spirals thumb right mclaughlin and rockne brubaker perform a death spiral during 2008 u s figure skating championships death spiral is a circular move in which male lowers his partner to ice while she is arched backwards gliding on one foot there are four types of death spirals forward inside death spiral backward inside death spiral backward outside death spiral and forward outside death spiral tech panel p 27 according to skate canada forward inside death spiral is easiest one to execute and forward outside death spiral is most difficult in 2019 2020 season both junior and senior pair teams must perform backward inside death spiral and death spiral performed in short program at senior level must be different than death spiral during free skating program if a different death spiral other than what has been prescribed is executed it receives no points one death spiral is required for juniors and seniors during their free skate tech panel p 27 man is not allowed an opposite hand hold as team enters a death spiral during short program although it is allowed during free skate woman however can use an opposite hand hold during both programs both partners can execute a change of arm hold in both programs as well tech panel p 28 step sequences step sequences in pair skating should be performed together or close together s p id 2018 p 114 step sequences must be a part of short program but they are not required in free skating program there is no required pattern but pair teams must fully use ice surface tech panel p 3 step sequence must be visible and identifiable in any shape they like oval circle straight line or serpentine step sequences can include any unlisted jump regardless of number of revolutions and short stops if they are done in accordance with music are allowed all turns and steps must be performed on one foot and they should have variety which isu defines as at least nine difficult turns and steps executed by both partners isu also considers simple variety in step sequences at least seven difficult turns and steps and a minimum variety of at least five difficult turns and steps types of turns and steps can only be counted once per sequence team must skate three meters or less near each other while executing crossing feature of sequence tech panel pp 3 4 they must not separate with no breaks for at least half of sequence changes of holds which can include a brief moment when partners do not touch are permitted during step sequence tech panel p 5 workload between partners must be even to help them earn more points more points are rewarded to teams when they change places or holds or when they perform difficult skating moves together teams also earn more points for following if they use difficult skating moves together and change holds and places during step sequences if they execute rotations to either right or left with full body rotation covering at least 1 3 of pattern in total for each rotational direction if they use their body movements for at least one third of pattern changes in position defined as crossing at least three times while doing steps and turns for at least a third of sequence but not over half of it and if partners execute two different combinations of three difficult turns both partners must execute combinations of difficult turns at same time and with a clear rhythm and continuous flow but without free foot touching ice although they do not have to execute same kind of turns partners can perform rockers counters brackets loops and during combinations of difficult turns three turns changes of edges jumps and or hops and changes of feet are not allowed and at least one turn in combination must be of a different type than others two combinations of difficult turns are same if they consist of same turns performed in same order on same foot and on same edges rotations to either right or left can be accomplished with any listed and unlisted steps and turns as long as they are done continuously in one direction for at least 1 3 of sequence and then continuously for at least 1 3 of sequence in opposite direction clockwise and anti clockwise rotations can also be performed throughout length of sequence skaters are rotating with any unlisted and listed steps and turns they choose for at least a third of total sequence and at least a third of total sequence in opposite direction also clockwise and anti clockwise use of body movements is defined as visible use by both partners any movements of arms and or hips and or legs and or head and or torso these movements must affect balance of main body core which affect balance of entire body and influence balance on their blades choreographic sequences 250px thumb right and robin 2005 from germany perform a spiral pair teams must perform one choreographic sequence during their free skating programs tech panel p 6 according to isu a choreographic sequence consists of any kind of movements like steps turns spirals arabesques spread eagles ina bauers any jumps with maximum of 2 revolutions spins small lifts etc it begins at first skating movement and ends when team begins to prepare to execute next element unless sequence is last element performed during program judges do not evaluate individual elements in a choreographic segment rather they note that it was accomplished there are no restrictions limiting sequence of movements but sequence must be clearly visible pair skaters in order to earn most points possible must include following in their choreographic sequences they must have originality and creativity sequence must match music and reflect program s concept and character and they must demonstrate effortlessness of element as a sequence they must also do following have good ice coverage or perform an interesting pattern demonstrate good unison between partners and demonstrate excellent commitment and control of whole body rules and regulations skaters must only execute prescribed elements if they do not extra or unprescribed elements will not be counted in their score only first attempt of an element will be included s p id2018 p 16 violations in pair skating include falls time music and clothing falls according to isu a fall is defined as loss of control by a skater with result that majority of his her own body weight is on ice supported by any other part of body other than blades e g hand s knee s back buttock s or any part of arm s p id2018 pp 79 80 australian single skater and coach belinda noonan stated pairs skating is literally physically more dangerous than other three disciplines american pair skater nathan agreed comparing danger in pair skating to playing in national football league sportswriter sandra in her discussion of accidents in all figure skating disciplines stated that very nature of pair skating adds an extra dimension of danger and risk of injury because of high speed and close proximity pair teams skate to each other and lifts and other elements in pair skating both members of a pair skating team can receive broken noses and other injuries from performing twist lifts incorrectly and although male partners are taught to protect their partners in case of a fall from an overhead lift concussions and serious head injuries are common isu has banned and restricted dangerous tricks and moves from pair skating but both skating audiences and skaters have demanded them skaters have resisted using protective gear even during practice because it interferes with developing self confidence and is seen as incompatible with aesthetic aspects of sport pair skaters have 1 83 injuries per athlete most of any figure skating discipline single skaters and ice dancers have more lower body injuries but pair skaters suffer more upper body injuries with 50 occurring to head e g facial lacerations concussions according to figure skating researchers jason vescovi and jaci vanheest these injuries are an obvious consequence of throws and side by side jumps performed in this discipline a study conducted in 1989 found that ice dancers and pair skaters during a nine month period of time can experience serious injuries defined as athletes missing seven or more consecutive days of training after their injuries and that women pair skaters have more injuries than men which vescovi and vanheest attributed to demands of pair skating for pair skaters one point is deducted for every fall by one partner and two points are deducted for every fall by both partners s p id2018 p 18 according to former american figure skater katrina hacker falls occur for following reasons skater makes an error during his or her takeoff his or her jump is under rotated or not fully rotated while skater is in air skater executes a tilted jump and is unable to land upright on his or her feet and skater makes an error during first jump of a combination jump resulting in not having enough smoothness speed and flow to complete second jump if there is an interruption while performing their program skaters can lose one point if it lasts more than 10 seconds but not over 20 seconds they can lose two points if interruption lasts 20 seconds but not over 30 seconds and three points if it lasts 30 seconds but not more than 40 seconds they can lose five points if they can resume their program three minutes after interruption begins s p id 2018 pp 18 19 isu rules leave stopping a program for medical reasons up to discretion of competition referee who decides after consulting with skaters team physician or doctor provided by competition s organizer to end a program but it must be done within three minutes after fall or interruption if not skater or team must withdraw s p id 2018 p 91 time as for all skating disciplines judges penalize pair skaters one point up to every five seconds for ending their programs too early or too late s p id 2018 p 17 if they start their programs between one and 30 seconds late they can lose one point s p id 2018 p 18 restrictions for finishing short program and free skating program are similar to requirements of other disciplines in figure skating they can complete these programs within plus or minus 10 seconds of required times if they cannot judges can deduct points if they finish up to five seconds too early or too late if they begin skating any element after their required time plus required 10 seconds they have to begin they earn no points for those elements pair team receive no points if duration of their program is completed less than 30 seconds or more seconds early s p id2018 p 79 music isu
