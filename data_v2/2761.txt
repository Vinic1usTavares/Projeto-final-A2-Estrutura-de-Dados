188 pp 141 142 production episode s initial script where pfaster was a necrophiliac was rejected by fox broadcasting company for being unacceptable for broadcast standards lowry p 91 as series creator chris carter described it when i handed script in it was really for a necrophiliac episode and that just didn t fly you cannot do combination of sex and death on network television hurwitz and knowles p 60 carter was forced to tone down script by changing pfaster from a necrophiliac to a death fetishist and diminishing pfaster s sexual obsession he considered that sexual content was implied and understood by audiences and that pfaster still resulted in a creepy character particularly his creepy arrogance in using shampoo on hair of his victims episode s original title was fascination lovece p 143 episode is one of few in series that has no paranormal elements to it carter said of episode s conception my first chance to work with david nutter in a long time and i wanted to give him something he could sink his teeth into it s a little bit different for us it doesn t really have a paranormal aspect except for scully s perceptions of her deepest fears i felt that i had to figure out what she is most afraid of and she is most afraid of those things that most of us are afraid of idea of dying at hands of someone creature or not and she is helpless to do anything about it i thought it was a very good way to explore scully s character edwards pp 111 112 scene where dana scully imagines pfaster appearing as a devil was influenced by real life accounts as described by carter there are reports of people who had been under spell of jeffrey dahmer who actually claimed that he shape shifted during those hours when they were held hostage that his image actually changed nutter said in many ways chris wanted to sell idea that as established in mulder s closing dialogue in show not all terror comes from paranormal it could come from person next door carter said of casting of nick chinlund as pfaster i thought it was a wonderfully creepy villain casting of that show was very difficult we saw many actors but there was a quality i was looking for and i couldn t put a name on that quality i finally figured out what it was when nick came in and he had a kind of androgynous quality that worked i thought he looked like joe college but he could scare hell out of you producer glen morgan said chinlund s performance was outstanding nutter stated nick chinlund was wonderful to work with guy was like putty in my hands he was great if you re looking for someone to underline weirdness and strangeness of character he did that nutter said of episode i really worked hard to make it a special show because i thought it was special it was gillian s post traumatic stress episode because she had not really had opportunity to vent her feelings about whole duane barry situation this was an opportunity to sit back and let all that happen carter particularly liked scene where a clearly disturbed scully hugs mulder claiming it was a tender moment between two characters that had not shown that much affection for each other reception ratings irresistible premiered

irresistible a b saying it was based on an unsettling concept to begin with that was reinforced by chinlund s skin crawling one man show emily vanderwerff of a v club rated episode a praising acting particularly of chinlund as pfaster and describing it as legitimately scary a sign of a show that was pushing itself in new and interesting directions only criticism was for scenes where scully hallucinates pfaster shapeshifting as pretty silly almost feeling like an attempt to make sure something vaguely paranormal is in episode so fans don t get bored with what is ultimately a very good
