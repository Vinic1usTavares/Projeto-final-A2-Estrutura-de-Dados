deeping fen is a low lying area in south holland district of lincolnshire england which covers approximately it is bounded by river welland and river glen and is extensively drained but efficient drainage of land exercised minds of several of great civil engineers of 17th and 18th centuries drainage schemes were first authorised during reign of queen elizabeth i but from 1632 a group of adventurers took control of drainage in return for which they were granted land they faced problem that outfalls of river welland and river glen were not sufficiently low to enable proper drainage by gravity and most schemes included improvement to rivers john perry an engineer of some repute who had set standard for engineering reports in 1727 began work in 1730 and was followed by john grundy sr a pioneer in applying scientific principles to civil engineering problems his son john grundy jr was another capable engineer who was retained as a consultant after he resigned as full time surveyor of works in 1800 civil engineers william jessop and john rennie assisted local engineers with plans for improvements chief of which was for a steam pumping station this plan was not implemented immediately but two steam engines fitted with scoop wheels were installed at pode hole in 1823 pumping station was largest in fens at time and remained so for many years steam gradually gave way to diesel engines and scoop wheels were replaced by centrifugal pumps and diesel engines were then replaced by electric motors however beam engine and scoop wheel at pinchbeck marsh which ran from 1833 to 1952 was not scrapped and can be visited by public from 1801 fen was managed by trustees appointed under terms of an act of parliament obtained in that year and this remained case until 1939 when administrative structure was replaced by welland deepings internal drainage board location deeping fen is a low lying area bounded by river welland and river glen which meet at its northern tip covering around it was originally an extra parochial liberty as it was formed of waste land which had previously belonged to a number of other parishes but because it had been reclaimed by adventurers was free from land tax and ecclesiastical tithes about half of fen became parish of deeping st nicholas in 1846 which became a civil parish in reforms authorised by an act of parliament of 1856 name of fen is derived from old english which means a deep or low place village was listed as in domesday book an inventory of country compiled in 1086 history people of market deeping deeping gate and deeping st james together with other villages along river welland presented a petition to elizabeth i requesting that fens should be drained as banks of river and of neighbouring river glen were in a poor state of repair they suggested that thomas lovell should undertake work which he did at a cost of ps12 000 for which he received of land which was reclaimed as a result of work unrest in early 1600s resulted in most of works being destroyed but in 1632 a group of adventurers led by earl of bedford were granted permission to drain deeping fen south fen and croyland work included making welland deeper and wider from deeping st james to its outfall beyond spalding and construction of side drains these included a drain running from pode hole to below spalding which is still known as vernatt s drain after one of adventurers called sir philibert vernatti although declared completed in 1637 efficient drainage would have to wait until construction of pode hole pumping station in 1827 drainage of fen was again addressed in 1664 when deeping fen act awarded earl of manchester and others of land in return for drainage works they were also obliged to maintain banks of welland inadequacy of its outfall and a spate of bad weather stopped them from completing their task they tried renting out land they had been granted but many tenants were unable to pay rent due to poor state of drainage which reduced crop yields in april 1729 deeping fen adventurers received a letter from captain john perry expressing opinion that only way to improve drainage was to improve river outfalls and proposing construction of scouring sluices on river at spalding on vernatt s drain at its outfall and on river glen at surfleet perry was an engineer of some repute who had set standard for engineering reports in 1727 when he published his recommendations for north level of fens his plans were approved and adventurers offered to give him land covering nearly in payment for work he sold one third of land to finance project and began work in 1730 cowbit sluice on welland had six wide gates which were operated by chains connected to a treadwheel at high tide water was penned in cowbit wash between banks which were set well back from main channel at low tide sluice gates were opened and flow scoured out silt from river bed for some downstream perry died in february 1733 before other works were completed and was buried in spalding churchyard scientific drainage perry was succeeded by john grundy sr who had arrived in region in 1731 at request of duke of buccleuch who wanted his estates surveyed perry was building spalding sluice at time and grundy s work allowed him to study drains banks sluices and outfalls he formed opinion that mathematical and philosophical principles should be applied to drainage of low lying regions in 1733 he surveyed parish of moulton a little further downstream to assess how drainage could be improved for commissioners of sewers he demonstrated use of a telescopic spirit level which enabled him to achieve accurate levels with errors of less than 1 inch per mile 2 cm per km next he addressed issue of flow in open drains using his mathematical principles he calculated that water in a drain which was long and had a fall of over its length should travel at around taking 1 hour and 28 minutes to travel length of drain observations in field showed him that other factors such as fluid friction resulted in actual flow rate being less than half of this he published a paper of his findings in april 1734 and insisted that accurate mapping and levels together with physical observation of drains and rivers were essential to deciding how fenland could best be drained in same month he began working for adventurers of deeping fen to produce a drainage scheme he spent some time mapping of welland and his chief recommendation was for a reservoir and sluice at outfall of river glen which would enable outfall to be scoured at low tide by releasing water from reservoir in july 1737 grundy and humphry smith set out their plans for fen and a bill was put before parliament to allow adventurers to raise ps15 000 estimated cost by taxes act was granted in 1738 and smith and grundy were appointed surveyors and agents of deeping fen they oversaw a programme of repairs to deeping bank which ran for along south eastern edge of fen protecting it from welland john scribo did same for country bank which ran for on far side of river grundy made river deeper above spalding and also constructed a sluice and reservoir at mouth of glen reservoir covered and provided water to scour channel below sluice two drainage mills were constructed each with a scoop wheel one on vernatt s drain and other on hill s drain bed of glen had also been regraded and its banks raised by 1742 when smith retired and grundy took sole charge of works he oversaw job of making welland through spalding deeper and wider and suggested that outfall of vernatt s drain should be moved downstream from its existing position although not implemented immediately his son completed this task in 1774 grundy died in 1748 having been a pioneer in applying scientific principles to civil engineering problems civil engineers john grundy jr took over as surveyor of works after death of his father in 1748 and spent nearly ps10 000 on repairs to deeping bank and country bank between then and 1764 he rebuilt perry s sluice on welland soon after 1750 with taller doors and a set of tide gates to prevent tide moving upstream in 1755 three more drainage mills were built on hills drain while a sluice on forty foot drain followed in 1758 from 1759 to 1761 he was engaged in lowering bed of welland below outfall sluice by after 1764 thomas hogard became surveyor of works but grundy continued to act as a consultant engineer hogard devised a scheme to cut a new channel from junction of welland and glen to wyberton on estuary of river witham below boston at end of cut there would be a huge sluice and a navigation lock adventurers asked thomas tofield for a second opinion who suggested a shorter cut from spalding to fosdyke they requested help from grundy who proposed a cut to fosdyke and that outfall of vernatt s drain should be moved downstream as his father had suggested improvements to drain were carried out under an act of parliament obtained in 1774 and an act was obtained in 1794 to sanction wyberton cut although work was not carried out and grundy s shorter cut was built under a new act of 1801 fen was inundated in 1798 and civil engineers william jessop and john rennie were asked to assist local engineers edward hare and george maxwell there was a clear understanding that outfalls were too high to allow proper drainage by gravity and two possible solutions were considered first was an outfall at a lower level which would involve hugh expense in its construction and second favoured by jessop and rennie was provision of steam pumping engines at pode hole these would pump water from internal drains of fen to vernatt s drain and lower internal water levels would allow existing wind powered drainage mills to work efficiently a report was produced which formed basis for deeping fen act of 1801 channel of welland above spalding was made deeper north bank was made stronger and north and south drove drains which crossed fen to join vernatt s drain at pode hole were made deeper at time there were no steam engines working in fens and rennie s recommendation of a steam pumping station at pode hole was not implemented pumping stations after reports by rennie and thomas pear in 1815 and by rennie alone in 1818 and 1820 provision of steam engines was authorised by an act in 1823 land which formed north drove was at a lower level to that in south drove and so it was intended to keep water at different levels in each drain so that a less powerful engine could be built to pump south drove drain by time details had been finalised engines of and were ordered both engines were beam engines larger one was manufactured by butterley was called holland engine and drove a scoop wheel which was in diameter wheel had 40 scoops and lifted water by smaller engine which was called kesteven engine was made by fenton murrey and drove a similar scoop wheel they were operational by august 1825 having cost ps26 673 pumping station was largest in fens at time and remained so for many years upgrading of plant occurred several times kesteven and holland engines were overhauled in 1881 and 1883 respectively flow into wheel pits was restricted by provision of shuttles and rising breasts were fitted on outflow so that height at which water was discharged could be varied as water level in vernatt s drain varied five new boilers which could supply either engine were fitted in 1883 and had been replaced by five more some time before 1928 for new boilers failed in that year kesteven engine had its scoop wheel removed although rest of plant was not scrapped until 1952 two twin cylinder diesel engines were installed to aid steam plant first in 1914 and second in 1920 they were made by mirrlees and were scrapped in 1956 following demise of steam engines a mirrlees five cylinder diesel engine which drove a pump was obtained first electric pump was installed in 1939 to be joined by three more in 1957 once mirrlees engines had been decommissioned a new engine house was built in 1964 which held two ruston diesel engines driving gwynnes limited pumps and a third ruston unit fitted with a gwynnes pump remaining mirrlees engine and first electric pump were scrapped at this time other districts pinchbeck south fen is a region covering lying on west side of vernatt s drain it was originally managed as fourth district by deeping fen trustees but was independent in 1828 when occupants approached trustees with a plan to drain some of water from fen to pode hole pumps a tunnel already existed under vernatt s drain and so trustees agreed however charges levied by trustees for this service rose dramatically so that south fen residents decided to build their own pumping engine at pode hole in 1830 a fenton murray beam engine driving a scoop wheel was installed at a cost of ps3 000 which was considerably less than charge trustees wanted to make engine was replaced by a suction gas engine and ruston pump in 1919 which was decommissioned in 1943 when a petter oil engine with a gwynnes pump was installed this only lasted for ten years as two electric motors driving and pumps were fitted in 1953 pinchbeck marsh was also part of deeping fen but following failure of work carried out under 1801 act to effectively drain area an act of parliament was obtained in 1832 to create a separate district called spalding and pinchbeck district or blue gowt as water from feeds into river glen from blue gowt drain a butterley beam engine driving a scoop wheel was installed in 1833 although a new boiler was installed in 1895 engine and wheel continued to operate until 1952 making it last beam engine and scoop wheel combination to be used in fens and also one which ran for longest time its function was replaced by two electric pumps fitted in 1953 which also pump pinchbeck south fen but plant was retained and is now open to public although steam engine is now turned by an electric motor management of deeping fen by trustees appointed under terms of 1801 act continued until they were replaced in 1939 by deeping fen spalding and pinchbeck internal drainage board which became part of welland deepings internal drainage board when it amalgamated with three other local internal drainage boards in 1973 see also pinchbeck engine pode hole vernatt s drain deepings bibliography
