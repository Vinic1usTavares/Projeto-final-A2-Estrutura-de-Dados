dauntless they rejoin initiates and board a train to amity sector to find abnegation survivors style many reviewers stated that novel s writing style offers a distinctive terse prose that creates a fast paced reading experience susan dominus writing in new york times described style as brisk pacing lavish flights of imagination and writing that occasionally startles with fine detail abby nolan from american prospect noted that divergent follows structural and stylistic patterns of hunger games and blood red road themes identity as in other children s and young adult fiction novel probes placement of authority and identity within youth s relationship to parents and other social forces critic antero garcia describes thematic similarity between these dystopian novels as an interest in grasp of power between youth and adult authority and compared novel to unwind by neal in new york times susan dominus stated that divergent explores a more common adolescent anxiety painful realization that coming into one s own sometimes means leaving family behind ideologically and physically voice of youth advocates agrees writing that divergent shows pressure of having to choose between following in your parents footsteps or doing something new critic antero garcia compared thematic interest in characters being forced into limiting constraints of identity and labor associated with their identity to similar interest in forced identities and labor in dystopian children s novels matched by allyson braithwaite condie and maze runner by james social structure and knowledge government division of its population into fragmented communities is a frequent device in young adult ya and children s fiction ya classics such as lois lowry s giver monica hughes s dream catcher and snyder s green sky trilogy use this device to different ends in her masters thesis ashley ann haynes describes of societies within divergent as a supporting comparison with hunger games unlike latter however each person can choose which faction they want to join so long as they follow rules and pass tests divergent adds a new layer of complexity with its creation of an illusion of democracy for participants in its society with factions controlled by outside forces basis of social structure in divergent is that each faction fulfils a role in society if one cannot contribute to society they are cast aside to become factionless and are deprived of access to an identity and resources in a journal article andrea burgos compares factionless to illegal immigrants as they do not have access to certain public services either both are marginalised from society because they are unable to contribute to it some reviews criticize lack of depth and realism of social structures within novel kirkus reviews called social structure a preposterous premise booklist called structure a simplistic color coded world that stretches credibility on occasion in a review for university of wisconsin whitewater s student newspaper royal purple news backhaus notes how entire system seems insubstantial and asks rhetorically how could it be possible for any individual with his or her infinite emotions and experiences to be condensed to one single quality to tolerate for rest of their lives and to choose at mere age of 16 in an interview roth describes social structure to have expanded from her initial conception adding candor to fill a gap in reasoning behind world that needed to be filled social structure most affects novel s themes by socially dividing different knowledge types that characters can access in her book chapter exploring how literacy in different knowledge types affects series alice curry describes factions and character indoctrination in those factions as deliberately creating knowledge gaps between initiates to different factions because of initiation process characters become illiterate in knowledge valued by other factions tris s divergence allows her to be successful because she can become literate in a broad set of knowledges and information types and thus she becomes more admirable to reader curry argues that jeanine s leadership within erudite represents an academic ivory tower that alienates other types of knowledge thus book critiques academic learning in favor of broader knowledge embodied by tris curry compares novel to julie s 2002 exodus describing both as using spaces and landscapes where knowledge is learned to critique crumbling knowledge institutions like academic spaces that knowledge instead of facilitating deeper holistic knowledge that create understanding violence and fear like hunger games divergent depicts considerable violence for a young adult novel publishers weekly review emphasized this stylistic choice calling it edgy and describing initiation rituals that tris endures as spellbinding as they are violent requiring sadistic tests of strength and courage but as susan dominus points out novel does not keep this violence at forefront of reader experience she writes in new york times that terrible things happen to people tris loves yet characters absorb these events with disquieting ease here somehow novel s flights from reality distance reader from emotional impact that might come in a more affecting realistic or even fantasy novel when describing her inspiration for dauntless training their initiates through exposing them to their fears roth in an interview for website popsugar says though influenced by many sources most important was her psych 101 my first year of college where i learned about exposure therapy which is when they treat people with fear like for anxiety it exposes them repeatedly to what they re afraid of and gradually you become less afraid of it or have a healthy level of fear and i thought of dauntless then because they re conditioning perfectly normal people to get over perfectly rational fears daniel kraus s booklist review of novel described intense psychological pressure as like akin to joining marines but also providing built in tension that makes novel a compelling read christianity though novel does not maintain an overtly christian thematic interest some readers place novel s themes within this context because of roth s professed religiosity in postscript acknowledgements roth emphasizes her christian faith saying thank you god for your son and for blessing me beyond comprehension for some reviewers this element of roth s lifestyle is important to novel s impact for example when reviewing novel for christian ministry break point sherry early describes roth as a christian and novel setting as post feminist maybe even christian she also says that though novel is not overtly christian it follows a christian point of view because it fight s against restrictions placed upon her by a controlling and totalitarian state and because tris must also explore cracks and imperfections within her own psyche k b hoyle also acknowledges that novel would have a christian message when reviewing it for evangelical book review organization gospel coalition however hoyle criticizes novel for using profane terminology and for never clarify ing what practices are supposed to mean reviewers outside christian community have also noticed christian context of novel in a review of book and first movie david edelstein observed book s treatment of intellectuals as following a tendency in christian culture to question genetic modification and majority intellectual erudite faction are largely depicted as control hungry villains pitted against abnegation faction who are depicted as righteous and merciful he wrote novelist veronica roth reserves her loathing for erudites who spend their days in intellectual pursuit and that trend of intellectualism thinking without feeling makes people apt to seize power and impose maoist like uniformity on entire populations on pain of death reception divergent has received mostly positive reviews in a review in new york times susan dominus wrote that it was rich in plot and imaginative details but also that compared to other such books in same genre as hunger games trilogy it did not exactly distinguish itself in a review for entertainment weekly breia brissey said that it was and less nuanced than hunger games but was good giving it a b rating similarly though critiquing simplistic color coded world booklist reviewer daniel kraus positively concluded that novel was full of gutsy action and romance and called it a spin on brave new world kirkus said it was built with careful details and intriguing scope common sense media commented on book s deep messages about identity and controlling societies and on unstoppable plot that s remarkably original it was
