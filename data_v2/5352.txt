congress urged americans to follow similar mourning practices later that year former president john quincy adams gave a eulogy of lafayette that lasted three hours calling him high on list of pure and disinterested benefactors of mankind leepson p 172 beliefs lafayette was a firm believer in a constitutional monarchy he believed that traditional and revolutionary ideals could be melded together by having a democratic national assembly work with a monarch as france always had his close relationships to american founding fathers such as george washington and thomas jefferson gave him ability to witness implementation of a democratic system his views on potential government structures for france were directly influenced by american form of government which was in turn influenced by british form of government for example lafayette believed in a bicameral legislature as united states had jacobins however detested idea of a monarchy in france which led national assembly to vote against it this idea contributed to his fall from favor especially when maximilien robespierre took power lafayette was author of declaration of rights of man and of citizen in 1789 and a staunch opponent of slavery his work never specifically mentioned slavery but he made his position clear on controversial topic through letters addressed to friends and colleagues such as washington and jefferson he proposed that slaves not be owned but rather work as free tenants on land of plantation owners and he bought a plantation in french colony of cayenne in 1785 to put his ideas into practice ordering that no slaves be bought or sold he spent his lifetime as an abolitionist proposing that slaves be emancipated slowly and recognizing crucial role that slavery played in many economies lafayette hoped that his ideas would be adopted by washington in order to free slaves in united states and spread from there and his efforts were not in vain as washington eventually began implementing those practices on his own plantation in mount vernon though he freed no slaves in his lifetime lafayette s grandson gustave de beaumont later wrote a novel discussing issues of racism lafayette played a significant role in abolition of slavery in france in 1794 as riots had erupted in haiti because of circulation two years earlier of declaration of rights of man and of citizen assessment throughout his life lafayette was an exponent of ideals of age of enlightenment especially on human rights and civic nationalism and his views were taken very seriously by intellectuals and others on both sides of atlantic kramer pp 15 16 his image in united states was derived from his disinterestedness in fighting without pay for freedom of a country that was not his own loveland p 9 samuel adams praised him for foregoing pleasures of enjoyment of domestick life and exposing himself to hardship and dangers of war when he fought in glorious cause of freedom this view was shared by many contemporaries establishing an image of lafayette seeking to advance freedom of all mankind rather than interests of just one nation during french revolution americans viewed him as an advocate for american ideals seeking to transport them from new world to old this was reinforced by his position as surrogate son and disciple of george washington who was deemed father of his country and embodiment of american ideals loveland pp 17 18 novelist james fenimore cooper befriended lafayette during his time in paris in 1820s he admired his patrician liberalism and eulogized him as a man who dedicated youth person and fortune to principles of liberty lafayette became an american icon in part because he was not associated with any particular region of country he was of foreign birth did not live in america and had fought in new england mid atlantic states and south making him a unifying figure loveland p 16 his role in french revolution enhanced this popularity as americans saw him steering a middle course americans were naturally sympathetic to a republican cause but also remembered louis xvi as an early friend of united states when lafayette fell from power in 1792 americans tended to blame factionalism for ouster of a man who was above such things in their eyes loveland pp 21 23 in 1824 lafayette returned to united states at a time when americans were questioning success of republic in view of disastrous economic panic of 1819 and sectional conflict resulting in missouri compromise loveland p 39 lafayette s hosts considered him a judge of how successful independence had become loveland pp 36 37 according to cultural historian lloyd kramer lafayette provided foreign confirmations of self image that shaped america s national identity in early nineteenth century and that has remained a dominant theme in national ideology ever since belief that america s founding fathers institutions and freedom created most democratic egalitarian and prosperous society in world kramer p 185 historian gilbert chinard wrote in 1936 lafayette became a legendary figure and a symbol so early in his life and successive generations have so willingly accepted myth that any attempt to deprive young hero of his republican halo will probably be considered as little short of iconoclastic and sacrilegious that legend has been used politically name and image of lafayette were repeatedly invoked in 1917 to gain popular support for america s entry into world war i culminating with charles e stanton s famous statement lafayette we are here this occurred at some cost to lafayette s image in america veterans returned from front singing we ve paid our debt to lafayette who hell do we owe now loveland pp 154 57 according to anne c loveland lafayette no longer served as a national hero symbol by end of war loveland p 160 in 2002 however congress voted to grant him honorary citizenship lafayette s reputation in france is more problematic thomas gaines notes that response to lafayette s death was far more muted in france than in america and suggested that this may have been because lafayette was last surviving hero of america s only revolution whereas changes in french government had been far more chaotic gaines p 447 lafayette s roles created a more nuanced picture of him in french historiography especially in french revolution 19th century historian jules michelet describes him as a mediocre idol lifted by mob far beyond what his talents deserved kramer p 5 jean tulard jean francois fayard and alfred fierro note napoleon s deathbed comment about lafayette in their histoire et dictionnaire de la revolution francaise he stated that king would still be sitting on his throne if napoleon had lafayette s place during french revolution gaines pp 349 440 they deemed lafayette an empty headed political dwarf and one of people most responsible for destruction of french monarchy gaines p 440 gaines disagreed and noted that liberal and marxist historians have also dissented from that view lloyd kramer related 57 percent of french deemed lafayette figure from revolution whom they most admired in a survey taken just before revolution s bicentennial in 1989 lafayette clearly had more french supporters in early 1990s than he could muster in early 1790s marc leepson concluded his study of lafayette s life see also lafayette motors notes references works
