many banded krait bungarus multicinctus also known as taiwanese krait or chinese krait is a highly venomous species of elapid snake found in much of central and southern china and southeast asia species was first described by scientist edward blyth in 1861 this species has two known subspecies nominate bungarus multicinctus multicinctus and bungarus multicinctus many banded krait mostly inhabits marshy areas throughout its geographical distribution though it does occur in other habitat types etymology since species description by zoologist and pharmacist edward blyth in 1861 bungarus multicinctus has been binomial of species generic name bungarus is a latinisation of telugu bangaru krait specific name multicinctus is derived from latin multi combining form of much many and latin past participle of to encircle as in a band full species name bungarus multicinctus thus literally means many banded krait common name krait is from hindi krait which is perhaps ultimately derived from sanskrit word kala which means black it is also called as in tamil a common name given to genus bungarus taxonomy and evolution left thumb specimen after shedding skin kraits as they are commonly known belong to family elapidae and genus bungarus genus is endemic to continent of asia they are morphologically well connected forming a close knit and cohesive unit genus has 12 13 species who are morphologically distinct from genus naja and afro elapids according to mcdowell 1987 mcdowell stated species diversity is greatest in africa but asiatic bungarus and ophiophagus are each so peculiar in anatomy as to suggest an ancient divergence others including slowinski believed that kraits bungarus are part of a clade that clusters with a group including king cobra ophiophagus hannah and oddly enough with african mambas dendroaspis on most parsimonious tree or with elapsoidea on maximum likelihood tree this result calls into question monophyly of cobras and underscores uncertainty of homology of hood spreading behavior in cobras and mambas relationships of dendroaspis ophiophagus and bungarus differed between parsimony and likelihood analyses suggesting that more work is necessary to resolve relationships of these problematic taxa mcdowell s findings in regard to sister group of bungarus and sea snakes hydrophiinae family propose that kraits might just be a per mutable clade between elapidae palatine and hydrophiinae palatine two genera within subfamily hydrophiinae in particular support mcdowell s hypothesis two genera are and due to many shared characteristics mao et al 1983 showed that this species bungarus multicinctus was slightly distinct from other members of its genus and was immunologically more similar to laticauda terrestrial australian elapids and true sea snakes than it is to elapsoidea sundevall s garter snake naja naja cobra or two species new world or american coral snakes minton 1981 schwaner et al and cadle gorman 1981 all suggested similar things to mao et al 1983 based on immunological data many banded krait was more similar to australian elapids laticauda and true sea snakes than they were to numerous elapids they were compared to description left thumb a many banded krait found in taiwan many banded krait is a medium to large sized species of snake averaging in length with maximum lengths reaching its body is slender and moderately compressed scales of this species are smooth and glossy with a noticeably distinct vertebral ridge colour of snake is black to dark bluish black with approximately 21 30 white or creamy white cross bands along entire length of its upper body more banding is seen in longer than average sized specimens tail is short and pointed that is also black in colour with alternating white cross bands of which there are 7 11 belly of snake is usually white in colour but could be an off white or creamy white head is primarily black in colour is broad and oval in shape but flat and slightly distinct from body eyes are small and black in colour pupils are black in colour thus making them hardly noticeable as they blend in with rest of eyes this species has large nostrils fangs are small fixed and are located in anterior of upper jaw juveniles of this species usually have whitish blotches on lower side of their heads scalation dorsal scales in 15 rows ventral scales 200 231 in males 198 227 in females tail short and tapering subcaudal scales single undivided 43 54 in males 37 55 in females distribution and habitat this species is found throughout taiwan including archipelagos of matsu and kinmen in central and southern regions of china in provinces of hainan anhui sichuan guangdong guangxi hunan hubei yunnan guizhou jiangxi zhejiang and fujian hong kong myanmar burma laos and northern vietnam it may also be found in thailand left thumb specimen found on tai mo shan hong kong although it can be found in elevations up to about it is far more commonly found in humid lowland areas and most often observed in subtropical marshy regions of its range it is also frequently found in shrublands woodlands agricultural fields and mangroves often adjacent to water such as rivers streams rice paddies and ditches it may also sometimes be found in villages and suburban areas it is able to survive in other habitats also behaviour and diet right thumb close up of head with scalation showing snake is nocturnal and may be more defensive at night it is however a timid and placid species of snake in daytime it hides under stones or in holes snake appears from april and retreats into hibernation in november it is considered to be more defensive than banded krait bungarus fasciatus thrashing about as it is handled unlike other bungarus species who are primarily snake eaters many banded krait usually feeds on fish but it is also preys on other species of snakes including members of its own species this species also feeds on rodents eels frogs and occasionally lizards reproduction there is limited information on reproductive habits of this snake like many elapids many banded kraits are oviparous mating occurs between months of august and september females usually deposit 3 15 eggs although up to 20 eggs can be produced eggs are deposited in late spring or early summer usually in month of june eggs usually hatch about a month and a half later hatchlings are around in length venom and toxins venom of many banded krait consists of both pre and postsynaptic neurotoxins known as a bungarotoxins and b bungarotoxins among others by weight almost half of protein content of venom is composed of b bungarotoxins average venom yield from specimens kept on snake farms is about 4 6 mg 19 4 mg per bite venom is highly toxic with values of 0 09 mg kg 0 108 mg kg sc 0 113 mg kg iv and 0 08 mg kg ip on mice based on several studies many banded krait is among most venomous land snakes in world a is important for neuromuscular histology it is known to bind irreversibly to receptors of neuromuscular junction and can be labelled with fluorescent proteins such as green fluorescent protein or dye clinical symptoms local symptoms of victims bitten by many banded krait are usually neither serious swelling nor pain victims merely feel slightly itchy and numb systemic symptoms occur in general one to six hours after being bitten by this snake symptoms may include bilateral ptosis diplopia discomfort in chest general ache weak feeling in limbs ataxia loss of voice dysphagia tunnel vision and difficulty breathing in case of serious bite suppression of breathing may occur leading to death hyponatremia is also seen but less commonly estimated mortality rates associated with untreated bites from this species vary between studies from 25 35 to 70 100 during vietnam war american soldiers referred to many banded krait as two step charlies in mistaken belief that its venom was lethal enough to kill within two steps many banded krait gathered worldwide attention after a juvenile individual bit and killed joe slowinski on 11 september 2001 in myanmar he died 29 hours after being bitten references external links category elapidae category
