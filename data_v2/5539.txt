bates method is an ineffective alternative therapy aimed at improving eyesight eye care physician william horatio bates m d 1860 1931 attributed nearly all sight problems to habitual strain of eyes and felt that glasses were harmful and never necessary bates self published a book perfect sight without glasses as well as a magazine better eyesight magazine and earlier collaborated with bernarr macfadden on a correspondence course detailing his approach to helping people relax such strain and thus he claimed improve their sight his techniques centered on visualization and movement he placed particular emphasis on imagining black letters and marks and movement of such he also proposed that exposing eyes to sunlight would help alleviate strain despite continued anecdotal reports of successful results including well publicised support by aldous huxley bates techniques have not been objectively shown to improve eyesight his main physiological proposition that eyeball changes shape to maintain focus has consistently been contradicted by observation in 1952 optometry professor elwin marg wrote of bates most of his claims and almost all of his theories have been considered false by practically all visual scientists marg concluded that bates method owed its popularity largely to flashes of clear vision experienced by many who followed it such occurrences have since been explained as a contact lens like effect of moisture on eye or a flattening of lens by ciliary muscles bates method has been criticized not only because there is no good evidence it works but also because it can have negative consequences for those who attempt to follow it they might damage their eyes through overexposure of their eyes to sunlight put themselves and others at risk by not wearing their corrective lenses while driving or neglect conventional eye care possibly allowing serious conditions to develop underlying concepts accommodation accommodation is process by which eye increases optical power to maintain focus on retina while shifting its gaze to a closer point long standing medical consensus is that this is accomplished by action of ciliary muscle a muscle within eye which adjusts curvature of eye s crystalline lens this explanation is based in observed effect of atropine temporarily preventing accommodation when applied to ciliary muscle as well as images reflected on crystalline lens becoming smaller as eye shifts focus to a closer point indicating a change in lens shape bates rejected this explanation and in his 1920 book presented photographs that he said showed that image remained same size even as eye shifted focus concluding from this that lens was not a factor in accommodation however optometrist philip pollack in a 1956 work characterized these photographs as so blurred that it is impossible to tell whether one image is larger than other in contrast to later photographs that clearly showed a change in size of reflected images just as had been observed since late 19th century bates adhered to a different explanation of accommodation that had already been generally disregarded by medical community of his time bates model had muscles surrounding eyeball controlling its focus in addition to their known function of turning eye bates maintained they also affect its shape elongating eyeball to focus at near point or shortening it to focus at a distance commenting on this hypothesis in an interview with ophthalmologist richard e stated when we put drops in eye to dilate pupil they paralyze focusing muscles evidence of anatomical fallacy is that you can t focus but your eye can move up and down left and right notion that external muscles affect focusing is totally wrong science author john grant writes that many animals such as fishes accommodate by elongation of eyeball it s just that humans aren t one of those animals laboratory tests have shown that human eyeball is far too rigid to spontaneously change shape to a degree that would be necessary to accomplish what bates described exceedingly small changes in axial length of eyeball 18 6 19 2 mm are caused by action of ciliary muscle during accommodation however these changes are far too small to account for necessary changes in focus producing changes of only 0 036 causes of sight problems medical professionals characterize refractive errors such as nearsightedness farsightedness astigmatism and age related blurring of near point vision as consequences of eye s shape and other basic anatomy for which no evidence shows that any exercise can alter bates however believed that these conditions are caused by tension of muscles surrounding eyeball which he believed prevents eyeball from sufficiently changing shape per his explanation of accommodation when gaze is shifted nearer or farther bates characterized this supposed muscular tension as consequence of a mental strain to see relief of which he claimed would instantly improve sight he also linked disturbances in circulation of blood which he said is very largely influenced by thought not only to refractive errors but also to double vision crossed eye lazy eye and to more serious eye conditions such as cataracts and glaucoma his therapies were based on these assumptions bates felt that corrective lenses which he characterized as eye crutches are an impediment to curing poor vision in his view strain would increase as eyes adjust to correction in front of them he thus recommended that glasses be discarded by anyone applying his method treatments in his writings bates discussed several techniques that he claimed helped patients to improve their sight he wrote ways in which people strain to see are infinite and methods used to relieve strain must be almost equally varied emphasizing that no single approach would work for everyone his techniques were all designed to help disassociate this strain from seeing and thereby achieve central fixation or seeing what is in central point of vision without staring he asserted that all errors of refraction and all functional disturbances of eye disappear when it sees by central fixation and that other conditions were often relieved as well palming thumb photo of someone palming from perfect sight without glasses bates suggested closing eyes for minutes at a time to help bring about relaxation he asserted that relaxation could be deepened in most cases by palming or covering closed eyes with palms of hands without putting pressure on eyeballs if covered eyes did not strain he said they would see a field so black that it is impossible to remember imagine or see anything blacker since light was excluded by palms however he reported that some of his patients experienced illusions of lights and colors sometimes amounting to kaleidoscopic appearances as they occurrences he attributed to his ubiquitous strain and that he claimed disappeared when one truly relaxed this phenomenon however was almost certainly caused by or dark light in fact even in conditions of perfect darkness as inside a cave neurons at every level of visual system produce random background activity that is interpreted by brain as patterns of light and color visualization bates placed importance on mental images as he felt relaxation was key to clarity of imagination as well as of actual sight he claimed that one s poise could be gauged by visual memory of black that darker it appeared in mind and smaller area of black that could be imagined more relaxed one was at moment he recommended that patients think of top letter from an eye chart and then visualize progressively smaller black letters and eventually a period or comma but he emphasized his view that clear visual memory of black cannot be attained by any sort of effort stating that memory is not cause of relaxation but must be preceded by it and cautioned against concentrating on black as he regarded an attempt to think of one thing only as a strain while bates preferred to have patients imagine something black he also reported that some found objects of other colors easiest to visualize thus were benefited most by remembering those because he asserted memory can never be perfect unless it is easy skeptics reason that only benefit to eyesight gained from such techniques is itself imagined and point out that familiar objects including letters on an eye chart can be recognized even when they appear less than clear movement he thought that manner of eye movement affected sight he suggested shifting or moving eyes back and forth to get an illusion of objects swinging in opposite direction he believed that smaller area over which swing was experienced greater was benefit to sight he also indicated that it was usually helpful to close eyes and imagine something swinging by alternating actual and mental shifting over an image bates wrote many patients were quickly able to shorten shift to a point where they could conceive and swing a letter size of a period in a newspaper one who mastered this would attain universal swing bates believed perhaps finding bates concepts of shifting and swinging too complicated some proponents of vision improvement such as bernarr macfadden suggested simply moving eyes up and down from side to side and shifting one s gaze between a near point and a far point sunning thumb a burning glass being used to focus sunlight on someone s eye from perfect sight without glasses bates believed that eyes were benefited by exposure to sunlight he stated that persons with normal sight can look directly at sun or at strongest artificial light without injury or discomfort and gave several examples of patients vision purportedly improving after is at variance with well known risk of eye damage that can result from direct sunlight observation bates said that just as one should not attempt to run a marathon without training one should not immediately look directly at sun but he suggested that it could be worked up to he acknowledged that looking at sun could have ill effects but characterized them as being always temporary and in fact effects of strain in response to sunlight he wrote that he had cured people who believed that sun had caused them permanent eye damage in his magazine bates later suggested exposing only white part of eyeball to direct sunlight and only for seconds at a time after allowing sun to shine on closed eyelids for a longer period posthumous publications of bates book omitted mention of supposed benefits from direct sunlight shining on open eyes effectiveness techniques advocated by bates are based on fallacious assumptions about eye and have no effect on improving eyesight only effect they can have is to delay use of effective therapy with possible adverse consequences as early as 1929 federal trade commission lodged a complaint against bates for advertising falsely or misleadingly in 1967 british medical journal reported that bates advocated prolonged sun gazing as treatment of myopia with disastrous results philosopher frank j leavitt has argued that method bates described would be difficult to test scientifically due to his emphasis on relaxation and visualization leavitt asked how can we tell whether someone has relaxed or imagined something or just thinks that he or she has imagined it regarding possibility of a placebo trial leavitt commented i cannot conceive of how we could put someone in a situation where he thinks he has imagined something while we know that he has not after bates after bates died in 1931 his methods of treatment were continued by his widow emily and other associates some of whom incorporated exercises and dietary recommendations most subsequent proponents did not stand by bates explanation of how eye focuses mechanically but nonetheless maintained that relieving a habitual strain was key to improving sight margaret darst corbett margaret darst corbett first met bates when she consulted him about her husband s eyesight she became his pupil and eventually taught his method at her school of eye education in los angeles she was of stated belief that optic nerve is really part of brain and vision is nine tenths mental and one tenth only physical in late 1940 corbett and her assistant were charged with violations of medical practice act of california for treating eyes without a licence at trial many of her students testified on her behalf describing in detail how she had enabled them to discard their glasses one witness testified that he had been almost blind from cataracts but that after working with corbett his vision had improved to such an extent that for first time he could read for eight hours at a stretch without glasses corbett explained in court that she was practicing neither optometry nor ophthalmology and represented herself not as a doctor but only as an instructor of eye training describing her method she said we turn vision on by teaching eyes to shift we want sense of motion to relieve staring to end fixed look we use light to relax eyes and to accustom them to sun trial attracted widespread interest as did not guilty verdict case spurred a bill in californian state legislature that would have then made such vision education illegal without an optometric or medical licence after a lively campaign in media bill was rejected aldous huxley thumb aldous huxley perhaps most famous proponent of bates method was british writer aldous huxley at age of 16 huxley had an attack of keratitis which after an 18 month period of near blindness left him with one eye just capable of light perception and other with an unaided snellen fraction of 10 200 this was mainly due to opacities in both corneas complicated by hyperopia and astigmatism he was able to read only if he wore thick glasses and dilated his better pupil with atropine to allow that eye to see around an opacity in center of cornea in 1939 at age of 45 and with eyesight that continued to deteriorate he happened to hear of bates method and sought help of margaret corbett who gave him regular lessons three years later he wrote art of seeing in which he related within a couple of months i was reading without spectacles and what was better still without strain and fatigue at present time my vision though very far from normal is about twice as good as it used to be when i wore spectacles describing process huxley wrote vision is not won by making an effort to get it it comes to those who have learned to put their minds and eyes into a state of alert passivity of dynamic relaxation he expressed indifference regarding veracity of bates explanation of how eye focuses stating my concern is not with anatomical mechanism of accommodation but with art of seeing his case generated wide publicity as well as scrutiny ophthalmologist walter b lancaster for example suggested in 1944 that huxley had learned how to use what he has to better advantage by training cerebral part of seeing rather than actually improving quality of image on retina in 1952 10 years after writing art of seeing huxley spoke at a hollywood banquet wearing no glasses and according to bennett cerf apparently reading his paper from lectern without difficulty in cerf s words then suddenly he faltered and disturbing truth became obvious he wasn t reading his address at all he had learned it by heart to refresh his memory he brought paper closer and closer to his eyes when it was only an inch or so away he still couldn t read it and had to fish for a magnifying glass in his pocket to make typing visible to him it was an agonizing moment in response to this huxley wrote i often do use magnifying glasses where conditions of light are bad and have never claimed to be able to read except under very good conditions this underscored that he had not regained anything close to normal vision and in fact never claimed that he had modern variants natural vision correction or natural vision improvement continues to be marketed by practitioners offering individual instruction many of whom have no medical or optometric credentials most base their approach in bates method though some also integrate vision therapy techniques also many self help books and programs which have not been subjected to randomized controlled trials are aimed at improving eyesight naturally purveyors of such approaches argue that they lack funds to formally test them heavily advertised see clearly method of which sales were halted by a court order in november 2006 in response to what were found to be dishonest marketing practices included palming and light therapy both adapted from bates creators of program however emphasized that they did not endorse bates approach overall in his 1992 book bates method a complete guide to improving eyesight naturally bates method teacher peter mansfield was very critical of eye care professionals for prescribing corrective lenses recommending most of bates techniques to improve vision book included accounts of 12 real cases but did not report any information about refractive error czech native john slavicek claims to have created an eye cure that improves eyesight in three days borrowing from ancient yogic eye exercises visualizations from seth material and bates method although he has testimonials from his neighbor and others several of his students indicate that he has greatly exaggerated their cases slavicek s self published manual yoga for eyes was rejected by an ophthalmologist who evaluated it and evinced no interest from world health organization and st erik s eye foundation in sweden as he had not conducted double blind tests anecdotal support in support of effectiveness of bates method proponents point to many accounts of people allegedly having improved their eyesight by applying it while these anecdotes may be told and passed on in good faith several potential explanations exist for phenomena reported other than a genuine reversal of a refractive error due to techniques practiced some cases of nearsightedness are recognized as due to a transient spasm of ciliary muscle rather than a misshapen eyeball these are classed as of which spontaneous reversal may account for some reports of improvement research has confirmed that when nearsighted subjects remove their corrective lenses over time there is a limited improvement termed blur adaptation in their unaided visual resolution even though refraction indicates no corresponding change in refractive error this is believed to occur due to adjustments made in visual system one who has been practicing bates techniques and notices such improvement may not realize that simply leaving glasses off would have had same effect which may be especially pronounced if prescription was too strong to begin with visual acuity is affected by size of pupil when it constricts such as in response to an increase in light quality of focus will improve significantly at cost of a reduced ability to see in dim light this is known as pinhole effect this concept is also used in photography when changing aperture size some eye defects may naturally change for better with age or in cycles ophthalmologist stewart duke elder suggested that this is what happened with aldous huxley a cataract when first setting in sometimes results in much improved eyesight for a short time one who happens to have been practicing bates method will likely credit it for any improvement experienced regardless of actual cause some studies have suggested that a learned ability to interpret blurred images may account for perceived improvements in eyesight ophthalmologist walter b lancaster had this to say since seeing is only partly a matter of image on retina and sensation it produces but is in still larger part a matter of cerebral processes of synthesis in which memories play a principal role it follows that by repetition by practice by exercises one builds up a substratum of memories useful for interpretation of sensations and facilitates syntheses which are major part of seeing lancaster faulted ophthalmologists in general for neglecting role of brain in process of seeing leaving to irregular half trained workers cultivation of that field a 1952 study involving 100 subjects claiming to experience flashes of clear vision in which eyesight momentarily becomes much sharper found only one subject who demonstrated unusually good transient acuity a flash but she was unable to maintain it or repeat it for measurement of refraction and concluded that those who can obtain remarkably large transient increases in visual acuity are uncommon a 2004 study proposed that such flashes may be caused by negative accommodation i e an active flattening of lens by ciliary muscles a 1982 study of subjects who underwent computer based visual training concluded that any perceived resulting improvement in visual acuity is best explained as a contact lens like effect of moisture on eye based on increased tear action exhibited by 15 out of 17 subjects who experienced such improvement a 2003 study of claims that positive suggestion e g using hypnosis can significantly improve visual acuity found that neither suggestion nor hypnotic phenomena are likely to significantly improve myopic vision general research in 2004 american academy of ophthalmology aao published a review of various research regarding visual training which consisted of eye exercises muscle relaxation techniques biofeedback eye patches or eye massages alone or in combinations no evidence was found that such techniques could objectively benefit eyesight though some studies noted changes both positive and negative in visual acuity of nearsighted subjects as measured by a snellen chart in some cases noted improvements were maintained at subsequent follow ups however these results were not seen as actual reversals of nearsightedness and were attributed instead to factors such as improvements in interpreting blurred images changes in mood or motivation creation of an artificial contact lens by tear film changes or a pinhole effect from of pupil in 2005 ophthalmology department of new zealand s christchurch hospital published a review of forty three studies regarding use of eye exercises they found that as yet there is no clear scientific evidence published in mainstream literature supporting use of eye exercises to improve visual acuity and concluded that their use therefore remains controversial general criticisms dead end a frequent criticism of bates method is that it has remained relatively obscure which is seen as proof that it is not truly effective writer alan m macrobert concluded in a 1979 article that most telling argument against bates system and other alternative therapies was that they bore no fruit in regards to bates method he reasoned that if palming shifting and swinging could really cure poor eyesight glasses would be as obsolete by now as horse drawn carriages corrective lenses and safety discarding one s corrective lenses as bates recommended or wearing lenses weaker than one s prescribed correction as some bates method advocates suggest poses a potential safety hazard in certain situations especially when one is operating a motor vehicle james randi related that his father shortly after discarding glasses on advice of bates book wrecked his car bates method teachers often caution that when driving one should wear correction legally required avoidance of conventional treatment one of greatest potential dangers of faith in bates method is that a believer may be disinclined to seek medical advice regarding what could be a sight threatening condition requiring prompt treatment such as glaucoma also children with vision problems may require early attention by a professional in order to successfully prevent lazy eye such treatment may include exercises but which are different from those associated with bates method and parents who subscribe to bates ideas may delay seeking conventional care until it is too late it may further be necessary for a child at risk of developing lazy eye to wear proper correction see also behavioral optometry convergence insufficiency list of topics characterized as pseudoscience pinhole glasses tibetan eye chart vision therapy see
