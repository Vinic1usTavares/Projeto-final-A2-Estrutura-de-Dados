sensibilities and themes for pop matters concluding its review by calling archie meets punisher best crossover in history of comic medium critical blast found some parts of story to be surprisingly serious but comic book resources thought constant slapstick comedy prevented comic from being anything but a novelty legacy since archie meets punisher archie characters have had a tradition of team
