2007 atlantic hurricane season was a slightly above average atlantic hurricane season featuring many weak and short lived storms despite high activity of weak storms during 2007 it was first season to feature more than one category 5 landfalling hurricane a feat that would not be matched until ten years later it produced 17 tropical cyclones 15 tropical storms six hurricanes and two major hurricanes it officially started on june 1 and ended on november 30 dates which conventionally delimit period during which most tropical cyclones form in atlantic ocean although as shown by subtropical storm andrea and tropical storm olga in early may and early december respectively formation of tropical cyclones is possible at any time of year first system subtropical storm andrea developed on may 9 while last storm tropical storm olga dissipated on december 13 most intense hurricane dean is tied for eighth most intense atlantic hurricane ever recorded as well as third most intense atlantic hurricane at landfall season was one of only seven on record for atlantic with more than one category 5 hurricane it was second on record in which an atlantic hurricane felix and an eastern pacific hurricane henriette made landfall on same day september had a record tying eight storms although strengths and durations of most of storms were low aside from hurricanes dean and felix none of storms in season exceeded category 1 intensity pre season forecasts by colorado state university called for 14 named storms and 7 hurricanes of which three were expected to attain major hurricane status national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa later issued its initial forecast which predicted 13 to 17 named storms 7 to 10 hurricanes and three to five major hurricanes after several revisions in projected number of storms noaa and csu lowered their forecasts by middle of season several storms made landfall or directly affected land hurricanes dean and felix made landfall at category 5 intensity causing severe damage in parts of mexico and central america respectively both storm names as well as noel name of a hurricane that affected caribbean were retired from naming list of atlantic hurricanes united states was affected by five cyclones although storms were generally weak three tropical depressions and only two tropical storms barry and gabrielle and one hurricane humberto made landfall in country elsewhere three storms directly affected canada although none severely combined storms killed at least 478 people and caused about 3 42 billion 2007 usd usd in damage cumulative damage figures were obtained by summing damage figures on individual tropical cyclone reports referenced throughout article with exception of hurricane dean dean s damage figures were obtained by adding per country totals referenced in impact section of this article seasonal forecasts noted hurricane experts philip j klotzbach william m gray and their associates at colorado state university issue forecasts of hurricane activity each year separately from noaa klotzbach s team formerly led by gray determined average number of storms per season between 1950 and 2000 to be 9 6 tropical storms 5 9 hurricanes and 2 3 major hurricanes storms exceeding category 3 on saffir simpson hurricane scale a normal season as defined by noaa has 9 to 12 named storms of

july november only 12 storms observed in this period pre season forecasts on december 8 2006 klotzbach s team issued its first extended range forecast for 2007 season predicting above average activity 14 named storms seven hurricanes three of category 3 or higher it listed a 64 percent chance of at least one major hurricane striking u s mainland this included a 40 percent chance of at least one major hurricane strike on east coast including florida peninsula and a 40 percent chance of at least one such strike on gulf coast from florida panhandle westward potential for major hurricane activity in caribbean was forecast to be above average and team predicted that el nino associated with reduced hurricane activity in atlantic would dissipate by active portion of season on april 3 a new forecast was issued calling for a very active hurricane season of 17 named storms nine hurricanes and five intense hurricanes increase in forecast was attributed to rapid dissipation of el nino conditions team also forecast a neutral or weak to moderate la nina and noted that sea surface temperatures were much higher than average estimated potential for at least one major hurricane to affect u s was increased to 74 percent east coast potential increased to 50 percent and from florida panhandle westward to brownsville texas probability rose to 49 percent however team s report noted that while they predicted an active season it was not suggesting that 2007 would be as active as 2004 and 2005 seasons midseason outlooks on june 19 uk met office ukmo issued a forecast of 10 tropical storms in july to november period with a 70 percent chance that number would be in range of 7 to 13 on august 3 2007 klotzbach s team lowered its season estimate to 15 named storms of which eight were to become hurricanes and four to become major hurricanes team members noted that conditions had become slightly less favorable for storms than earlier in year sea surface temperature anomalies were cooler and several saharan air layer events had suppressed development of tropical cyclones el nino southern oscillation enso conditions were also noted to have been slightly cooler on august 9 2007 noaa revised its season estimate slightly downwards to 13 to 16 named storms of which seven to nine were to be hurricanes and three to five major hurricanes however agency reaffirmed its prediction of an above average season citing warmer than normal sea surface temperatures in parts of atlantic ocean and caribbean sea and likelihood of la nina conditions during peak of season season summary overall season s activity was reflected with a cumulative accumulated cyclone energy ace rating of 74 which is below long term average of 93 and lowest since 2002 ace is broadly speaking a measure of power of hurricane multiplied by length of time it existed so storms that last a long time as well as particularly strong hurricanes have high aces ace is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34 knots 39 mph 63 km h or tropical storm strength although officially subtropical cyclones such as andrea or initial portions of gabrielle jerry and olga are excluded from total figure above includes periods when storms were in a subtropical phase only two major hurricanes storms of category 3 intensity or higher formed during season least since 1997 season although tied with 2006 and 2002 seasons named storms were active for 33 50 days during season lowest number of active days since 1994 season there were only 11 25 days with active hurricanes lowest value since 2002 season despite this number of days with major hurricanes was above long term average four named storms made landfall on u s during year but damage from those storms totaled to only about 82 million 2007 usd this was least damage u s saw from any atlantic hurricane season since 1990 season season was one of only six atlantic hurricane seasons to produce two category 5 equivalent hurricanes others being 1932 1933 1961 2005 and 2017 seasons two category 5 hurricanes dean and felix both reached category 5 strength on two separate occasions and both made landfall at category 5 intensity making 2007 season first to feature two hurricanes doing each both of which would not be repeated until 2017 when hurricane felix was upgraded to a category 5 storm on september 2 it became eighth to form in this basin since 2000 this gave decade more hurricanes of such strength than any other on record when tropical depression fourteen was upgraded to tropical storm melissa on september 29 it was eighth named storm to form in month of september that tied a record for most storms during september which was first set in 2002 hurricane humberto was first hurricane to make landfall in texas since hurricane claudette in 2003 systems subtropical storm andrea first storm of season subtropical storm andrea originated from a large extratropical cyclone that formed off mid atlantic coast on may 6 it deepened steadily along a cold front that pushed through florida when system lost most of its baroclinic support development ceased until its low moved into warmer waters near bahamas however interaction between low and a strong high pressure system to north generated hurricane force winds in system decreasing vertical wind shear allowed storm to generate deeper convection much closer to center by may 9 previously extratropical cyclone had transformed into subtropical storm andrea while located about 140 miles 225 km southeast of savannah georgia andrea began its subtropical phase as it was weakening and continued this deterioration as it moved southward into an environment with higher wind shear by may 11 andrea had lost all significant convection and degenerated into a remnant low though it produced intermittent bursts of convection andrea s chance of regeneration was extinguished when an advancing cold front pushed it northward and eventually absorbed system andrea was short lived dissipating on may 11 it was first pre season storm to develop since tropical storm ana in april 2003 and first atlantic named storm in may since tropical storm arlene in 1981 six people drowned along southeast u s coast however because andrea never made landfall most of resulting damage was associated with large waves higher than normal tides associated coastal flooding and beach erosion caused by storm tropical storm barry on june 1 tropical storm barry developed on first day of hurricane season it originated from a trough of low pressure in southeastern gulf of mexico that previously formed in northwestern caribbean it accelerated to northeast before reaching a peak intensity of 997 mbar and making landfall on florida barry dissipated on june 2 in florida rainfall resulted in slick roads which caused two traffic related deaths and a woman was killed after being injured by rough surf tropical storm chantal an area of low pressure formed near bahamas on july 28 and gradually began to organize while moving north northeast on july 30 it was classified as tropical depression three and was named tropical storm chantal shortly thereafter while south of nova scotia storm weakened on august 1 and made landfall on newfoundland it later tracked into north atlantic as an extratropical storm chantal moved over avalon peninsula of newfoundland where flooding was observed where about of rain caused postponement of annual royal st john s regatta insured damage across area totaled 5 8 million 2007 cad 5 5 million 2007 usd usd hurricane dean on august 11 a tropical wave moved off west coast of africa and encountering favorable conditions quickly spawned tropical depression four roughly 520 miles 835 km west southwest of cape verde depression moved briskly westward south of a deep layered ridge and was upgraded to tropical storm dean on august 14 storm continued to strengthen overnight as it gained organization and became first hurricane of season on august 16 on august 17 eye of hurricane passed into caribbean between islands of martinique and saint lucia as a category 2 hurricane in warm waters of caribbean dean rapidly strengthened into a category 5 hurricane with sustained winds this made it strongest atlantic hurricane since hurricane wilma and it was tied for seventh most intense atlantic storm of all time an eyewall replacement cycle weakened dean which then passed just south of jamaica as a category 4 hurricane dean regained category 5 status late on august 20 and at that strength it made landfall on yucatan peninsula of mexico near costa maya on august 21 hurricane dean was first storm to make landfall as a category 5 hurricane in atlantic basin since hurricane andrew in 1992 a dropsonde in eye of storm estimated a central pressure of 905 mbar tying dean with hurricane mitch for seventh most intense atlantic hurricane ever recorded dean was third most intense landfalling atlantic storm in history after labor day hurricane of 1935 and hurricane gilbert of 1988 dean weakened over land but re intensified slightly in gulf of mexico it made its final landfall near tecolutla veracruz on august 22 dissipating next day in hispaniola dean killed 15 people and destroyed hundreds of homes dean also left 616 million 2007 usd usd in damage on martinique and 154 million 2007 usd usd on guadeloupe in mexico hurricane dean made landfall on yucatan peninsula on august 21 as a category 5 hurricane throughout its track dean killed 44 people and caused several billion dollars in damage tropical storm erin tropical storm erin formed on august 16 in gulf of mexico from a persistent area of convection based on reconnaissance data received from an noaa plane investigating depression it was upgraded to tropical storm erin on august 15 it weakened to a tropical depression as it made landfall near lamar texas on august 16 and nhc issued its last advisory on system shortly thereafter as it moved inland early on august 19 after entering oklahoma remnants of erin suddenly re intensified to maximum sustained winds of 60 mph 95 km h a short distance west of oklahoma city storm flooded more than 40 homes and businesses along its path into central states erin killed 16 people 9 directly and left about 25 million 2007 usd usd in total damage hurricane felix an area of disturbed weather east of windward islands was designated tropical depression six on august 31 early on september 1 it was named tropical storm felix and it was upgraded to a hurricane later that day tracking generally westward it rapidly intensified to category 5 and after fluctuating in strength made landfall on nicaragua with winds at least 133 deaths and more than 50 million 2007 usd in damage have been attributed to felix with felix 2007 atlantic hurricane season became first known to include two hurricanes making landfall at category 5 hurricanes irma and maria made landfall at category 5 intensity during 2017 atlantic season hurricane felix took a similar path as hurricane dean though a bit further south although its effects were not severe damage on tobago was estimated at 250 000 2007 ttd 40 000 2007 usd usd hurricane felix made landfall just south of border between nicaragua and honduras in a region historically known as mosquito coast as a category 5 hurricane with 160 mph 260 km h winds on september 4 residents of region were reported to have been given little warning of oncoming hurricane which left many fisherman stranded at sea in all felix killed at least 130 people and damage in nicaragua totaled c 869 3 million 2007 nio 46 7 million 2007 usd usd tropical storm gabrielle a cold front that moved off southeastern coast of united states on september 1 developed a weak low over waters near georgia low drifted eastward and weakened over next few days until it joined with convection from an upper level trough that had been moving over western atlantic on september 8 center of circulation became sufficiently organized to be declared subtropical storm gabrielle about southeast of cape hatteras for next twelve hours system s strongest winds and thunderstorms remained separated from center on september 8 new convection eventually united with center leading transition of gabrielle into a tropical storm gabrielle gradually strengthened as it traveled northwest towards north carolina and virginia storm reached its peak intensity of 60 mph 95 km h just before it arrived in cape lookout though strong wind shear kept most of convection and surface winds offshore gabrielle weakened over land and moved back into atlantic on september 10 circulation deteriorated further and storm dissipated southwest of nova scotia next day in advance of storm tropical cyclone watches and warnings were issued for coastal areas while rescue teams and u s coast guard were put on standby storm dropped heavy rainfall near its immediate landfall location but little precipitation elsewhere along coast high waves rip currents and storm surge were reported slight localized flooding was reported gusty winds also occurred though no wind damage was reported overall damage was minor and there were no fatalities tropical storm ingrid a large tropical wave exited africa on september 6 and initially failed to develop due to strong easterly shear on september 9 a broad low pressure area developed about midway between africa and lesser antilles wind shear slowly weakened and early on september 12 tropical depression eight developed about 1125 miles 1815 km east of lesser antilles system moved west northwestward due to a ridge to its north and with continued wind shear it remained a tropical depression for 24 hours before convection increased further early on september 13 it intensified into tropical storm ingrid reaching peak winds of 45 mph 75 km h operationally it was not upgraded to a tropical storm until that evening ingrid remained a tropical storm until september 15 when it weakened to a tropical depression due to high shear from a strong tropical upper tropospheric trough gradual weakening continued as it passed northeast of leeward islands ingrid briefly reorganized on september 16 before weakening further and degenerating into an open wave early on september 17 remnants turned northwestward within low level steering flow and dissipated on september 18 without redevelopment there were no reports of damage or casualties associated with ingrid because storm never threatened land hurricane humberto on september 12 an area of thunderstorm activity in gulf of mexico organized into tropical depression nine about southeast of matagorda texas within three hours of forming it was named tropical storm humberto and it turned to north northeast before rapidly intensifying in early morning hours of september 13 a hurricane hunter aircraft found that humberto had strengthened into a hurricane while located about 15 miles 20 km off coast of texas humberto quickly weakened and entered southwest louisiana as a tropical storm during afternoon of september 13 dissipating next day hurricane humberto caused some structural damage on high island and widespread tree and power line damage in beaumont port arthur area power outages caused four oil refineries to halt production in beaumont one person was reported dead as a result of storm a bridge city man killed when his carport crashed on him outside his house damage was estimated at 50 million tropical depression ten a subtropical depression formed on september 21 in northeastern gulf of mexico from interaction of a tropical wave tail end of a cold front and an upper level low initially containing a poorly defined circulation and intermittent thunderstorm activity system transitioned into a tropical depression after convection increased over center tracking northwestward depression moved ashore near fort walton beach early on september 22 and shortly thereafter it dissipated over southeastern alabama it was first tropical cyclone to threaten new orleans area after destructive 2005 hurricane season and hurricane katrina overall impact from cyclone was minor and largely limited to light rainfall however precursor system spawned a damaging tornado in eustis florida where 20 houses were destroyed and 30 more were damaged damage was estimated at 6 2 million tropical storm jerry origins of jerry were from a non tropical low pressure area over central atlantic on september 21 system meandered for two days gradually developing deeper convection and gaining organization on september 23 national hurricane center declared it a subtropical depression as a warm core had developed but system was still involved with an upper level low and its strongest winds were well removed from center early on september 23 both satellite estimates and quikscat data determined that depression had strengthened into subtropical storm jerry despite lack of a well defined inner core storm slowly acquired tropical characteristics including a better defined warm core and jerry became fully tropical that evening as a weak and sheared tropical storm with 40 mph 65 km h winds over a small radius it accelerated northeastward over cooler waters with sea surface temperatures below 75 degf 24 degc on september 24 it weakened to a tropical depression ahead of a powerful cold front with little deep convection remaining in system that evening a quikscat pass determined that jerry opened up into a trough which was being absorbed into larger frontal system it completely dissipated by early on september 25 jerry never approached land during its lifespan and no damage or casualties were reported hurricane karen a very large tropical wave accompanied by a large envelope of low pressure emerged from coast of africa on september 21 as it moved westward deep convection gradually increased over disturbance as its broad low level circulation became better defined by september 24 as system traveled northwestward it organized enough to become a tropical depression six hours later depression was upgraded to tropical storm karen karen s organization and intensity remained steady for next day early on september 26 however storm strengthened significantly in post operational analysis cyclone was determined to have reached hurricane strength for about twelve hours however strengthening was short lived because a sharp upper level trough to west of karen increased amount of vertical wind shear over hurricane by september 28 these unfavorable conditions had weakened karen to a marginal tropical storm and left its large low level circulation exposed meanwhile storm began heading northward and experiencing intermittent bursts of deep convection however relentless wind shear exposed system s circulation until it dissipated in mid atlantic on september 29 karen s remnants lingered near leeward islands for next few days although system never directly affected land as a result no reported damages or casualties were associated with karen hurricane lorenzo a tropical wave moved off western coast of africa on september 11 traversed caribbean and crossed yucatan on september 21 disturbance developed a small surface low on september 24 while moving erratically over southwestern gulf of mexico strong upper level winds initially prevented system from developing convection however shear relaxed on following day and convection increased on evening of september 25 a hurricane hunter aircraft found evidence that low qualified as a tropical depression under weak steering currents depression drifted south and southwest executing a small cyclonic loop into bay of campeche upper level winds gave way to an anticyclone above depression and system became tropical storm lorenzo on september 27 about east of tuxpan rapid intensification brought lorenzo to hurricane status early that evening less than twelve hours after becoming a tropical storm lorenzo reached its peak intensity on september 28 then weakened slightly before making landfall near tecolutla mexico as a minimal hurricane small circulation weakened rapidly after landfall and system dissipated next day six deaths in mexico were attributed to lorenzo mostly due to flash floods and mudslides states of puebla and veracruz reported damage from rain and high winds two hundred people were forced to evacuate in hidalgo when san lorenzo river overflowed its banks lorenzo made landfall in virtually same location that hurricane dean had struck a month earlier damage was estimated at 1 billion 2007 mxn 92 million 2007 usd usd tropical storm melissa on september 26 a tropical wave exited africa and quickly developed a low pressure area following a convective increase and better defined outflow it developed into tropical depression fourteen about 115 miles 185 km west southwest of southernmost cape verde islands early on september 28 because depression was isolated from subtropical ridge depression drifted west northwestward westerly wind shear prevented significant development but following an increase in convection depression intensified into tropical storm melissa early on september 29 similar to previous storms ingrid and karen high wind shear in deep tropics hindered melissa s development and its peak winds were only 40 mph 65 km h operationally satellite imagery suggested storm reached by september 30 shear and cooler waters weakened melissa to a tropical depression with a poorly defined surface center system lost its deep convection and by that afternoon melissa degenerated into a remnant low it continued west northwestward producing intermittent convection until being absorbed by a front northeast of lesser antilles on october 5 there were no reports of damage or casualties tropical depression fifteen an area of disturbed weather extended from northwestern caribbean sea to western atlantic ocean on october 4 possibly related to remnants of hurricane karen system slowly organized developing a surface low pressure on october 8 to northeast of turks and caicos islands convection associated with storm steadily increased as low moved towards northeast by october 11 low organized into tropical depression fifteen about 740 mi 1 190 km east southeast of bermuda after convection had persisted for about 12 hours an upper level low to west caused strong southwesterly wind shear which inhibited development on october 12 a building ridge caused depression to slow at same time as convection began decreasing storm s center became exposed as deep convection became limited to a few small cells north of center by that afternoon depression degenerated into a remnant low remnant low persisted for next several days while picking up speed and taking a gradual turn towards northeast low transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on october 14 and intensified moving through azores with gale force winds it reached winds of 50 mph 85 km h before being absorbed by a larger extratropical storm on october 18 hurricane noel during evening of october 27 a low pressure system that had been slowly developing over eastern caribbean organized into tropical depression sixteen on next day it strengthened into tropical storm noel and made landfall on haiti on october 29 noel meandered across western caribbean for next three days intensifying into a hurricane on november 1 tracking northward noel began its transition into an extratropical cyclone on november 2 becoming fully extratropical on november 4 while over labrador as a powerful extratropical cyclone noel crossed back into atlantic and began a track towards western greenland throughout caribbean hurricane noel caused severe damage torrential rainfall and mudslides caused by storm killed at least 87 people in dominican republic and at least 73 in haiti noel generated winds of in region of newfoundland and labrador tropical storm olga in second week of december after official end of hurricane season a low developed east of northernmost lesser antilles it slowly acquired tropical characteristics and late on december 10 national hurricane center declared it subtropical storm olga while just north of puerto rico it is first post season storm since tropical storm zeta in 2005 season olga was only one of a few out of season tropical cyclones to make landfall storm made landfall on december 11 on eastern tip of dominican republic later that evening olga transitioned into a tropical storm just after making landfall olga tracked over hispaniola and emerged in caribbean sea strong wind shear and dry air caused olga to weaken into a remnant low early on december 13 storm impacted many areas affected by tropical storm noel a month earlier in puerto rico moderate rainfall caused one death according to national hurricane center s tropical cyclone report on olga at least 22 occurred due to release of floodgates at a dam in santiago province two deaths were also reported in haiti and one fatality was confirmed in puerto rico almost 12 000 homes were damaged of which 370 were completely destroyed storm names names to right were used for storms that formed in atlantic basin in 2007 this is same list used in 2001 season except for andrea ingrid and melissa which replaced allison iris and michelle respectively and were first used in 2007 names that were not assigned are marked in andrea barry chantal dean erin felix gabrielle humberto ingrid jerry karen lorenzo melissa noel olga retirement on may 13 2008 at 30th session of world meteorological organization s regional association iv hurricane committee wmo retired names dean felix and noel from its rotating name lists and they will not be used again for another atlantic hurricane they were replaced with dorian fernand and nestor for 2013 season although name nestor was not used in 2013 it was instead used for 2019 season season effects this is a table of storms in
