hurricane floyd in 1999 threatened florida as a major hurricane roughly three times as large as hurricane andrew floyd originated from a tropical wave well east of lesser antilles on september 7 while approaching bahamas storm strengthened significantly between september 12 and september 13 on latter day floyd peaked as a strong category 4 hurricane on saffir simpson scale however upon moving closer to bahamas storm fluctuated in intensity between a category 3 and a category 4 hurricane a subtropical ridge eroded by a mid to upper tropospheric trough over eastern united states caused floyd to curve northwestward over abaco islands and later to northeast avoiding a potentially catastrophic landfall in florida storm made its closest approach to florida early on september 15 passing about east of cape canaveral officials and residents in state underwent extensive preparations due to overwhelming threat from floyd tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued including a hurricane warning from florida city northward nearly entire east coast of florida almost 1 37 million floridians were placed under a mandatory evacuation order while approximately 2 2 million people evacuated at least 17 counties opened shelters which collectively housed more than 53 498 people thousands of travelers were left stranded after airline companies canceled flights to and from fort lauderdale jacksonville miami orlando and west palm beach walt disney world closed for a full day for first time since its opening in 1971 ultimately floyd remained well offshore and thus wrought relatively minor impacts in florida hurricane produced sustained winds up to and gusts up to beach erosion affected much of state s atlantic coast though worst impacts from floyd occurred in brevard and volusia counties in both counties erosion left some structural damage in latter winds and falling trees damaged a total of 337 homes volusia county alone experienced about 42 million in damage throughout

for five days a tropical depression developed well west of lesser antilles on september 7 early on next day depression intensified into tropical storm floyd cyclone reached hurricane intensity on september 9 while approaching bahamas floyd strengthened significantly between september 12 and september 13 on latter day system peaked as a strong category 4 hurricane on saffir simpson scale with maximum sustained winds of 155 mph 250 km h however upon moving closer to bahamas storm fluctuated in intensity between a category 3 and a category 4 hurricane although floyd appeared to pose a significant threat to florida a subtropical ridge eroded by a mid to upper tropospheric trough over eastern united states caused storm to curve northwestward over abaco islands and later to northeast as a result storm made its closest approach to around 09 00 utc on september 15 passing about east of cape canaveral floyd went on to make landfall in north carolina on september 16 as a category 2 hurricane and continued moving across mid atlantic and new england before becoming extratropical just offshore maine on september 17 several hurricanes made landfall in florida during 1990s including andrew in 1992 erin and opal in 1995 and earl and georges in 1998 another hurricane irene would strike state in october 1999 bringing total to six however floyd was approximately three times larger than andrew and similar in intensity at its peak intensity tropical storm force winds spanned a diameter of 580 mi 930 km making floyd one of largest atlantic hurricanes of its intensity ever recorded several computer forecast models as late as september 13 predicted either a landfall in florida or a glancing blow at time forecast models errors for 48 hour positions averaged west of storm s actual path official forecasts from national hurricane center which made about average errors outperformed all guidance models except for model preparations thumb right 300px visual comparison of hurricane floyd with hurricane andrew while at similar positions and nearly identical intensities initial fears were of a direct hit as a large category 4 hurricane in florida potentially costlier and deadlier than hurricane andrew had been in 1992 as a result national hurricane center issued tropical cyclone warnings and watches along atlantic coast of florida beginning with a hurricane watch from flagler beach to hallandale beach at 09 00 utc on september 13 six hours later watch was extended northward to brunswick georgia and southward to miami dade county at 18 00 utc lake okeechobee was included in watch area nearly entire east coast of florida was placed under a hurricane warning at 21 00 utc on september 13 when watch was upgraded from south of brunswick to florida city finally a tropical storm warning was issued in florida keys for areas north of seven mile bridge in preparation for a potentially catastrophic landfall florida governor jeb bush declared a state of emergency on

johns and 24 000 in nassau and flagler counties however about 2 2 million floridians evacuated a significant cause for major traffic jams at time this was largest evacuation in state s history until hurricane irma in 2017 as storm turned to north more people were evacuated as a progressively larger area was threatened massive storm caused what was at time largest peacetime evacuation ever in united states with an overall number of 2 6 million people evacuating coastal areas in florida georgia and carolinas by september 12 red cross was prepared to open eleven shelters in palm beach county and four in martin county which would shelter up to 4 000 people overall at least 53 498 stayed at shelters in 17 counties miami dade county had most shelters and highest number of shelter refugees

dollars in damage of space equipment draining funds of an already money strained government agency in theoretical scenario damage would be caused by water always a potential problem in an area only nine feet above sea level if water entered facility it would damage electronics as well as requiring a complete inspection of all hardware when floyd actually passed by area kennedy space center only reported light winds with minor water intrusion damage was minor overall and was repaired easily because fort lauderdale hollywood and miami international airports were closed miami dolphins flew to

johns st lucie and volusia counties through federal emergency management agency federal government offered up to 75 reimbursement for damages to public facilities in those counties a study conducted after storm indicated that 62 out of 67 counties lacked adequate shelter space in event of a worst case scenario hurricane therefore governor jeb bush proposed that 18 million to be allocated in 2000 state budget to create new shelters and improve those already existing with money coming from federal state and local sources plans called for shelter space to collectively accommodate an additional 88 679 people approximately 2 2 million people in florida evacuated although only about 1 37 million were ordered to a large contributing factor to major traffic jams most of those ordered to evacuate lived along coast in mobile homes or in low lying areas however in coastal central florida counties for instance a 2 400 person telephone survey indicated that approximately 40 of residents in inland areas evacuated even though they faced little danger as a result state officials and emergency management recommended that non vulnerable residents remain at home or close to home during future hurricanes officials also suggested contraflow lane reversal on interstate highways and florida s turnpike another recommendation to improve disaster preparation was to provide better and further up
