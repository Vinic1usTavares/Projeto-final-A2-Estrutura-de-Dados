decompression sickness dcs also known as divers disease bends or caisson disease describes a condition arising from dissolved gases coming out of solution into bubbles inside body on depressurisation dcs most commonly refers to problems arising from underwater diving decompression i e during ascent but may be experienced in other depressurisation events such as emerging from a caisson flying in an aircraft at altitude and extravehicular activity from spacecraft dcs and arterial gas embolism are collectively referred to as decompression illness since bubbles can form in or migrate to any part of body dcs can produce many symptoms and its effects may vary from joint pain and rashes to paralysis and death individual susceptibility can vary from day to day and different individuals under same conditions may be affected differently or not at all classification of types of dcs by its symptoms has evolved since its original description over a hundred years ago risk of dcs caused by diving can be managed through proper decompression procedures and contracting it is now uncommon its potential severity has driven much research to prevent it and divers almost universally use dive tables or dive computers to limit their exposure and to control their ascent speed if dcs is suspected it is treated by hyperbaric oxygen therapy in a recompression chamber if treated early there is a significantly higher chance of successful recovery classification dcs is classified by symptoms earliest descriptions of dcs used terms bends for joint or skeletal pain chokes for breathing problems and staggers for neurological problems in 1960 golding et al introduced a simpler classification using term type i simple for symptoms involving only skin musculoskeletal system or lymphatic system and type ii serious for symptoms where other organs such as central nervous system are involved type ii dcs is considered more serious and usually has worse outcomes this system with minor modifications may still be used today following changes to treatment methods this classification is now much less useful in diagnosis since neurological symptoms may develop after initial presentation and both type i and type ii dcs have same initial management decompression illness and dysbarism term dysbarism encompasses decompression sickness arterial gas embolism and barotrauma whereas decompression sickness and arterial gas embolism are commonly classified together as decompression illness when a precise diagnosis cannot be made dcs and arterial gas embolism are treated very similarly because they are both result of gas bubbles in body u s navy prescribes identical treatment for type ii dcs and arterial gas embolism their spectra of symptoms also overlap although symptoms from arterial gas embolism are generally more severe because they often arise from an infarction blockage of blood supply and tissue death signs and symptoms while bubbles can form anywhere in body dcs is most frequently observed in shoulders elbows knees and ankles joint pain bends accounts for about 60 to 70 of all altitude dcs cases with shoulder being most common site neurological symptoms are present in 10 to 15 of dcs cases with headache and visual disturbances being most common symptom skin manifestations are present in about 10 to 15 of cases pulmonary dcs chokes is very rare in divers and has been observed much less frequently in aviators since introduction of oxygen pre breathing protocols table below shows symptoms for different dcs types signs and symptoms of decompression sickness dcs type bubble location signs symptoms clinical manifestations musculoskeletal mostly large joints elbows shoulders hip wrists knees ankles localized deep pain ranging from mild to excruciating sometimes a dull ache but rarely a sharp pain active and passive motion of joint aggravates pain pain may be reduced by bending joint to find a more comfortable position if caused by altitude pain can occur immediately or up to many hours later cutaneous skin itching usually around ears face neck arms and upper torso sensation of tiny insects crawling over skin mottled or marbled skin usually around shoulders upper chest and abdomen with itching swelling of skin accompanied by tiny scar like skin depressions pitting edema neurologic brain altered sensation tingling or numbness paresthesia increased sensitivity confusion or memory loss amnesia visual abnormalities unexplained mood or behaviour changes seizures unconsciousness neurologic spinal cord ascending weakness or paralysis in legs urinary incontinence and fecal incontinence girdling also referred to as girdle banding or tightening feeling around abdominal region and or chest constitutional whole body headache unexplained fatigue generalised malaise poorly localised aches inner ear loss of balance dizziness vertigo nausea vomiting hearing loss pulmonary lungs dry persistent cough burning chest pain under sternum aggravated by breathing shortness of breath frequency relative frequencies of different symptoms of dcs observed by u s navy are as follows symptoms by frequency symptoms frequency local joint pain 89 arm symptoms 70 leg symptoms 30 dizziness 5 3 paralysis 2 3 shortness of breath 1 6 extreme fatigue 1 3 collapse unconsciousness 0 5 onset although onset of dcs can occur rapidly after a dive in more than half of all cases symptoms do not begin to appear for at least an hour in extreme cases symptoms may occur before dive has been completed u s navy and technical diving international a leading technical diver training organization have published a table that documents time to onset of first symptoms table does not differentiate between types of dcs or types of symptom onset of dcs symptoms time to onset percentage of cases within 1 hour 42 within 3 hours 60 within 8 hours 83 within 24 hours 98 within 48 hours 100 causes dcs is caused by a reduction in ambient pressure that results in formation of bubbles of inert gases within tissues of body it may happen when leaving a high pressure environment ascending from depth or ascending to altitude ascent from depth dcs is best known as a diving disorder that affects divers having breathed gas that is at a higher pressure than surface pressure owing to pressure of surrounding water risk of dcs increases when diving for extended periods or at greater depth without ascending gradually and making decompression stops needed to slowly reduce excess pressure of inert gases dissolved in body specific risk factors are not well understood and some divers may be more susceptible than others under identical conditions dcs has been confirmed in rare cases of breath holding divers who have made a sequence of many deep dives with short surface intervals and it may be cause of disease called by south pacific island natives who for centuries have dived by breath holding for food and pearls two principal factors control risk of a diver suffering dcs rate and duration of gas absorption under pressure deeper or longer dive more gas is absorbed into body tissue in higher concentrations than normal henry s law rate and duration of outgassing on depressurization faster ascent and shorter interval between dives less time there is for absorbed gas to be offloaded safely through lungs causing these gases to come out of solution and form micro bubbles in blood even when change in pressure causes no immediate symptoms rapid pressure change can cause permanent bone injury called dysbaric osteonecrosis don don can develop from a single exposure to rapid decompression leaving a high pressure environment thumb 300px alt schematic of a caisson principal features of a caisson are workspace pressurised by an external air supply and access tube with an airlock when workers leave a pressurized caisson or a mine that has been pressurized to keep water out they will experience a significant reduction in ambient pressure a similar pressure reduction occurs when astronauts exit a space vehicle to perform a space walk or extra vehicular activity where pressure in their spacesuit is lower than pressure in vehicle original name for dcs was caisson disease this term was introduced in 19th century when caissons under pressure were used to keep water from flooding large engineering excavations below water table such as bridge supports and tunnels workers spending time in high ambient pressure conditions are at risk when they return to lower pressure outside caisson if pressure is not reduced slowly dcs was a major factor during construction of eads bridge when 15 workers died from what was then a mysterious illness and later during construction of brooklyn bridge where it incapacitated project leader washington roebling on other side of manhattan island during construction of hudson river tunnel contractor s agent ernest william moir noted in 1889 that workers were dying due to decompression sickness and pioneered use of an airlock chamber for treatment ascent to altitude most common health risk on ascent to altitude is not decompression sickness but altitude sickness or acute mountain sickness ams which has an entirely different and unrelated set of causes and symptoms ams results not from formation of bubbles from dissolved gasses in body but from exposure to a low partial pressure of oxygen and alkalosis however passengers in unpressurized aircraft at high altitude may also be at some risk of dcs altitude dcs became a problem in 1930s with development of high altitude balloon and aircraft flights but not as great a problem as ams which drove development of pressurized cabins which coincidentally controlled dcs commercial aircraft are now required to maintain cabin at or below a pressure altitude of even when flying above symptoms of dcs in healthy individuals are subsequently very rare unless there is a loss of pressurization or individual has been diving recently divers who drive up a mountain or fly shortly after diving are at particular risk even in a pressurized aircraft because regulatory cabin altitude of represents only 73 of sea level pressure generally higher altitude greater risk of altitude dcs but there is no specific maximum safe altitude below which it never occurs there are very few symptoms at or below unless patients had predisposing medical conditions or had dived recently there is a correlation between increased altitudes above and frequency of altitude dcs but there is no direct relationship with severity of various types of dcs a us air force study reports that there are few occurrences between and and 87 of incidents occurred at or above high altitude parachutists may reduce risk of altitude dcs if they flush nitrogen from body by pre breathing pure oxygen predisposing factors although occurrence of dcs is not easily predictable many predisposing factors are known they may be considered as either environmental or individual decompression sickness and arterial gas embolism in recreational diving are associated with certain demographic environmental and dive style factors a statistical study published in 2005 tested potential risk factors age gender body mass index smoking asthma diabetes cardiovascular disease previous decompression illness years since certification dives in last year number of diving days number of dives in a repetitive series last dive depth nitrox use and drysuit use no significant associations with risk of decompression sickness or arterial gas embolism were found for asthma diabetes cardiovascular disease smoking or body mass index increased depth previous dci larger number of consecutive days diving and being male were associated with higher risk for decompression sickness and arterial gas embolism nitrox and drysuit use greater frequency of diving in past year increasing age and years since certification were associated with lower risk possibly as indicators of more extensive training and experience environmental following environmental factors have been shown to increase risk of dcs magnitude of pressure reduction ratio a large pressure reduction ratio is more likely to cause dcs than a small one repetitive exposures repetitive dives within a short period of time a few hours increase risk of developing dcs repetitive ascents to altitudes above within similar short periods increase risk of developing altitude dcs rate of ascent faster ascent greater risk of developing dcs us navy dive manual indicates that ascent rates greater than about when diving increase chance of dcs while recreational dive tables such as buhlmann tables require an ascent rate of with last taking at least one minute an individual exposed to a rapid decompression high rate of ascent above has a greater risk of altitude dcs than being exposed to same altitude but at a lower rate of ascent duration of exposure longer duration of dive greater is risk of dcs longer flights especially to altitudes of and above carry a greater risk of altitude dcs underwater diving before flying divers who ascend to altitude soon after a dive increase their risk of developing dcs even if dive itself was within dive table safe limits dive tables make provisions for post dive time at surface level before flying to allow any residual excess nitrogen to outgas however pressure maintained inside even a pressurized aircraft may be as low as pressure equivalent to an altitude of above sea level therefore assumption that dive table surface interval occurs at normal atmospheric pressure is invalidated by flying during that surface interval and an otherwise safe dive may then exceed dive table limits diving before travelling to altitude dcs can occur without flying if person moves to a high altitude location on land immediately after diving for example scuba divers in eritrea who drive from coast to asmara plateau at increase their risk of dcs diving at altitude diving in water whose surface altitude is above for example lake titicaca is at without using versions of decompression tables or dive computers that are modified for high altitude individual thumb alt diagram of four chambers of heart there is a gap in wall between upper left and upper right chambers atrial septal defect pfo showing left to right shunt a right to left shunt may allow bubbles to pass into arterial circulation following individual factors have been identified as possibly contributing to increased risk of dcs dehydration studies by walder concluded that decompression sickness could be reduced in aviators when serum surface tension was raised by drinking isotonic saline and high surface tension of water is generally regarded as helpful in controlling bubble size maintaining proper hydration is recommended patent foramen ovale a hole between atrial chambers of heart in fetus is normally closed by a flap with first breaths at birth in about 20 of adults flap does not completely seal however allowing blood through hole when coughing or during activities that raise chest pressure in diving this can allow venous blood with microbubbles of inert gas to bypass lungs where bubbles would otherwise be filtered out by lung capillary system and return directly to arterial system including arteries to brain spinal cord and heart in arterial system bubbles arterial gas embolism are far more dangerous because they block circulation and cause infarction tissue death due to local loss of blood flow in brain infarction results in stroke and in spinal cord it may result in paralysis a person s age there are some reports indicating a higher risk of altitude dcs with increasing age previous injury there is some indication that recent joint or limb injuries may predispose individuals to developing decompression related bubbles ambient temperature there is some evidence suggesting that individual exposure to very cold ambient temperatures may increase risk of altitude dcs decompression sickness risk can be reduced by increased ambient temperature during decompression following dives in cold water body type typically a person who has a high body fat content is at greater risk of dcs this is due to nitrogen s five times greater solubility in fat than in water leading to greater amounts of total body dissolved nitrogen during time at pressure fat represents about 15 25 percent of a healthy adult s body but stores about half of total amount of nitrogen about 1 litre at normal pressures alcohol consumption although alcohol consumption increases dehydration and therefore may increase susceptibility to dcs a 2005 study found no evidence that alcohol consumption increases incidence of dcs mechanism thumb upright alt a diver being helped out of his bulky diving gear this surfacing diver must enter a decompression chamber for surface decompression a standard operating procedure to avoid decompression sickness after long or deep s depressurisation causes inert gases which were dissolved under higher pressure to come out of physical solution and form gas bubbles within body these bubbles produce symptoms of decompression sickness bubbles may form whenever body experiences a reduction in pressure but not all bubbles result in dcs amount of gas dissolved in a liquid is described by henry s law which indicates that when pressure of a gas in contact with a liquid is decreased amount of that gas dissolved in liquid will also decrease proportionately on ascent from a dive inert gas comes out of solution in a process called outgassing or offgassing under normal conditions most offgassing occurs by gas exchange in lungs if inert gas comes out of solution too quickly to allow outgassing in lungs then bubbles may form in blood or within solid tissues of body formation of bubbles in skin or joints results in milder symptoms while large numbers of bubbles in venous blood can cause lung damage most severe types of dcs interrupt and ultimately damage spinal cord function leading to paralysis sensory dysfunction or death in presence of a right to left shunt of heart such as a patent foramen ovale venous bubbles may enter arterial system resulting in an arterial gas embolism a similar effect known as may occur during explosive decompression when water vapour forms bubbles in body fluids due to a dramatic reduction in environmental pressure inert gases main inert gas in air is nitrogen but nitrogen is not only gas that can cause dcs breathing gas mixtures such as trimix and heliox include helium which can also cause decompression sickness helium both enters and leaves body faster than nitrogen so different decompression schedules are required but since helium does not cause narcosis it is preferred over nitrogen in gas mixtures for deep diving there is some debate as to decompression requirements for helium during short duration dives most divers do longer decompressions however some groups like have been pioneering use of shorter decompression times by including deep stops any inert gas that is breathed under pressure can form bubbles when ambient pressure decreases very deep dives have been made using hydrogen oxygen mixtures hydrox but controlled decompression is still required to avoid dcs isobaric counterdiffusion dcs can also be caused at a constant ambient pressure when switching between gas mixtures containing different proportions of inert gas this is known as isobaric counterdiffusion and presents a problem for very deep dives for example after using a very helium rich trimix at deepest part of dive a diver will switch to mixtures containing progressively less helium and more oxygen and nitrogen during ascent nitrogen diffuses into tissues 2 65 times slower than helium but is about 4 5 times more soluble switching between gas mixtures that have very different fractions of nitrogen and helium can result in fast tissues those tissues that have a good blood supply actually increasing their total inert gas loading this is often found to provoke inner ear decompression sickness as ear seems particularly sensitive to this effect bubble formation location of micronuclei or where bubbles initially form is not known most likely mechanisms for bubble formation are when two surfaces make and break contact such as in joints and heterogeneous nucleation where bubbles are created at a site based on a surface in contact with liquid homogeneous nucleation where bubbles form within liquid itself is less likely because it requires much greater pressure differences than experienced in decompression spontaneous formation of on hydrophobic surfaces is a possible source of micronuclei but it is not yet clear if these can grow large enough to cause symptoms as they are very stable once microbubbles have formed they can grow by either a reduction in pressure or by diffusion of gas into gas from its surroundings in body bubbles may be located within tissues or carried along with bloodstream speed of blood flow within a blood vessel and rate of delivery of blood to capillaries perfusion are main factors that determine whether dissolved gas is taken up by tissue bubbles or circulation bubbles for bubble growth pathophysiology primary provoking agent in decompression sickness is bubble formation from excess dissolved gases various hypotheses have been put forward for nucleation and growth of bubbles in tissues and for level of supersaturation which will support bubble growth earliest bubble formation detected is subclinical intravascular bubbles detectable by doppler ultrasound in venous systemic circulation presence of these silent bubbles is no guarantee that they will persist and grow to be symptomatic vascular bubbles formed in systemic capillaries may be trapped in lung capillaries temporarily blocking them if this is severe symptom called chokes may occur if diver has a patent foramen ovale or a shunt in pulmonary circulation bubbles may pass through it and bypass pulmonary circulation to enter arterial blood if these bubbles are not absorbed in arterial plasma and lodge in systemic capillaries they will block flow of oxygenated blood to tissues supplied by those capillaries and those tissues will be starved of oxygen moon and 1988 concluded that evidence suggests that risk of serious neurological dci or early onset dci is increased in divers with a resting right to left shunt through a pfo there is at present no evidence that pfo is related to mild or late onset bends bubbles form within other tissues as well as blood vessels inert gas can diffuse into bubble nuclei between tissues in this case bubbles can distort and permanently damage tissue as they grow bubbles may also compress nerves causing pain or autochthonous bubbles usually form in slow tissues such as joints tendons and muscle sheaths direct expansion causes tissue damage with release of and their associated affects biochemical damage may be as important as or more important than mechanical effects bubble size and growth may be affected by several factors gas exchange with adjacent tissues presence of surfactants coalescence and disintegration by collision vascular bubbles may cause direct blockage aggregate platelets and red blood cells and trigger coagulation process causing local and downstream clotting arteries may be blocked by intravascular fat aggregation platelets accumulate in vicinity of bubbles endothelial damage may be a mechanical effect of bubble pressure on vessel walls a toxic effect of stabilised platelet aggregates and possibly toxic effects due to association of lipids with air bubbles protein molecules may be denatured by reorientation of secondary and tertiary structure when non polar groups protrude into bubble gas and hydrophilic groups remain in surrounding blood which may generate a cascade of pathophysiological events with consequent production of clinical signs of decompression sickness physiological effects of a reduction in environmental pressure depend on rate of bubble growth site and surface activity a sudden release of sufficient pressure in saturated tissue results in a complete disruption of cellular organelles while a more gradual reduction in pressure may allow accumulation of a smaller number of larger bubbles some of which may not produce clinical signs but still cause physiological effects typical of a blood gas interface and mechanical effects gas is dissolved in all tissues but decompression sickness is only clinically recognised in central nervous system bone ears teeth skin and lungs necrosis has frequently been reported in lower cervical thoracic and upper lumbar regions of spinal cord a catastrophic pressure reduction from saturation produces explosive mechanical disruption of cells by local effervescence while a more gradual pressure loss tends to produce discrete bubbles accumulated in white matter surrounded by a protein layer typical acute spinal decompression injury occurs in columns of white matter infarcts are characterised by a region of oedema haemorrhage and early myelin degeneration and are typically centred on small blood vessels lesions are generally discrete oedema usually extends to adjacent grey matter are found in blood vessels associated with infarcts following acute changes there is an invasion of lipid phagocytes and degeneration of adjacent neural fibres with vascular hyperplasia at edges of infarcts lipid phagocytes are later replaced by a cellular reaction of astrocytes vessels in surrounding areas remain patent but are distribution of spinal cord lesions may be related to vascular supply there is still uncertainty regarding aetiology of decompression sickness damage to spinal cord dysbaric osteonecrosis lesions are typically bilateral and usually occur at both ends of femur and at proximal end of humerus symptoms are usually only present when a joint surface is involved which typically does not occur until a long time after causative exposure to a hyperbaric environment initial damage is attributed to formation of bubbles and one episode can be sufficient however incidence is sporadic and generally associated with relatively long periods of hyperbaric exposure and aetiology is uncertain early identification of lesions by radiography is not possible but over time areas of radiographic opacity develop in association with damaged bone diagnosis decompression sickness should be suspected if any of symptoms associated with condition occurs following a drop in pressure in particular within 24 hours of diving in 1995 95 of all cases reported to divers alert network had shown symptoms within 24 hours an alternative diagnosis should be suspected if severe symptoms begin more than six hours following decompression without an altitude exposure or if any symptom occurs more than 24 hours after surfacing diagnosis is confirmed if symptoms are relieved by recompression although mri or ct can frequently identify bubbles in dcs they are not as good at determining diagnosis as a proper history of event and description of symptoms prevention underwater diving thumb alt close up of lcd display of an aladin pro display of a basic personal dive computer shows depth dive time and decompression information to prevent excess formation of bubbles that can lead to decompression sickness divers limit their ascent rate recommended ascent rate used by popular decompression models is about per minute and carry out a decompression schedule as necessary this schedule requires diver to ascend to a particular depth and remain at that depth until sufficient gas has been eliminated from body to allow further ascent each of these is termed a decompression stop and a schedule for a given bottom time and depth may contain one or more stops or none at all dives that contain no decompression stops are called no stop dives but divers usually schedule a short safety stop at or depending on training agency decompression schedule may be derived from decompression tables decompression software or from dive computers and these are commonly based upon a mathematical model of body s uptake and release of inert gas as pressure changes these models such as buhlmann decompression algorithm are designed to fit empirical data and provide a decompression schedule for a given depth and dive duration since divers on surface after a dive still have excess inert gas in their bodies decompression from any subsequent dive before this excess is fully eliminated needs to modify schedule to take account of residual gas load from previous dive this will result in a shorter allowable time under water without obligatory decompression stops or an increased decompression time during subsequent dive total elimination of excess gas may take many hours and tables will indicate time at normal pressures that is required which may be up to 18 hours decompression time can be significantly shortened by breathing mixtures containing much less inert gas during decompression phase of dive or pure oxygen at stops in of water or less reason is that inert gas at a rate proportional to difference between partial pressure of inert gas in diver s body and its partial pressure in breathing gas whereas likelihood of bubble formation depends on difference between inert gas partial pressure in diver s body and ambient pressure reduction in decompression requirements can also be gained by breathing a nitrox mix during dive since less nitrogen will be taken into body than during same dive done on air following a decompression schedule does not completely protect against dcs algorithms used are designed to reduce probability of dcs to a very low level but do not reduce it to zero exposure to altitude one of most significant breakthroughs in prevention of altitude dcs is oxygen pre breathing breathing pure oxygen significantly reduces nitrogen loads in body tissues by reducing partial pressure of nitrogen in lungs which induces diffusion of nitrogen from blood into breathing gas and this effect eventually lowers concentration of nitrogen in other tissues of body if continued for long enough and without interruption this provides effective protection upon exposure to low barometric pressure environments however breathing pure oxygen during flight alone ascent en route descent does not decrease risk of altitude dcs as time required for ascent is generally not sufficient to significantly slower tissues pure aviator oxygen which has moisture removed to prevent freezing of valves at altitude is readily available and routinely used in general aviation mountain flying and at high altitudes most small general aviation aircraft are not pressurized therefore oxygen use is an faa requirement at higher altitudes although pure oxygen pre breathing is an effective method to protect against altitude dcs it is logistically complicated and expensive for protection of civil aviation flyers either commercial or private therefore it is currently used only by military flight crews and astronauts for protection during high altitude and space operations it is also used by flight test crews involved with certifying aircraft and may also be used for high altitude parachute jumps astronauts aboard international space station preparing for extra vehicular activity eva camp out at low atmospheric pressure spending eight sleeping hours in quest airlock chamber before their spacewalk during eva they breathe 100 oxygen in their spacesuits which operate at although research has examined possibility of using 100 o2 at in suits to lessen pressure reduction and hence risk of dcs treatment thumb alt a large horizontal cylinder with a bank of instruments and monitors recompression chamber at neutral buoyancy lab all cases of decompression sickness should be treated initially with 100 oxygen until hyperbaric oxygen therapy 100 oxygen delivered in a high pressure chamber can be provided mild cases of bends and some skin symptoms may disappear during descent from high altitude however it is recommended that these cases still be evaluated neurological symptoms pulmonary symptoms and mottled or marbled skin lesions should be treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy if seen within 10 to 14 days of development recompression on air was shown to be an effective treatment for minor dcs symptoms by keays in 1909 evidence of effectiveness of recompression therapy utilizing oxygen was first shown by yarbrough and behnke and has since become standard of care for treatment of dcs recompression is normally carried out in a recompression chamber at a dive site a riskier alternative is in water recompression oxygen first aid has been used as an emergency treatment for diving injuries for years if given within first four hours of surfacing it increases success of recompression therapy as well as decreasing number of recompression treatments required most fully closed circuit rebreathers can deliver sustained high concentrations of oxygen rich breathing gas and could be used as a means of supplying oxygen if dedicated equipment is not available it is beneficial to give fluids as this helps reduce dehydration it is no longer recommended to administer aspirin unless advised to do so by medical personnel as analgesics may mask symptoms people should be made comfortable and placed in supine position horizontal or recovery position if vomiting occurs in past both trendelenburg position and left lateral position durant s maneuver have been suggested as beneficial where air are suspected but are no longer recommended for extended periods owing to concerns regarding cerebral edema duration of recompression treatment depends on severity of symptoms dive history type of recompression therapy used and patient s response to treatment one of more frequently used treatment schedules is us navy table 6 which provides hyperbaric oxygen therapy with a maximum pressure equivalent to of seawater for a total time under pressure of 288 minutes of which 240 minutes are on oxygen and balance are air breaks to minimise possibility of oxygen toxicity a multiplace chamber is preferred facility for treatment of decompression sickness as it allows direct physical access to patient by medical personnel but monoplace chambers are more widely available and should be used for treatment if a multiplace chamber is not available or transportation would cause significant delay in treatment as interval between onset of symptoms and recompression is important to quality of recovery it may be necessary to modify optimum treatment schedule to allow use of a monoplace chamber but this is usually better than delaying treatment a us navy treatment table 5 can be safely performed without air breaks if a built in breathing system is not available in most cases patient can be adequately treated in a monoplace chamber at receiving hospital prognosis immediate treatment with 100 oxygen followed by recompression in a hyperbaric chamber will in most cases result in no long term effects however permanent long term injury from dcs is possible three month follow ups on diving accidents reported to dan in 1987 showed 14 3 of 268 divers surveyed had ongoing symptoms of type ii dcs and 7 from type i dcs long term follow ups showed similar results with 16 having permanent neurological sequelae epidemiology incidence of decompression sickness is rare estimated at 2 8 cases per 10 000 dives with risk 2 6 times greater for males than females dcs affects approximately 1 000 u s scuba divers per year in 1999 divers alert network dan created project dive exploration to collect data on dive profiles and incidents from 1998 to 2002 they recorded 50 150 dives from which 28 were required although these will almost certainly contain incidents of arterial gas embolism age a rate of about 0 05 around 2013 honduras had highest number of decompression related deaths and disabilities in world caused by unsafe practices in lobster diving among indigenous miskito people who face great economic pressures at that time it was estimated that in country over 2000 divers had been injured and 300 others had died since 1970s history 1670 robert boyle demonstrated that a reduction in ambient pressure could lead to bubble formation in living tissue this description of a bubble forming in eye of a viper subjected to a near vacuum was first recorded description of decompression sickness 1769 giovanni morgagni described post mortem findings of air in cerebral circulation and surmised that this was cause of death 1840 charles pasley who was involved in recovery of sunken warship hms royal george commented that of those having made frequent dives not a man escaped repeated attacks of rheumatism and cold 1841 first documented case of decompression sickness reported by a mining engineer who observed pain and muscle cramps among coal miners working in mine shafts air pressurized to keep water out 1854 decompression sickness reported and one resulting death of caisson workers on royal albert bridge 1867 panamanian pearl divers using revolutionary sub marine explorer submersible repeatedly suffered fever due to rapid ascents continued sickness led to vessel s abandonment in 1869 1870 bauer published outcomes of 25 paralyzed caisson workers from 1870 to 1910 all prominent features were established explanations at time included cold or exhaustion causing reflex spinal cord damage electricity cause by friction on compression or organ congestion and vascular stasis caused by decompression thumb alt a large arch bridge with several substantial support pillars sunk into a river eads bridge where 42 workers were injured by caisson disease 1871 eads bridge in st louis employed 352 compressed air workers including alphonse jaminet as physician in charge there were 30 seriously injured and 12 fatalities jaminet developed decompression sickness and his personal description was first such recorded 1872 similarity between decompression sickness and iatrogenic air embolism as well as relationship between inadequate decompression and decompression sickness was noted by he suggested that intravascular gas was released by rapid decompression and recommended slow compression and decompression four hour working shifts limit to maximum pressure of 44 1 psig 4 atm using only healthy workers and recompression treatment for severe cases 1873 andrew smith first utilized term caisson disease describing 110 cases of decompression sickness as physician in charge during construction of brooklyn bridge project employed 600 compressed air workers recompression treatment was not used project chief engineer washington roebling suffered from caisson disease and endured after effects of disease for rest of his life during this project decompression sickness became known as grecian bends or simply bends because afflicted individuals characteristically bent forward at hips this is possibly reminiscent of a then popular women s fashion and dance maneuver known as grecian bend 1890 during construction of hudson river tunnel contractor s agent ernest william moir pioneered use of an airlock chamber for treatment 1900 leonard hill used a frog model to prove that decompression causes bubbles and that recompression resolves them hill advocated linear or uniform decompression profiles this type of decompression is used today by saturation divers his work was financed by augustus siebe and siebe gorman company 1904 tunnel building to and from manhattan island caused over 3 000 injuries and over 30 deaths which led to laws requiring psi limits and decompression rules for sandhogs in united states 1904 and gorman in conjunction with leonard hill developed and produced a closed bell in which a diver can be decompressed at surface thumb alt a horizontal cylinder just large enough to contain one person with an hinged door clamp at one end an early recompression chamber door removed for public safety 1908 prevention of compressed air illness was published by js haldane boycott and recommending staged decompression these tables were accepted for use by royal navy 1914 16 experimental decompression chambers were in use on land and aboard ship 1924 us navy published first standardized recompression procedure 1930s albert r behnke separated symptoms of arterial gas embolism age from those of dcs 1935 behnke et al experimented with oxygen for recompression therapy 1937 behnke introduced no stop decompression tables 1941 altitude dcs is treated with hyperbaric oxygen for first time 1957 robert workman established a new method for calculation of decompression requirements m values 1959 sos decompression meter a submersible mechanical device that simulated nitrogen uptake and release was introduced 1960 fc golding et al split classification of dcs into type 1 and 2 1982 paul k louis d homer and edward t flynn introduce survival analysis into study of decompression sickness 1983 orca produced edge a personal dive computer using a microprocessor to calculate nitrogen absorption for twelve tissue compartments 1984 albert a buhlmann released his book decompression decompression sickness which detailed his deterministic model for calculation of decompression schedules society and culture economics in united states it is common for medical insurance not to cover treatment for bends that is result of recreational diving this is because scuba diving is considered an elective and high risk activity and treatment for decompression sickness is expensive a typical stay in a recompression chamber will easily cost several thousand dollars even before emergency transportation is included as a result groups such as divers alert network dan offer medical insurance policies that specifically cover all aspects of treatment for decompression sickness at rates of less than 100 per year in united kingdom treatment of dcs is provided by national health service this may occur either at a specialised facility or at a hyperbaric centre based within a general hospital other animals animals may also contract dcs especially those caught in nets and rapidly brought to surface it has been documented in loggerhead turtles and likely in prehistoric marine animals as well modern reptiles are susceptible to dcs and there is some evidence that marine mammals such as cetaceans and seals may also be affected aw carlsen has suggested that presence of a right left shunt in reptilian heart may account for predisposition in same way as a patent foramen ovale does in humans footnotes see also notes 1 autochthonous formed or originating in place where found references
