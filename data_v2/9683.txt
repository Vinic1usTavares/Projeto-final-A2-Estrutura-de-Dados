a baroque instrumental ensemble of a corno da tirarsi possibly a slide trumpet two recorders two oboes da caccia strings and basso continuo this is an unusually rich instrumentation for an ordinary sunday bach created in opening chorus an unusual uncompromising fugue for up to nine parts bass aria with an obbligato trumpet depicting god s wrath compared to a thunderstorm has been regarded as more frightening than any contemporary operatic rage arias closing chorale is not usual simple four part setting but includes instrumental interludes reminiscent of motifs used before bach used music of first section of opening chorus for of his mass in b minor he made considerable changes when he adapted lamenting music to depict lamb of god carrying sins of world history and words bach composed cantata in his first year as in leipzig for tenth sunday after trinity eleventh cantata of his first cantata cycle prescribed readings for sunday were from first epistle to corinthians different gifts but one spirit and from gospel of luke jesus announcing destruction of jerusalem and cleansing of temple as with other cantatas bach composed in his first years in leipzig we do not know identity of

gardiner at work in rehearsal looking to left john eliot gardiner who conducted bach cantata pilgrimage in 2007 first movement behold and see if there be any sorrow in two sections is a lamento of large proportions text of lament part of prescribed for good friday has been set by many composers including tomas luis de victoria carlo gesualdo and handel who set it as a tenor arioso messiah last movement before scene of death movement is structured like a prelude and fugue prelude covering beginning of biblical verse fugue anguish of lord s wrath prelude begins with 16 measures of instrumental music with strings engaged in a persistent sobbing commentary as john eliot gardiner puts it who conducted bach cantata pilgrimage in 2000 and performed this cantata in brunswick cathedral in second round of vocal entries each part is intensified by a wind instrument musicologist julian mincham notes about bach s different ways to convey distress of text there is frequent stressing of word schmerz sorrow suspensions and dissonant seventh chords in harmony add to tension as do uses of highly expressive neapolitan chord and false relations fugue marked un poco allegro covers second part of verse translating to for lord has made me full of anguish on day of his wrathful anger fugue builds from two vocal parts and continuo to nine parts gardiner writes it is uncompromising in its contrapuntal wildness and grim dissonant harmony thumb upright 1 5 alt two lines of musical notation in comparison beginning of first vocal entry in cantata movement and beginning of in mass in 1733 a period of mourning death of august strong permitted composition of complex music when bach wrote his missa kyrie and gloria in b minor he reworked first part of movement and incorporated it into in lamenting music depicts lamb of god carrying sins of world bach transposed music from d minor to b minor used transverse flutes instead of recorders dropped instrumental opening and installed a repetitive bass when he adapted music to new function towards end of his life bach used complete for his mass in b minor 2 a tenor recitative lament then o destroyed city of god is accompanied by recorders and strings recorders play five note mourning figures which may depict tears of jesus mourning fall of jerusalem mincham notes that bach s experiments with instrumentation in a way that lends colour and expressive depth adding that it is equally likely that these iridescent are symbolic flickering feelings of uncertainty within a demolished world 3 first aria sung by bass your storm arose from far off depicts dramatically outbreak of a thunderstorm it is only part of cantata where trumpet appears in a solo function as a symbol of divine majesty strings and continuo depict thunder and lightning striking earth mincham notes about double image bass aria is indeed a graphic musical portrait of a thundering storm as well as an allegorical portrayal of god s anger and fury gardiner regards aria as more frightening than any operatic rage aria of time by say vivaldi or handel 4 alto renders in a secco recitative yet do not imagine o sinners mincham observes that bach is using minimum of resource but even so he still manages to create maximum of effect for example that in last measures in contrast to calm beginning harmony becomes more obscure bass less conjunct and alto line more passionate 5 alto aria yet jesus will even in punishment is scored as a quartet for voice two recorders and oboes in unison without basso continuo mincham notes that alto voice is surrounded and encompassed by instruments of contrasting but complementary timbres a movement without continuo appeared in same position within cantata previous week a soprano aria about conscience of sinner in herr gehe nicht ins gericht mit deinem knecht bwv 105 here jesus is seen as caring good shepherd whom poet describes he gathers them as his sheep lovingly as his little chicks 6 thumb upright johann matthaus meyfart poet of hymn closing chorale o great god of faithfulness by johann matthaus meyfart is a four part setting with recorders playing isolated little episodes between lines of chorales they are reminiscent of motifs of mourning heard in movement 2 elaborate setting with instrumental interludes is similar as in herr gehe nicht ins gericht mit
