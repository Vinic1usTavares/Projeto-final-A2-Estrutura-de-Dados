weyland corporation and assembles a team of experts to investigate team includes archaeologists linguistic experts drillers mercenaries and a guide named alexa lex woods sanaa lathan as a predator ship reaches earth s orbit it fires an energy beam aimed at pyramid site when team arrives at abandoned whaling station above heat source they find a perfectly circular unnatural tunnel running directly beneath ice towards pyramid weyland shows team satellite images showing that passage was not there 24 hours ago exploration team descend tunnel and locate mysterious pyramid and begin to explore it soon finding evidence of a prehistoric civilization and what appears to be a sacrificial chamber filled with human skeletons inexplicably all skeletons appear to have ruptured rib cages meanwhile three predators scar celtic and chopper arrive and kill remaining team members on surface they make their way down to pyramid and arrive just as team unwittingly activates structure and are trapped within it alien queen awakes from cryogenic stasis and begins to produce eggs when eggs hatch several facehuggers attach themselves to humans trapped in sacrificial chamber emerge from humans and quickly grow into adult xenomorphs conflict erupts between predators xenomorphs and humans resulting in several deaths celtic and chopper are killed by a xenomorph and weyland buys lex and italian archaeologist sebastian de rosa raoul bova enough time to escape from scar giving his life in process two witness scar kill a facehugger and a xenomorph with a shuriken before unmasking and marking himself with blood of facehugger after lex and sebastian leave another facehugger attaches itself to scar due to him not wearing his mask through translation of pyramid s hieroglyphs lex and sebastian learn that predators have been visiting earth for thousands of years it was they who taught early human civilizations how to build pyramids and were worshipped as gods every 100 years they visit earth to take part in a rite of passage by which several humans sacrifice themselves as hosts for xenomorphs creating ultimate prey for predators to hunt as a fail safe if overwhelmed predators would activate a self destruct device to eliminate xenomorphs and themselves two deduce that this is why current predators are at pyramid and that heat bloom was a ruse to attract humans to site for sole purpose of making new xenomorphs to hunt lex and sebastian decide that predators must be allowed to succeed in their hunt so that xenomorphs do not escape to surface sebastian is captured by a xenomorph leaving only lex and scar to fight xenomorph scar uses parts of a dead xenomorph to fashion weapons for lex and two form an alliance xenomorph queen using her own acidic blood is freed from her restraints and along with other xenomorphs begins pursuing lex and scar just as they are about to escape scar detaches and uses a bomb in his wrist module to destroy pyramid and remaining xenomorphs and eggs lex and scar reach surface however xenomorph queen has survived and continues chasing them they defeat queen by hooking her chains to exploration team s water supply tank and pushing it over a cliff dragging her to ocean floor scar however had been impaled by xenomorph queen s tail and succumbs to his wounds dying a predator ship and several predators appear they retrieve their fallen comrade and an elite predator presents lex with one of their spear weapons as a gift other predators recognize her for her skill as a warrior symbolized by alien blood scar burned on her cheek before he died predators spaceship flies off leaving lex behind lex walks over to a snowcat and leaves area predators leave scar s body on a plinth in front of a window on ship once predators

predator greenlight aliens writer director james cameron had been working on a story for a fifth alien film alien director ridley scott had talked with cameron stating i think it would be a lot of fun but most important thing is to get story right in a 2002 interview scott s concept for a story was to go back to where alien creatures were first found and explain how they were created this project eventually became scott s film prometheus 2012 on learning that fox intended to pursue alien vs predator cameron believed film would kill validity of franchise and ceased work on his story to me that was frankenstein meets werewolf it was universal just taking their assets and starting to play them off against each other milking it after viewing alien vs predator however cameron remarked that it was actually pretty good i think of five alien films i d rate it third i actually liked it i actually liked it a lot conversely ridley scott had no interest in alien vs predator films when asked in may 2012 if he had watched them scott laughed no i couldn t do that i couldn t quite take that step director neill blomkamp would eventually go on to pitch his sequel to aliens however scott stated in 2017 that project has been cancelled development concept of alien vs predator originated from aliens versus predator comic book in 1989 by comic book writers randy stradley and chris warner it was also hinted at when an alien skull appeared in a trophy case aboard predator ship in predator 2 shortly after release of predator 2 predator co writer jim thomas discussed possibilities of a predator franchise and commented on prospect of a crossover film stating i think predator vs alien is a good idea that will probably never happen screenwriter peter briggs created original spec screenplay in 1990 1991 which was based on first comic series in 1991 he successfully pitched concept to 20th century fox who owned film franchises although company did not move forward with project until 2002 project was delayed chiefly because studio was working on alien resurrection a draft penned by james demonaco and kevin fox was rejected by producer john davis who hoped to give film an original approach by setting it on earth as there were six producers between film franchises predator producer john davis had difficulty securing rights as producers were worried about a film featuring two creatures paul w s anderson pitched davis a story he worked on for eight years and showed him concept art created by randy bowen impressed with anderson s idea davis thought story was like jaws in that it just drew you in it drew you in anderson started to work on film after completing script for resident evil apocalypse with shane salerno writer of aliens vs predator requiem co writing salerno spent six months writing shooting script finished its development and stayed on for revisions throughout film s production dan o bannon and ronald shusett received story credit on film based on elements from their work on original alien story and setting thumb influenced by work of erich von daniken and aztec mythology anderson had predators come to earth in spaceships and teach humans how to build pyramids as a result they were treated as gods alt early reports claimed story was about humans who tried to lure predators with alien eggs although idea was scrapped influenced by work of erich von daniken anderson researched von daniken s theories on how he believed early civilisations were able to construct massive pyramids with help of aliens an idea drawn from aztec mythology anderson wove these ideas into alien vs predator describing a scenario in which predators taught ancient humans to build pyramids and used earth for rite of passage rituals every 100 years in which they would hunt aliens to explain how these ancient civilisations disappeared without a trace anderson came up with idea that predators if overwhelmed by aliens would use their self destruct weapons to kill everything in area h p lovecraft s novella at mountains of madness 1931 served as an inspiration for film and several elements of aliens vs predator comic series were included anderson s initial script called for five predators to appear in film although number was later reduced to three as alien vs predator is a sequel to predator films and prequel to alien series anderson was cautious of contradicting continuity in franchises he chose to set film on remote norwegian antarctic island of bouvet commenting it s definitely most hostile environment on earth and probably closest to an alien surface you can get anderson thought that setting film in an urban environment like new york city would break continuity with alien series as protagonist ellen ripley had no knowledge creatures existed you can t have an alien running around city now because it would ve been written up and everyone will know about it so there s nothing in this movie that contradicts anything that already exists casting thumb upright lance henriksen was first to be cast in alien vs predator as anderson wanted to keep continuity with alien series alt first actor to be cast for alien vs predator was lance henriksen who played character bishop in aliens and alien 3 although alien films are set 150 years in future anderson wanted to keep continuity with series by including a familiar actor henriksen plays billionaire and self taught engineer charles bishop weyland a character that ties in with weyland yutani corporation as original founder and ceo of weyland industries according to anderson weyland becomes known for discovery of pyramid and as a result weyland yutani corporation models bishop android in alien films after him when bishop android is created in 150 years time it s created with face of creator it s kind of like microsoft building an android in 100 years time that has face of bill gates anderson opted for a european cast including italian actor raoul bova ewen bremner from scotland and english actor colin salmon producer davis said there s a truly international flavor to cast and gives film a lot of character several hundred actresses attended auditions to be cast as film s heroine alexa woods sanaa lathan was selected and one week later she flew to prague to begin filming filmmakers knew there would be comparisons to alien heroine ellen ripley and did not want a clone of character but wanted to make her similar while adding something different anderson reported in an interview that california governor arnold schwarzenegger was willing to reprise his role as major alan dutch schaeffer from predator in a short cameo appearance if he lost recall election on condition that filming should take place at his residence schwarzenegger however won election with 48 58 of votes and was unavailable to participate in alien vs predator actress sigourney weaver who starred as ellen ripley in alien series said she was happy not to be in film as a possible crossover was reason i wanted my character to die in first place and thought concept sounded awful filming and set designs production began in late 2003 at barrandov studios in prague czech republic where most of filming took place production designer richard bridgland was in charge of sets props and vehicles based on early concept art anderson had created to give a broad direction of how things would look 25 to 30 life sized sets were constructed at barrandov studios many of which were interiors of pyramid pyramid s carvings sculptures and hieroglyphs were influenced by egyptian cambodian and aztec civilisations while regular shifting of pyramid s rooms was meant to evoke a sense of claustrophobia similar to original alien film according to anderson if he was to build sets in los angeles they would have cost 20 million however in prague they cost 2 million an important factor when film s budget was less than 50 million third scale miniatures several meters in height were created to give film effect of realism rather than relying on computer generated imagery cgi for whaling station miniatures and life sized sets over 700 bags of artificial snow were used roughly 15 20 tons a 4 5 meter miniature of an icebreaker with working lights and a mechanical moving radar was created costing almost 37 000 and taking 10 weeks to create visual effects producer arthur windus claimed miniatures were beneficial in filming process with computer graphics you need to spend a lot of time making it real with a miniature you shoot it and its there a scale 25 meter miniature of whaling station was created in several months it was designed so model could be collapsed and then reconstructed which proved beneficial for a six second shot which required a re shoot effects and creatures thumb a hydraulic alien was used to film six scenes as it was faster than a man in a suit puppet required six people to operate it alt special effects company amalgamated dynamics incorporated adi was hired for movie having previously worked on alien 3 and alien resurrection visual special effects producers arthur windus and john bruno were in charge of project which contained 400 effects shots adi founders alec gillis tom woodruff jr and members of their company began designing costumes miniatures and effects in june 2003 for five months creatures were redesigned predators wrist blades being extended roughly four times longer than those in predator films and a larger mechanical plasma caster was created for scar predator basic shape of predator mask was kept although technical details were added and each predator was given a unique mask to distinguish them from each other these masks were created using clay which was used to form moulds to create fiberglass copies these copies were painted to give a weathered look which woodruff claims is what predator is all about a hydraulic alien puppet was created so adi would be able to make movements faster and give alien a slimline and skeletal appearance rather than using an actor in a suit puppet required six people to run it one for head and body two for arms and a sixth to make sure signals were reaching computer movements were recorded in computer so that puppeteers would be able to repeat moves that anderson liked puppet was used in six shots including fight scene with predator which took one month to film crew tried to keep cgi use to a minimum as anderson said people in suits and puppets are scarier than cgi monsters as they are there in frame roughly 70 of scenes were created using suits puppets and miniatures alien queen was filmed using three variations a 4 8 meter practical version a 1 2 meter puppet and a computer generated version practical version required 12 puppeteers to operate and cgi tails were added to aliens and queen as they were difficult to animate using puppetry queen alien s inner mouth was automated though and was powered by a system of hydraulics anderson praised alien director ridley scott s and predator director john mctiernan s abilities at building suspense by not showing creatures until late in film something anderson wanted to accomplish with alien vs predator yes we make you wait 45 minutes but once it goes off from there until end of movie it s fucking relentless music austrian composer harald kloser was hired to create film s score after completing score for day after tomorrow kloser was chosen by anderson as he is a fan of franchises it was recorded in london and was primarily orchestral as anderson commented this is a terrifying movie and it needs a terrifying classic movie score to go with it at same time it s got huge action so it needs that kind of proper orchestral support score was released on 31 august 2004 and received mixed reviews james christopher monger of allmusic thought kloser introduced electronic elements well and called alien vs predator main theme a particularly striking and serves as a continuous creative source for composer to dip his baton in mike brennan of soundtrack however said it lacks ingenuity of previous trilogy alien and predator scores which all shared a strong sense of rhythm in place of thematic content kloser throws in some interesting percussion cues antarctica and down tunnel but more as a sound effect than a consistent motif john fallon of joblo com compared it to character development in film too generic to completely engage or leave a permanent impression reception box office alien vs predator was released in north america on august 13 2004 in 3 395 theatres film grossed 38 2 million

06 10 based on 145 reviews with site s critical consensus reading gore without scares and cardboard cut out characters make this clash of monsters a dull sit on metacritic film has a score of 29 out of 100 based on 21 critics indicating generally unfavorable reviews audiences polled by cinemascore gave film an average grade of b on an a to f scale rick of film threat praised film stating for a big dumb production about a movie monster smackdown alien vs predator is a surprisingly good time ian grey of orlando weekly felt anderson clearly relished making this wonderful utterly silly film his heart shows in every drip of slime staci layne wilson of horror com called it a pretty movie to look at with its grandiose sets and top notch creature fx but it s a lot like anderson s previous works in that it s all facade and no foundation gary dowell of dallas morning news called film a transparent attempt to jumpstart two run down franchises ed halter of village voice described film s lighting for fight sequences as black on black in blackness while ty burr of boston globe felt lighting left audience in dark home media releases alien vs predator was released on vhs dvd and psp umd movies in
