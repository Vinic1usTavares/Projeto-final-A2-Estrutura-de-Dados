bandit reception critical response english version of cobra was named as one of top 25 translated to english manga of all time by wizard magazine upatkoon of ex online magazine praised it as a rich fantasy that was unmatched by any other she said main character took after james bond albeit somewhat on silly side and costumes and bizarre worlds are but a shade shy of plagiarizing barbarella she was impressed that series is surprisingly devoid of sexual innuendo and exploitation that anime fans have come to associate with decorative female characters it avoids stereotypical beautiful women and instead creates its own extreme world upatkoon also said that modern readers might find manga dated and would be discouraged from reading it despite improvement in artistic quality as series progresses writing for anime news network ann jason thompson described cobra as a significant piece of manga history thompson wrote that women of series have a realistic physique and not some moe jailbait or grotesque explosion thompson deemed cobra as a parody of both western action heroes and star wars and 1970s shojo science fiction and its concept of beauty pedro cortes from japanator affirmed space adventure cobra is interesting in that it takes a shard of an idea from a classic and then spins it out into its own epic cortes praised its charming designs while criticized main character lack of development as only negative thing he added there isn t a ton of depth but show doesn t pretend to be anything but a fun sci fi romp around galaxy ann s theron martin praised its surprisingly solid art for a series of its era and affirmed it does stand up well as high spirited fun loving action fare with occasional darker overtones chris beveridge of fandom post said it s simple but full of adventure interesting characters and locations and a sense of fun that definitely makes it work in a very good way and has a solid visual design washington in a review for otaku usa commended it for being entertaining overall and having an overall fun vibe because of its smooth art he however criticized what he called serious misogynistic tendencies chris beveridge from mania com praised cobra animation anime series and its visual design comparing to psychogun ones but said it is not for those who are unaware original series he said anime has a healthy dose of action kind of sexuality that s a trademark of series as well as a good bit of silly fun in second episode review beveridge said it seems to be following much same kind of pace and structure as ovas its animation was compared with darkside blues ann s erin finnegan said it was a gritty animation but that from episode five animation quality looks more modern and much less gritty beveridge said anime s idea is simple but added it is also not a show you see often since it doesn t center around teenagers schools or harem concept he said it is not a great show but that it gives us something different than usual reason it is enjoyable popularity and legacy cobra made terasawa who at time was 22 and was little known famous approximately 40 million copies of cobra have been sold making it one of weekly

rights to a live action film adaptation of series he stated it was off record and that if it happened it would be partly standalone and separate from his original manga however in 2010 alexandre aja announced he had purchased its rights and that he planned to direct a live action film adaptation of cobra aja was inspired to create this film adaptation because original manga was one of his childhood favorites aja said he wanted to create a tent pole sized live action franchise in 2011 aja wrote a script with gregory levasseur and production was held by aton soumache and dimitri under onyx films and studio 37 with a budget of more than 100 million later a teaser poster depicting promotional concept art for cobra space pirate along with a release date scheduled for mid 2013 was unveiled in september 2013 however aja admitted that making film will be very hard since to do a new kind of star wars is expensive though he stated we are trying everything we will make it in july 2014 aja revealed it was estimated that project would require a budget of over 150 million and that he was seeking to have an a list actor to help attract a funder one of his main difficulties aja said in 2015 was to decide who would star film when i think who heck is going to play that cobra i become unable to move forward in a june 2016 interview aja said he did not abandon it and that project is well advanced working with orange studio and a group of twenty concept artists aja was able to develop an absolutely huge universe in visual research one of drawbacks that made him slow process was release of guardians of galaxy in 2014 because aja had to change several aspects of cobra to differentiate it in june 2017 he revealed script was ready but commented that another drawback is big budget required for film which finds no funders in us because franchise is relatively unknown there in april 2018 aja revealed film was in preproduction at lionsgate until a regime change occurred company s new staff considered film budget us 130 million to be high and release of star wars force awakens was also a factor on cancellation notes japanese references external links cobra at
