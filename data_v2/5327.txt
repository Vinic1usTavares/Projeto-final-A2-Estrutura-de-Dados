spotted sandgrouse pterocles is a species of ground dwelling bird in family pteroclidae it is found in arid regions of northern and eastern africa and across middle east and parts of asia as far east as northwest india it is a gregarious diurnal bird and small flocks forage for seed and other vegetable matter on ground flying once a day to a waterhole for water in breeding season pairs nest apart from one another eggs being laid in a depression on stony ground chicks leave nest soon after hatching and eat dry seed water they need being provided by male which saturates its belly feathers with water at waterhole spotted sandgrouse is listed as being of least concern by international union for conservation of nature in its red list of threatened species description 300px thumb spotted sandgrouse in desert at erg spotted sandgrouse reaches a length of about male has a small reddish brown nape surrounded by a band of pale grey that extends to bill and round neck in a collar chin neck and throat are orange and breast grey upper parts are pinkish grey with dark flight feathers and dark patches on wings tail and lower belly primaries are pale with dark trailing edges a fact that distinguishes this species from crowned sandgrouse pterocles coronatus which has completely dark primaries female also has an orange throat region but is generally duller in plumage than male body colour is greyish brown liberally spotted with small dark markings and with dark patches on wings tail and lower belly central tail feathers in both sexes are elongated but not to extent that they are in pin tailed sandgrouse pterocles when flying overhead a dark belly stripe is visible distribution and habitat thumb roosting at kutch where it is rare winter visitor thumb left female spotted sandgrouse spotted sandgrouse is found in north africa and middle east in africa its range extends through morocco algeria tunisia libya sudan egypt eritrea somalia ethiopia djibouti mali mauritania chad and niger in middle east it is native to oman saudi arabia israel jordan syria iran iraq and afghanistan and its range extends as far as pakistan and north west india in 2016 a flock of around a hundred birds arrived at kutch after a gap of 19 years it has also been recorded as a vagrant in italy united arab emirates and turkey it inhabits deserts and semi arid countryside and is largely resident although there is some local movement of flocks population size has not been firmly established but it seems to be stable and bird seems to be common over most of its extensive range it is listed as being of least concern by iucn red list of threatened species behaviour spotted sandgrouse has a rapid wing beat and flies swiftly its call is a musical queeto queeto which distinguishes it from other species of sandgrouse with similar plumage spotted sandgrouse is a ground dwelling bird and feeds on seeds and other plant material that it finds among scrubby vegetation of its dry habitat during breeding season it is solitary but at other times of year it is gregarious flocks move into a new feeding ground after a storm has stimulated new green growth in sahara spotted sandgrouse are particularly fond of a species of spurge and concentrate on this until foliage begins to after which birds return to their normal diet of seeds these are abundant on desert floor remaining in a dormant state until rain occurs george 1978 p 180 birds are very wary and easily frightened their chief enemy is lanner falcon which flies rapidly just above ground and scoops up any unwary bird sandgrouse strategy is to have one bird flying high overhead when it sees an approaching falcon it gives a warning call and other sandgrouse freeze so good is their camouflage that raptor is unable to detect them and flies on george 1978 pp 157 158 sandgrouse need to make a daily journey to a drinking hole which may be many kilometres from their feeding ground they land a short distance from water and maintain a sentinel system here too as beside falcons mammal predators may lurk nearby and nomads may water their herds when all is safe another distinctive call from sentinel bird sends all others to pool where their daily water needs are taken up within about fifteen seconds george 1978 pp 159 160 journey to waterhole is undertaken at around dawn when air is cool later in day when air temperature may reach over 50 degc birds are inactive and have ability to increase their thermal insulation when air temperature exceeds their body temperatures at very high temperatures they also resort to gular fluttering and gaping to cool themselves at night several flocks coalesce and fly off into rocky desert far away from any vegetation each bird scrapes itself a shallow sleeping hollow by moving from side to side there are no or other small mammals in these barren wastes so foxes and jackals do not roam there at night and birds are safe life cycle thumb stuffed female thumb egg in sahara breeding takes place in hottest part of summer on a stony desert plain when choosing a nest site female scrapes several trial hollows before selecting one of them main criterion for selection seems to be porous nature of underlying rock spongy rock heats up less in sun and provides a cool spot to nest also desirable are one or two cover stones close by chosen because their dense structure attracts dew at night moisture which drains into soil and gets absorbed by porous rock which helps keep nest cool by day george 1978 pp 186 188 nest is made in a shallow depression in ground without any bedding material and two occasionally three eggs are laid eggs are elongated ovals in shape buff with grey and brown blotches and speckles their colour and shape makes them difficult to distinguish from pebbles lying around them both parents incubate eggs and their cryptic colouration makes them almost invisible when sitting on nest eggs hatch after about 20 days young are precocial and already covered in down when they emerge from eggs soon after they are hatched female leads chicks to one of many wadis that wind across plains and there she teaches them to peck at and ingest seeds it is four or five weeks before they are fledged and able to fly meanwhile problem of supplying them with water is solved by male which has specially adapted absorbent down on his belly while at waterhole he immerses himself in water to saturate plumage which absorbs a quantity that is sufficient for chicks to last them until following day when he leaves waterhole with his water laden feathers male emits a repeated high pitched queet queet queet calls when female and chicks pick up sounds of his approach they reciprocate and by this means male can find his family even when they have moved away from nest on his arrival he assumes an upright posture and raises his wings displaying wet belly feathers this is sign for chicks to approach and stand underneath him with their beaks upturned and suck fluid from between feathers if danger threatens chicks crouch under a plant or any cover that offers their dappled brown down merging into desert scene parents are very vigilant in defence of their family if a jackal approaches an adult gives a warning cry and all crouch down and freeze usually enemy fails to notice them and passes by if it gets too close one of parents tries to lure it away by flapping along ground pretending to be injured and helpless when jackal has been led far enough away adult recovers and flies off after three or four days chicks can be left alone while both parents visit water hole and chicks can guide them back with their queet queet cries george 1978 pp 181 182 references bibliography external links oriental bird images spotted sandgrouse
