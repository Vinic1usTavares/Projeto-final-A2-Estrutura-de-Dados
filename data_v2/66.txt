thumb florentine ostrakon potsherd on which sappho 2 is most completely preserved sappho 2 is a fragment of a poem by archaic greek lyric poet sappho in antiquity it was part of book i of alexandrian edition of sappho s poetry sixteen lines of poem survive preserved on a potsherd discovered in egypt and first published in 1937 by medea norsa it is in form of a hymn to goddess aphrodite summoning her to appear in a temple in an apple grove majority of poem is made up of an extended description of sacred grove to which aphrodite is being summoned preservation before 1937 only two strophes of poem survived both quoted in other ancient authors hermogenes of tarsus quotes part of second strophe in his work kinds of style peri ideon and athenaeus quotes from fourth stanza in scholars at dinner deipnosophistae in 1937 italian papyrologist medea norsa published an ostrakon which preserves four stanzas of poem ostrakon psi xiii 1300 was discovered in egypt and is now in collection of biblioteca in florence florentine ostrakon dates from mid third or second century bc which makes it one of oldest surviving fragments of sappho s poetry handwriting is good indicating that it was written by a professional scribe but text is full of errors to point that greek does not make sense in places ostrakon was most likely either copied by a private enthusiast unfamiliar with aeolic dialect used by sappho or produced as part of a school exercise poem first book of alexandrian edition of sappho s poem from which sappho 2 comes was made up of poems composed in sapphic stanzas metre is made up of stanzas of four lines three longer lines followed by a single shorter line four stanzas in this metre survive it is uncertain whether poem was originally longer florentine ostrakon begins with a partial line which reads coming down from katiou this is generally considered not to have been part of sappho 2 it is followed by a larger blank space than other strophe ends on potsherd suggesting that it is part of a different text additionally katiou is not in sappho s aeolic dialect and most likely restoration of line is unmetrical for a poem in sapphic stanzas poem is in form of a hymn to goddess aphrodite invoking her and asking her to appear in form which it is preserved on florentine ostrakon it seems to begin unusually abruptly normally such a hymn would begin with a mention of god being called upon this may be a deliberate stylistic choice by sappho rather than evidence that poem is incomplete at least one other archaic hymn anacreon 12 page also withholds name of god being invoked until final line thomas mcevilley argues that aphrodite s name is withheld in order to build tension first three stanzas of poem consist of an extended description of sanctuary to which aphrodite is being summoned this ekphrasis of a natural scene is unusual in archaic greek literature description makes repeated reference to attributes of aphrodite apples roses spring flowers meadows and horses are all linked to her spring flowers are linked to aphrodite in cypria a poem from epic cycle where crocuses hyacinths violets roses narcissi and lilies adorn her girls ready for love are described as horses of aphrodite in anacreon and a similar image is found in theognis it is generally assumed that sacred precinct described by sappho in poem is a real one which she knew but there is no evidence for a temple to aphrodite on lesbos mcevilley suggests that location of grove should be found in spiritual geography rather than physical alexander compares sanctuary described by sappho in fragment 2 to ancient greek image of paradise description of elysium in pindar s fragment 129 for instance has many elements in common with sappho 2 meadows of red roses frankincense trees god s altars all have parallels in sappho however mcevilley finds equivalent parallels in poems by xenophanes and theognis neither of which describe paradise and argues that ritual and festal images overlap in archaic greek poetry especially by sappho other scholars have seen description of grove as a metaphor for female sexuality such as john j winkler and barbara goff who describes drowsiness induced in it as nothing short of final surviving stanza of poem describes aphrodite pouring nectar into golden cups sappho 2 14 trans this is similar to a ritual described in sappho 96 and may represent a real ritual in which priestess as aphrodite poured wine for celebrants in athenaeus deipnosophistae a version of final stanza preserved on florentine ostrakon is followed by a line of prose which means for these my friends and yours these words may come from a later stanza of same poem as words are in prose rather than sappho s aeolic dialect and ungrammatical four words are in wrong gender they are not from poem as sappho composed it they are likely to have been composed by athenaeus himself rather than known to him from an earlier source if they had been composed in a classical athenian context for instance mark de argues that they would have fitted sappho s metre better it is possible but not certain that they are a paraphrase of sappho s work by athenaeus at other points in deipnosophistae there are similar continuations of quotations which look like paraphrases but in fact do not appear in source text for instance in his quotation of apollonius rhodius at deipnosophistae 13 references works cited further reading category works by sappho category ancient greek poems
