listener would have to actually manually rewind first track a full nine minutes to hear two additional hidden tracks time jesum et non and a cover of x files theme song both performed by nick cave and dirty three this is hinted at in album s liner booklet which notes nick cave and dirty three would like you to know that 0 is also a number use of these hidden tracks has been described as just sort of surprise one might have suspected from a show that deals in unexplainable mysteries not all cd or dvd players will allow album to be rewound back to these tracks as this violates red book standards
