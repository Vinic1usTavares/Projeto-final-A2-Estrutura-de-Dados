thumb right alt a scanned sheet of paper including text of first page of accurate news and information act accurate news and information act including a note about lieutenant governor s reservation accurate news and information act was a statute passed by legislative assembly of alberta canada in 1937 at instigation of william aberhart s social credit government it would have required newspapers to print clarifications of stories that a committee of social credit legislators deemed inaccurate and to reveal their sources on demand act was a result of stormy relationship between aberhart and press which dated to before 1935 election in which social credit league was elected to government virtually all of alberta s newspapers especially calgary herald were critical of social credit as were a number of publications from elsewhere in canada even american media had greeted aberhart s election with derision though act won easy passage through social credit dominated legislature lieutenant governor of alberta john c bowen reserved royal assent until supreme court of canada evaluated act s legality in 1938 s reference re alberta statutes court found that it was unconstitutional and it never became law aberhart and press before 1935 election william aberhart s social credit league running candidates for first time won a large majority in 1935 alberta election on strength of promises to use a new economic theory called social credit to end depression conditions in province it did so against almost uniform opposition of news media some of province s major newspapers were loyal to one of traditional parties edmonton bulletin for example had supported liberals since its inception barr 33 aberhart initially laid out his economic agenda in only vague terms and by early 1935 his opponents including premier richard gavin reid of united farmers of alberta were trying to force him to commit to a specific plan calgary herald took up this call going so far as to offer aberhart a full page to lay out his approach in detail aberhart refused on grounds that he considered herald s coverage of him to be unfair elliott 172 he frequently attacked newspaper in speeches around province elliott 174 and on april 28 suggested that his followers boycott it and other unfriendly newspapers boycott was successful to extent that it drove at least one newspaper out of business elliott 182 herald responded to boycott by asking is everyone opposed to political opinions and plans of mr aberhart to be boycotted he has invoked a most dangerous precedent and has given people of this province a foretaste of hitlerism which will prevail if he ever secures control of provincial administration shortly before election herald began to run cartoons by stewart cameron a virulently anti aberhart cartoonist day before election it ran one featuring a car labelled people travelling along aberhart highway no 1 and arriving at a railway crossing a train labelled common sense was approaching from around bend along tracks labelled fundamental facts aberhart leans out s c signal tower advising car all s clear don t stop look or listen elliott 197 though herald was most strident in its opposition to aberhart and social credit bulletin edmonton journal medicine hat news lethbridge herald and many smaller papers all in words of athabasca university historian alvin finkel attacked social credit viciously as a chimera which if placed in power would wreck alberta s chances for economic recovery finkel 36 of province s major papers only calgary albertan provided even lukewarm support byrne 101 so frustrated were social crediters with newspapers hostility that in 1934 they founded their own alberta social credit chronicle to spread their views elliott 147 148 chronicle in addition to acting as aberhart s mouthpiece carried guest editorials by such figures as british fascist leader oswald mosley and anti semitic priest charles coughlin brennan 23 post election media reaction to social credit s 1935 victory in which it won 56 of 63 seats in legislative assembly of alberta was almost uniformly negative herald opined that people of alberta have made a most unfortunate decision and may soon see folly of it brennan 24 25 even albertan expressed its wish that social credit be first tried in scotland or ethiopia or anywhere but alberta elliott 203 reaction across canada was also negative st catharines standard called results a nightmare that passeth all understanding and montreal star accused albertans of voting for an untried man and a policy whose workings he ostentatiously refused to explain before polling day elliott 202 american newspapers were less restrained chicago tribune asked greetings to canadians who s loony now and boston herald s headline screamed alberta goes crazy relationship did not improve once aberhart took office in january 1935 h napier moore wrote two articles for maclean s casting doubt on aberhart s honesty and his ability to follow through on his election promises american collier s weekly ran a profile that mocked aberhart s appearance taking note of his vast colorless face and his narrow left slanted mouth with soft extra heavy bloodless lips which don t quite meet and through which he breathes elliott 230 231 finkel finding fault with both sides of aberhart press feud states major newspapers of province opposed virtually everything government did virtually every reform instituted was made to sound more draconian than it actually was conservative views of owners and editors often interfered with objective presentation of news reports although perhaps not to extent that government claimed in many cases papers simply concentrated on very real chaos and confusion in government ranks and required few embellishments to make government look bad finkel 62 herald lured stewart cameron away from working on disney s snow white and seven dwarfs to make him its first ever staff cartoonist cameron devoted himself full time to ridicule of aberhart elliott 240 though social credit staffer turned journalistic historian john barr argues that media s unswerving hostility to aberhart may have benefited him politically by allowing him to depict press as a mere tool of eastern financial and commercial interests by january 1936 aberhart was telling listeners of his weekly gospel radio show that he was glad there will be no newspapers in heaven elliott 230 to help combat negative press aberhart resolved to gain control of albertan one paper of note to show him any support he formed a company that acquired an option to purchase it and used his radio program to promote purchase of shares by social credit supporters other newspapers criticized him for using what was nominally a gospel program to promote stock sales elliott 232 plan came to naught as most social credit supporters were too poor to buy newspaper stock and only interested buyers were beneficiaries of government patronage chiefly liquor interests elliott 247 even so albertan became official organ of social credit an editorial decision that doubled its circulation aberhart reacted bitterly to media s hostility in a september 20 1937 radio broadcast he said of press these creatures with mental hydrophobia will be taken in hand and their biting and barking will cease barr 108 four days later a special session of legislative assembly of alberta opened with accurate news and information act figuring prominently on its order paper barr 108 109 statute 1937 social credit backbenchers revolt had forced aberhart to abdicate a portion of his power to newly created social credit board which consisted of five social credit backbenchers charged with supervising a commission of experts while initial plan was to have this commission headed by c h douglas social credit s british founder douglas did not like aberhart and did not view his approach to social credit as consistent with its true form he refused to come instead he sent two subordinates l d byrne and g f powell these surrogates were charged with recommending legislation to implement social credit in alberta their first round of proposals which included measures imposing government control on banks and prohibiting any person from challenging constitutionality of any alberta law in court without receiving approval of lieutenant governor in council was disallowed by federal government second round included accurate news and information act elliott 272 273 act empowered chair of social credit board to require a newspaper to reveal names and addresses of its sources as well as names and addresses of any writers including of unsigned pieces non compliance would result in fines of up to 1 000 per day and prohibitions on publishing of offending newspaper of stories by offending writers or of information emanating from offending sources act also required newspapers to print at instruction of chair of social credit board any statement which has for its object correction or amplification of any statement relating to any policy or activity of government of province elliott 272 act was attacked by opposition politicians as evidence of government s supposed fascism and alienated even albertan elliott 273 international press was also cutting one british paper referred to aberhart as a little hitler barr 109 later commentators have been no more favourable finkel calls act evidence of increasingly authoritarian nature of aberhart regime and even barr generally sympathetic to social credit calls it a harsh blow to free speech lieutenant governor john c bowen mindful of federal government s disallowance of social credit board s earlier legislation reserved royal assent of act and its companions until their legality could be tested at supreme court of canada this was first use of power of reservation in alberta history and in summer of 1938 aberhart s government announced elimination of bowen s official residence his government car and his secretarial staff aberhart biographers david elliott and iris miller and ernest manning biographer brian brennan attribute this move to revenge for bowen s reservation of assent elliott 54 aftermath bowen put a stop to accurate news and information act at least temporarily but aberhart s fight against press continued on march 25 1938 a resolution of social credit dominated legislature ordered that don brown a reporter for edmonton journal be jailed during pleasure of assembly for allegedly misquoting social credit backbencher john lyle robinson on inclusion of chiropractors in workman s compensation act brown was never actually jailed next day in response to negative publicity from across canada legislature passed another resolution ordering release of mr don c brown from custody in barr s view government was made to look less ominous than silly barr 112 113 around same time supreme court ruled on reference re alberta statutes it found that accurate news and information act along with others submitted to it for evaluation was ultra vires beyond powers of alberta government barr 112 in case of accurate news and information act court found that canadian constitution included an implied bill of rights that protected freedom of speech as being critical to a parliamentary democracy morton 481 482 for its leadership in fight against
