called event an enormous middle finger to traditionalists and wrote of his feeling that it was huge for a hidden part of motorsport that formula e has taken that chance other media outlets received race more negatively luke smith of nbc sports wrote that pahkala s penalty was deeply embarrassing for all of those who looked to make inaugural erace such a success and likened it to balance of performance on steroids he went on to say that event had not been as smoothly as organizers wished and there had been some skepticism over formula e attempting to close gap between real life and simulation worlds since former is reliant on sensory input checkered flag scott douglas was more critical writing that as a competition race was a disappointment since sim racers were expected to dominate and its problems hurt finishing order s credibility this undermined race as a competition and also did nothing to help reputation of formula e itself as its best drivers were so resoundingly beaten it lacked any sense of real weight or drama and tied in with glitches affecting some of drivers it didn t come anywhere near to producing excitement of real racing writing for ars technica
