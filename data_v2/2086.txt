attacks part of queen anne s war north american theater of war of spanish succession resulted in burning of town and caused most of its indian population to flee although fort withstood repeated attacks battles were primarily fought in nighttime hours due to excessive heat of day first siege in august 1707 resulted in destruction of town but fort san carlos de austria successfully resisted onslaught in late november 1707 a second expedition arrived and made unsuccessful attacks on three consecutive nights before withdrawing pensacola s governor don sebastian de moscoso whose garrison was depleted by disease recruited convicted criminals to assist in fort s defense background english and spanish colonization efforts in southeastern north america began coming into conflict as early as middle of 17th century arnade 1962 p 31 spanish population of florida at time was fairly small since its founding in 16th century spanish had set up a network of missions whose primary purpose was to pacify local indian population and convert them to roman catholicism boyd et al p 10 founding in 1670 by english of charles town present day charleston south carolina in recently established 1663 province of carolina heightened tensions by early 18th century carolina traders like anthony dodsworth and thomas nairne had established alliances with creek indians in upper watersheds of rivers draining into gulf of mexico who they supplied with arms and from whom they purchased slaves and animal pelts these traders penetrated into spanish florida leading to raiding and reprisal expeditions on both sides crane 1919 p 381 in 1700 carolina s governor joseph blake threatened spanish that english claims to pensacola established by spanish in 1698 would be enforced crane 1919 p 384 pierre le moyne d iberville french founder of mobile in january 1702 warned spanish commander at pensacola that he should properly arm apalachee indians and engage in a vigorous defense against english incursions into spanish territory d iberville even offered equipment and supplies for that purpose crane 1956 p 73 however an attempt at a punitive expedition against creek resulted in a rout of spanish and their apalachee allies in october 1702 shortly before news of war declarations bringing england into war of spanish succession arrived boyd 1953 pp 469 471 after a failed english assault on st augustine spanish mission towns were severely reduced by numerous raids by carolina led indians against spanish mission network from 1703 to 1706 crane 1956 pp 78 81 a french organized 1706 expedition against charles town was a failure but motivated carolina authorities to again target spanish at pensacola and french at mobile crane 1956 p 88 nairne proposed a major expedition after attack on charles town intending to recruit as many as 1 500 indians to capture mobile but political divisions in carolina prevented execution of plan crane 1956 p 90 first siege in 1707 pensacola was under command of don sebastian de moscoso exact size of his garrison in 1707 is not known authorized strength of garrison was 220 but it rarely reached that strength owing to difficulty in recruiting soldiers for what was viewed as a highly undesirable posting and a fairly high rate of desertion moscoso reported in 1708 that garrison numbered about 100 having been reduced by events of 1707 griffen p 247 garrison was housed in fort san carlos de austria a wooden stockade fort built in 1698 p 48 thumb left 300px spanish map of florida gulf coast 1700 extant records do not describe composition of forces that attacked pensacola in august 1707 beyond several hundred tallapoosas and a few south carolina traders oatis p 70 siege began on 12 august with arrival of a band of 20 to 30 indians who began terrorizing indians living in town outside fort they took prisoners including some women and children and began burning houses governor moscoso fired one of fort s cannons scattering attackers some of their captives managed to escape to fort in confusion two days later ten men sent out of fort to do laundry disappeared on 14 august an estimated 300 indians appeared before fort and engaged it in a battle lasting several hours griffen p 251 next day attack resumed as did pillaging of town activity quieted down until 18 august when an english flag was raised over a house near fort this prompted moscoso to open fire from fort beginning a battle that raged until dark that day attackers burned down rest of town and moscoso s men had to work to prevent fort from burning as well higginbotham pp 309 310 while spanish inspected rubble one of them was taken prisoner on 19 august and a second person was captured next day this marked end of active assaults on fort however area beyond range of fort s guns was unsafe for at least next month a number of people also disappeared after they ventured too far from its vicinity griffen p 252 second siege second siege began with arrival on 27 november of a contingent of about 20 carolina traders and 300 creeks primarily tallapoosas and alabamas hall p 108 on that day an englishman unidentified in spanish reports but possibly thomas nairne brought a demand for surrender written in english since none of spaniards could read it he was sent away and demand was eventually transmitted orally by a french huguenot higginbotham p p 221 moscoso rejected demand even though his garrison was depleted by disease besiegers began an ineffectual attack on fort around midnight which lasted until daybreak at which point they delivered a final surrender demand which moscoso again refused in order to supplement his forces he successfully recruited convicts being held in fort s guardhouse to participate in defense offering them freedom and money for their service during each of next two nights besiegers renewed their attacks on fort without significant effect during night of 29 30 november one of leading creek chiefs was killed this apparently broke besiegers morale for siege was lifted following morning higginbotham p 312 attackers were reported to have suffered significant casualties word of attacking force had reached french at mobile on 24 november governor jean baptiste le moyne de bienville raised a force of 100 frenchmen and 400 indians they reached pensacola on 8 december only to learn that siege had been lifted a week earlier french p 98 aftermath thumb aerial view of fort barrancas these attacks were last major assaults on pensacola in war although there continued to be minor skirmishes and kidnappings

mobile was also being targeted for attack higginbotham p 313 he improved mobile s defenses in 1708 but outpost was never attacked a village of mobile indians was attacked in may 1709 however
