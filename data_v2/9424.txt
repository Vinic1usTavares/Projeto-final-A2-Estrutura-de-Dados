juno or juno beach was one of five beaches of allied invasion of german occupied france in normandy landings on 6 june 1944 during second world war beach spanned from courseulles a village just east of british beach gold to saint aubin sur mer and just west of british beach sword taking juno was responsibility of canadian army with sea transport mine sweeping and a naval bombardment force provided by royal canadian navy and british royal navy as well as elements from free french norwegian and other allied navies objectives of 3rd canadian infantry division on d day were to cut caen bayeux road seize carpiquet airport west of caen and form a link between two british beaches on either flank beach was defended by two battalions of german 716th infantry division with elements of 21st panzer division held in reserve near caen invasion plan called for two brigades of 3rd canadian division to land on two beach sectors mike and nan focusing on courseulles bernieres and saint aubin it was hoped that preliminary naval and air bombardments would soften up beach defences and destroy coastal strong points close support on beaches was to be provided by amphibious tanks of 2nd canadian armoured brigade and specialized armoured vehicles of 79th armoured division united kingdom once landing zones were secured plan called for 9th canadian infantry brigade to land reserve battalions and deploy inland royal marine commandos to establish contact with british 3rd infantry division on sword and 7th canadian infantry brigade to link up with british 50th infantry division on gold 3rd canadian division s d day objectives were to capture carpiquet airfield and reach caen bayeux railway line by nightfall landings initially encountered heavy resistance from german 716th division preliminary bombardment proved less effective than had been hoped and rough weather forced first wave to be delayed until 07 35 several assault companies notably those of royal winnipeg rifles and queen s own rifles of canada took heavy casualties in opening minutes of first wave strength of numbers coordinated fire support from artillery and armoured squadrons cleared most of coastal defences within two hours of landing reserves of 7th and 8th brigades began deploying at 08 30 along with royal marines while 9th brigade began its deployment at 11 40 subsequent push inland towards carpiquet and caen bayeux railway line achieved mixed results sheer numbers of men and vehicles on beaches created lengthy delays between landing of 9th brigade and beginning of substantive attacks to south 7th brigade encountered heavy initial opposition before pushing south and making contact with british 50th division at creully 8th brigade encountered heavy resistance from a battalion of 716th at tailleville while 9th brigade deployed towards carpiquet early in evening resistance in saint aubin prevented royal marines from establishing contact with british 3rd division on sword by time all operations on anglo canadian front were ordered to halt at 21 00 queen s own rifles of canada had reached its d day objective and 3rd canadian infantry division had succeeded in pushing farther inland than any other landing force on d day background invasion of normandy thumb d day assault map of normandy region and north western coast of france utah and omaha are separated by douve river whose mouth is clear in coastline notch or corner of map in 1942 western allies agreed to open a second front western front in western europe to take pressure off beleaguered red army in soviet union while britain and united states did not yet possess resources to mount a full invasion invasion plans that came to be known as operation sledgehammer were drawn up in case german position in western europe weakened or ussr s situation became dire in august 1942 anglo canadian forces attempted an abortive landing operation jubilee at french port of dieppe landing was designed to test feasibility of a cross channel invasion attack was poorly planned and ended in disaster 4 963 soldiers were killed wounded or captured following anglo american victory against field marshal erwin rommel in north africa in may 1943 british american and canadian troops invaded sicily in july 1943 followed by italy in september by december allies progress had slowed facing tenacious german resistance and difficult geography of italian peninsula after gaining valuable experience in amphibious assaults and inland fighting allied planners returned to plans to invade northern france now postponed to 1944 under direction of general dwight d eisenhower supreme commander allied expeditionary force and frederick morgan plans for invasion of france coalesced as operation overlord with an initial target date of 1 may 1944 infantry attack was conceived as a joint assault by five divisions transported by landing craft constituting largest amphibious operation in military history attack was later scheduled for monday 5 june 1944 and normandy was selected for landing sites with a zone of operations extending from cotentin peninsula to caen there were originally seventeen sectors along normandy coastline with codenames taken from one of spelling alphabets of time from able west of omaha to rodger on east flank of invasion area eight further sectors were added when planned invasion was extended to include utah on cotentin peninsula sectors were further subdivided into beaches identified by colours green red and white operation overlord called for british second army to assault between river orne and port en bessin capture caen and form a front line from caumont l evente to south east of caen to acquire airfields and protect left flank of united states first army while it captured cherbourg possession of caen and its surroundings would give second army a suitable staging area for a push south to capture city of falaise which could then be used as a pivot for a swing left to advance on argentan touques river and then towards river seine after delays due to both logistical difficulties and poor weather d day of overlord largest amphibious operation ever was postponed 24 hours to 6 june 1944 eisenhower and montgomery commander of 21st army group aimed to capture caen within first day and liberate paris within 90 days juno thumb right one of several s converted to act as a headquarters ship for normandy landings note extended superstructure to accommodate staff officers and additional smaller mainmast to support extra aerials on 8 june 1944 whilst operating off juno she was hit by enemy fire during an air attack and sunk operation neptune landing phase of overlord called for a five division front spread across of coastline three airborne divisions two american one british which also included a canadian battalion would also land in pre dawn hours of d day eisenhower and general bernard montgomery hoped to have eight infantry divisions and fourteen tank regiments in normandy beachhead by nightfall on d day landing zone was divided into five landing areas with americans attacking utah westernmost and omaha and british attacking gold and sword juno a stretch of shoreline between la riviere to west and saint aubin to east was assigned to 3rd canadian infantry division 3rd cid commanded by major general rod keller juno included villages of courseulles and bernieres name juno arose because winston churchill considered that original code name jelly sounded inappropriate code names for beaches to be taken by british and commonwealth forces were named after types of fish goldfish swordfish and jellyfish abbreviated to gold sword and jelly churchill disapproved of name jelly for a beach on which so many men might die he insisted on a change to more dignified name juno planning and preparation german defences thumb left field marshal erwin rommel inspecting atlantic wall defences april 1944 while german army had seen its strength and morale heavily depleted by campaigns in russia north africa and italy it remained a powerful fighting force despite this most of german divisions along french coast in late 1943 were composed of either new recruits or veteran units resting and rebuilding from eastern front altogether some 856 000 soldiers were stationed in france predominantly on coast an additional 60 000 voluntary helpers ussr and polish members of german army served on french coast under command of field marshals erwin rommel and gerd von rundstedt defences of atlantic wall a line of coastal gun emplacements machine gun nests minefields and beach obstacles along french coast were increased in first six months of 1944 germans laid of steel and of concrete rommel also surrounded coast with four million anti tank and anti personnel mines and 500 000 beach obstacles on juno defences of atlantic wall were greater than at many other landing sectors germans assumed that allies would land during high tide to minimize distance during which they would be exposed on beaches and created a devil s garden of beach obstacles deployed in rows between above low tide mark strongpoints of machine gun positions antitank and anti personnel artillery and bunkers were located every manned by several platoons with mortars minefields were deployed surrounding these strongpoints and additional defences were present in courseulles harbour calvados beaches of normandy were defended by 716th static and 352nd infantry divisions with canadian landing zone defended by elements of 716th it was formed mostly from soldiers under 18 or over 35 comprising 7 771 combat troops in six battalions as opposed to 9 or 12 battalions of allied divisions while 352nd was considered a first rate division 716th was accounted a better than average static division these divisions generally had very few vehicles or tanks and had to rely on infantry and field regiments on juno 736th grenadier regiment deployed four infantry companies 7 kompanie held what was to become mike sector 6th was stationed in courseulles 5th was at bernieres and 9th held nan sector and saint aubin a second line of four infantry companies and one panzer company was stationed inland 21st panzer division was deployed south east of caen and two battalions of polish and russian conscripts were stationed on flanks of juno adjacent to sword and gold canadian preparations canadian training for d day had begun as early as july 1943 when lieutenant general andrew mcnaughton of first canadian army informed harry crerar commander of ii canadian corps that 3rd canadian infantry division might play a role in invasion of france initial training was demanding and complicated by lack of any landing craft to practice with either lcas or lcts field exercises in scotland commenced in august and september 1943 and succeeded in establishing unique techniques and equipment for use by armoured and artillery regiments in storming beach most significant were amphibious duplex drive tanks dd tanks mechanisms were also developed to allow artillery to bombard beach while still aboard their landing craft through winter of 1943 units jointly developed more advanced assault tactics among juno regiments landings would be supported by largest invasion fleet in history 7 016 vessels in total royal canadian navy contributed 121 vessels to armada including destroyers frigates corvettes landing ships minesweepers and torpedo boats four canadian tribal class destroyers were in royal navy s 10th destroyer flotilla which joined other rn units in keeping english channel near normandy clear of german naval units naval force j had begun intense training for invasion with 3rd canadian infantry division in february 1944 with a full scale simulation of invasion carried out on 4 may in exercise fabius on d day itself force j commanded from was to bombard german defensive positions along landing zone with everything from heavy calibre cruiser guns to self propelled artillery attached to landing craft according to canadian army historian c p stacey a light bombardment of landing zone would commence 30 minutes before h hour and continue for 15 minutes heavy bombing would then begin on flanks of divisional attack lasting until h hour additional cover would be provided by royal and royal canadian air force squadrons both before and on d day a successful surprise invasion required total air superiority over english channel and normandy in months preceding d day raf second tactical air force attacked airfields coastal garrisons radar railway lines and transport routes in order to soften beach defences as well as prevent german luftwaffe from mounting a serious challenge to air superiority over normandy by dawn on 6 june raf tactical air forces had 2 434 fighter and fighter bomber aircraft with approximately 700 light and medium bombers to support them operational plan for juno was divided into two main sectors mike west and nan east mike sector would be attacked by 7th canadian infantry brigade with royal winnipeg rifles canadian scottish regiment and 1st hussars in support 7th brigade was to take courseulles and drive inland nan sector would be assaulted by regina rifle regiment of 7th brigade as well as north shore regiment and queen s own rifles of canada of 8th canadian infantry brigade while tanks of fort garry horse provided armoured support a squadron of specialized armoured vehicle royal engineers avre from british 79th armoured division would land on each beach sector as well 8th brigade was to capture bernieres and western edge of saint aubin then push south into normandy operational plan also called for 9th canadian infantry brigade and sherbrooke fusiliers to be deployed to juno as reinforcements within 4 to 6 hours of initial assault by nightfall of d day 3rd canadian infantry division was slated to have captured high ground west of caen bayeux caen railway line and seaside towns of courseulles bernieres saint aubin and beny sur mer d day landings early bombardment thumb cruiser bombarding juno on d day air attacks on normandy s coastal defences began in earnest on 5 june at 23 30 with raf bomber command units targeting primary coastal defences attack continued until 05 15 with of bombs dropped by 1 136 sorties this marked largest attack by bomber command in terms of tonnage up to that point in war initial attacks on atlantic wall proved ineffective with poor weather and visibility making it difficult to accurately hit bunkers and turrets bombing left defences on omaha gold and juno virtually intact yet did not damage allied landing craft in channel as many planners had feared it would royal canadian air force rcaf sent 230 bombers to bomb targets on juno during this raid yet damage was limited as americans began their own bombing runs against omaha and utah to west anglo canadian naval forces began their counter battery fire seeking to knock out german shore batteries and bunkers british had attached cruisers and to force j to serve as heavy support belfast commenced bombardment of atlantic wall at 05 30 and diadem at 05 52 on 6 june naval gunfire proved more effective than aerial bombardment battery at was only one to return fire and was quickly destroyed by light cruiser indeed most of gun batteries at juno were incomplete on d day and did not possess sufficient protection or communication measures to accurately return fire on force j beny sur mer battery was neutralized by diadem shortly after she opened fire at 06 10 11 destroyers of force j moved shoreward to begin bombardment hoping to damage light gun emplacements and prevent german 716th from mobilizing and moving across beach they were supplemented by additional raids by medium bombers and fighter bombers of raf and usaaf which dropped an additional 2 796 tons of ordnance on five landing zones while medium bombers proved inaccurate hawker typhoon fighter bombers proved more effective at attacking coastal defences as bombing runs continued to hit juno destroyers and landing craft moved towards beach and began close range saturation bombardment in addition to destroyers of force j two canadian eight british one french bombardment was also provided by converted lcts fitted with guns smaller light gunned landing craft were able to get closer to beach and use their 6 pounder guns against german defensive positions additional firepower was provided by eight landing craft fitted with over 1 000 high explosive rockets and 24 lcts each carrying four m7 priest self propelled guns these field regiments while still seaborne were to fire heavy concentrations of high explosive and smoke shells against four main resistance nests in mike and nan sectors beginning half an hour before h hour forward observation and fire control officers in leading assault waves were to make necessary adjustments to this neutralizing fire during assault bombardment was scheduled to cease immediately before assault companies deployed on juno but due to heavy seas landing was delayed by ten minutes to 07 45 in mike sector and 07 55 in nan sector this was at a slightly higher tide closer to beach obstacles and mines lcts carrying field artillery were forced to adjust course to avoid landing too early lcts carrying dd tanks were forced to break off their advance seas proved too rough to launch dd tanks so they were ordered to deploy from lcts several hundred yards out from beach landing 7th brigade mike nan green thumb left royal winnipeg rifles heading towards juno aboard lcas though 7th canadian infantry brigade was scheduled to land on mike sector at 07 35 rough seas and poor craft co ordination pushed this time back by ten minutes two assault companies of royal winnipeg rifles one assault company of canadian scottish regiment and one squadron of 1st hussars were to land on mike red and also on mike green while regina rifle regiment supported by a second squadron of 1st hussars landed on nan green sector first winnipegs touched down at 07 49 with remaining assault companies deploying within seven minutes lcas carrying b company craft were engaged while about 700 yards from shore disembarkation had to be done under direct fire and in consequence heavy casualties were sustained by this company while landing strongpoint in this area consisted of three casemates and twelve machine gun emplacements this left infantry grim prospect of clearing it by direct assault b company was unable to advance further without armoured support hussars a squadron launched from beach but would not be fully deployed until a full six minutes after winnipegs were ashore to their west d company faced less defensive fire as it was clear of strongpoint company easily cleared beach and went through barbed wire with light casualties a platoon of 6th field company royal canadian engineers was redirected to clear minefields facing d company given that flail tanks had yet to land on far right c company of canadian scottish regiment landed with little opposition and discovered that their objective a 75 mm gun emplacement had been destroyed by naval gunfire to east of mike sector regina rifles came ashore on nan green with objective of subduing german forces in courseulles a company reported touchdown at 08 09 and met heavy resistance almost immediately b company reported touchdown at 08 15 hussars tanks first reported deploying twenty minutes before infantry with b squadron hq reporting their landing at 07 58 they faced task of destroying a heavy gun emplacement equipped with 88 mm and 75 mm guns and thick concrete walls bombardment had failed to destroy emplacement and heavy machine guns inflicted many casualties on company one lca reported six men killed within seconds of lowering ramps a platoon was able to breach barbed wire lining beach and take cover in courseulles and then eliminate machine guns engaging a company of regina rifles dd tanks arrived in regina rifles sector with greater numbers and punctuality than in winnipegs sector 75 mm gun emplacement in courseulles strongpoint was destroyed by fire from b squadron of 1st hussars 88 mm was similarly silenced to their east b company encountered limited resistance pushed into courseulles and soon had cleared a succession of assigned blocks in village with initial assault companies ashore and fighting for their objectives reserve companies and battalion canadian scottish regiment began their deployment on juno a and c companies of winnipeg rifles landed at 08 05 and began to push towards villages of banville and sainte croix sur mer a company encountered heavy machine gun fire and had to request support from 1st hussars to clear position on nan green c and d companies of regina rifles prepared to storm courseulles c company touched down at 08 35 and moved into village without difficulty d company was further delayed after several lcas struck antitank mines attached to beach obstacles only 49 d company soldiers reached beach canadian scottish regiment arrived on beach at 08 30 with leading companies coming under heavy mortar fire it took regiment a full hour to get off beaches and push further inland landing 8th brigade nan white red thumb left canadian troops moving towards juno originally scheduled to land at 07 45 to east of 7th 8th canadian infantry brigade s two assault battalions were postponed by 10 minutes as a result of heavy seas queen s own rifles of canada qor landed at 08 12 at nan white and faced most tenacious defences of any unit in nan sector an 88 mm gun emplacement with multiple machine gun nests outside of bernieres first lca to touch down saw 10 of its first 11 soldiers either killed or wounded b company came ashore directly in front of main resistance nests 200 yards east of their intended landing zone subjecting them to heavy mortar and machine gun fire qor had been scheduled to advance with dd fire support but heavy seas meant that instead of swimming in they dd tanks left their craft close inshore and landed behind infantry assault companies several soldiers from b company succeeded in outflanking main pillbox and killing its gunners with grenades and small arms one lca s rudder from b company had jammed and that platoon landed far to left of rest of b company enabling them to outflank and destroy gun emplacements with defences silenced qor was able to advance into bernieres having suffered 65 casualties on beaches to their west a company encountered less resistance but was limited by poorly coordinated run ins by lcas to beach a company was able to quickly reach seawall and breach barbed wire but encountered much mortar and sniper fire in bernieres this was only sector of juno where armoured support proved ineffective as b squadron of fort garry horse was too far out from beach to provide heavy support first units of north shore regiment s a and b companies touched down on nan red at 08 10 in chest deep water they were tasked with securing saint aubin and clearing defences in village b company landed to find that saint aubin strong point appeared not to have been touched by preliminary naval bombardment two assault companies faced a sprint across open beach in face of fire from saint aubin a company suffered most casualties incurring many fatalities from beach mines b company faced stronger opposition at strong point yet managed to breach seawall and barbed wire 50 mm antitank gun was still firing and thick concrete casemates protected it from infantry fire by 08 10 sherman tanks of fort garry horse and avre of 80th assault squadron royal engineers had landed at nan red and begun to assist b company in clearing gun emplacement 50 mm gun knocked out four of squadron s tanks while north shore s machine gun platoon was flanking position right section of strong point was eliminated by anti tank guns and engineers while central anti tank gun was silenced by petard demolition bombs fired from avre when north shore captured strong point approximately half defenders were killed 48 german soldiers surrendered 8th brigade reserve battalion le regiment de la chaudiere began deploying to beaches at 08 30 along with reserve companies of north shore and qor more than half of lcas were crippled by mines buried along beach qor c company was forced to touch down further offshore when their lcas were damaged by mines c company linked up with b squadron of fort garry horse and moved to assist pinned down and exhausted a company north shore c and d companies landed outside of saint aubin with c company taking over for a company in advance further into saint aubin while d company occupied village all but one of lcas carrying chaudiere a company foundered before they could touch down on beach and they lost most of their equipment while swimming to shore chaudieres quickly formed up outside bernieres and saint aubin linking up with both qor and north shores reserve also included no 48 royal marine commando which was scheduled to land 45 minutes after first arrivals commandos were to pass saint aubin s eastern edge and occupy sur mer on eastern end of juno strong point facing them had not been cleared and 120 of 400 man unit became casualties within seconds of landing deploying reinforcements thumb soldiers of 9th canadian infantry brigade deploying in nan white sector with juno largely secured keller prepared to deploy reserves of 9th canadian infantry brigade and tanks of sherbrooke fusiliers reports coming in from battalions already on juno were mixed canadian military historian terry copp says that north shore was proceeding according to plan while chaudieres were making progress slowly two self propelled artillery regiments 14th field and 19th army field regiments royal canadian artillery had deployed at 09 25 and 09 10 and had several dozen guns in action before 11 00 opposition and continued problems with mine obstacles on nan red meant that entire 9th brigade would have to land in bernieres and nan white sector when 9th brigade s lcis touched down at 11 40 congestion on beach in nan white was so heavy that most infantry companies could not disembark from their landing craft 9th brigade s reserves consisted of cameron highlanders of ottawa north nova scotia highlanders stormont dundas and glengarry highlanders and highland light infantry of canada glengarry highlanders reported coming under mortar fire from german positions further inland as with little room to manoeuvre on dry land entire 9th brigade became easy targets for german artillery 9th brigade quickly made it across beach and joined chaudieres queen s own rifles and fort garry horse in bernieres to await further advance inland having subdued german defences on beach next task of landed forces was to clear juno of obstacles debris and undetonated mines then establish 3rd canadian infantry division s headquarters in bernieres movement control units came ashore just before noon with military policemen beginning to marshal vehicles through to bernieres and courseulles sappers of 619 independent field company also moved in to begin clearing minefields surrounding beach so as to free up advance south towards carpiquet keller himself established divisional headquarters in bernieres shortly after noon advance inland initial attacks thumb left royal winnipeg rifles advance inland on d day at 14 35 keller met with commanders of 8th and 9th infantry brigades as well as newly reconstituted 2nd armoured brigade fort garry horse sherbrooke fusiliers 1st hussars with first line of objectives codenamed yew secured on beachhead keller ordered 7th and 8th brigades to advance with armoured support towards second line of objectives elm whereupon 9th brigade would then leapfrog over 7th and 8th to reach third objective line oak facing them were remains of three battalions of 736th grenadier regiment and three battalions of 726th regiment b company of winnipegs was still facing heavy resistance from snipers and machine guns in courseulles while eastern companies of north shore regiment were fighting for saint aubin a and c companies of royal winnipegs moved off beach cut through walls of barbed wire behind german bunkers pushed through vaux and sur mer and began to advance towards st croix and banville c company advanced on banville headquarters of ii battalion of 726th but was stopped by three machine gun emplacements just short of town winnipeg a company joined c company of canadian scottish regiment and a troop of c squadron of 1st hussars and advanced on st croix unaware of a large german counter attack massing in st croix under command of 8 battalion 726 regiment c company of canadian scottish regiment had deployed to their west and was able to spot units of 8th battalion and halt counter attack before it fully materialized d company of winnipegs joined advance on banville with covering fire from cameron highlanders and 12th and 13th field artillery regiments banville was declared captured at 13 10 although small pockets of resistance would survive until nightfall and then retreat d company of canadian scottish moved to capture two bridges on seulles river further inland from winnipeg companies b company joined them and pushed through gap between st croix and banville joining c company as it did so c squadron of 1st hussars provided armoured support to their east regina rifles advanced south towards reviers engaging troops of 7th battalion of 736th grenadier regiment they reported reaching town by 12 15 with two companies and began consolidating their position in preparation for further advance in nan sector 8th brigade advance started slower than that of 7th brigade because chaudieres had lost most of their equipment on advance over beaches queen s own rifles c company was pinned down at edge of bernieres by sniper fire and could not cross open fields behind town their armoured support was also stopped by heavy antitank fire coming from beny sur mer chaudieres a and b companies were caught in crossfire b company lost almost an entire platoon when a german 88 mm scored hit a priest self propelled gun chaudiere and qor progress was slow all told it took nearly two hours for artillery and heavy guns to clear defences at beny sur mer allowing qor to advance towards town beny sur mer was reported cleared at 14 00 at which point chaudieres began to mass in town for a further advance south towards carpiquet qor broke off to left to engage heavy artillery batteries to west of beny and b company was assisted by guns of hmcs algonquin which destroyed a bunker of 105 mm guns to their east c and d company of north shores advanced towards tailleville headquarters of ii battalion of 736th grenadiers mortar fire north of headquarters was both concentrated and accurate slowing advance of c company they were supported in their drive south by tanks of fort garry horse which caught close to 100 german defenders in open fields north shores and their armour support entered tailleville at 14 00 at which point six tanks of c squadron moved through village destroying german gun emplacements defenders of ii battalion had created a complex underground bunker system in village which enabled them to continuously outflank canadian infantry it took another seven hours to clear tailleville of defenders which ensured that north shores would be unable to capture german radar sites to south on d day b company of north shore regiment and no 48 commando of royal marines were engaged in a protracted fight to secure saint aubin and lagrune sur mer b company had generally neutralized strongpoint within two hours of landing which allowed troops a and b of royal marines to push east these units had important objective of bridging gap between landing zones at juno and sword which would allow for a continuous anglo canadian front by end of first day royal marines began to advance on lagrune and strong point while to their east no 41 commando royal marines advanced from sword strongpoint was defended by a reinforced platoon from 736th grenadiers and was a group of fortified houses and 50 mm anti tank guns b troop s first attempt to capture it failed and assault was renewed with support from centaur tanks only to again falter in face of heavy resistance no 48 commando was forced to call assault off at nightfall as reports of massing for counter attacks by 21st panzer division against divide between sword and juno arrived strong points at lagrune and luc sur mer were captured on 8 june drive to elm thumb canadian advances on d day division s advance south of tailleville had halted preventing an attack on german radar stations queen s own rifles and c company of chaudieres opted to continue their advance towards anguerny and columby sur thaon and objective line elm beachhead was now filled to capacity with troops to point that b company of chaudieres could not be deployed alongside c company without severely hindering advance of qor to their east c company s advance on basly was even further hindered by proximity of combat fighting occurred at such close range that 14th field artillery would not provide fire support for fear of friendly fire casualties when c company reached basly north nova scotia highlanders formed up outside beny sur mer with intention of overtaking chaudieres and making for carpiquet and caen bayeux highway at 16 45 north novas assembled in beny and were target of concentrated german mortar fire as sherbrooke fusiliers de waterproofed their tanks three companies of north novas and a squadron of advanced on mortar positions with many casualties among infantry but clearing positions qor entered anguerny on elm objective line at 17 30 and sent d company to probe german defences on hills overlooking village chaudieres reported that basly was cleared of defenders at 18 15 allowing 9th brigade to advance towards carpiquet airfield by 19 00 north nova scotia highlanders were advancing towards carpiquet encountering their first resistance an hour later with reports of 21st panzer division attacking flanks of british 3rd infantry division on sword lieutenant general miles dempsey commander of british second army ordered forces on sword juno and gold to establish defensive positions at their intermediate objectives on western edge of canadian sector advance of 7th brigade had stalled in face of stiffening resistance in st croix and banville delaying right flank of assault german defenders gave ground slowly and did not begin withdrawing from towns until bren gun platoons began to arrive at 14 00 once st croix and banville were cleared canadian scots pushed south to reinforced platoons that had captured bridge across seulles earlier in day and moved towards creully caen road canadian scots reported reaching road at 16 30 and continued to push south past objective line elm to their west royal winnipegs stopped at elm line and began to erect defensive positions with bren gun carriers and artillery regina rifles had been slow to advance from courseulles on account of heavy casualties taken securing village 1st hussars b squadron was in a similar position with only half its fighting strength having made it off beach by 18 00 reginas were advancing while hussars scouted ahead of infantry companies as reginas linked up with canadian scots order to hold positions and dig in arrived from keller s headquarters two battalions halted at 21 00 three tanks of 1st hussars c squadron no 2 troop had continued to advance southwards pushing through side roads towards carpiquet airfield aside from a german staff car and a machine gun nest three sherman tanks encountered virtually no resistance advancing all way to caen bayeux railway line and becoming only unit on whole of d day to reach its final objective though commander of unit lieutenant william f mccormick attempted to contact his superiors to bring up reinforcements to attack carpiquet airfield three tanks eventually withdrew back to canadian lines positions at nightfall thumb left queen s own rifles of canada dug in at end of d day near carpiquet at end of d day 3rd canadian infantry division was situated firmly on objective line elm short of their final d day objectives in west 7th brigade was anchored in creully and fresne 9th brigade was positioned a mere from caen farthest inland of any allied units on d day on eastern edge of canadian sector 8th brigade had taken up positions in anguerny and columby having begun in late afternoon to dig in 3rd canadian infantry division had succeeded in advancing farther than any other divisional element in allied expeditionary force but due to heavy fighting in lagrune and saint aubin had failed to link up with british 3rd division from sword german 716th infantry division was scattered and heavily depleted division commander lieutenant general wilhelm richter recorded that less than one full battalion could be mustered for further defence german 21st panzer division had driven a wedge between british and canadian 3rd divisions yet had been unable to dislodge either from beaches to south hitler had released elite panzer lehr division and 12th ss panzer division hitlerjugend hitler youth both of which prepared to head north with i ss panzer corps aftermath analysis thumb corporal w of royal canadian corps of signals examines telephone switchboard in underground bunker of a german radar station at beny sur mer although site was originally intended to be taken on d day a series of problems delayed its capture until 11 june while normandy landings in all five sectors managed to establish footholds in normandy many d day objectives were not met 82nd and 101st us airborne divisions had suffered many casualties their landings were scattered all over but had captured sainte mere eglise to west of utah on cotentin peninsula american 4th infantry division had suffered lighter casualties in securing utah and had established a strong bridgehead by end of d day omaha had met with less success as intact defences and high calibre troops of 352nd infantry division caused more casualties than at any of other beaches at one point attack was going so badly that lieutenant general omar bradley considered withdrawing v corps from beaches a second wave of attacks breached coastal defences but could only push inland by nightfall to west of juno british 50th northumbrian infantry division encountered only light resistance and succeeded in advancing inland and creating a continuous front with juno though not with omaha with only 413 casualties to their east british 3rd infantry division established a foothold on sword counter attacks by 21st panzer division in afternoon prevented 3rd infantry division from capturing caen and from making contact with 3rd canadian infantry division on juno counter attack failed to drive british into sea in spite of many casualties inflicted on 352nd and 716th infantry divisions 7th army quickly established plans for counter attacks early orders to move towards invasion beaches were confused as divisions necessary for counter attacks fell under a different jurisdiction than those defending coast panzer divisions such as panzer lehr 12th ss panzer and 2nd ss panzer could not be mobilized for coast without authorization by hitler order to mobilize panzer lehr and 12th ss was finally given in mid afternoon of 6 june when 9th canadian infantry brigade and sherbrooke fusiliers began to advance on 7 june they were met by dug in troops of 716th infantry and 21st panzer divisions at 17 00 advancing force was counter attacked by 12th ss under command of kurt meyer 9th brigade was forced to withdraw to its d day positions having suffered more casualties than any unit on juno previous day 7th brigade reached its final d day objectives along line oak while 8th brigade attempted to destroy german radar stations to their east which took until 11 june 3rd canadian infantry division made contact with british from sword on 7 june before forming a continuous front with american sector by 13 june subsequent advance on caen and cherbourg was slow as a greater number of german panzer units were concentrated near caen and carentan canadians captured carpiquet airfield during operation windsor on 5 july while anglo canadian forces captured caen as part of operation charnwood 8 9 july and operation atlantic 18 20 july preliminary bombardment military historians have generally drawn conclusion that preliminary aerial and naval bombardment of juno was not as effective as had been hoped yet differ in their opinions as to how ineffective aerial bombardment of juno s defences night before is considered to have been very ineffective primarily because of inclement weather john keegan notes that prevailing low thick cloud frustrated its bomber command s efforts colonel stacey official historian of canadian army in second world war considers effects of bombing runs to have been spotty noting that while several coastal batteries were not hit those that were such as battery at houlgate were hit accurately chester wilmot offers a different view suggesting that coastal guns had been accurately bombed but had survived because they were heavily protected by concrete casemates rommel had insisted upon historians assessment of naval bombardment is even more mixed while they generally agree that it failed to fully neutralize german defences on juno they are in disagreement as to why stacey suggests that while beach drenching fire was concentrated and substantial it was both inaccurate and of insufficient firepower to destroy coastal bunkers he further suggests that effect of drenching fire was moral rather than material in that it forced defenders to keep below ground and sapped their morale terry copp echoes this analysis noting that reasonable accuracy could not be obtained from pitching decks of lcts by mounted artillery on ships 13th field regiment s drenching fire fell on average past their targets british historian max hastings notes that because of delay in landing times by ten minutes a substantial gap existed between cessation of bombardment and actual landing of first waves of infantry meaning that platoons of 716th had ample time to return to their positions bombardment of strongpoints in towns along coast was inconsistent north shore regiment reported that strongpoint near saint aubin appeared not to have been touched by bombardment while strongpoints facing canadian scottish regiment had been eliminated by naval bombardment before their landing overall thumb right allied soldiers guarding german prisoners on juno despite failure to capture any of final d day objectives assault on juno is generally considered alongside utah most strategically successful of d day landings historians suggest a variety of reasons for this success mark zuehlke notes that canadians ended day ahead of either us or british divisions despite facts that they landed last and that only americans at omaha faced more difficulty winning a toehold on sand suggesting that calibre of training 3rd canadian infantry division had received beforehand explains their success chester wilmot claims that canadian success in clearing landing zones is attributable to presence of amphibious dd tanks on beaches he also notes that absence of dd tanks was largely responsible for heavier casualties on omaha only beach with heavier resistance than juno canadian historian terry copp attributes steady advance of 7th brigade in afternoon to less serious opposition than north shore regiment encountered in tailleville despite verdict of a successful d day for 3rd cid failure of canadian units to reach their final objectives has proven more disputed than reasons for their success terry copp places blame on keller who committed entirety of 9th brigade reserve to land on narrower beaches of 8th brigade which was itself still fighting to clear seaside towns after receiving reports of poor progress by 7th brigade dutch historian dan van der vat notes that planned breakout of 9th brigade was held up by a huge jam of vehicles wilmot also places blame with logistical difficulties of landing saying that on whole it was not so much opposition in front as congestion behind on beaches and in bernieres that prevented canadians from reaching their final d day objective stacey offers a different view suggesting that it was not impossible for 3rd cid to reach its d day objectives and that failure to do so rests in fact that british and canadian forces were usually better at deceiving enemy and achieving initial success in an assault than they were at exploiting surprise and success once achieved perhaps they were rather too easily satisfied copp disagrees with stacey s assessment suggesting that such caution was not result of poor planning but of fact that british and canadians fought way they had been trained moving forward to designated objectives in controlled bounds and digging in at first sign of a counterattack he also disputes whether capture of final objectives would have been strategically intelligent observing that if 9th brigade had reached carpiquet and dug in with artillery in position to offer support commander of 26th panzer grenadiers might have followed orders and waited until a coordinated counterattack with other divisions had been organized such an attack might well have done far more damage to allied beachhead than hastily improvised operation actually carried out on 7 june stacey offers a second line of analysis on canadians failure to advance to line oak suggesting that difficulties encountered by british 3rd infantry division on sword caused dempsey to halt advance of entire british second army british encountered heavy counterattacks by 21st panzer division which prevented british 9th brigade from establishing contact with canadians at juno copp wrote that before this withdrawal of 21st panzer division became evident dempsey had concluded that more armoured counter attacks could be expected so he ordered three assault divisions to dig in at their second line of objectives this decision was relayed to subordinate commanders somewhere after 19 00 just as 9th canadian brigade was preparing to advance south towards carpiquet wilmot wrote that british 3rd infantry division brigade commanders were overly cautious in advancing towards caen and this slowed anglo canadian advance especially given reports of counter attacks dempsey received from sword casualties predictions of casualties on juno had been about 2 000 men including 600 drowned 3rd canadian infantry division suffered 340 men killed 574 wounded and 47 taken prisoner queen s own rifles suffered 143 casualties most of any battalion royal winnipegs 128 north shore 125 and regina rifles 108 of landing craft used on run in to juno 90 of 306 were lost or damaged due to lack of records for d day casualties for german 716th infantry division are unknown of four german battalions numbering 7 771 men before invasion richter reported that equivalent of only one battalion at 80 per cent strength remained at least one of two conscript battalions of 716th was reported to have fled richter also reported that 80 per cent of divisional artillery had been destroyed or captured on d day while only two gun batteries were intact west of river orne by 9 june division had been reduced to a battlegroup of 292 officers and men
