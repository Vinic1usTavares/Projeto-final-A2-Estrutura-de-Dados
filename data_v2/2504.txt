occurring in rural areas depending on type of vegetation present a wildfire can also be classified more specifically as a brush fire bushfire in australia desert fire forest fire grass fire hill fire peat fire vegetation fire or veld fire many organizations consider wildfire to mean an unplanned and unwanted fire while wildland fire is a broader term that includes prescribed fire as well as wildland fire use wfu these are also called monitored response fires fossil charcoal indicates that wildfires began soon after appearance of terrestrial plants 420 million years ago wildfire s occurrence throughout history of terrestrial life invites conjecture that fire must have had pronounced evolutionary effects on most ecosystems flora and fauna earth is an intrinsically flammable planet owing to its cover of carbon rich vegetation seasonally dry climates atmospheric oxygen and widespread lightning and volcanic ignitions wildfires can be characterized in terms of cause of ignition their physical properties combustible material present and effect of weather on fire wildfires can cause damage to property and human life although naturally occurring wildfires may have beneficial effects on native vegetation animals and ecosystems that have evolved with fire high severity wildfire creates complex early seral forest habitat also called snag forest habitat which often has higher species richness and diversity than unburned old forest many plant species depend on effects of fire for growth and reproduction wildfires in ecosystems where wildfire is uncommon or where non native vegetation has encroached may have strongly negative ecological effects wildfire behavior and severity result from a combination of factors such as available fuels physical setting and

combustible material such as vegetation that is subjected to enough heat and has an adequate supply of oxygen from ambient air a high moisture content usually prevents ignition and slows propagation because higher temperatures are needed to evaporate any water in material and heat material to its fire point dense forests usually provide more shade resulting in lower ambient temperatures and greater humidity and are therefore less susceptible to wildfires graham et al 12 less dense material such as grasses and leaves are easier to ignite because they contain less water than denser material such as branches and trunks national wildfire coordinating group communicator s guide for wildland fire management 3 plants continuously lose water by evapotranspiration but water loss is

people in holding areas and minimize mop up camps and command posts should also be located upwind of wildfires protective clothing and equipment can also help minimize exposure to smoke and ash firefighters are also at risk of cardiac events including strokes and heart attacks fire fighters should maintain good physical fitness fitness programs medical screening and examination programs which include stress tests can minimize risks of firefighting cardiac problems other injury hazards wildland fire fighters face include slips trips and falls burns scrapes and cuts from tools and equipment being struck by trees vehicles or other objects plant hazards such as thorns and poison ivy snake and animal bites vehicle crashes electrocution from power lines or lightning storms and unstable building structures firefighter safety zone guidelines u s forest service publishes guidelines for minimum distance a firefighter should be from a flame us forest service efforts to update firefighter safety zone guidelines fire retardant fire retardants are used to slow wildfires by inhibiting combustion they are aqueous solutions of ammonium phosphates and ammonium sulfates as well as thickening agents decision to apply retardant depends on magnitude location and intensity of wildfire in certain instances fire retardant may also be applied as a precautionary fire defense measure typical fire retardants contain same agents as fertilizers fire retardant may also affect water quality through leaching eutrophication or misapplication fire retardant s effects on drinking water remain inconclusive dilution factors including water body size rainfall and water flow rates lessen concentration and potency of fire retardant wildfire debris ash and sediment clog rivers and reservoirs increasing risk for floods and erosion that ultimately slow and or damage water treatment systems there is continued concern of fire retardant effects on land water wildlife habitats and watershed quality additional research is needed however on positive side fire retardant specifically its nitrogen and phosphorus components has been shown to have a effect on nutrient deprived soils and thus creates a temporary increase in vegetation current usda procedure maintains that aerial application of fire retardant in united states must clear waterways by a minimum of 300 feet in order to safeguard effects of retardant runoff aerial uses of fire retardant are required to avoid application near waterways and endangered species plant and animal habitats after any incident of fire retardant misapplication u s forest service requires reporting and assessment impacts be made in order to determine mitigation remediation and or restrictions on future retardant uses in that area

wildfire modeling is concerned with numerical simulation of wildfires in order to comprehend and predict fire behavior wildfire modeling aims to aid wildfire suppression increase safety of firefighters and public and minimize damage using computational science wildfire modeling involves statistical analysis of past fire events to predict spotting risks and front behavior various wildfire propagation models have been proposed in past including simple ellipses and egg and fan shaped models early attempts to determine wildfire behavior assumed terrain and vegetation uniformity however exact behavior of a wildfire s front is dependent on a variety of factors including windspeed and slope steepness modern growth models utilize a combination of past ellipsoidal descriptions and huygens principle to simulate fire growth as a continuously expanding polygon g d richards an elliptical growth model of forest fire fronts and its numerical solution int j meth eng 30 1163 1179 1990 finney 1 3 extreme value theory may also be used to predict size of large wildfires however large fires that exceed suppression capabilities are often regarded as statistical outliers in standard analyses even though fire policies are more influenced by large wildfires than by small fires alvarado et al 66 68 right thumb upright 1 1 2003 canberra firestorm human risk and exposure wildfire risk is chance that a wildfire will start in or reach a particular area and potential loss of human values if it does risk is dependent on variable factors such as human activities weather patterns availability of wildfire fuels and availability or lack of resources to suppress a fire wildfires have continually been a threat to human populations however human induced geographical and climatic changes are exposing populations more frequently to wildfires and increasing wildfire risk it is speculated that increase in wildfires arises from a century of wildfire suppression coupled with rapid expansion of human developments into fire prone wildlands wildfires are naturally occurring events that aid in promoting forest health global warming and climate changes are causing an increase in temperatures and more droughts nationwide which contributes to an increase in wildfire risk airborne hazards most noticeable adverse effect of wildfires is destruction of property however release of hazardous chemicals from burning of wildland fuels also significantly impacts health in humans wildfire smoke is composed primarily of carbon dioxide and water vapor other common smoke components present in lower concentrations are carbon monoxide formaldehyde acrolein hydrocarbons and benzene small particulates suspended in air which come in solid form or in liquid droplets are also present in smoke 80 90 of wildfire smoke by mass is within fine particle size class of 2 5 micrometers in diameter or smaller despite carbon dioxide s high concentration in smoke it poses a low health risk due to its low toxicity rather carbon monoxide and fine particulate matter particularly 2 5 um in diameter and smaller have been identified as major health threats other chemicals are considered to be significant hazards but are found in concentrations that are too low to cause detectable health effects degree of wildfire smoke exposure to an individual is dependent on length severity duration and proximity of fire people are exposed directly to smoke via respiratory tract though inhalation of air pollutants indirectly communities are exposed to wildfire debris that can contaminate soil and water supplies u s environmental protection agency epa developed air quality index aqi a public resource that provides national air quality standard concentrations for common air pollutants public can use this index as a tool to determine their exposure to hazardous air pollutants based on visibility range fire ecologist leda found that wildfire smoke distributes microbial life on a global level she stated there are numerous allergens that we ve found in smoke and so it may be that some people who are sensitive to smoke have that sensitivity not only because of particulate matter and smoke but also because there are some biological organisms in it post fire risks after a wildfire hazards remain residents returning to their homes may be at risk from falling fire weakened trees humans and pets may also be harmed by falling into ash pits at risk groups firefighters firefighters are at greatest risk for acute and chronic health effects resulting from wildfire smoke exposure due to firefighters occupational duties they are frequently exposed to hazardous chemicals at a close proximity for longer periods of time a case study on exposure of wildfire smoke among wildland firefighters shows that firefighters are exposed to significant levels of carbon monoxide and respiratory irritants above osha permissible exposure limits pel and threshold limit values tlv 5 10 are overexposed study obtained exposure concentrations for one wildland firefighter over a 10 hour shift spent holding down a fireline firefighter was exposed to a wide range of carbon monoxide and respiratory irritant combination of particulate matter 3 5 um and smaller acrolein and formaldehyde levels carbon monoxide levels reached up to and tlv irritant index value reached a high of 10 in contrast osha pel for carbon monoxide is and for tlv respiratory irritant index calculated threshold limit value is 1 any value above 1 exceeds exposure limits between 2001 and 2012 over 200 fatalities occurred among wildland firefighters in addition to heat and chemical hazards firefighters are also at risk for electrocution from power lines injuries from equipment slips trips and falls injuries from vehicle rollovers heat related illness insect bites and stings stress and rhabdomyolysis residents residents in communities surrounding wildfires are exposed to lower concentrations of chemicals but they are at a greater risk for indirect exposure through water or soil contamination exposure to residents is greatly dependent on individual susceptibility vulnerable persons such as children ages 0 4 elderly ages 65 and older smokers and pregnant women are at an increased risk due to their already compromised body systems even when exposures are present at low chemical concentrations and for relatively short exposure periods they are also at risk for future wildfires and may move away to areas they consider less risky wildfires affect large numbers of people in western canada and united states in california alone more than 350 000 people live in towns and cities in very high fire hazard severity zones fetal exposure additionally there is evidence of an increase in maternal stress as documented by researchers m h o donnell and a m thus affecting birth outcomes in australia studies show that male infants born with drastically higher average birth weights were born in mostly severely fire affected areas this is attributed to fact that maternal signals directly affect fetal growth patterns http apps com full record do product ua search mode qid 1 sid page 2 doc 16 asthma is one of most common chronic disease among children in united states affecting estimated 6 2 million children a recent area of research on asthma risk focuses specifically on risk of air pollution during gestational period several pathophysiology processes are involved are in this in human s considerable airway development occurs during 2nd and 3rd trimester and continue until 3 years of age it is hypothesized that exposure to these toxins during this period could have consequential effects as epithelium of lungs during this time could have increased permeability to toxins exposure to air pollution during parental and pre natal stage could induce epigenetic changes which are responsible for development of asthma recent meta analyses have found significant association between pm2 5 no2 and development of asthma during childhood despite heterogeneity among studies furthermore maternal exposure to chronic stressor which are most like to be present in distressed communities which is also a relevant co relate of childhood asthma which may further help explain early childhood exposure to air pollution neighborhood poverty and childhood risk living in distressed neighborhood is not only linked to pollutant source location and exposure but can also be associated with degree of magnitude of chronic individual stress which can in turn alter load of maternal immune system leading to adverse outcomes in children including increased susceptibility to air pollution and other hazards health effects thumb animation of diaphragmatic breathing with diaphragm shown in green wildfire smoke contains particulate matter that may have adverse effects upon human respiratory system evidence of health effects of wildfire smoke should be relayed to public so that exposure may be limited evidence of health effects can also be used to influence policy to promote positive health outcomes inhalation of smoke from a wildfire can be a health hazard wildfire smoke is composed of combustion products i e carbon dioxide carbon monoxide water vapor particulate matter organic chemicals nitrogen oxides and other compounds principal health concern is inhalation of particulate matter and carbon monoxide particulate matter pm is a type of air pollution made up of particles of dust and liquid droplets they are characterized into three categories based on diameter of particle coarse pm fine pm and ultrafine pm coarse particles are between 2 5 micrometers and 10 micrometers fine particles measure 0 1 to 2 5 micrometers and ultrafine particle are less than 0 1 micrometer each size can enter body through inhalation but pm impact on body varies by size coarse particles are filtered by upper airways and these particles can accumulate and cause pulmonary inflammation this can result in eye and sinus irritation as well as sore throat and coughing coarse pm is often composed of materials that are heavier and more toxic that lead to short term effects with stronger impact smaller particulate moves further into respiratory system creating issues deep into lungs and bloodstream in asthma patients pm2 5 causes inflammation but also increases oxidative stress in epithelial cells these particulates also cause apoptosis and autophagy in lung epithelial cells both processes cause cells to be damaged and impacts cell function this damage impacts those with respiratory conditions such as asthma where lung tissues and function are already compromised third pm type is ultra fine pm ufp ufp can enter bloodstream like pm2 5 however studies show that it works into blood much quicker inflammation and epithelial damage done by ufp has also shown to be much more severe pm2 5 is of largest concern in regards to wildfire this is particularly hazardous to very young elderly and those with chronic conditions such as asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd cystic fibrosis and cardiovascular conditions illnesses most commonly with exposure to fine particle from wildfire smoke are bronchitis exacerbation of asthma or copd and pneumonia symptoms of these complications include wheezing and shortness of breath and cardiovascular symptoms include chest pain rapid heart rate and fatigue asthma exacerbation smoke from wildfires can cause health problems especially for children and those who already have respiratory problems several epidemiological studies have demonstrated a close association between air pollution and respiratory allergic diseases such as bronchial asthma an observational study of smoke exposure related to 2007 san diego wildfires revealed an increase both in healthcare utilization and respiratory diagnoses especially asthma among group sampled projected climate scenarios of wildfire occurrences predict significant increases in respiratory conditions among young children particulate matter pm triggers a series of biological processes including inflammatory immune response oxidative stress which are associated with harmful changes in allergic respiratory diseases although some studies demonstrated no significant acute changes in lung function among people with asthma related to pm from wildfires a possible explanation for these counterintuitive findings is increased use of quick relief medications such as inhalers in response to elevated levels of smoke among those already diagnosed with asthma in investigating association of medication use for obstructive lung disease and wildfire exposure researchers found increases both in usage of inhalers and initiation of long term control as in oral steroids more specifically some people with asthma reported higher use of quick relief medications inhalers after two major wildfires in california researchers found an increase in physician prescriptions for quick relief medications in years following wildfires than compared to year before each occurrence there is consistent evidence between wildfire smoke and exacerbation of asthma carbon monoxide danger carbon monoxide co is a colorless odorless gas that can be found at highest concentration at close proximity to a smoldering fire for this reason carbon monoxide inhalation is a serious threat to health of wildfire firefighters co in smoke can be inhaled into lungs where it is absorbed into bloodstream and reduces oxygen delivery to body s vital organs at high concentrations it can cause headache weakness dizziness confusion nausea disorientation visual impairment coma and even death however even at lower concentrations such as those found at wildfires individuals with cardiovascular disease may experience chest pain and cardiac arrhythmia a recent study tracking number and cause of wildfire firefighter deaths from 1990 2006 found that 21 9 of deaths occurred from heart attacks another important and somewhat less obvious health effect of wildfires is psychiatric diseases and disorders both adults and children from countries ranging from united states and canada to greece and australia who were directly and indirectly affected by wildfires were found by researchers to demonstrate several different mental conditions linked to their experience with wildfires these include post traumatic stress disorder ptsd depression anxiety and phobias in a new twist to wildfire health effects former uranium mining sites were burned over in summer of 2012 near north fork idaho this prompted concern from area residents and idaho state department of environmental quality officials over potential spread of radiation in resultant smoke since those sites had never been completely cleaned up from radioactive remains epidemiology western us has seen an increase in both frequency and intensity of wildfires over last several decades this increase has been attributed to arid climate of western us and effects of global warming an estimated 46 million people were exposed to wildfire smoke from 2004 to 2009 in western united states evidence has demonstrated that wildfire smoke can increase levels of particulate matter in atmosphere epa has defined acceptable concentrations of particulate matter in air through national ambient air quality standards and monitoring of ambient air quality has been mandated due to these monitoring programs and incidence of several large wildfires near populated areas epidemiological studies have been conducted and demonstrate an association between human health effects and an increase in fine particulate matter due to wildfire smoke epa has defined acceptable concentrations of particulate matter in air national ambient air quality standards are part of clean air act and provide mandated guidelines for pollutant levels and monitoring of ambient air quality in addition to these monitoring programs increased incidence of wildfires near populated areas have precipitated several epidemiological studies such studies have demonstrated an association between negative human health effects and an increase in fine particulate matter due to wildfire smoke size of particulate matter is significant as smaller particulate matter fine is easily inhaled into human respiratory tract often small particulate matter can be inhaled into deep lung tissue causing respiratory distress illness or disease an increase in pm smoke emitted from hayman fire in colorado in june 2002 was associated with an increase in respiratory symptoms in patients with copd looking at wildfires in southern california in october 2003 in a similar manner investigators have shown an increase in hospital admissions due to asthma symptoms while being exposed to peak concentrations of pm in smoke another epidemiological study found a 7 2 95 confidence interval 0 25 15 increase in risk of respiratory related hospital admissions during smoke wave days with high wildfire specific particulate matter 2 5 compared to matched non smoke wave days children participating in children s health study were also found to have an increase in eye and respiratory symptoms medication use and physician visits recently it was demonstrated that mothers who were pregnant during fires gave birth to babies with a slightly reduced average birth weight compared to those who were not exposed to wildfire during birth suggesting that pregnant women may also be at greater risk to adverse effects from wildfire worldwide it is estimated that 339 000 people die due to effects of wildfire smoke each year while size of particulate matter is an important consideration for health effects chemical composition of particulate matter pm2 5 from wildfire smoke should also be considered antecedent studies have demonstrated that chemical composition of pm2 5 from wildfire smoke can yield different estimates of human health outcomes as compared to other sources of smoke health outcomes for people exposed to wildfire smoke may differ from those exposed to smoke from alternative sources such as solid fuels see also references bibliography external links current global map of airborne particulates less than 1 micrometer in diameter including smoke australian government site mapping fires and
