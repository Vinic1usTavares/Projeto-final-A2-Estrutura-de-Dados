floors in park are forested there are alpine meadows at higher altitudes there are rocks and glaciers at altitudes higher than meadows gran paradiso is only mountain entirely within boundaries of

s vanoise national park they co operate in managing ibex population which moves across their shared boundary seasonally flora thumb left park in autumn park s woods are important because they provide shelter for a large number of animals they are a natural defence against landslides avalanches and flooding two main types of woods found in park are coniferous and deciduous woods deciduous european beech forests are common on piedmont side of park and are not found on dryer valle d aosta side these forests are thick with dense foliage that lets in very little light during summer beech leaves take a long time to decompose and they form a thick layer on woodland floor that impedes development of other plants and trees are most common trees in forests on valley floors they are mixed with spruces swiss stone pines and more rarely silver firs maple and lime forests are found in gulleys these forests are only present in isolated areas and are at risk of extinction downy oak woods are more common in aosta valley area than in piedmont area because of its higher temperatures and lower precipitation oak is not a typical species in park and it is often found mixed with scots pine park s chestnut groves have been affected by human cultivation for wood and fruit it rarely grows above 1 000 metres 3 280 ft and most important chestnut forests are in park s piedmontese side park s conifer woods include scots pine groves spruce forests dominated by norway spruce often mixed with larch larch and swiss stone pine woods are found up to highest sub alpine level 2200 2300 metres 7 217 7 546 ft at higher altitudes trees gradually thin out and there are alpine pastures these pastures are rich in flowers in late spring wildflowers in park s high meadows include wild pansies martagon lilies and park has many rocky habitats they are mostly located above timberline and alpine pastures these areas have rock and detritus on their surface alpine plants have adapted to these habitats by assuming characteristics like dwarfism hairiness bright coloured flowers and highly developed roots about 1 500 plant species can be seen at garden near inside park fauna thumb right 200px alpine ibex thumb 200px marmot alpine ibex graze in abundant mountain pastures in summer and descend to lower elevations in winter gran paradiso s pairing with vanoise national park provides year round protection to ibex along with ibex animal species found in park include ermine weasel hare eurasian badger alpine chamois wolf recently arrived from central italy and maybe even lynx ibex and chamois spend most of year above tree line they descend to valleys in winter and spring alpine marmot forage on plants along snow line there are more than 100 bird species in park including eurasian eagle owl rock ptarmigan alpine and chough golden eagles nest on rocky ledges and sometimes in trees are found on steep cliffs there are black woodpeckers and nutcrackers in park s woodlands park
