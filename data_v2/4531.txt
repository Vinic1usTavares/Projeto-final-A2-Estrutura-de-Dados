ketuanan melayu jawi script literally malay dominance is a political concept emphasising malay preeminence in present day malaysia malays of malaysia claimed a special position and special rights owing to their long domicile and fact that present malaysian state itself evolved from a malay polity oldest political institution in malaysia is system of malay rulers of nine malay states british colonial government transformed system and turned it first into a system of indirect rule then in 1948 using this culturally based institution they incorporated malay monarchy into blueprints for independent federation of malaya term tanah melayu in its name which literally means malay homeland assumes of malay states in this way britain strengthened malay ethno nationalism malay ethnicity and culture and malay sovereignty in new nation state though other cultures would continue to flourish identity of emerging political community was to be shaped by historic political culture of its dominant malay ethnic group chinese and indian immigrants who form a significant minority in malaysia are considered beholden to malays for granting them citizenship in return for special privileges as set out in article 153 of constitution of malaysia this quid pro quo arrangement is usually referred to as malaysian social contract concept of ketuanan melayu is usually cited by politicians particularly those from united malays national organisation umno although idea itself predates malaysian independence phrase ketuanan melayu did not come into vogue until early 2000s decade historically most vocal political opposition towards concept has come from non malay based parties such as malaysian people s movement party parti gerakan rakyat malaysia and democratic action party dap in 2000s decade multiracial people s justice party parti keadilan rakyat or pkr also positioned itself against ketuanan melayu advocating instead ketuanan rakyat supremacy of people idea of malay supremacy gained attention in 1940s when malays organised themselves to protest malayan union s establishment and later fought for independence during 1960s there was a substantial effort challenging ketuanan melayu led by people s action party pap of singapore which was a state in malaysia from 1963 to 1965 and dap after singapore s secession however portions of constitution related to ketuanan melayu were entrenched after race riots of 13 may 1969 which followed an election campaign focused on issue of non malay rights and ketuanan melayu this period also saw rise of ultras who advocated a one party government led by umno and an increased emphasis on malays being definitive people of malaysia i e only a malay could be a true malaysian riots caused a major change in government s approach to racial issues and led to introduction of an aggressive affirmative action policy strongly favouring malays new economic policy nep national culture policy also introduced in 1970 emphasised an assimilation of non malays into malay ethnic group however during 1990s prime minister mahathir bin mohamad rejected this approach with his bangsa malaysia policy emphasising a malaysian instead of malay identity for state during 2000s decade politicians began stressing ketuanan melayu again and publicly chastised government ministers who questioned social contract malaysian malay ethnic malays which make up majority population of malaysia at 50 4 are an ethnic group of austronesian people predominantly inhabiting malay peninsula including southernmost parts of thailand east coast of sumatra coast of borneo and smaller islands which lie between these locations true origin of ethnic malays is still subject of studies among historians anthropologists and linguists a popular theory suggested that people who spoke austronesian languages first arrived in maritime southeast asia between 2 500bce and 1 500bce as a part of austronesian expansion from taiwan to south east asia however a recent genetic studies carried out by hugo human genome organization involving almost 2000 people across asia points to another theory of asian migration pattern hugo findings support hypothesis that asia was populated primarily through a single migration event from south and that south east asian region was populated first which contained most diversity then continuing slowly north with its diversity being lost hindu and buddhist influences arrived through trade contacts with indian subcontinent beginning of first millennium saw rise of ancient malay states in coastal areas of malay peninsular notably red earth kingdom 1st century gangga negara 2nd century 2nd century kedah 2nd century and pahang 5th century between 7th and 13th centuries many of these small often prosperous peninsular maritime trading states became part of srivijaya empire a malay kingdom centred in palembang and kadaram by 15th century malacca sultanate whose hegemony reached over much of western malay archipelago had become centre of islamization in east malaccan tradition was transmitted onwards and fostered a vigorous ethos of malay identity since this era islamic faith became closely identified with malay society and played a significant role in defining malay identity close identification of malays with islam continued until 20th century and was finally entrenched in article 160 of constitution of malaysia as well as in national philosophy of brunei known as malay islamic monarchy present day malaysian malays are divided broadly into malays proper or peninsular malays melayu anak jati or melayu semenanjung and foreign malays or islander malay melayu anak dagang or melayu malays proper consist of those individuals who adhere to malay culture which has developed in malay peninsula among notable groups are malays malays and malays foreign malays consist of descendants of immigrants from other part of malay archipelago who became citizens of malay sultanates and were absorbed and assimilated into malay culture at different times aided by similarity in lifestyle and common religion islam among notable groups are javanese minangkabau and bugis malays article 160 of constitution of malaysia defines a malay as a malaysian citizen born to a malaysian citizen who professes to be a muslim habitually speaks malay language adheres to malay customs and is domiciled in malaysia or singapore a non malay malaysian who converts to islam can claim to be a malay provided they meet other conditions two good examples are jeanne abdullah wife of prime minister abdullah ahmad badawi who

regard themselves as malay and enjoy same benefit and privilege as latter though this definition is not according to ancestry lineage it is however correct in sense of social behaviours culture which controls a great proportion of general mentality and social behaviour is succeeded through mother tongue and religion article 160 unites malays from different ethnic groups as prevailing race and thus

historians root cause of ethnic strife and ketuanan melayu was a lack of mixing between malays and non malays an exception to this were straits chinese who managed to assimilate reasonably well despite assimilation taking 600 years including intermarriage according to ming shi lu ancestors of straits chinese were gifts given to sultan of malacca as a recognition of both bilateral ties between ming dynasty and sultanate and of malay sovereignty at time most were rich merchants during british rule instead of manual labourers and many habitually spoke malay dressed in malay style and

also fanned racial sentiments another contributing factor to ketuanan melayu was world war ii japanese occupation war awakened a keen political awareness among malayan people by intensifying communalism and racial hatred japanese policies politicised malay peasantry intentionally fanning flames of malay nationalism two malay historians wrote that japanese hostile acts against chinese and their apparently more favourable treatments of malays helped to make chinese community feel its separate identity more acutely a foreign commentator agreed stating that during occupation period malay

convenience alliance won 51 out of 52 seats available sole remaining seat went to pan malayan islamic party later known as pas a malay based party and strong advocate of ketuanan melayu total defeat

retrospective effect it was a major concession by malays who had vigorously campaigned against jus soli citizenship in malayan union ongkili p 113 on other hand malay and islam became national

character is malay in any other country where aliens try to dominate economic and other fields eventually there is bitter opposition from indigenous people but not with malays therefore in return they must appreciate position of malays it has been suggested that a malaysian nationality did not emerge because all national symbols in malaysia were derived from malay tradition hwang p 49 constitutional restraint on size of rural parliamentary constituencies was later removed providing what one commentator called an indirect buttress to malay special rights as malays were concentrated in rural areas this indirectly enhanced malay political power original constitution had implicitly followed one man one vote change was denounced as giving one man one vote another a number of votes

malay agenda evoked little sentiment from non malays despite most of them gaining citizenship and thus becoming theoretically equal to malay citizens under constitution this could be attributed to acceptance of social contract of which one historian wrote at elite level non malays recognized that malays were politically superior by virtue of their indigenous status and that malaysian polity would have a malay character malays were to be assured of safe majorities in both state and federal parliament malays would control highest positions of government and dominate members of federal cabinet a malay historian wrote that in return chinese gained more than overseas chinese in southeast asia had dreamed of equal citizenship political participation and office holding unimpaired economic opportunity and tolerance for their language religion and cultural institutions hwang p 67 some expressed trepidation at article 153 shortly before independence china press suggested that while special rights may be excusable at start of building of a nation if period of special rights is not restricted or scope of special rights is not clearly defined then endless disputes will arise later on and argued that special rights would eventually divide instead of unite malayans hickling p 179 nevertheless at time of independence some historians assert there was a genuine sense of common citizenship common aspirations a common destiny hickling p 95 this was about to change merger in 1961 when malayan government began discussing a possible merger with neighbouring singapore sabah sarawak and brunei problems of ethnic power relations arose again malaysia proposal sans sabah and sarawak went back more than a decade earlier negotiations had proved fruitless singaporeans themselves were not anxious to be ruled by what they considered a malay government sopiee p 102 by 1961 however singapore had grown receptive to idea of joining malaysia largely because of prevailing idea at time that industrial singapore could not survive without access to malayan markets sopiee p 146 malayan government was not keen on having chinese singaporean population push malays into a minority position in new malaysia many malays felt that upsetting malay dominated nature of armed forces and police might place them in a dangerous situation it was also argued that inferior economic position of malays would be emphasised by entry of even more rich chinese setting stage for major discontent keith p 21 malayans decided to resolve this by merging with sabah and sarawak both british colonies had large native populations whom government considered malay under article 160 of constitution most of them were not malay natives were mainly animists or christians instead of muslims as required to resolve this issue government expanded its informal definition of malay to include these people sopiee p 144 sabahans and sarawakians could not see how they would benefit from merger many regarded malaya as being only for malays a group they did not include themselves in spectre of malaysia inclusion of phrase malay being considered frightening with its official religion of islam and official language of malay did nothing to soothe their fears of malay domination for merger to come about they insisted natives of sabah and sarawak be awarded same privileges as malays sopiee p 150 a 20 point agreement between sabah and malayan government and a slightly different 18 point agreement by sarawak was later agreed upon after much negotiation and a show of support from british for merger impasse was resolved although natives of borneo were denied privileges of malays merger was effected on 16 september 1963 malaysian malaysia in 1963 singapore state elections alliance

treated as second class citizens under chinese dominated though ostensibly multiracial pap government however all of umno backed malay candidates lost to pap pap politicians who saw this as a betrayal of an earlier agreement with alliance not to contest elections in malaya and singapore respectively decided to run on mainland in 1964 general election although pap attracted large crowds at its rallies it won only one seat that by devan nair who represented bangsar constituency it is thought by some historians that finance minister and mca president tan siew sin s appeal to chinese to avoid

had been limited affirmative action programmes before however these mostly focused on civil service as article 153 of constitution did admission to higher education was largely merit based tunku government preferred laissez faire policies minimising economic intervention although some agencies such as rural industrial development agency rida which attempted to aid malay entrepreneurs existed

development of malay entrepreneurship musa pp 97 100 although nep was aimed at addressing economic imbalances it soon became associated with ketuanan melayu while two were rarely directly equated they

in 1970 government made malay medium of instruction for primary secondary and tertiary education replacing english although government funding for chinese and tamil education streams continued many non malays considered this new policy to be most discriminatory thus far government s rationale was that this would provide better educational opportunities for malays especially those who formerly had to make transition from malay medium primary and secondary schools to english medium universities it was also argued that uniting students under one language would provide for greater racial harmony while indirectly underscoring malay nature of state same year that medium of instruction was changed to malay national culture policy ncp was announced syed nasir ismail described government s

whether policy should be renewed replaced or scrapped altogether government organised an official review of nep in years leading up to its expiration nep had been faced with a number of criticisms throughout its lifetime most of them related to political corruption and other inefficiencies one point of dispute was calculation of malay equity although officially as of 1992 malays controlled 18 of economy some dismissed this figure as misleading it was argued that as in reality much of this amount comprised equity held by government agencies therefore it belonged to malaysians as a whole musa pp 217 218 practice of awarding public works contracts mainly to bumiputras was argued to be stifling malay competency by providing little incentive to improve many bumiputra contractors in turn subcontracted their jobs to others who were in some cases chinese ali baba arrangements with malay ali using his privileges to acquire licences and permits denied non malay then accepting a fee to be front man while non malay baba ran business were prevalent some suggested that nep might have worked if malay had actually wanted to learn ropes but more often than not he just wanted to be rich rashid pp 134 135 some said disbursement of shares favoured politically connected many of whom immediately sold shares at market price reaping arbitrage instead of holding on and increasing malay

that only 5 of all local undergraduates would be malays if quotas were abolished musa p 182 another criticism was that nep and other affirmative action had actually reduced malays self confidence

reliant on chinese economically maidin pp 252 253 putra pp 97 99 claims that nep had retarded economic growth were dismissed it was posited that nep had managed to avert further racial rioting which would have hurt economic growth more than nep nep was also defended as having created a malay middle class and improving standards of living without compromising non bumiputra share of economy in absolute terms statistics indicated that chinese and indian middle classes also grew under nep albeit not as much as malays overall malaysian poverty rate had shrunk from 50 at independence to 7 it was also argued that ethnic stereotypes had been largely stamped out due to nep s success in creating a malay upper class although many of nep s goals were restated by ndp new policy appeared to be

was returned to power for first time without its customary 2 3 supermajority in dewan rakyat meaning it could no longer pass constitutional amendments without support of opposition parties election results were widely seen as reflecting discontent about state of country s economy and increasing ethnic tensions within country three main opposition parties had campaigned on a platform condemning nep and government s response to widening economic disparities month after crown prince of kelantan tengku faris petra said during an assembly organised by newly formed malay unity action front that since malays had given in to granting non malays citizenship latter should not seek equality or special treatment in his speech prince also called for malay unity to ensure that malay sovereignty and supremacy was preserved anwar ibrahim former umno deputy president and former deputy prime minister whose parti keadilan rakyat became second largest party in parliament after elections and de facto

we want what we desire for is a new malaysia is supremacy for all malaysians a week later his wife wan azizah wan ismail president of pkr told press that we should not keep talking about malay

keris at three previous umno annual general assemblies saying he was sorry if it had affected non malays he refused to comment on whether he would repeat act in future his conditional apology was met with heavy criticism from within umno one media outlet described reaction as such sentiment among many in party is that chinese and indians betrayed bn when they voted for pakatan rakyat there is hurt there is anger so why should hishammuddin be too concerned about what non malays think of keris act many felt that apology itself threatened malay supremacy abdullah welcomed apology saying it was brave and made it clear to non malays important role keris had in malay community in response to questions about diminishing of malay supremacy post elections he said that it was more about parity for bumiputra communities rejecting notion of political dominance shortly thereafter information minister ahmad shabery cheek insisted that ketuanan melayu did not imply a master slave relationship in any sense between malays and non malays instead he suggested it referred to institution of malay monarchs who had once been masters but gave up their primacy when federal constitution was adopted at independence shabery cited article 182 of constitution which grants royalty certain legal immunities as an example of malay supremacy however some prominent members of royalty such as raja of perlis and former yang di pertuan agong tuanku syed sirajuddin putra syed have themselves been critical of ketuanan melayu in early 2009 raja stated that in malaysia every race is tuan master i believe that if everyone understands that every individual of any race should not be deprived of their rights then efforts of certain parties who think that supremacy or rights should only be given to a particular race can be stopped in late 2009 cabinet decided to change curriculum of biro tata negara national civics bureau or btn programmes which are mandatory for public servants and students studying on
