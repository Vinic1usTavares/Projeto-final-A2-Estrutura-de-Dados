bond film with intention that roger moore would not reprise role of james bond moore who by time of release of living daylights would have been 59 years old chose to retire from role after 12 years and 7 films albert broccoli however claimed that he let moore go from role an extensive search for a new actor to play bond saw a number of actors including new zealander sam neill irish born pierce brosnan and welsh born stage actor timothy dalton audition for role in 1986 bond co producer michael g wilson director john glen dana and barbara broccoli were impressed with sam neill and very much wanted to use him however albert broccoli was not sold on actor thumb right official car aston martin v8 vantage series 2 at a james bond convention producers eventually offered role to brosnan after a three day screen test at time he was contracted to television series remington steele which had been canceled by nbc network due to falling ratings announcement that he would be chosen to play james bond caused a surge in interest in series which led to nbc exercising less than three days prior to expiry a 60 day option in brosnan s contract to make a further season of series nbc s action caused drastic repercussions as a result of which broccoli withdrew offer given to brosnan citing that he did not want character associated with a contemporary television series this led to a drop in interest in remington steele and only five new episodes were filmed before series was finally cancelled edict from broccoli was that remington steele would not be james bond dana broccoli suggested timothy dalton albert broccoli was initially reluctant given dalton s public lack of interest in role but at his wife s urging agreed to meet actor however dalton would soon begin filming brenda starr

dalton but he had not signed a contract a casting director persuaded robert bathurst an english actor who would become known for his roles in joking apart cold feet and downton abbey to audition for bond bathurst believes that his ludicrous audition was only an arm twisting exercise because producers wanted to persuade dalton to take role by telling him they were still auditioning other actors

project if he were asked to imitate moore timothy dalton interview everything or nothing 2012 in contrast to moore s more jocular approach dalton found his creative muse from original books i definitely wanted to recapture essence and flavour of books and play it less flippantly after all bond s essential quality is that he s a man who lives on edge he could get killed at any moment and that stress and danger factor is reflected in way he lives chain smoking drinking fast cars and fast women ian blair playgirl interview 1987 moore declined to watch living daylights in cinema as he

for its introduction of sequenced electronic rhythm tracks overdubbed with orchestra at time a relatively new innovation title song of film living daylights was co written with pal waaktaar of norwegian pop music group a ha and recorded by band group and barry did not collaborate well resulting in two versions of theme song barry s film mix is heard on soundtrack and on a ha s later compilation album headlines and deadlines version preferred by band can be heard on a ha album stay on these roads released in 1988 however in 2006 waaktaar complimented barry s contributions i loved stuff he added to track i mean it gave it this really cool string arrangement that s when for me it started to sound like a bond thing title song is one of few 007 title songs that is not performed or written by a british or american performer in a departure from previous bond films living daylights was first to use different songs over opening and end credits song heard over end credits if there was a man was one of two songs performed for film by chrissie hynde of pretenders other song where has everybody gone is heard from necros s walkman in film pretenders were originally considered to perform daylights title song however producers had been pleased with commercial success of duran duran s a view to a kill and felt that a ha would be more likely to make an impact on charts original
