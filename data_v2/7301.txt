reviewers were from atlantic where both kevin fallon and patrick burns declared it best episode of glee all season and meghan brown suggested that show should just do competition episodes from now on aly semigran of mtv was similarly laudatory and said that show was back in top form she added that episode felt very reminiscent of magic first season provided others were more tempered in their praise james poniewozik of time said episode was grounded and solid if not spectacular and highlighted how glee has developed into a broad ensemble where any of several characters is capable of taking spotlight even an originally comic relief character like brittany emily vanderwerff of a v club and houston chronicle bobby hankinson both liked episode vanderwerff gave it a b but they like erica futterman of rolling stone who was less complimentary were disappointed that it failed to measure up to last time new directions competed in sectionals vanderwerff wrote when show remains at some level a show about a bunch of kids who just love to sing and dance and maybe have wacky adventures on side it remains fundamentally strong as it does tonight she also stated fact that warblers and new directions tied while probably necessary for whatever reason is ridiculously anticlimactic and keeps this episode from an a pretty much singlehandedly amy reiter of los angeles times was disappointed with almost everything and said episode felt more like a long slow letdown after a season of gleeful highs she added new directions sectionals performance wasn t a total fumble but it wasn t touchdown you might ve hoped for either and of long awaited opportunity to see other members featured in competition anticipated shining moment turned out to be so dull reiter was one of a very few critics to note absence of cheerleading coach sue sylvester in episode and only when she lamented relative lack of humor futterman merely remarked on sue s non appearance in passing she came to conclusion that we got a spazzy unfocused hour at expense of emotional investment and though anthony benigno of daily news complimented solid acting he also wrote that this is first time show s started to feel genuinely boring as opposed to you know gleeful he made a general complaint as well this show is starting to suffer in a big way from making music secondary to plot robert canning of ign gave episode a 7 5 out of 10 rating he said that show tried to make it all work and while hour was enjoyable enough each storyline felt just a little bit shy of going from good to great a few reviewers remarked on how hipsters seemed to be a reflection of new directions crew in fifty years with futterman getting into specifics we see future rachel start number with a cane and future mercedes break through to finish song off with a riff and it s hard not to be endeared to them poniewozik wrote that rachel s silent reminder to kurt to smile on stage was a perfect sweet little moment a sentiment shared by tim stack of entertainment weekly poniewozik also noted that lea michele had some of her strongest non singing moments of season by showing not just how rachel dealt with her problems with finn but with being on periphery of group storyline that featured disintegration of rachel finn relationship when commented on at all was viewed unfavorably vanderwerff called it a stupid twist brown praised addition of fink as lauren to new directions and declared i hope she s on team for keeps while poniewozik was pleased that episode used lauren for comedy without simply making her butt of jokes brown also wrote kurt s arc was subtler this week and thereby about 50 times more interesting i am impressed that glee handling his acclimation to dalton so truthfully canning was similarly impressed and called kurt at dalton most solid story of episode there was little approval among reviewers for canary in a cage metaphor in scene between kurt and blaine at end of episode with kurt canary in his new dalton cage hankinson characterized it as super ham fisted and others were nearly as harsh music and performances thumb upright left solo by santana rivera pictured her first on show garnered rave reviews musical performances in this episode were mostly praised by critics though there was little said about quality of abbreviated performance by hipsters in competition there was near universal approval for first song heard don t cry for me argentina which stack called totally beautiful and gave an a he like burns who said it was fantastic loved having rachel and kurt get a chance to sing together jen harper of buddytv echoed kurt s words in episode she said rachel really is as talented as she is irritating but wished she didn t always look like she s crying while she s singing and added that she was really digging kurt in a lower register futterman noted that rachel as is usual with her power ballads uses time to grapple with latest obstacle to her future stardom while we see kurt deliver a clear restrained take benigno called michele s voice astounding and added that her solo alternated with kurt s audition with warblers which is predictably outstanding and gave song a b even those who disliked song or composer were won over by performance berk gave it three stars out of five and burns thought it was fantastic both liked song s tag team presentation performance of train s hey soul sister by dalton academy warblers received even more praise than don t cry for me argentina benigno called it flawless and gave it an a and hanh nguyen of zap2it gave it her top prize of night berk gave it four stars out of five burns said warblers sounded fantastic and fun and harper said she loved it and that like audience on show she would have given it a standing ovation stack said he sorta hated song from sheer overexposure but darren criss sold it for me with his choreography and acting and gave it a b pat monahan lead singer of train said loved it i thought they did an amazing job praise was more tepid for sam and quinn s i ve had time of my life benigno called it solid but added overkill knocks it down to a solid b both futterman and stack said number fell a little flat though stack said duo had great physical chemistry fallon characterized it as an adorable duet berk gave it five stars of five his best grade for episode and called it curdling perfection while reiter was least impressed and wrote that their voices and romantic interplay seemed wan and thin new directions closing number at sectionals valerie received most commentary with santana s solo given enthusiastic praise though brittany and mike s dancing was also lauded hankinson who had tepidly called songs nice up to this point shifted gears and said then santana burns roof down with a rendition of amy winehouse s valerie it was awesome raymund flandez of wall street journal echoed that fervor but then santana came on and killed with an on spot rendition of mark ronson amy winehouse s valerie and wearing a snooki bun santana was electrifying behind mic in an energizing display that revved up audience and added brittany and mike s pas de deux rocked benigno opined that brittany and mike chang handle moves extraordinarily well but vocals here are what steal it naya rivera santana is completely outstanding on lead vocals and i can t understand why she hasn t gotten a solo before this he gave it an a stack was slightly less generous with an a and wrote that it was a great song choice for santana he gave bonus points for phenomenal mike brittany choreography while harper said that their dancing totally made song nguyen liked dancing but she was critical of how song sounded as she felt it lacked something and didn t really feel worthy of standing o while futterman said santana s sassy vocals are a perfect echo of winehouse s but rest of song feels a bit like a circus reiter felt entire song seemed kind of tacked on both dancing and santana s solo dog days are over was favorite song of several reviewers including hankinson who said it was exact brand of high energy jubilation that i love most harper was also enthusiastic this performance for me represents what i like about new directions and why kurt needs to come back asap everyone got to do their own individual thing yet they still work really well as a group i give it best song of night in semigran s view from cute choreographed claps to unconventional but oddly fitting choice to have tina and mercedes sing tune i wish they d save this one for regionals it was a winner while vanderwerff wrote dog days are over is right in this show s wheelhouse so naturally it hits song out of park benigno gave song a b and berk awarded three stars out of five while stack gave it an a and said series creator ryan murphy chose perfect gals to pull off this cover chart history five of seven cover versions released as singles debuted on billboard hot 100 and appeared on other musical charts show s rendition of dog days are over debuted at number twenty two on both hot 100 and canadian hot 100 peak chart positions for season 2 singles in united states dog days are over valerie i ve had time of my life don t cry for me argentina and hey soul sister and pushed original version of song by florence and machine ahead of it to number twenty one on hot 100 up from number fifty eight in previous week other songs
