total viewership episode s ratings increased significantly from previous week s episode this episode received generally positive response from critics emily vanderwerff of a v club gave road to north pole a positive review stating that it is a satisfying episode of family guy all around filled with funny gags and nice moments she especially praised musical segments and portrayal of north pole writing that way episode kept piling more and more ridiculous horrors on top of each other kept whole thing funny she rated episode an a jason hughes of tv squad also praised songs and depiction of santa s factory though he found delivery of episode s message heavy handed kate moon of tv fanatic gave episode 3 6 out of 5 stars she said i had mixed feelings about this one despite its clever moments and hopeful ending while i normally have no problems about family guys shocking or offensive themes i felt bit disconcerted about direction of this christmas episode she went on to say perhaps it was way that series stomped on something as innocent as santa and his elves and twisted them all around or perhaps it was cannibalistic reindeer whatever specific reason irreverent nature of family guy seemed just a little too graphic for me this time around tom eames of entertainment website digital spy placed episode at number twelve on his listing of best family guy episodes in order of yukyukyuks and described episode as christmas comedy gold praising christmastime is killing us song and boreanaz s cameo parents television council a conservative campaigning critic of seth macfarlane works named family guy its worst tv show of week for road to north pole for week ending on december 17 2010 it got this rating due to sexual content and excessive violent scenes including scene in which stewie beats a man to death with a baseball bat and scenes featuring seth macfarlane s father ron while also stating forget naughty or nice this show was simply nauseating robin pierson of tv critic gave road to north pole a 47 out of a possible 100 said a little more interesting plot wise than usual fare but otherwise just as gruesome he especially disliked portrayal of santa and his elves and violence episode was also nominated for outstanding original music and lyrics for song christmastime is killing us written by ron jones seth macfarlane and danny smith and outstanding sound mixing for a comedy or drama series half hour and animation it won for outstanding sound mixing for a comedy or drama series half hour and animation series was successfully nominated in 2009 but failed to merit an award mark hentemann executive producer and showrunner of family guy said of nominating process we had internal discussions in writers room and it seemed like we were much more akin to other primetime comedies than we were to children s shows in animation we assumed we would not get anywhere and so it was a great surprise when we got nomination christmastime is killing us was
