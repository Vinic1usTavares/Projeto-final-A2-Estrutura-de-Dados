of passengers aboard helicopter although fellow democrats controlled two thirds of kentucky general assembly jones never developed a good working relationship with legislature miller p 247 this was due in part to remarks jones made in wake of operation boptrot investigation that led to conviction of 15 sitting or former state legislators jones called investigation a cleansing process legislators reacted negatively claiming jones was trying to take high ground above them following jones remarks state senate president john eck rose became jones bitter political foe miller p 249 nevertheless jones was able to enact many of his legislative priorities during his term jones top priority as governor was passage of health care reform he appointed two health care reform study commissions and in may 1993 he called legislature into a special session to consider a universal health care bill only measure to come out of this session was a temporary tax on health care providers mccubbin kentucky healthcare experiment legislators also agreed to work toward a bill that could be passed in next regular legislative session on march 2 1994 kentucky house of representatives passed a health care reform bill that did not include universal coverage angered jones began campaigning against bill but kentucky senate passed its version on march 22 both chambers worked to reconcile differences between their respective versions of bill and on april 1 1994 last regular day of legislative session senate passed a compromise bill but house killed it on a procedural motion on april 15 last day of session which legislators had set aside to override any gubernatorial health care bill was reintroduced and passed both houses of general assembly jones then reversed course and signed it among reforms included in bill were a mechanism making policies of all companies uniform and creation of a health policy board to regulate rate increases it ensured that insurance companies could not deny coverage because of a pre existing condition and allowed workers to retain their insurance after changing jobs jones also advocated for an amendment to state constitution that had major implications for governor s office under terms of amendment lieutenant governor no longer became acting governor when sitting governor left state it also allowed candidates for governor and lieutenant governor to run as a ticket instead of being elected on separate ballots centerpiece of amendment however was removal of restriction on governors from succeeding themselves in office state constitution had previously barred incumbent from seeking a second consecutive term under new amendment sitting governor would be allowed to succeed himself once succession amendments had been proposed and defeated during administrations of john y brown jr and wallace wilkinson but jones was able to see it passed because unlike brown and wilkinson he was willing to exempt present incumbents including himself from succession provision separate legislation passed during jones term required a runoff election if no gubernatorial candidate won a majority in his or her party primary each of jones three immediate predecessors would have faced a runoff had this law been in effect during their primaries among jones other accomplishments were passage of a mandatory seat belt law an increase in funding
