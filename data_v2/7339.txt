rhodocene formally known as bis e5 cyclopentadienyl rhodium ii is a chemical compound with formula rh c5h5 2 each molecule contains an atom of rhodium bound between two planar aromatic systems of five carbon atoms known as cyclopentadienyl rings in a sandwich arrangement it is an organometallic compound as it has haptic covalent rhodium carbon bonds rh c5h5 2 radical is found above 150 degc or when trapped by cooling to liquid nitrogen temperatures 196 degc at room temperature pairs of these radicals join via their cyclopentadienyl rings to form a dimer a yellow solid history of organometallic chemistry includes 19th century discoveries of zeise s salt and nickel tetracarbonyl these compounds posed a challenge to chemists as compounds did not fit with existing chemical bonding models a further challenge arose with discovery of ferrocene iron analogue of rhodocene and first of class of compounds now known as metallocenes ferrocene was found to be unusually chemically stable as were analogous chemical structures including rhodocenium unipositive cation of rhodocene and its cobalt and iridium counterparts study of organometallic species including these ultimately led to development of new bonding models that explained their formation and stability work on sandwich compounds including rhodocenium rhodocene system earned geoffrey wilkinson and ernst otto fischer 1973 nobel prize for chemistry owing to their stability and relative ease of preparation rhodocenium salts are usual starting material for preparing rhodocene and substituted rhodocenes all of which are unstable original synthesis used a cyclopentadienyl anion and tris acetylacetonato rhodium iii numerous other approaches have since been reported including gas phase redox transmetalation and using half sandwich precursors octaphenylrhodocene a derivative with eight phenyl groups attached was first substituted rhodocene to be isolated at room temperature though it decomposes rapidly in air x ray crystallography confirmed that octaphenylrhodocene has a sandwich structure with a staggered conformation unlike cobaltocene which has become a useful one electron reducing agent in research no rhodocene derivative yet discovered is stable enough for such applications biomedical researchers have examined applications of rhodium compounds and their derivatives in medicine and reported one potential application for a rhodocene derivative as a radiopharmaceutical to treat small cancers rhodocene derivatives are used to synthesise linked metallocenes so that metal metal interactions can be studied potential applications of these derivatives include molecular electronics and research into mechanisms of catalysis value of rhodocenes tends to be in insights they provide into bonding and dynamics of novel chemical systems rather than their applications history thumb left space filling model of e2 c2h4 ptcl3 anion of zeise s salt based on x ray crystallographic data discoveries in organometallic chemistry have led to important insights into chemical bonding zeise s salt k ptcl3 c2h4 h2o was reported in 1831 and mond s discovery of ni co 4 occurred in 1888 each contained a bond between a metal centre and small molecule ethylene in case of zeise s salt and carbon monoxide in case of nickel tetracarbonyl space filling model of anion of zeise s salt image at left shows direct bonding between platinum metal centre shown in blue and carbon atoms shown in black of ethylene ligand such metal carbon bonds are defining characteristic of organometallic species bonding models were unable to explain nature of such metal alkene bonds until dewar chatt duncanson model was proposed in 1950s original formulation covered only metal alkene bonds but model was expanded over time to cover systems like metal carbonyls including ni co 4 where p backbonding is important ferrocene fe c5h5 2 was first synthesised in 1951 during an attempt to prepare by oxidative dimerization of cyclopentadiene resultant product was found to have molecular formula and reported to exhibit remarkable stability discovery sparked substantial interest in field of organometallic chemistry in part because structure proposed by and shown at right was inconsistent with then existing bonding models and did not explain its unexpected stability consequently initial challenge was to definitively determine structure of ferrocene in hope that its bonding and properties would then be understood sandwich structure was deduced and reported independently by three groups in 1952 robert burns woodward and geoffrey wilkinson investigated reactivity in order to determine structure and demonstrated that ferrocene undergoes similar reactions to a typical aromatic molecule such as benzene ernst otto fischer deduced sandwich structure and also began synthesising other metallocenes including cobaltocene eiland and provided x ray crystallographic confirmation of sandwich structure applying valence bond theory to ferrocene by considering an fe2 centre and two cyclopentadienide anions c5h5 which are known to be aromatic according to huckel s rule and hence highly stable allowed correct prediction of geometry of molecule once molecular orbital theory was successfully applied reasons for ferrocene s remarkable stability became clear properties of cobaltocene reported by wilkinson and fischer demonstrated that unipositive cobalticinium cation co c5h5 2 exhibited stability similar to that of ferrocene itself this observation is not unexpected given that cobalticinium cation and ferrocene are isoelectronic although bonding was not understood at time nevertheless observation led wilkinson and f albert cotton to attempt synthesis of rhodocenium and iridocenium salts they reported synthesis of numerous rhodocenium salts including those containing tribromide rh c5h5 2 perchlorate rh c5h5 2 and rh c5h5 2 cr 4 nh3 2 h2o anions and found that addition of produced a compound of composition rh c5h5 2 n 2 in each case rhodocenium cation was found to possess high stability wilkinson and fischer went on to share 1973 nobel prize for chemistry for their pioneering work performed independently on chemistry of organometallic so called sandwich compounds stability of metallocenes can be directly compared by looking at reduction potentials of one electron reduction of unipositive cation following data are presented relative to saturated calomel electrode sce in acetonitrile fe c5h5 2 fe c5h5 2 0 38 v co c5h5 2 co c5h5 2 0 94 v rh c5h5 2 rh c5h5 2 1 41 v these data clearly indicate stability of neutral ferrocene and cobaltocenium and rhodocenium cations rhodocene is ca 500 mv more reducing than cobaltocene indicating that it is more readily oxidised and hence less stable an earlier investigation of rhodocenium perchlorate at neutral ph showed a cathodic wave peak at 1 53 v versus sce at dropping mercury electrode corresponding to formation rhodocene in solution but researchers were unable to isolate neutral product from solution in same study attempts to detect iridocene by exposing iridocenium salts to oxidising conditions were unsuccessful even at elevated ph these data are consistent with rhodocene being highly unstable and may indicate that iridocene is even more unstable still speciation 18 electron rule is equivalent of octet rule in main group chemistry and provides a useful guide for predicting stability of organometallic compounds it predicts that organometallic species in which sum of metal valence electrons plus electrons donated by ligand groups total 18 are likely to be stable this helps to explain unusually high stability observed for ferrocene and for cobalticinium and rhodocenium cations all three species have analogous geometries and are isoelectronic 18 valence electron structures instability of rhodocene and cobaltocene are also understandable in terms of 18 electron rule in that both are 19 valence electron structures this explains early difficulties in isolating rhodocene from rhodocenium solutions chemistry of rhodocene is dominated by drive to attain an 18 electron configuration rhodocene exists as rh c5h5 2 a paramagnetic 19 valence electron radical monomer only at or below 196 degc liquid nitrogen temperatures or above 150 degc in gas phase it is this monomeric form that displays typical staggered metallocene sandwich structure at room temperature 25 degc lifetime of monomeric form in acetonitrile is less than two seconds and rhodocene forms rh c5h5 2 2 a diamagnetic 18 valence electron bridged dimeric ansa metallocene structure electron spin resonance esr nuclear magnetic resonance nmr and infrared spectroscopic ir measurements point to presence of an equilibrium monomeric and dimeric forms esr evidence confirms that monomer possesses a high order axis of symmetry cn n 2 with a mirror plane s perpendicular to it as symmetry elements this experimentally demonstrates that monomer does possess typical sandwich structure of a metallocene although interpretation of esr data has been questioned decomposition pathway of monomer has also been studied by mass spectrometry dimerisation is a redox process dimer is a rhodium i species and monomer has a rhodium ii centre rhodium typically occupies oxidation states i or iii in its stable compounds temperature controlled equilibrium between rhodocene and its dimer this dimerisation process has overall effect of decreasing electron count around rhodium centre from 19 to 18 this occurs because oxidative coupling of two cyclopentadienyl ligands produces a new ligand with lower hapticity and which donates fewer electrons to metal centre term hapticity is used to indicate number of carbon or other atoms through which a ligand binds n to a metal centre and is symbolised as en for example ethylene ligand in zeise s salt is bound to platinum centre through both carbon atoms and it hence formally has formula k ptcl3 e2 c2h4 h2o carbonyl ligands in nickel tetracarbonyl are each bound through only a carbon atom and are hence described as ligands but e1 notations are typically omitted in formulae cyclopentadienyl ligands in many metallocene and half sandwich compounds are pentahapto ligands hence formula rh e5 c5h5 2 for rhodocene monomer in rhodocene dimer coupled cyclopentadienyl ligands are 4 electron donors to each rhodium i metal centre in contrast to 6 electron pentahapto cyclopentadienyl donors increased stability of 18 valence electron rhodium i dimer species as compared to 19 valence electron rhodium ii monomer likely explains why monomer is only detected under extreme conditions thumb right e5 c5h5 rh e4 c5h6 an 18 valence electron mixed hapticity rhodocene derivative that can form when rhodocene monomer is generated in protic solutions cotton and wilkinson demonstrated that 18 valence electron rhodium iii rhodocenium cation rh e5 c5h5 2 can be reduced in aqueous solution to monomeric form they were unable to isolate neutral product as not only can it rhodium ii radical monomer can also spontaneously form mixed hapticity stable rhodium i species e5 c5h5 rh e4 c5h6 differences between rhodocene and this derivative are found in two areas 1 one of bound cyclopentadienyl ligands has formally gained a hydrogen atom to become cyclopentadiene which remains bound to metal centre but now as a 4 electron e4 donor 2 rhodium ii metal centre has been reduced to rhodium i these two changes make derivative an 18 valence electron species fischer and colleagues hypothesised that formation of this rhodocene derivative might occur in separate and reduction steps but published no evidence to support this suggestion e4 cyclopentadiene e5 cyclopentadienyl rhodium i resulting compound is an unusual organometallic complex in that it has both a cyclopentadienyl anion and cyclopentadiene itself as ligands it has been shown that this compound can also be prepared by sodium reduction of a rhodocenium solution in aqueous ethanol researchers who made this discovery characterised product as hydride fischer and co workers also studied chemistry of iridocene third transition series analogue of rhodocene and cobaltocene finding chemistry of rhodocene and iridocene are generally similar synthesis of numerous iridocenium salts including tribromide and hexafluorophosphate have been described just as with rhodocene iridocene at room temperature but a monomer form can be detected at low temperatures and in gas phase and ir nmr and esr measurements indicate a chemical equilibrium is present and confirm sandwich structure of iridocene monomer complex e5 c5h5 ir e4 c5h6 analogue of rhodocene derivative reported by fischer has also been studied and demonstrates properties consistent with a greater degree of p backbonding in iridium i systems than is found in analogous cobalt i or rhodium i cases synthesis rhodocenium salts were first reported within two years of discovery of ferrocene these salts were prepared by reacting carbanion grignard reagent bromide with tris acetylacetonato rhodium iii rh acac 3 more recently gas phase rhodocenium cations have been generated by a redox transmetalation reaction of rhodium i ions with ferrocene or rh e5 c5h5 2m m e5 c5h5 2rh m ni or fe modern microwave synthetic methods have

with molten sodium if a rhodocenium containing melt is treated with sodium or potassium metals and then onto a liquid nitrogen cooled cold finger a black polycrystalline material results warming this material to room temperature produces a yellow solid which has been confirmed as rhodocene dimer a similar method can be used to prepare iridocene dimer substituted rhodocenes and rhodocenium salts e5

rapidly cyclic voltammetry has been used to investigate this and similar processes in detail mechanism of reaction has been shown to involve a loss of one electron from pentadienediyl ligand followed by a fast rearrangement with loss of a hydrogen atom to form 1 2 3 tri tert butylrhodocenium cation both tetrafluoroborate and hexafluorophosphate salts of this cation have been structurally

ortep diagram of structure of cation at right it is evident that it possesses typical geometry expected of a rhodocene or rhodocenium cation two cyclopentadienyl rings are close to parallel centroid rh centroid angle is 177 2deg and rhodium centre is slightly closer to substituted cyclopentadienyl ring rh centroid distances are 1 819 a and 1 795 a an observation attributed to greater inductive effect of tert butyl groups on substituted ligand ortep diagram shows that cation adopts an eclipsed conformation in solid state crystal structure of hexafluorophosphate salt shows three crystallographically independent cations one eclipsed one staggered and one which is rotationally disordered this suggests that conformation adopted is dependent on anion present and also that energy

ligand there is somewhat greater variation carbon carbon bond lengths vary between 1 39 a and 1 48 a internal bond angles vary between and and rhodium carbon bond lengths vary between 2 14 a and 2 20 a greater variation in substituted ligand is attributed to distortions necessary to relieve steric strain imposed by neighbouring tert butyl substituents despite these variations data demonstrate that substituted cyclopentadienyl is also e5 coordinated stability of metallocenes changes with ring substitution comparing reduction potentials of cobaltocenium and cations shows that species is ca 600 mv

reduction potentials is attributed in cobaltocenium system to inductive effect of alkyl groups further stabilising 18 valence electron species a similar effect is seen in rhodocenium data shown above again consistent with inductive effects in substituted iridocenium system cyclic voltammetry investigations shows irreversible reductions at temperatures as low as 60 degc by comparison reduction of corresponding rhodocenes is quasi reversible at room temperature and fully reversible at 35 degc irreversibility of substituted iridocenium reductions is attributed to extremely rapid dimerisation of resulting 19 valence electron species which further illustrates that are less stable than their corresponding rhodocenes penta substituted cyclopentadienyl ligands body of knowledge concerning compounds with penta substituted cyclopentadienyl ligands is extensive with organometallic complexes of pentamethylcyclopentadienyl and ligands being well known substitutions on cyclopentadienyl rings of rhodocenes and rhodocenium salts produce compounds of higher stability as they allow for increased delocalisation of positive charge or electron density and also provide steric hindrance against other species approaching metal centre various mono and di substituted rhodocenium species are known but substantial stabilisation is not achieved without greater substitutions known highly

substituents onto a single cyclopentadienyl ligand structural studies of termetallocene systems have shown they typically adopt an eclipsed double crankshaft geometry taking as an example 1 cobaltocenyl 1 rhodocenylferrocene cation shown above this means that cobaltocenyl and rhodocenyl moieties are eclipsed and thus carbon atoms 1 and 1 on central ferrocene core are as close to vertically aligned as is possible given staggered conformation of cyclopentadienyl rings within each metallocene unit viewed from side on this means termetallocenes resemble down up down pattern of a crankshaft synthesis of this termetallocene involves combining of rhodocenium and cobaltocenium solutions with 1 1 this produces an uncharged intermediate with linked cyclopentadienyl cyclopentadiene
