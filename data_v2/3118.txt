associated with mid 1930s fashion for wearing a white linen waistcoat with a lounge suit while poet and novelist robert graves likened eden s moustache to those of film stars ronald colman william

dutton 1997 anthony eden a life and reputation at pages 461 2 in period between his resignation and his return to government on outbreak of war in 1939 eden and his acolytes who broadly speaking favoured a tougher stance against adolf hitler and benito mussolini were often referred to as glamour boys sir henry channon diary 1 3 november 1938 see also charles williams 2009 harold macmillan

reference with its effeminate or homosexual connotations with unexplained observation that soldiers thought him wet with affectations of manner which they identified with homosexuals it may be that seventy or more years ago eden s alleged feminine side manner of dress habit of calling men my dear a trait detested by us secretary of state john foster dulles in 1950s dislike of men s clubs and cultivated interest in art and flowers encouraged such a view in fact eden s well attested courage including his military cross from first world war and notwithstanding an apparent expression of doubt in 1955 about eden s ability to be an effective prime minister churchill s long standing belief in him see colville 1981 churchillians tend to belie charge of wetness and despite historian michael

junior while at oxford see d j taylor 2007 bright young things there is ample evidence that in addition to being intensely attractive to women eden sometimes pursued his relationships with them to point of recklessness see generally rhodes james 1986 and thorpe 2003 also douglas hurd 2010 choose your weapons british foreign secretary who noted that eden was charming and successful with women and lacked any cohort of male friends either personal or political even his future much younger second wife confided to her friend duff cooper that eden with whom she was not then coupled never stops

whom he closely resembled and with whom his mother was rumoured to have had an affair see e g john 1989 chamberlain and lost peace eden s most recent biographer notes that eden could have inherited his temper and aesthetic sensibilities from either wyndham or sir william eden d r thorpe 2003 eden however butler had a habit of making such observations once asking historian richard thorpe how was

vain about his clothes he merely dressed well as for his homburg which deedes noted that he wore at an angle w f deedes 2004 brief lives his official biographer sir robert rhodes james wrote that to him it was just a hat robert rhodes james 1986 anthony eden there was for example a contrast between eden s almost accidental glamour and that of neville chamberlain s father joseph 1836 1914 who as
