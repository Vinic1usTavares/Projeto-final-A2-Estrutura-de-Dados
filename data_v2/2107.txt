other media golden sun was re released for virtual console via wii u eshop in april 2014 gameplay frame left golden suns form of magic psynergy can be used in battle and in dungeons here an ice spell is used to create a navigable path of frozen ice pillars from puddles of water golden sun is a contemporary presentation of traditional role playing video game formula in which player controls a cast of four characters as they journey through a fantasy themed world interact with other characters battle monsters acquire increasingly powerful abilities and equipment and take part in an ongoing narrative although many of player s actions are compulsory golden sun often allows player to visit previous locations and complete certain objectives out of order much of time spent outside of battle takes place in dungeons caves and other locales which often feature puzzles integrated into their layout these puzzles require player to perform a variety of actions such as creating makeshift bridges by pushing logs into rivers or shifting track of a mine cart to gain access to new areas many of these puzzles require use of game s form of magic spells called psynergy this is in contrast to many rpgs which often restrict magic to within battles and post combat healing psynergy however is used for both purposes for example whirlwind spell that damages enemies in battle is also used out of battle to remove overgrown foliage blocking player s path psynergy comes in four elements venus manipulation of rocks and plants mars revolving around fire and heat jupiter based on wind and electricity and mercury concerning water and ice players can return to previous locations in game to finish puzzles which they could not solve earlier because of lack of a specific psynergy spell battle and djinn frame right battles in golden sun have many special effects here a weapon specific attack is unleashed by sword gaia blade golden sun contains both random monster encounters featuring randomly selected enemies and compulsory boss battles that advance story when a battle begins a separate screen is brought up in which player s party faces off against enemy during a battle characters and background rotate to offer a pseudo 3d effect in each battle players must defeat enemies while keeping their own party alive through items and psynergy that restore life and supplement defense player receives a game over if each character s hit points are reduced to zero if this happens player will incur a monetary penalty and party will be returned to sanctum in last visited town after winning a battle players receive experience points coins and occasionally items golden sun also features an optional battling mode accessible from menu screen in this mode players can enter a team from their saved game files into an arena environment where they battle increasingly difficult cpu controlled enemies additionally players can select three of their four characters to fight another player s three character team player does not receive any reward or punishment for participating in these battles one of most distinctive features of golden sun is collection and manipulation of creatures called djinn djinn are scattered in hiding throughout game once found they can be allocated to each character though some may require player to first defeat them in battle they form basis of game s statistic enhancement as well as system that dictates character s psynergy capabilities attaching different djinn to different characters modifies that character s character class subsequently modifying hit points psynergy points and other statistics as well as determining what psynergy character is able to perform djinn can either be set to a player or put on standby when a djinni is set it gives bonuses to stats of character it is on and may change character s class or usable psynergy set djinn also have abilities that can be used in battle to attack heal or otherwise affect battle however using these abilities causes djinn to move from being set to being in standby mode there are seven djinn of each element and these djinn can be mixed and matched to four characters allowing a large array of possible class setups and a variety of combat options in combat a djinni has several uses each set djinni has a special ability which can be invoked during combat by character it is attached to which can include enhanced elemental attacks buffing spells healing restoration spells and other effects after a successful invoke djinni shifts to standby mode until it is set on character again while in standby djinn do not contribute to statistics or change character classes but can be used for summon spells which are attacks where player summons a powerful elemental monster to inflict damage on every enemy and increases respective characters affinity for that element for a duration this is game s most powerful method of attack but required switch to standby mode is a risky trade off djinn used for summoning must rest for several turns before reverting to set position during which time they cannot bolster statistics or classes there are sixteen summon sequences in golden sun four for each element and each summon sequence requires between one and four djinn of same element on standby synopsis setting golden sun takes place in fantasy world of weyard a massive earth like environment with several major continents and oceans it is revealed in game s sequel golden sun lost age that setting is based on flat earth concept it is a flat roughly elliptical plane whose oceans perpetually spill off edge of world s perimeter into an endless abyss male villager huge waterfall at edge of world is known as gaia falls old male villager well at least gaia falls will put an end to a few silly arguments after all if it s got an edge and you can fall off it world is clearly flat plot progression of golden sun spans two largest continents in world s central region angara to north and to south weyard is governed by mythological concept of classical elements all matter on weyard consists of any combination of four base elements venus mars mercury and jupiter or earth fire water and wind respectively these four building blocks of reality can be manipulated by omnipotent force of alchemy which reigned supreme in world s ancient past alchemy was sealed away in past however and world in present age has become seemingly devoid of this power however in various places throughout world people demonstrate an aptitude to manipulate one of elements through a form of magic called psynergy these wielders of psynergy called adepts usually refrain from displaying their talents to outsiders characters player controls four characters in golden sun isaac game s silent protagonist is a seventeen year old venus adept from village of vale garet a seventeen year old mars adept also from vale is isaac s closest companion ivan is a fifteen year old jupiter adept who has lived with a famous merchant in town of kalay his entire life mia a sixteen year old mercury adept from wintry town of is a gentle healer from a heritage of mercury adept clansmen a fifth character seen and playable in game s exposition sequence is 17 year old mars adept jenna another childhood friend to isaac primary antagonists of game are saturos and menardi a pair of immensely powerful and talented mars adepts of a foreign race hailing from a town in weyard s frigid north their goal is to restore alchemy to world and they are assisted by powerful and mysterious mercury adept alex who is of same heritage as mia and jenna s older brother 18 year old venus adept felix who is indebted to saturos for saving felix from death plot prevalent force of alchemy in weyard s ancient past enabled development of great civilizations however this thriving period eventually gave way to a worldwide conflict that subsided only with sealing away of alchemy in game text ages ago or so stories tell power of alchemy ruled over world of weyard alchemy wrought base elements of humanity into thriving civilizations like lead into gold but in time man s dreams gave birth to untold strife dreams of endless riches of eternal life of dominion over all that lived dreams of conquest and war keys to unlocking alchemy four elemental stars which hold pure power of four elements are hidden within mountain shrine mt aleph which in turn is guarded by town of vale at mountain s base in game s prologue saturos and menardi with help from a raiding party storm mt aleph with intention to seize elemental stars for themselves they fail to solve riddles guarding stars and are driven away by mountain s trap a magically generated thunderstorm and rock slide menardi how could we have anticipated sol sanctum would unleash such fury saturos it s a miracle that even two of us were spared menardi that switch it must have been a trap saturos but to think it could conjure up a storm this powerful menardi another demonstration of awesome powers of alchemy saturos regardless we must not fail next time we challenge sol sanctum three years later isaac garet and jenna join their

elemental stars to contain it magma flows freely once again and this chamber is collapsing but before escaping they capture jenna and kraden as eventual bargaining chips saturos forget about them they won t make it out alive menardi but saturos there s still a chance they might survive saturos anything is possible so what do you suggest we do alex we take this jenna with us if they survive they will want her back and if they want her back they will bring us star guardian of mt aleph wise one appears before isaac and garet and instructs them to prevent saturos group from casting elemental stars into their respective elemental lighthouses across weyard if this happens alchemy will be restored and period of instability will begin anew wise one world will be exposed to threat of alchemy garet alchemy a threat wise one it can be a dangerous power if it is misused if elemental stars ignite flames of four lighthouses that power will be released as long as four lighthouses remain unlit

eighteen months developing golden sun which is considered a long time for a handheld video game finished product was described as a testament to positive results a long development cycle can bring to a game in august 2000 camelot showed an early but playable version at nintendo spaceworld expo in japan north american reviewers received game a few weeks before release and ign noted that experience of developing shining force for sega helped camelot develop a gripping rpg for handheld camelot originally planned to create a single title instead of a series and in extremely early stages of their project they had created a game design document for one golden sun game to be on nintendo 64 console when it became apparent n64 was to be superseded by nintendo gamecube camelot shifted their focus to making a game on handheld game boy advance golden sun was still intended to be a single game but due to hardware limitations of putting game on a single game boy advance cartridge and developers own desire for what they wanted to do with game it was expanded to become two successive games golden sun and golden sun lost age scenario writer hiroyuki takahashi and director shugo takahashi had previously designed shining force iii where story involved playing through perspectives of both good and bad characters thinking that it was an effective way of conveying full story of a fictional game world they incorporated elements of this storytelling methodology into two game setup of golden sun series having player control good guys in golden sun and some of antagonists in lost age

limitations of its 32 bit cartridge game s graphical quality was still extremely high gamespot wrote that golden sun is a throwback to some of snes s best complaints generally focused on a perceived overuse of text dialogue in game s cutscenes particularly during prologue section some faulted game for relying on typical random battle encounter mechanics present in many other role playing games g4 tv stated it s best original gba rpg to date while gamepro called it a huge fantastic creative and wickedly fun rpg that doesn t seem to care that it s just on a gba game informer called golden sun a
