walking and a day in death brief that executive producer russell t davies gave to writer helen raynor included terms sontarans military and martha s back this episode continues pattern of having monsters from classic series return in new one davies commented that sontarans were always on his list of villains to resurrect time and location of episode was chosen because every previous sontaran story except for invasion of time 1978 was set on earth writing martha s departure allowed davies to change character s personality in her reappearance she is more mature and equal to doctor as opposed to third series in which she was in love with him writers debated several aspects of her character her status and reaction to donna in particular raynor elected to emphasise martha s medical career over her military career and avoided a handbags at dawn scenario because she felt it would rehash rose tyler s billie piper initial opinion of former companion sarah jane smith elisabeth sladen from second series episode school reunion episode is first major appearance of unit since show s revival their name has changed from united nations intelligence taskforce to unified intelligence taskforce at request of united nations who cited political climate and potential brand confusion as reasons for new acronym was coined by davies after several meetings among scriptwriters unit privates gray and wilson were specifically written as alien fodder episode refers to inconsistencies in dating unit stories when doctor is unsure whether he worked for unit in 1970s or 1980s raynor initially envisioned poisonous gas would be emitted by factories but changed it in later drafts to cars for several reasons episode would provide social commentary and idea of an evil satnav system was much more and irresistible davies thought concept was so very doctor who because series was produced out of order atmos subplot was seeded in previous episode partners in crime fifteenth broken moon of medusa cascade is also mentioned medusa cascade was previously mentioned in last of time lords partners in crime and in fires of pompeii in episode a system installed in a unit jeep explodes originally raynor wanted it to be a large explosion but reduced explosion to several sparks to reduce costs and to lampoon an action movie cliche episode like aliens of london and lazarus experiment properly introduces lead companion s family unlike tyler or jones families both sylvia noble and wilfred mott had met doctor before in runaway bride and voyage of damned respectively providing raynor with an additional subplot expository dialogue explains mott s absence from runaway bride by character having had spanish flu wilfred s positive opinion of doctor is different from sylvia s who according to tennant joined a long line of mothers that don t quite get doctor davies had wanted a family member who trusted doctor since show s revival filming opening scene which depicts system driving reporter jo nakashima into canal was filmed at cardiff s docks scene was first time a car cannon had been used since 2005 and was required to be completed in one shot car fired into canal was removed immediately afterwards to clear shipping route scenes at rattigan academy were filmed at margam country park port talbot from 23 to 26 october 2007 london skyline and gas were added in post production by mill when interviewed on friday night with jonathan ross catherine tate stated that she had been filming alongside ten actors playing sontarans for two weeks before she realised that there were actors inside sontaran costumes she had assumed sontarans ran on electricity it was not until an actor removed his helmet to reveal his real face that she realised her mistake she stated she was freaked out by this and said she nearly died friday night with jonathan ross episode broadcast friday 4 april 2008 despite sontarans clone culture being asserted in classic series sontaran strategem is first episode to depict cloning process originally all of factory workers were to be clones but raynor reduced this to only martha to solve continuity problems with second part template clone was portrayed by mears who wore a prosthetic mask that took longer to apply than any he had previously worn scenes involving cloning tank were filmed in a welsh shampoo factory and reused a prop from fires of pompeii as tank which contained clone davies and agyeman enjoyed scenes set in cloning room agyeman liked playing an evil companion who she and davies felt made real martha warmer and davies thought privates gray and harris discovering tank in a darkened room was classic doctor who broadcast and reception broadcast and ratings sontaran strategem was most watched programme in its timeslot with 7 06 million viewers episode was second most watched programme of day beaten by britain s got talent and was seventeenth most watched programme of week episode s appreciation index was 87 considered excellent highest figure recorded on its airdate critical reception mark wright of stage commented overall that episode was about as deliciously old fashioned as new who gets stating that script was a deftly simple premise that makes you wonder why you didn t think of it yourself and that tate s character moved away from caricature in runaway bride wright also praised agyeman for effortlessly portraying martha and her evil cloned counterpart a fan of sontarans wright reacted positively to their return and redesign ben rawson jones of digital spy rated episode four stars out of five rawson jones felt narrative was well plotted and paced and felt helen raynor s writing had improved from daleks in manhattan rawson jones also praised reintroductions of unit martha donna s family and sontarans interaction between donna and martha and christopher ryan s portrayal of staal but felt s voice was distinctly lacklustre episode s direction by douglas mackinnon also received criticism particularly scenes in clone room in end rawson jones felt that first part s effectiveness lies on how much viewers wish to tune in to see poison sky matt wales of ign rated episode a good 7 9 out of 10 stating that despite episode s premise it came perilously close to greatness and praised raynor s crackling script which graciously walked tightrope between balls out farce and affectionate sci fi pastiche wales noted that tennant and tate relished perpetual swings from square jawed serious to faintly sadistic subversion to mess with audience expectations ryan s performance as staal was again praised but wales felt agyeman still displayed charisma and range of a dead fish despite martha s transformation from lovesick sap to ripley esque super soldier wales summed up that episode did pretty much everything a two part opener should swiftly shifting pieces into place for next week s inevitably bombastic showdown alan stanley bear of airlock alpha called sontaran strategem an exciting and nostalgic adventure and said that episode lives up to show s reputation for transforming a normal object in this case car to a global killer bear praised episode for donna and martha s introduction being opposite to rose tyler and sarah jane smith s in school reunion for providing a human element in subplot where donna visits her grandfather and for episode s cliffhanger however bear wrote that it took too long to get to point and criticized bland sontaran dialogue and cliched simplicity of mind control which he felt reduced what could have been a fantastically intricate story piece into saturday morning cartoon material john beresford of tv scoop thought episode lived up to many of his expectations with sharp dialogue and some humour a well plotted story and a good pace overall with a heap of action despite episode s slow start beresford also praised reintroduction of unit from old tired unit to a newly revamped and spiffy unit with lots of cool gadgets doctor s meeting with rattigan calling scene an inspired piece of writing and episode s cliffhanger calling it best yet he also believed atmos idea worked well only weak spot beresford noted was that sontarans appeared to have been softened from their previous appearance stating that staal would shoot first and ask questions later references external links category tenth doctor
