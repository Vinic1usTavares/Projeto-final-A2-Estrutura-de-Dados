thumb right 300px construction of covering and tunnels 1870 covering of senne was covering and later diverting of main river of brussels and construction of public buildings and major boulevards in its place carried out between 1867 and 1871 it is one of defining events in history of brussels senne french dutch was historically main waterway of brussels but it became more polluted and less navigable as city grew by second half of 19th century it had become a serious health hazard and was filled with pollution garbage and decaying organic matter it flooded frequently inundating lower town and working class neighbourhoods which surrounded it numerous proposals were made to remedy this problem and in 1865 mayor of brussels jules anspach selected a design by architect leon suys to cover river and build a series of grand boulevards and public buildings project faced fierce opposition and controversy mostly due to its cost and need for expropriation and demolition of working class neighbourhoods construction was contracted to a british company but control was returned to government following an embezzlement scandal this delayed project but it was still completed in 1871 its completion allowed construction of modern buildings and boulevards which are central to downtown brussels today in 1930s plans were made to cover senne along its entire course within greater brussels area which had grown significantly since covering of 19th century by 1955 course of senne was changed to downtown s peripheral boulevards in 1976 disused tunnels were converted into north south axis of brussels underground tram system premetro actual purification of waste water from brussels capital region was not completed until march 2007 when two treatment stations were built thus finally cleansing senne after centuries of problems senne in brussels thumb map of brussels in 1837 north is roughly to right at beginning of 19th century brussels was still in many ways a medieval city royal quarter in upper town inhabited mainly by nobility and richer members of bourgeoisie was upscale and modern rest of city however in particular lower town located in western half of pentagon was densely populated and industrial characterised by an illogical street layout back alleys narrow streets and numerous dead ends senne river split into two branches at anderlecht penetrating pentagon former site of second city walls in two places main and more southern arm entered through greater sluice gate near today s brussels south railway station smaller northerly arm entered through lesser sluice gate near today s ninove gate courses of two traced a meandering path through city centre forming several islands largest of which was known as saint gaugericus island two branches met up on north side of saint gaugericus island exiting pentagon one block east of antwerp gate a man made arm called lesser senne continued on borders of pentagon in former moat outside sluice gates it followed charleroi canal before rejoining main part of senne north of city thumb left many unsanitary and unsafe wooden add ons projected over river in lower town senne had long since lost its usefulness as a navigable waterway being replaced by canals including charleroi canal senne had always been a river with an inconsistent flow often overflowing its banks in times of heavy rainfall even sluice gates were unable to regulate flow of river which was often swollen by numerous creeks flowing down from higher ground making matters worse within city river s bed was narrowed by encroaching construction due to demographic pressure supports of numerous unregulated bridges impeded water flow and caused water levels to rise even further exacerbated by a riverbed of accumulated waste during dry periods however much of senne s water was diverted for needs of populace of city as well as to maintain water level in charleroi canal this left a flow too feeble to evacuate filthy water leaving sewage garbage detritus and industrial waste that had been dumped into river to accumulate in stagnant water senne which a witness in 1853 described as most nauseous little river in world had become an open air sewer spreading pestilential odours throughout city early in second half of 19th century brussels saw numerous dry periods floods and a cholera epidemic caused as much by river itself as by poverty and lack of hygiene and potable water in lower city this forced governments of province of brabant and city of brussels to act attempts at purification thumb 1837 course of senne superimposed on modern city first studies and propositions to clean up river date back to 1859 and during following years many different commissions of engineers were assigned to examine possible solutions dozens of different ideas were submitted many of which were completely unfeasible several of them proposed diverting large amounts of cleaner water from other rivers upstream to dilute senne while greatly improving drainage system in city other proposals involved diverting main course of senne completely to lesser senne which would then be enlarged and thus more useful for boat traffic and mills others considered any sort of sanitisation impossible and proposed covering senne without greatly changing its course among these was a proposal to double size of underground drainage tunnels creating space for a subterranean railroad tunnel idea was ahead of its time but would be implemented a century later with north south connection municipal council chose proposal by architect leon suys submitted in 1865 which had backing of mayor jules anspach plan involved suppressing secondary arm of senne by closing lesser sluice gate main branch would be channeled into tunnels to be placed directly beneath a long straight boulevard stretching from greater sluice gate to augustinian church now de brouckere square before splitting into two one branch was to head towards brussels north railway station and present day rogier square other towards antwerp gate thus forming a long narrow y shape map of suys proposal city archives of brussels p p 1 169 anspach s backing of suys proposal was a calculated decision as he had radical plans to transform city anspach saw proposal as an unexpected boon as it allowed him to accomplish several of his goals at once it had long been his ambition to transform impoverished lower city into a centre of business and commerce suitable for a modern capital belgium had declared its independence in 1830 with brussels its capital he wanted to attract middle class most of whom had left dingy downtown for cleaner suburbs including leopold quarter now often called european quarter and avenue louise causing a large loss in tax revenue for city elimination of numerous alleys and dead ends in lower town in favour of a large straight wide open air boulevard linking two rapidly growing train stations seemed both a necessity and an opportunity to beautify city and improve both traffic circulation and hygiene controversy and opposition thumb upright jules anspach and senne editorial cartoon from 1868 belgian parliament had recently passed a law allowing expropriation of privately owned land by government when land was to be used for greater good this could be done even if project was still speculative in nature and allowed for more land to be taken beyond what was strictly necessary for a project city expropriated large swathes of lower town counting on reselling land for a profit which after project was complete would be on a grandiose modern boulevard in an upper class neighbourhood selling of land after completion of project was seen as a way of financing project itself that poorer residents of lower town were forced away into other already overcrowded districts or into surrounding suburbs did not trouble upper classes very much as displaced residents did not pay taxes or have right to vote even after suys proposal was officially adopted anspach faced strong opposition to project this opposition came first from engineers who felt that covering was incompatible with brussels s geology would accumulate potentially dangerous gases and would not be able to handle enough water to prevent floods others opposed to project complained about high taxes resulting from its high cost poor compensation for seized property and lack of public input into project press accused anspach of being responsible for demolishing brussels old town and published numerous caricatures mocking him a liberal anspach feared weakness and rigidity of government and therefore gave work of covering river to a private british company belgian public works company english name was used which was created for task however partway through construction it was forced to relinquish control to city of brussels after an embezzlement scandal in which a company director allegedly attempted to steal 2 5 million francs from company anspach only barely kept his office in 1869 by elections construction thumb beginning of construction in 1867 excluding important sewers built upriver and downriver in adjacent suburbs covered section itself was to be in length constructed from bricks covering was to consist of two parallel wide tunnels and a set of two lateral drainage pipes each taking in waste water from its respective side of street contract was signed on 15 june 1866 and expropriation of first 1 100 houses was completed in a few months work began on 13 february 1867 there were several technical difficulties that delayed covering many of which were due to geology of brussels though they were not as bad as some engineers had forecast embezzlement scandal also caused a significant delay in construction largely due to change in control project was completed in 1871 with municipal council ceremonially opening reconstructed sluice gates on 30th november new central boulevards series of boulevards created by project hainaut boulevard now maurice lemonnier boulevard central boulevard now anspach boulevard north boulevard now adolphe max boulevard and senne boulevard now emile boulevard were progressively opened to traffic from 1871 to 1873 thumb upright left house of cats by architect henri beyaert which won first prize in 1876 contest opening of these new routes offered a more efficient way to get into lower town than cramped streets of and rue neuve and helped revitalise lower quarters of town in order to accomplish this revitalisation and attract investment public buildings were constructed as part of leon suys project including brussels stock exchange vast a good example of metallic architecture replaced unhygienic open air markets though it was torn down in 1958 monumental fountain which was to break monotony of boulevards at square was abandoned for budgetary reasons construction of private buildings on boulevards and surrounding areas took place later middle class continued to prefer living in new suburbs rather than cramped areas of city centre high prices of land expected to finance part of construction costs and high rents were not within means of lower classes life in apartments was no longer desirable for residents of brussels who preferred to live in single family homes buildings constructed by private citizens had difficulty finding buyers to give builders an incentive to create elaborate and appealing facades on their works an architecture competition was arranged in which twenty buildings built before 1 january 1876 would win prizes first prize of 20 000 francs was awarded to henri beyaert who designed hier ist in den kater en de kat loosely house of cats on north boulevard nonetheless it took another 20 years until 1895 for buildings to solidly line boulevards former augustinian church built at beginning of 17th century in baroque style was only remaining part of a convent destroyed in 1796 by french revolutionaries after having been used as a protestant church from 1815 to 1830 it subsequently saw use as a concert hall a commercial exchange and a post office at centre of de brouckere square church s facade was intended by leon suys to be one of focal points of new boulevards work to cover river which nearly surrounded church preserved integrity of building at great trouble and expense but church was finally demolished in 1893 its style no longer popular with people and its presence unsuitable for area church was replaced by a fountain dedicated to memory of jules anspach its facade however was preserved being disassembled and moved to serve as facade for church of holy trinity in municipality of ixelles diversion and treatment thumb senne leaving its northern treatment plant although original covering of senne resolved sanitary problems and flooding in brussels old city this was not case in peripheral areas senne was still very polluted despite work done to sewers and in canal drainage into canal was not able to completely stop floods that regularly affected certain outer areas of city in 1930 a group was created whose objective was to channel senne into tunnels for nearly its entire course through brussels metropolitan area this was done in order to expand benefits that covering achieved in old city in centre course of river was to be changed using a diversion from central boulevards to peripheral boulevards of small ring project delayed by war and work being done on north south connection was only finished in 1955 disused channels of central boulevards later facilitated construction of north south line of premetro which opened in 1976 conversion of existing tunnels to metro tunnels ensured that there was minimal disruption on surface some of former pipes also served as storm drains anspach fountain was transferred to actual purification of waste water from brussels capital region was not completed until 21st century when two purification stations were built south station treats refuse water from 360 000 inhabitants which is about one third of polluted water and lies on border of anderlecht and forest north station completed in march 2007 is located near border of brussels capital region between senne and charleroi canal near buda bridge a portion of cost was footed by flemish government as 7 of adjacent municipalities lie within flemish region this station is capable of treating water of 1 100 000 inhabitants and should finally be capable of fully purifying senne which had long caused much of pollution of scheldt river see also haussmann s
