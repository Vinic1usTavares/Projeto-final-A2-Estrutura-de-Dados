middleton described it as by far best thing we ve done an analogy that would be often made when comparing album to its predecessor parables for wooden ears middleton praised album because band knew how they wanted record to sound before they began to record he also described it as most concise continuation of who we are down on record lead singer bernard fanning noted that another important element of album was that there was more space in songs it wasn t overcrowded however fanning commented that powderfinger had not intended to greatly change their sound in creating double allergic instead change in sound came as a natural progression guitarist ian haug agreed stating music was more melodic and sort of simpler without so many different time signatures and things rolling stone author tracey grimson also commented on this stating that powderfinger have become practical advocates of space and lauding their acknowledgment that absence of sound can be lush evocative she noted that even in rockers on album songs like pick you up and skinny jean band were still able to pull back and give songs additional space powderfinger spent less money producing double allergic than on their previous works previously band had worked with tony cohen whom fanning stated was expensive due to his success in industry for double allergic band chose tim whitten a less well known producer and because band knew what they intended to do as they entered studio they managed to spend less despite improved sound middleton commented on whitten s capabilities in recording studio saying he s what a band looks for in a producer engineer because he s got his own ideas but stating that whitten would also listen to and appreciate band s ideas album and single releases double allergic was
