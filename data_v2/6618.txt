associates his law practice had many influential clients including lord braco and sons of lord fraser of lovat pitfour was one of 15 advocates acting in a case raised by alexander fraser against lord fraser claiming liferents to lovat estates eventually a compromise was reached lovat retained liferents and fraser gained a monetary sum instead as negotiations had taken many hours of legal deliberation over a three year period case proved very profitable for pitfour ferguson was a jacobite records of spalding club include a soldier s letter which indicates it is likely ferguson was willing to offer refuge to jacobites who participated in battle of culloden jacobite rebels captured from throughout scotland were taken to stand trial at carlisle castle in 1746 ferguson and fellow advocate alexander lockhart argued in their defence prosecutors showed little mercy calling for rebels to be executed by hanging since prosecution assumed anyone dressed in tartan was guilty ferguson and lockhart had their servants dress in tartan and appear along with other defendants they called each other to stand to testify as to whereabouts of servants and proved that despite their tartan dress defendants could not have taken part in rebellion many were found guilty but tactic succeeded as some of accused were acquitted including laird of a kinsman of ferguson 1773 papers of george iii contain details of pitfour accompanying lord justice clerk thomas miller on northern circuit from end of april until 20 may among cases heard were trial of a servant accused of murdering another

highway robbery some of gang was caught but mcintosh remained an outlaw lord pitfour was widely admired and often dined with fellow lawyer and biographer james boswell who declared pitfour to be one of greatest scottish lawyers this was endorsed by diarist john ramsay of ochtertyre 1736 1814 who remarked that pitfour was one of a small number of barristers who he found satisfying to hear speak pitfour practised law in edinburgh at height of scottish enlightenment and was a member of poker club lord pitfour is described as being good humoured but of a somewhat awkward manner and small in stature his voice was shrill and he had poor eyesight he was shrewd kind and sympathetic which put him at odds with some of his colleagues on bench serving at same time as lord who had a reputation for handing down severe sentences pitfour was viewed as indecisive and too lenient his desire to be fair and reach compromise had stood him in good stead as an advocate but as a judge these characteristics drew criticism from his contemporaries lord kames was critical of him maintaining that pitfour did not want anyone to be hanged writing in 2008 local historian alex buchan speculated that pitfour s hard life travelling around scotland took too much of a toll on him leading to a rapid decline in his health and ability at 64 years of age at his appointment as a judge he was likely too old to be effective pitfour thumb 300px a side view of pitfour house c late 19th century ferguson inherited expansive pitfour estate on death of his father first laird in 1734 second laird

uncultivated land addition of this extensive property made pitfour largest estate in area stretching over from buchanhaven in peterhead and along course of river ugie to maud pitfour had handled earl marischal s complex legal requirements over a lengthy period but purchase of land led to ill feeling and insinuations against pitfour of underhand dealing from other landowners he never regained
