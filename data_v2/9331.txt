dreamtime concerning boundary between wilderness and civilization is an anthropological and philosophical study of altered states of consciousness found in shamanism and european witchcraft written by german anthropologist hans peter duerr first published in 1978 by und under german title of traumzeit uber die grenze zwischen und it was translated into english by hungarian american anthropologist felicitas goodman and published by basil blackwell in 1985 dreamtime opens with premise that many of those accused of witchcraft in early modern christendom had been undergoing visionary journeys with aid of a hallucinogenic salve which was suppressed by christian authorities duerr argues that this salve had been a part of nocturnal visionary traditions associated with goddess diana and he attempts to trace their origins back to ancient world before looking at goddesses associated with wilderness and arguing that in various goddess centred cultures cave represented a symbolic vagina and was used for birth rituals later in book duerr looks at ethnographic examples of shamanism focusing on shamanic use of hallucinogens and experiences which such entheogens induce he argues that archaic cultures recognize that a human can only truly understand themselves if they go to mental boundary between civilization and wilderness and that it is this altered state of consciousness which both shaman and european witch reached in their visionary journeys believing that modern western worldview failed to understand this process duerr criticizes work of those anthropologists and scientists who had tried to understand archaic society through a western rationalist framework instead advocating a return to archaic modes of thought dreamtime was a controversial best seller upon its initial release in west germany and inspired academic debate leading to publication of der glaserne zaun 1983 an anthology discussing duerr s ideas edited by rolf gehlen and bernd wolf reviews in anglophone world were mixed with critics describing dreamtime as unoriginal factually inaccurate and difficult to read but also innovative and well referenced background according to his own account idea for writing dreamtime first came to duerr when he was in new mexico in summer of 1963 he had spent day visiting cliff dwellings and was returning to albuquerque greyhound bus station where he met a native yerbatero herbalist buying a cup of coffee and struck up a conversation duerr asked yerbatero if he could help him find a native family living in one of pueblos north of santa fe with whom he could stay to conduct anthropological research into nightly dances that took place in subterranean kivas native told him that if he wanted to find out about dances in kivas then he should go to pueblo of our lady of angels and study at university of california duerr would later relate that this blow to his vanity first provided him with idea of writing dreamtime duerr 1985 p x duerr presented some of his ideas in a lecture given to members of a philosophy seminar at university of constance in autumn of 1975 which he repeated at a housewives club in mannheim he was greatly encouraged in his preparation for work by noted english anthropologist 1902 1973 who died before its publication duerr 1985 p xi anthropologist rik pinxten noted that dreamtime was published at a time of new advancements in german anthropology after a period of intellectual stagnation during preceding decades 1970s saw rising popularity of discipline with a dramatic increase in number of students enrolling to study ethnography at west german universities it also saw increasing interdisciplinary collaboration between anthropologists and philosophers with several scholars arguing that ethnography was relevant to philosophical analysis this increase in philosophical discussion within german anthropology was largely rejected by official academic representatives of discipline who believed that it exceeded limits of scientific respectability but it was nonetheless adopted by duerr in dreamtime pinxten 1992 p 194 publication when book was first published in west germany in 1978 it sold hundreds of thousands of copies becoming a bestseller and arousing both popular and academic interest stewart 1987 p 251 according to american indologist wendy doniger o flaherty dreamtime became canon of a cult for intellectual former hippies dealing as it did with issues such as drugs sex anarchy and lurid religions british anthropologist charles stewart noted that it was popular among members of german subculture and for this reason believed that book could tell anthropologists a considerable amount about strivings of modern german society book was translated into english by felicitas d goodman 1914 2005 a hungarian born american anthropologist who had written several books of her own on subject of religious trance journeys duerr noted that of all translators he had worked with goodman showed greatest dedication to her work duerr 1985 p ix for english language translation duerr included a new preface in which he noted that he had refused to make changes to original text despite insistence of publisher explaining his reasoning he remarked that a book is not a dishwasher where it is advisable to change malfunctioning parts he accepted that book had faults and expressed his hope that reader would forgive him for leaving them intact in english translation duerr 1985 p viii in english language edition main text takes up first 133 pages of book while footnotes and bibliography occupy next 324 pages synopsis and arguments duerr examines use of flying ointment in early modern witchcraft and draws ethnographic parallels from accused witches among shona people of rhodesia and witchcraft beliefs of normanby archipelago in south pacific he concludes that some of those accused of witchcraft in early modern europe had applied hallucinogenic ointments to their skin to make themselves believe that they were flying to so called witches sabbat a ritual gathering of witches noting apparent lack of recipes for this salve in witch trial records duerr posits view that christian authorities intentionally covered up existence of hallucinogenic ointments fearing that their existence would cast doubt on various aspects of witches accounts including their alleged encounters with devil duerr maintains that this knowledge might have ultimately led people to cast doubt on even devil a key aspect of early modern christian cosmology although use of hallucinogenic ointments was not a factor in every witch trial it was more prevalent in earlier trials of alpine region duerr connects its use to nocturnal visionary traditions associated with goddess diana in that region duerr 1985 pp 1 11 duerr then looks into origins of nocturnal visionary traditions beginning with ancient greek deity artemis and her influence on roman goddess diana in alpine lore diana survived christianization as leader of nocturnal procession duerr 1985 pp 12 15 duerr goes further back into palaeolithic where venus figurines are interpreted as a prototype for later greek artemis a goddess who was unrestrained mistress of animals and plants duerr then describes relationship between ancient goddesses and caves as a symbol of female vagina and explores stories involving caves in greek mythology sir gawain and green knight and yakut folklore duerr proposes that association between caves and vagina is global in scope as societies around world use caves in rituals symbolizing birth duerr 1985 pp 16 31 thumb right a woodcut depicting a witches sabbat produced by hans baldung in 1508 duerr included it as tenth plate in dreamtime in midst of a chapter discussing european witch duerr 1985 p 48 various folk traditions across europe are analyzed such as alpine where women broke social conventions by attacking men or engaging in lesbianism duerr compares these traditions to benandanti of early modern friuli and to livonian werewolf viewing them as representing clash between order and chaos duerr 1985 pp 32 39 christian society in late middle ages began to construe witch as a creature inside of society rather than outside it which partly led to witch trials of early modern period duerr argues that societies of european christendom began to increasingly accept female nudity in art and fashion during late middle ages duerr 1985 pp 40 59 examples in historical european folk tradition where criminals have been declared to be outside of law and banished from community are illustrated duerr connects these outsiders to executioners and warriors who were also outside law because they had entered world of dead similarly witches of early modern period also left everyday world and like shamans of siberia experienced their wild or animal aspect in order to understand their human side duerr uses ethnographic examples from around world to show that many cultures have used hallucinogenic substances to reach states of consciousness beyond ordinary societal boundaries duerr 1985 pp 60 69 duerr provides additional ethnographic examples showing how societal rules were reversed at special times of year in shamanic terms societies which espouse an archaic mentality understand who they are by understanding who they are not according to duerr modern societies fail to understand this concept duerr 1985 pp 70 75 datura a plant that contains toxic hallucinogens is discussed plant was introduced to europe in early modern period among people of central mexico shamans have told anthropologists that datura is used by malevolent witches duerr makes note of anthropologists who have undertaken shamanic experiences with people they are studying such as barbara and carlos castenada but argues that such ethnographers have failed to truly understand what shamans mean when they describe their experiences as flying in duerr s view shamans learn to evaporate their ego boundaries thereby experiencing themselves in a different way it is this feeling that can be described as shamanic flying duerr ties these shamanic practices into werewolves of early modern europe arguing that these werewolves did not physically transform into wolves but that they embraced their wolf nature by crossing over boundary from civilisation to wilderness duerr 1985 pp 76 88 duerr then offers a philosophical discussion on nature of reality criticizing psychiatrists like george devereux for their beliefs that shamans were mentally ill instead he champions idea that visionary experiences of shamans should be treated as real rather than illusionary drawing from ideas of philosopher ludwig wittgenstein to support his argument duerr 1985 pp 89 103 author then examines role of animals in shamanic visions paying particular reference to experiences of peruvian anthropologist carlos castaneda duerr argues that conversations between animal and individual undertaking vision are neither literal nor delusional but that only way to understand this is to situate oneself on fence between worlds of civilisation and wilderness duerr 1985 pp 104 113 duerr argues that modern western society lacks important facets found in archaic societies who adhere to shamanic beliefs and he asserts that majority of western anthropologists who have performed ethnographic fieldwork in these cultures have failed to truly understand them to correct this duerr argues that anthropologists must understand that people in such societies take a mythic perspective to world often comparing objects and places in material world to objects and places that exist outside of time in eternal realm of mythology he connects this with indigenous australian concept of dreamtime an otherworld outside of ordinary space and time duerr 1985 pp 114 124 finally duerr once again criticises approach of western society and its anthropologists to studying archaic spiritual beliefs he asserts that in these archaic cultures people have a much clearer idea about fact that we can not be only what we are if at same time we are also what we are not and that we can only know who we are if we experience our boundaries he denounces western scientists and anthropologists for their approaches to study of such cultures arguing that they have misrepresented them by attempting to fit them within western ideas of objectivity he argues that in future anthropologists must reach their own boundaries and recognize wilderness of their consciousness before they can truly understand worldview of archaic humans duerr 1985 pp 125 133 reception academic reviews writing in journal of religion gail hinich claimed that duerr s dreamtime had a maverick whimsy and passion that stemmed from its argument that western society had unfairly forced otherworld into an autistic tyranny of self on a critical note hinich believed that despite duerr s extensive bibliography he had failed to understand critical context in which intellectual history of demonized outsider continues to be examined ignoring ideas put forward by edward dudley and maximilian in their edited volume wild man within 1972 or john block friedman in his monstrous races in medieval art and thought 1981 hinich 1986 in a review published in journal forest conservation history paul fayter praised dreamtime considering it to be a groundbreaking ethnographic study that invites reader to consider what western society has lost in its over reliance on science and rationalism fayter also commented positively on goodman s translation noting that she had successfully conveyed duerr s dry humour and self deprecating wit fayter 1990 joseph j valadez of harvard school of public health reviewed duerr s dreamtime for journal contemporary sociology he felt that book had brought him to edges of his own logics but that this had not been result of any intellectual argument posed by duerr indeed he suggested that there were crucial scholarly weaknesses that made much of duerr s argument suspect he ultimately felt that because duerr had refused to correct his factual mistakes for english translation book had left realms of scholarship and instead become an obscure cultural artifact one which was represented by myriad descriptions of cryptic symbols that are discussed within its pages going on to comment on duerr s main argument regarding relationship between wilderness and civilization valadez also expressed his opinion that duerr had made a fundamental error in assuming that wilderness is not accessible to everyone by virtue of genetic heritage valadez 1987 in comparative civilizations review journal anthony m stevens arroyo proclaimed that it was easy to get lost in dreamtime believing that multitude of ethnographic and historical facts presented by duerr often distracted from book s main arguments although praising book s contents stevens arroyo expressed his annoyance at duerr s use of humour believing that it was inappropriate in such a serious work of scholarship he also remarked that duerr practices what he preaches noting that book was something of an apologia for his involvement in counter cultural and drug subcultures of 1960s and his continuing advocacy of use of mind altering substances in same style as timothy leary considering work to be an attack on social convention he believes that duerr has made use of mind altering drugs to cross boundaries into altered states of consciousness and that dreamtime is his invitation for others to join him stevens arroyo did praise goodman s english translation but argued that index was too limited stevens arroyo 1992 in a commentary piece for journal of anthropological society of oxford charles stewart expressed his opinion that dreamtime is best described as sort of book that carlos castaneda might have written if he were a german philosopher he identifies a series of commonalities between duerr s work and castenada s claiming that duerr s description of his encounter with native american yerbatero in book s preface is an allusion to castenada s meeting with don juan which he described in teachings of don juan 1968 praising duerr s use of source material stewart notes that many anthropologists would be critical of using ethnographic data to construct a moral parable for western society and he went on to question whether it was really necessary for westerners to return to archaic modes of thought stewart 1987 press reviews american indologist wendy doniger o flaherty of university of chicago published a review of duerr s dreamtime in new york times she expressed her opinion that duerr had put forward a bold hypothesis but that dreamtime was a paradigm of borderline academia consisting of chapter titles written with charm and wit that hid a mountainous scholarly apparatus 236 pages of 827 notes with an 86 page bibliography of some 2 400 titles to support 133 pages of text she also identified multiple influences on duerr s thinking including historian and philosopher of science paul feyerabend philosopher ludwig wittgenstein historian of religions mircea eliade and anthropologist carlos castenada ultimately doniger o flaherty was critical of dreamtime commenting that duerr is attempting to hunt with hounds and run with hare and his book is likely to infuriate both ordinary readers and scholars although initially appearing suitable for average reader she felt that most would be put off by daunting scholarly apparatus he had employed and heaviness of argument believing that book was difficult to read she felt that duerr had hidden his arguments in footnotes and that reading first third of book was akin to wandering stoned through stacks of a very fine european library browsing in sections devoted to witchcraft hallucinogens and orgiastic cults it is good fun but it is not for all tastes she equally felt that book would be criticized by academics and other scholars working in fields of witchcraft history and history of religion who would recognize that book not only contained multiple factual errors but also that many of duerr s arguments were unoriginal having previously been made by mircea eliade and victor turner writing for los angeles times kenneth atchity described duerr s book as being outstanding for its weirdness and provocation despite fact that its anthropology is neither original nor precise atchity maintains that dreamtime offers nothing new except energy of its serendipity noting similarities with books such as james frazer s golden bough 1890 robert graves white goddess 1948 and works of carlos castenada although of opinion that it contained patches of brilliant illumination atchity ultimately considered dreamtime to be an obscure essay on human experience atchity 1985 wider influence in 1983 german academics rolf gehlen and bernd wolf published der glaserne zaun aufsatze zu hans peter traumzeit glass fence essays on hans peter duerr s dreamtime an edited volume of papers discussing duerr s work gehlen and wolf 1983 duerr s theories were evaluated by belgian anthropologist rik pinxten in an academic paper entitled dreamtime relativism and irrationality in work of hans peter duerr 1992 published in cognitive relativism and social science volume pinxten discussed role of german anthropology within academia and its influence on philosophy and described dreamtime as most important publication to emerge from interaction between two disciplines pinxten 1992 in her study of feminist orientated wicca in new zealand 2004 anthropologist kathryn rountree remarked that along with historian carlo ginzburg s ecstasies deciphering witches sabbath 1989 dreamtime offered perhaps most detailed investigation so far of witches sabbath rountree 2004 p 23 similarly duerr s work was referenced by anthropologist susan greenwood in her study of wiccan and ceremonial magical communities of london magic witchcraft and otherworld 2000 greenwood 2000 p 120 according to dutch historian willem de blecourt dreamtime was responsible for first introducing 1692 case of of livonian werewolf to anglophone scholarship prior to this he noted scholarly debate on case had been restricted to german speaking scholars de blecourt 2007 p 52 duerr had briefly discussed case in chapter wild women and werewolves in which he compared it with various european folk traditions in which individuals broke social taboos and made mischief in public arguing that they represented a battle between forces of chaos and order duerr
