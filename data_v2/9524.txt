vega is brightest star in northern constellation of lyra it has bayer designation a lyrae which is latinised to alpha lyrae and abbreviated alpha lyr or a lyr this star is relatively close at only 25 light years from sun and together with arcturus and sirius one of most luminous stars in sun s neighborhood it is fifth brightest star in night sky and second brightest star in northern celestial hemisphere after arcturus vega has been extensively studied by astronomers leading it to be termed arguably next most important star in sky after sun vega was northern pole star around 12 000 bc and will be so again around year 13 727 when declination will be vega was first star other than sun to be photographed and first to have its spectrum recorded it was one of first stars whose distance was estimated through parallax measurements vega has functioned as baseline for calibrating photometric brightness scale and was one of stars used to define zero point for ubv photometric system vega is only about a tenth of age of sun but since it is 2 1 times as massive its expected lifetime is also one tenth of that of sun both stars are at present approaching midpoint of their life expectancies vega has an unusually low abundance of elements with a higher atomic number than that of helium vega is also a variable star that varies slightly in brightness it is rotating rapidly with a velocity of 236 km s at equator this causes equator to bulge outward due to centrifugal effects and as a result there is a variation of temperature across star s photosphere that reaches a maximum at poles from earth vega is observed from direction of one of these poles based on an observed excess emission of infrared radiation vega appears to have a circumstellar disk of dust this dust is likely to be result of collisions between objects in an orbiting debris disk which is analogous to kuiper belt in solar system stars that display an infrared excess due to dust emission are termed vega like stars nomenclature a lyrae latinised to alpha lyrae is star s bayer designation traditional name vega earlier wega comes from a loose transliteration of arabic word meaning falling or landing via phrase falling eagle in 2016 international astronomical union organized a working group on star names wgsn to catalog and standardize proper names for stars wgsn s first bulletin of july 2016 included a table of first two batches of names approved by wgsn which included vega for this star it is now so entered in iau catalog of star names observation left thumb upright 1 2 summer triangle vega can often be seen near zenith in mid northern latitudes during evening in northern hemisphere summer from mid southern latitudes it can be seen low above northern horizon during southern hemisphere winter with a declination of 38 78deg vega can only be viewed at latitudes north of 51deg s therefore it does not rise at all anywhere in antarctica or in southernmost part of south america including punta arenas chile 53deg s at latitudes to north of 51deg n vega remains continuously above horizon as a circumpolar star around july 1 vega reaches midnight culmination when it crosses meridian at that time thumb path of north celestial pole among stars due to precession vega is bright star near bottom alt small white disks representing northern stars on a black background overlaid by a circle showing position of north pole over time each night positions of stars appear to change as earth rotates however when a star is located along earth s axis of rotation it will remain in same position and thus is called a pole star direction of earth s axis of rotation gradually changes over time in a process known as precession of equinoxes a complete precession cycle requires 25 770 years during which time pole of earth s rotation follows a circular path across celestial sphere that passes near several prominent stars at present pole star is polaris but around 12 000 bc pole was pointed only five degrees away from vega through precession pole will again pass near vega around ad 14 000 vega is brightest of successive northern pole stars this star lies at a vertex of a widely spaced asterism called summer triangle which consists of vega plus two first magnitude stars altair in aquila and deneb in cygnus this formation is approximate shape of a right triangle with vega located at its right angle summer triangle is recognizable in northern skies for there are few other bright stars in its vicinity observational history thumb of vega photography of celestial objects began in 1840 when john william draper took an image of moon using daguerreotype process on july 17 1850 vega became first star other than sun to be photographed when it was imaged by william bond and john adams whipple at harvard college observatory also with a daguerreotype henry draper took first photograph of a star s spectrum in august 1872 when he took an image of vega and he also became first person to show absorption lines in spectrum of a star similar lines had already been identified in spectrum of sun in 1879 william huggins used photographs of spectra of vega and similar stars to identify a set of twelve very strong lines that were common to this stellar category these were later identified as lines from hydrogen balmer series since 1943 spectrum of this star has served as one of stable anchor points by which other stars are classified distance to vega can be determined by measuring its parallax shift against background stars as earth orbits sun first person to publish a star s parallax was friedrich g w von struve when he announced a value of 0 125 arcseconds 0 125 for vega friedrich bessel was skeptical about struve s data and when bessel published a parallax of 0 314 for star system 61 cygni struve revised his value for vega s parallax to nearly double original estimate this change cast further doubt on struve s data thus most astronomers at time including struve credited bessel with first published parallax result however struve s initial result was actually close to currently accepted value of 0 129 as determined by hipparcos astrometry satellite brightness of a star as seen from earth is measured with a standardized logarithmic scale this apparent magnitude is a numerical value that decreases in value with increasing brightness of star faintest stars visible to unaided eye are sixth magnitude while brightest in night sky sirius is of magnitude 1 46 to standardize magnitude scale astronomers chose vega to represent magnitude zero at all wavelengths thus for many years vega was used as a baseline for calibration of absolute photometric brightness scales however this is no longer case as apparent magnitude zero point is now commonly defined in terms of a particular numerically specified flux this approach is more convenient for astronomers since vega is not always available for calibration and varies in brightness ubv photometric system measures magnitude of stars through ultraviolet blue and yellow filters producing u b and v values respectively vega is one of six a0v stars that were used to set initial mean values for this photometric system when it was introduced in 1950s mean magnitudes for these six stars were defined as 0 in effect magnitude scale has been calibrated so that magnitude of these stars is same in yellow blue and ultraviolet parts of electromagnetic spectrum thus vega has a relatively flat electromagnetic spectrum in visual region wavelength range 350 850 nanometers most of which can be seen with human eye so flux densities are roughly equal 2000 4000 jy however flux density of vega drops rapidly in infrared and is near 100 jy at 5 micrometers photometric measurements of vega during 1930s appeared to show that star had a low magnitude variability on order of 0 03 magnitudes around 2 8 luminosity this range of variability was near limits of observational capability for that time and so subject of vega s variability has been controversial magnitude of vega was measured again in 1981 at david dunlap observatory and showed some slight variability thus it was suggested that vega showed occasional low amplitude pulsations associated with a delta scuti variable this is a category of stars that oscillate in a coherent manner resulting in periodic pulsations in star s luminosity although vega fits physical profile for this type of variable other observers have found no such variation thus variability was thought to possibly be result of systematic errors in measurement however a 2007 article surveyed these and other results and concluded that a conservative analysis of foregoing results suggests that vega is quite likely variable in 1 2 range with possible occasional excursions to as much as 4 from mean also a 2011 article affirms that long term year to year variability of vega was confirmed vega became first solitary main sequence star beyond sun known to be an x ray emitter when in 1979 it was observed from an imaging x ray telescope launched on an aerobee 350 from white sands missile range in 1983 vega became first star found to have a disk of dust infrared astronomical satellite iras discovered an excess of infrared radiation coming from star and this was attributed to energy emitted by orbiting dust as it was heated by star physical characteristics vega s spectral class is a0v making it a blue tinged white main sequence star that is fusing hydrogen to helium in its core since more massive stars use their fusion fuel more quickly than smaller ones vega s main sequence lifetime is roughly one billion years a tenth of sun s current age of this star is about 455 million years or up to about half its expected total main sequence lifespan after leaving main sequence vega will become a class m red giant and shed much of its mass finally becoming a white dwarf at present vega has more than twice mass of sun and its bolometric luminosity is about 40 times sun s because it is rapidly rotating and seen nearly pole on its apparent luminosity calculated assuming it was same brightness all over is about 57 times sun s if vega is variable then it may be a delta scuti type with a period of about 0 107 days most of energy produced at vega s core is generated by carbon nitrogen oxygen cycle cno cycle a nuclear fusion process that combines protons to form helium nuclei through intermediary nuclei of carbon nitrogen and oxygen this process becomes dominant at a temperature of about 17 million k which is slightly higher than core temperature of sun but is less efficient than sun s proton proton chain reaction fusion reaction cno cycle is highly temperature sensitive which results in a convection zone about core that evenly distributes ash from fusion reaction within core region overlying atmosphere is in radiative equilibrium this is in contrast to sun which has a radiation zone centered on core with an overlying convection zone energy flux from vega has been precisely measured against standard light sources at a flux is 3 650 jy with an error margin of 2 visual spectrum of vega is dominated by absorption lines of hydrogen specifically by hydrogen balmer series with electron at n 2 principal quantum number lines of other elements are relatively weak with strongest being ionized magnesium iron and chromium x ray emission from vega is very low demonstrating that corona for this star must be very weak or non existent however as pole of vega is facing earth and a polar coronal hole may be present confirmation of a corona as likely source of x rays detected from vega or region very close to vega may be difficult as most of any coronal x rays would not be emitted along line of sight using spectropolarimetry a magnetic field has been detected on surface of vega by a team of astronomers at observatoire du pic du midi this is first such detection of a magnetic field on a spectral class a star that is not an ap chemically peculiar star average line of sight component of this field has a strength of this is comparable to mean magnetic field on sun magnetic fields of roughly 30 gauss have been reported for vega compared to about 1 gauss for sun in 2015 bright star spots were detected on star s surface first such detection for a normal a type star and these features show evidence of rotational modulation with a period of 0 68 days rotation when radius of vega was measured to high accuracy with an interferometer it resulted in an unexpectedly large estimated value of times radius of sun this is 60 larger than radius of star sirius while stellar models indicated it should only be about 12 larger however this discrepancy can be explained if vega is a rapidly rotating star that is being viewed from direction of its pole of rotation observations by chara array in 2005 06 confirmed this deduction right thumb upright 1 4 size comparison of vega left to sun right pole of vega its axis of rotation is inclined no more than five degrees from line of sight to earth at high end of estimates for rotation velocity for vega is along equator much higher than observed i e projected rotational velocity because vega is seen almost pole on this is 88 of speed that would cause star to start breaking up from centrifugal effects this rapid rotation of vega produces a pronounced equatorial bulge so radius of equator is 19 larger than polar radius estimated polar radius of this star is solar radii while equatorial radius is solar radii from earth this bulge is being viewed from direction of its pole producing overly large radius estimate local surface gravity at poles is greater than at equator which produces a variation in effective temperature over star polar temperature is near 10 000 k while equatorial temperature is about 8 152 k this large temperature difference between poles and equator produces a strong gravity darkening effect as viewed from poles this results in a darker lower intensity limb than would normally be expected for a spherically symmetric star temperature gradient may also mean that vega has a convection zone around equator while remainder of atmosphere is likely to be in almost pure radiative equilibrium by von theorem local luminosity is higher at poles as a result if vega were viewed along plane of its equator instead of almost pole on then its overall brightness would be lower as vega had long been used as a standard star for calibrating telescopes discovery that it is rapidly rotating may challenge some of underlying assumptions that were based on it being spherically symmetric with viewing angle and rotation rate of vega now better known this will allow improved instrument calibrations element abundance in astronomy those elements with higher atomic numbers than helium are termed metals metallicity of vega s photosphere is only about 32 of abundance of heavy elements in sun s atmosphere compare this for example to a threefold metallicity abundance in similar star sirius as compared to sun for comparison sun has an abundance of elements heavier than helium of about 0 0 002 thus in terms of abundances only about 0 54 of vega consists of elements heavier than helium unusually low metallicity of vega makes it a weak lambda bootis star however reason for existence of such chemically peculiar spectral class a0 f0 stars remains unclear one possibility is that chemical peculiarity may be result of diffusion or mass loss although stellar models show that this would normally only occur near end of a star s hydrogen burning lifespan another possibility is that star formed from an interstellar medium of gas and dust that was unusually metal poor observed helium to hydrogen ratio in vega is 0 030 0 005 which is about 40 lower than sun this may be caused by disappearance of a helium convection zone near surface energy transfer is instead performed by radiative process which may be causing an abundance anomaly through diffusion kinematics radial velocity of vega is component of this star s motion along line of sight to earth movement away from earth will cause light from vega to shift to a lower frequency toward red or to a higher frequency toward blue if motion is toward earth thus velocity can be measured from amount of redshift or blueshift of star s spectrum precise measurements of this redshift give a value of minus sign indicates a relative motion toward earth motion transverse to line of sight causes position of vega to shift with respect to more distant background stars careful measurement of star s position allows this angular movement known as proper motion to be calculated vega s proper motion is mas per year in right ascension celestial equivalent of longitude and in declination which is equivalent to a change in latitude net proper motion of vega is 327 78 mas y which results in angular movement of a degree every 11 000 years in galactic coordinate system space velocity components of vega are u v w for a net space velocity of 19 km s radial component of this velocity in direction of sun is 13 9 km s while transverse velocity is 9 9 km s although vega is at present only fifth brightest star in night sky star is slowly brightening as proper motion causes it to approach sun vega will make its closest approach in an estimated 264 000 years at a perihelion distance of based on this star s kinematic properties it appears to belong to a stellar association called castor moving group however vega may be much older than this group so membership remains uncertain this group contains about 16 stars including alpha librae alpha castor fomalhaut and vega all members of group are moving in nearly same direction with similar space velocities membership in a moving group implies a common origin for these stars in an open cluster that has since become gravitationally unbound estimated age of this moving group is and they have an average space velocity of 16 5 km s possible planetary system right thumb a mid infrared 24 mm image of debris disk around vega infrared excess one of early results from infrared astronomy satellite iras was discovery of excess infrared flux coming from vega beyond what would be expected from star alone this excess was measured at wavelengths of 25 60 and 100 mm and came from within an angular radius of 10 arcseconds 10 centered on star at measured distance of vega this corresponded to an actual radius of 80 astronomical units au where an au is average radius of earth s orbit around sun it was proposed that this radiation came from a field of orbiting particles with a dimension on order of a millimeter as anything smaller would eventually be removed from system by radiation pressure or drawn into star by means of poynting robertson drag latter is result of radiation pressure creating an effective force that opposes orbital motion of a dust particle causing it to spiral inward this effect is most pronounced for tiny particles that are closer to star subsequent measurements of vega at 193 mm showed a lower than expected flux for hypothesized particles suggesting that they must instead be on order of 100 mm or less to maintain this amount of dust in orbit around vega a continual source of replenishment would be required a proposed mechanism for maintaining dust was a disk of coalesced bodies that were in process of collapsing to form a planet models fitted to dust distribution around vega indicate that it is a 120 au radius circular disk viewed from nearly pole on in addition there is a hole in center of disk with a radius of no less than 80 au following discovery of an infrared excess around vega other stars have been found that display a similar anomaly that is attributable to dust emission as of 2002 about 400 of these stars have been found and they have come to be termed vega like or vega excess stars it is believed that these may provide clues to origin of solar system debris disks by 2005 spitzer space telescope had produced high resolution infrared images of dust around vega it was shown to extend out to 43 330 au at a wavelength of 24 mm 70 543 au at 70 mm and 105 815 au at 160 mm these much wider disks were found to be circular and free of clumps with dust particles ranging from 1 50 mm in size estimated total mass of this dust is 3 times mass of earth production of dust would require collisions between asteroids in a population corresponding to kuiper belt around sun thus dust is more likely created by a debris disk around vega rather than from a protoplanetary disk as was earlier thought thumb left upright 1 2 artist s concept of a recent massive collision of dwarf planet sized objects that may have contributed to dust ring around vega inner boundary of debris disk was estimated at 11 2 or 70 100 au disk of dust is produced as radiation pressure from vega pushes debris from collisions of larger objects outward however continuous production of amount of dust observed over course of vega s lifetime would require an enormous starting mass estimated as hundreds of times mass of jupiter hence it is more likely to have been produced as result of a relatively recent breakup of a moderate sized or larger comet or asteroid which then further fragmented as result of collisions between smaller components and other bodies this dusty disk would be relatively young on time scale of star s age and it will eventually be removed unless other collision events supply more dust observations first with palomar testbed interferometer by david ciardi and gerard van belle in 2001 and then later confirmed with chara array at mt wilson in 2006 and infrared optical telescope array at mt hopkins in 2011 revealed evidence for an inner dust band around vega originating within 8 au of star this exozodiacal dust may be evidence of dynamical perturbations within system this may be caused by an intense bombardment of comets or meteors and may be evidence for existence of a planetary system possible planets observations from james clerk maxwell telescope in 1997 revealed an elongated bright central region that peaked at 9 70 au to northeast of vega this was hypothesized as either a perturbation of dust disk by a planet or else an orbiting object that was surrounded by dust however images by keck telescope had ruled out a companion down to magnitude 16 which would correspond to a body with more than 12 times mass of jupiter astronomers at joint astronomy centre in hawaii and at ucla suggested that image may indicate a planetary system still undergoing formation determining nature of planet has not been straightforward a 2002 paper hypothesizes that clumps are caused by a roughly jupiter mass planet on an eccentric orbit dust would collect in orbits that have mean motion resonances with this planet where their orbital periods form integer fractions with period of planet producing resulting thumb upright 1 2 artist s impression of a planet around vega in 2003 it was hypothesized that these clumps could be caused by a roughly neptune mass planet having migrated from 40 to 65 au over 56 million years an orbit large enough to allow formation of smaller rocky planets closer to vega migration of this planet would likely require gravitational interaction with a second higher mass planet in a smaller orbit using a coronagraph on subaru telescope in hawaii in 2005 astronomers were able to further constrain size of a planet orbiting vega to no more than 5 10 times mass of jupiter issue of possible clumps in debris disc was revisited in 2007 using newer more sensitive instrumentation on plateau de bure interferometer observations showed that debris ring is smooth and symmetric no evidence was found of blobs reported earlier casting doubts on hypothesized giant planet smooth structure has been confirmed in follow up observations by hughes et al 2012 and herschel space telescope although a planet has yet to be directly observed around vega presence of a planetary system can not yet be ruled out thus there could be smaller terrestrial planets orbiting closer to star inclination of planetary orbits around vega is likely to be closely aligned to equatorial plane of this star from perspective of an observer on a hypothetical planet around vega sun would appear as a faint 4 3 magnitude star in columba constellation etymology and cultural significance name is believed to be derived from arabic term al al waki which appeared in al al star
