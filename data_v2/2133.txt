impressionist and portraitist augustus john this work was hung in inaugural exhibition of contemporary art society held at national gallery of victoria it was included in a travelling exhibition that appeared in new york s metropolitan museum of art in 1941 and later in canada in 1946 stokes presented work to national gallery of victoria thumb girl in red tights 1948 one of stokes best known and well regarded paintings alt oil painting of a female model standing in a room facing viewer wearing only red tights in mid twentieth century there were divisions in melbourne art scene which became intertwined with complex cultural politics of cold war era in late 1940s there was a move against modernism in art and tonalism came into favour partly as a reaction to this development artist george bell established an exhibiting group called melbourne contemporary artists in 1940 bell was a former war artist and influential member of victorian artistic establishment who after world war ii was appointed to teach at national gallery of victoria s painting school influenced by bell stokes was among artists for whom modernism was a strong influence and who exhibited with melbourne contemporary artists other members of group included russell drysdale and sali herman stokes artistry endured while that of some of her modernist colleagues did not by 1945 when melbourne contemporary artists held one of their exhibitions art critic alan mcculloch observed that works were increasingly lacking in originality and that former standards of group were being maintained by only a few members one of those was stokes whose work family he praised as strongly designed and sensitively modelled following year though mcculloch was more upbeat describing show as their best to date while again complementing stokes on her rich and opulent pictures six years later when group exhibited in 1952 critic for melbourne s argus was as unimpressed as had been mcculloch in 1945 suggesting that show demonstrated that melbourne s art scene lacked innovation he nevertheless singled out a small number of works for praise one of these was stokes christ with simon and andrew which he thought showed richness and feeling while stokes was being praised at home in melbourne one of her portraits was among six paintings owned by national gallery of victoria that were loaned for an exhibition on other side of country in perth city s newspaper west australian chose stokes picture to illustrate its story on exhibition calling it girl drying her hair paper described work as notable for its patient handling use of bright colour and skilful blending of figure and background national gallery of victoria refers to work as woman drying her hair which it had acquired in 1947 at behest of curator and artist daryl lindsay it was soon to travel a great deal further than to perth later career 1953 to 1989 in 1953 at request of prime minister robert menzies and british arts council an exhibition of works of twelve australian artists was assembled it was shown in london five regional british cities and at venice biennale of twelve artists selected for inclusion only two were from victoria rest being from new south wales stokes was one of victorians her three works including woman drying her hair hung alongside those of australia s most prominent mid twentieth century artists including arthur boyd russell drysdale william dobell sidney nolan lloyd rees donald friend and frank hinder despite these prominent painters being selected for inclusion when exhibition appeared in london stokes girl in red tights drew critical attention and acclaim admired by director of national gallery sir philip hendy work was proclaimed by art critic at times as best picture in london that week some artists in sydney were not so impressed a meeting of royal art society of new south wales urged prime minister menzies to intervene members describing paintings as worst ever gathered in one place however commonwealth art advisory board member who announced exhibition considered that it would represent most substantial promotion australian art would have experienced to that time following year joseph burke professor of fine arts at university of melbourne praised stokes painting making particular reference to her work that had so entranced viewers at 1953 exhibition constance stokes he wrote was a painter who announced pursuit of classical ideal as her aim her girl in red tights with its venetian richness of colouring ably sustains monumental harmony of classical tradition religious subjects appear regularly in stokes paintings one such work baptism is in collection of national gallery of victoria despite her recurring attention to such subjects however artist entered blake prize for religious art only once in 1953 esmond george critic at adelaide newspaper mail admired unidentified work as having strong art interest stokes interest in prize was not so strong as to prompt her to enter again she told an interviewer that abstract painting took over eric stokes died unexpectedly in 1962 an experience which left constance bereft a long time friend said that she never really recovered faced with a substantial mortgage to service stokes returned to work painting two years later she opened her first one woman show in over thirty years it comprised 43 works with 27 paintings priced dearly at upwards of 150 guineas exhibition was a success both financially and critically stokes earned over 4000 guineas and exhibition attracted praise from art historian and critic bernard william smith throughout 1960s 1970s and 1980s she painted and held shows this later phase of her work was based on a stronger if lighter colour palette and reflected influence of art of henri matisse whom stokes admired there was also a change in her subject matter from classically conceived still lifes groups of figures and nudes to more decorative themes stokes works continued to be well received having been included in 1975 exhibition australian women artists at university of melbourne and regional galleries association of victoria s 1977 touring exhibition heroic years of australian painting 1940 1965 stokes last painting was alice tumbling down rabbit hole painted around 1989 she died in melbourne in 1991 legacy standard reference work mcculloch s encyclopedia of australian art describes stokes as a leading figure in modernist movement in victoria not all critics regard stokes work so favourably however art historian christopher heathcote acknowledges recognition of stokes work by her contemporaries but goes on to say that strong staff support at melbourne university for a few lesser practitioners such as constance stokes hardly aided appreciation of better local work though she appears in mcculloch s guide few other reviews of australian art recognise stokes exceptions according to feminist writer anne summers include ursula hoff s masterpieces of national gallery of victoria and janine burke s australian women artists one hundred years 1840 1940 both of which refer to well travelled painting woman drying her hair while academic artists and art historians such as bernard william smith and joseph burke praised stokes work during her lifetime she faded into relative obscurity there is however a strong market for resale of her works stokes returned to some prominence through a book by anne summers published in 2009 called lost mother in which stokes and her paintings are central to a narrative about summers own family summers contrasts stokes ongoing obscurity with dramatic resurrection of oeuvre of artists grace cossington smith and clarice beckett both brought to attention by well regarded gallery curators summers considers a number of factors to be involved in stokes fate including her association with george bell whose destruction of many of his early pictures propensity to keep reworking his old pieces and artistic conservatism all limited his subsequent reputation summers also points to lack of a high profile champion of stokes work and her identity in a time when sydney was where ideas and experimentation were and place where reputations were made historian helen topliss takes a slightly different view emphasising that stokes was deflected from her career by raising a family a retrospective exhibition of stokes paintings toured victorian regional galleries including swan hill regional gallery and geelong art gallery in 1985 next year an exhibition of her work toured several state galleries and s h irvin gallery in sydney in 1992 her works were displayed in national gallery of victoria s exhibition classical modernism george bell circle while in 1993 same gallery curated an exhibition of her paintings and drawings most major australian collections hold works by stokes village is one of thirteen in collection of national gallery of victoria closely associated with victoria and in particular cultural
