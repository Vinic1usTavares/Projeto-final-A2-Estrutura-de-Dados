served as an event meant to respect past while looking forward to future just like wrestlemania xx with wrestlers like bryan and cesaro spotlighted as future of wwe however tucker noted that saying goodbye to past proved harder than anyone could imagine with end of undertaker s streak he said this and not wrestlemania 28 was true end of an era but tucker did not think it could have ended on a worse note with over 15 minutes of slow subpar action tucker commented that lack of hype before event of streak being in jeopardy made it less of a defining moment when lesnar broke it and more of an indictment on whoever okay ed decision to let this happen however bryan was there to save day with two well executed matches making those in attendance momentarily forget about taker and root for underdog who was finally getting his chance to shine tucker praised booking of match as perfect with its numerous false finishes for rest of event tucker commented that wyatt lost nothing by losing but cena certainly lost a lot by winning man shows no weakness tucker also noted that segment involving hogan austin and rock was meaningless surreal and a lot of fun tucker concluded by saying that event was easily one of best manias of last ten years and that future certainly does look bright if only we could have said our good byes properly reflecting in march 2016 just before wrestlemania 32
