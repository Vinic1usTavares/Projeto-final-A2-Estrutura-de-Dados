carried and used two large a fore staysail and jib and a main staysail to help conserve coal for their journeys cochran and ginger p 348 note 2 early career at start of her american hawaiian career american sailed in scheduled service from new york and philadelphia around south america via straits of magellan up to san francisco and from there to honolulu along way she was refueled with coal at saint lucia in british west indies and at coronel in chile chilean coal was often of lesser quality which burned too quickly and dangerously sent sparks flying from ship s funnel quality and fire danger were key reasons that all subsequent american hawaiian ships used oil instead of coal for fuel early american hawaiian voyages averaged about 70 days in each direction from new york to san francisco which was about 55 days shorter than typical time required for sailing ships insurers initially made company pay a 6 premium for taking its large ships through treacherous channel in straits of magellan rather than safer passage around cape horn but by 1903 american hawaiian s safe operation and experience on route allowed company to negotiate a 3 1 2 rate just a 1 2 surcharge over standard rate of 3 experience on route also paid off in shorter transit times american set a record time with a 59 day new york to san francisco passage in 1901 however typical times for trip were just over 50 days by 1903 cochran and ginger pp 348 349 in may 1905 after two years of negotiations american hawaiian signed a contract with tehuantepec national railway of mexico abandoning straits of magellan route in favor of tehuantepec route shipments on tehuantepec route would arrive at mexican ports salina cruz oaxaca for eastbound cargo and coatzacoalcos veracruz for westbound cargo and would traverse isthmus of tehuantepec mexico s narrowest point on railroad hovey p 78 eastbound shipments were primarily sugar and pineapple from hawaii while westbound cargoes were more general in nature cochran and ginger pp 355 56 after united states occupation of veracruz on 21 april 1914 which found six american hawaiian ships in mexican ports huerta led mexican government closed tehuantepec national railway to american shipping this loss of access coupled with fact that panama canal was not yet open caused american hawaiian to return to its historic route of sailing around south america via straits of magellan in late april cochran and ginger p 360 with opening of panama canal on 15 august american hawaiian ships switched to taking that route in october 1915 landslides closed panama canal and all american hawaiian ships including american returned to straits of magellan route again cochran and ginger p 361 americans exact movements from this time through early 1917 are unclear she may have been in half of american hawaiian fleet that was chartered for transatlantic service she may also have been in group of american hawaiian ships chartered for service to south america delivering coal gasoline and steel in exchange for coffee nitrates cocoa rubber and manganese ore cochran and ginger p 362 however when united states entered world war i in april 1917 entire american hawaiian fleet including american was requisitioned by united states shipping board ussb which then returned ships for operation by american hawaiian cochran and ginger p 363 u s navy service

engine of ahead and to starboard of american jammed sending ship veering sharply to port west gates crew put ship s engine at half speed to try to drop out of convoy but minutes later men on bridge sighted red light from oncoming american though west gates bridge rang up full speed ahead to avoid collision there was not enough time for engine to respond before americans bow cut into starboard side of west gate near poop deck american which was lightly damaged by collision reversed her engine to back out of tangle while west gates engine was shut down after american was completely backed out west gate began rapidly settling and was ordered abandoned a total of seven men from west gate died in accident two when their lifeboat capsized and a further five that probably died in initial
