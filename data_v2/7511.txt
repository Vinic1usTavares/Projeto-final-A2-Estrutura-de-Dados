a hellogoodbye van she style 80s dancefloor euphoria song s lyrical content is metaphorical and features sexual euphemisms buchanan described song during an interview that was published on group s official website saying easy is a very naughty and cheeky song it s most sexy song we ve ever done it came about when orson had an idea for a song they played it to us it was just a verse and a bridge and we completely changed format of song to make it our own and result is this incredibly provocative sexy number that we love she elaborated in a separate interview when we started working with guys from orson sound just blew us away it s completely fresh sounding but at same time has same qualities as biggest songs of our career so it s perfect for this album critical reception easy received

of american acts at their own game stuart mccaighy of this is fake diy wrote it thrills with its edge electro bass and that sugababes come over all seductive with most transparently obvious lyrical euphemisms heard in a long time a journalist from contactmusic com regarded it as smart sexy and danceable packed with hooks and undeniably fun they described verses as low slung and chorus as an un second blast of pure pop however cameron of herald sun criticized easy as having none of charm or sass of other songs on overloaded tim finney of pitchfork media had a similar response to song writing that it attempts to reverse engineer brand of cool that is commonly given to them via a limpid and largely tuneless rock pop hybrid adam webb of yahoo music regarded song as forgettable chart
