thief was last album released under their six album contract with emi band had no contractual obligation to release new material according to new york times in 2006 radiohead were by far world s most popular unsigned band drummer philip selway said it was definitely time to take a break there was still a desire amongst us to make music but also a realisation that other aspects of our lives were being neglected and we d come to end of our contract which gives you a natural point to look back over at what you ve achieved as a band singer and songwriter thom yorke recorded his first solo album eraser 2006 and multi instrumentalist jonny greenwood composed his first solo works soundtracks bodysong 2004 and there will be blood 2007 recording in march 2005 radiohead began writing and recording new music in their oxfordshire studio without their longtime producer nigel godrich guitarist ed o brien said they chose to work without godrich to get out of comfort zone we ve been working together for 10 years and we all love one another too much bassist colin greenwood later denied this saying godrich had been busy working with charlotte gainsbourg and beck at ether festival in july 2005 greenwood and yorke performed a version of future in rainbows track weird fishes arpeggi with london sinfonietta orchestra and arab orchestra of nazareth regular recording sessions began in august 2005 with radiohead updating fans on their progress intermittently on their new blog dead air space sessions were slow and band struggled to regain confidence according to yorke we spent a long time in studio just not going anywhere wasting our time and that was really really frustrating o brien said band considered splitting up but kept working because when you got beyond all shit and bollocks core of these songs were really good they attributed their slow progress to a lack of momentum after their break and lack of deadline and producer thumb radiohead performing live at greek theatre berkeley california during their 2006 tour radiohead used tour to test songs later recorded for in rainbows alt in december 2005 radiohead hired producer spike stent who had worked with artists including u2 and bjork to help them work through their material o brien told mojo spike listened to stuff we d been self producing these weren t demos they d been recorded in proper studios and he said sounds aren t good enough however collaboration with stent was unsuccessful in an effort to break deadlock radiohead decided to tour for first time since 2004 they performed in europe and north america in may and june 2006 and returned to europe for several festivals in august performing many new songs according to yorke we basically had all these half formed songs and we just had to get it together and rather than it being a nightmare it was really really good fun because suddenly everyone is being spontaneous and no one s self conscious because you re not in studio it felt like being 16 again after tour radiohead scrapped their work and re enlisted godrich who according to yorke gave us a walloping kick up arse in october 2006 recording started at tottenham house in marlborough wiltshire a country house scouted by godrich where radiohead worked for three weeks band members lived in caravans as building was in a state of disrepair yorke described it as derelict in stricter sense of word where there s holes in floor rain coming through ceilings half window panes missing there were places you just basically didn t go it definitely had an effect it had some pretty strange vibes sessions were productive and band recorded jigsaw falling into place and bodysnatchers in october yorke wrote on dead air space that radiohead had started record properly now starting to get somewhere i think finally in december 2006 sessions took place at halswell house taunton and godrich s hospital studios in covent garden where band recorded videotape and nude in january 2007 radiohead resumed recording in their oxfordshire studio and started to post photos lyrics videos and samples of new songs on dead air space in june having wrapped up recording godrich posted clips of songs on dead air space excluding last flowers which yorke recorded in eraser sessions in rainbows sessions produced 16 songs feeling hail to thief had been overlong radiohead wanted their seventh album to be concise they settled on ten songs saving rest for limited edition album was mastered by bob ludwig in july 2007 at gateway mastering new york city music in rainbows incorporates elements of art rock experimental rock and art pop opening track 15 step features a handclap rhythm inspired by fuck pain away by peaches radiohead planned to record handclaps by a group of children from matrix music school arts centre in oxford when clapping proved not quite good enough they recorded children cheering instead radiohead recorded a version of nude during ok computer sessions but discarded it ok computer version was inspired by al green and featured a hammond organ a straighter feel and different lyrics during early sessions for in rainbows colin greenwood wrote a new bassline for song which according to godrich transformed it from something very straight into something that had much more of a rhythmic flow radiohead performed a song with working title reckoner in 2001 during in rainbows sessions they abandoned original reckoner and created a new song with same name yorke released original song as a solo single feeling pulled apart by horses in 2009 bodysnatchers a song yorke described as sounding like wolfmother and neu meets dodgy hippy rock was recorded when he was in a period of hyperactive mania on all i need jonny greenwood wanted to capture white noise generated by a band playing loudly in a room a sound which never occurs in studio his solution was to have a string section play every note of scale blanketing frequencies yorke described process of composing videotape as absolute agony stating that song went through every possible parameter one day yorke left studio returning to find that godrich and jonny greenwood had stripped song down to final version a minimal piano ballad lyrics yorke said that in rainbows lyrics are based on that anonymous fear thing sitting in traffic thinking i m sure i m supposed to be doing something else it s similar to ok computer in a way it s much more terrifying he said that whereas hail to thief was a very angry record there was very little anger in in rainbows it s in no way political or at least doesn t feel that way to me it very much explores ideas of transience it starts in one place and ends somewhere completely different in another interview yorke said album was about fucking panic of realising you re going to die and that any time soon i could possibly have a heart attack when i next go for a run ed o brien described lyrics as universal there wasn t a political agenda it s being human song bodysnatchers is inspired by victorian ghost stories 1972 novel stepford wives and yorke s feeling of your physical consciousness trapped without being able to connect fully with anything else jigsaw falling into place is about a set of observations and different experiences partly of chaos witnessed by yorke when he used to go out on weekend in oxford yorke said lyrics are quite caustic idea of before you re comatose or whatever drinking yourself into oblivion and getting fucked up to forget there is partly this elation but there s a much darker side artwork in rainbows artwork was designed by longtime radiohead collaborator stanley donwood donwood worked in studio while radiohead worked on album allowing artwork to convey mood of music he displayed images in studio and on studio computer for band to interact with and comment on he also posted images daily on radiohead website though none were used in final artwork donwood experimented with photographic etching putting prints into acid baths and throwing wax at paper creating images influenced by nasa space photography he originally planned to explore suburban life but realised it did not fit album saying it s a sensual record and i wanted to do something more organic he described final artwork as very colourful it s a rainbow but it is very toxic it s more like sort of one you d see in a puddle radiohead did not release cover for digital release preferring to hold it back for physical release limited edition includes a booklet containing additional artwork by donwood release on 1 october 2007 jonny greenwood announced radiohead s seventh album on radiohead s blog writing well new album is finished and it s coming out in 10 days we ve called it in rainbows post contained a link to inrainbows com

release was hailed as a revolution in way major bands sell their music and media s reaction was almost overwhelmingly positive time called it easily most important release in recent history of music business and jon pareles of new york times wrote that for beleaguered recording business radiohead has put in motion most audacious experiment in years nme wrote that music world seemed to several rimes off its axis and praised fact that everyone from fans to critics had access to album at same time on release day kind of moment of togetherness you don t get very often singer bono of u2 praised radiohead as courageous and imaginative in trying to figure out some new relationship with their audience release also drew criticism trent reznor of nine inch nails thought it did not go far enough calling it very much a bait and switch to get you to pay for a myspace quality stream as a way to promote a very traditional record sale reznor independently released his sixth album ghosts i iv under a creative commons licence following year singer lily allen called release arrogant saying radiohead have millions of pounds it sends a weird message to younger bands who haven t done as well you don t choose how to pay for eggs why should it be different for music in guardian journalist will hodgkinson wrote that radiohead had made it impossible for less successful musicians to compete and make a living from their music kim gordon of sonic youth told guardian release seemed really community oriented but it wasn t catered towards their musician brothers and sisters who don t sell as many records as them it makes everyone else look bad for not offering their music for whatever radiohead s managers defended release as a solution for radiohead not industry and doubted it would work same way for radiohead ever again radiohead have not used pay what you want system for subsequent releases in february 2013 yorke told guardian that though radiohead had hoped to subvert corporate music industry with in rainbows he feared they had instead played into hands of content providers such as apple and google they have to keep commodifying things to keep share price up but in doing so they have made all content including music and newspapers worthless in order to make their billions and this is what we want dispute with emi as radiohead s recording contract with emi ended after 2003 release of hail to thief radiohead recorded in rainbows without a record label in 2005 yorke told time i like people at our record company but time is at hand when you have to ask why anyone needs one and yes it probably would give us some perverse pleasure to say fuck you to this decaying business model in august 2007 as radiohead were finishing in rainbows emi was acquired by private equity firm terra firma for us 6 4 billion ps4 7 billion emi accepts 4 7 billion bid from terra firma new york times 21 may 2007 4 7 billion private equity buyout wins support at emi new york times 22 may 2007 emi executives including keith wozencroft who had signed radiohead to emi travelled regularly to radiohead s oxfordshire studio in hopes of negotiating a new contract radiohead wanted rights to their back catalog which new emi owner guy hands refused however even in days leading to album announcement executives believed a deal could be made and were devastated when radiohead s team informed them of self release plan a day in advance hands said he believed that radiohead would only have canceled it with a really big offer according to eamonn forde author of final days of emi radiohead had lost faith in emi and thought new ownership would be a bloodbath o brien said it was really sad to leave all people we d worked with but terra firma don t understand music industry an emi spokesman stated that radiohead had demanded an extraordinary amount of money for a new contract radiohead s management and yorke released statements denying that they had asked for a large advance but instead wanted control over their back catalogue according to hands they wanted a lot of money and they wanted their masters back which we valued even more at our valuation it was millions and millions that they wanted responding to hands s statement yorke told an interviewer it fucking pissed me off we could have taken them terra firma to court idea that we were after so much money was stretching truth to breaking point that was his pr company briefing against us and i ll tell you what it fucking ruined my christmas days after radiohead signed to xl emi announced a box set of radiohead material recorded before in rainbows released in same week as in rainbows special edition radiohead were reportedly incensed at release commentators including guardian saw it as retaliation for band choosing not to re sign with emi hands defended reissues as necessary to boost emi s revenues we have a bank that is staring us down and now radiohead have basically told us to eff off i don t think we have a huge amount of reasons to be nice to them we need money for bank so let s do it in 2019 o brien told an interviewer i had no idea that we mattered that much to emi that probably sounds really naive but there weren t people going you re so important we were just one of bands on their roster promotion following album release radiohead recorded two webcasts in their oxfordshire studio thumbs down

concluded no wasted moments no weak tracks just primo radiohead in 2011 rolling stone album guide described it as radiohead s most expansive and seductive album possibly their all time high jon dolan of blender called in rainbows a far more pensive and reflective album than hail to thief writing that it formulates a lush sensualized ideal out of vague layered discomfort spins mikael wood felt that album succeeds because all of that cold clinical lab work hasn t eliminated warmth from their music while pitchforks mark pytlik dubbed it a more human album that represents sound of radiohead coming back to earth robert christgau writing for msn music gave in rainbows a two star honourable mention and noted that album having been developed in concert was more jammy less songy and less which is

of all previous radiohead albums combined in october 2008 one year after album s release warner chappell reported that although most people paid nothing for download pre release sales for in rainbows were more profitable than total sales of hail to thief and that limited edition had sold 100 000 copies in 2009 wired reported that radiohead had made an instantaneous ps3 million from album pitchfork
