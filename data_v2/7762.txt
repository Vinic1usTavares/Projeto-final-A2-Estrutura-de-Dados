engage in sexual intercourse at a pharmacy writer robert kirkman insisted that it was important to view storyline in a different perspective explaining i don t think we wanted to turn that into some kind of steamy pornographic sex romp cherokee rose marked a turning point in character development of daryl dixon it contains a monologue that references cherokee rose and its association to trail of tears scene was devised and written by evan rielly i was actually on set during filming of that stated kirkman almost every actor in cast showed up because they absolutely loved that scene and they wanted to see melissa and norman s portrayal of it as it unfolded episode contains a scene in which survivors pull a bloated walker out of a well in order to prevent contamination of water such attempts prove to be unsuccessful as all of water retention severs walker in half greg nicotero special effects director for walking dead collaborated with knb efx group to produce sequence nicotero received a phone call from staff members of company two hours after leaving production offices they devised and expressed plans of creating a scenario in which a walker falls into a well nicotero worked with knb efx group in several other films in past one of things we ve noticed looking at some morgue research and cadaver research is that everything gets really swollen he articulated liquid saturates skin so much that it swells up and skin starts to split that was one of things that we really wanted to play up a costume was sculpted using a body and a head cast it was composed of three layers a thin skin like substance covers exterior of suit followed by a layer of silicone and a layer of foam in costume s center a mask that was previously utilized in action horror film grindhouse 2007 was used as part of costume nicotero inserted water balloons between silicone and foam layering he explained that as performer begins to move liquid transfers from one side of costume to another nicotero added if we made it out of foam latex it would ve been stiff but we used silicone that was heavily which means that silicone was really soft suit weighed approximately sixty pounds brian hilliard a member of knb efx group was chosen by producers as walker hilliard was favored in lieu of another actor who fell ill shortly after being cast in his interview with entertainment weekly greg nicotero explained why he chose hilliard for part i needed somebody who could perform and who also had a lot of endurance because we were shooting in atlanta at end of july silicone doesn t have cell structure like foam does it doesn t breathe so brian was basically encased in a sixty pound wet suit every part of his body was covered he had facial prosthetics hands full legs feet it was all glued down it wasn t like we could take him out between takes he was in thumb right upright greg nicotero pictured collaborated with knb efx group to produce well sequence sequence was shot over a period of two days principal photography on first day commenced inside a well which was built by gregory melton in approximately four weeks it measured over forty feet in height and base of well was located in a swimming pool nicotero stated that they could open door put zombie actor in there then close door camera would shoot down atop of well was a lip that measured a height of six feet despite putting slime and k y jelly on a board inside of well nicotero and his production team found particular sequence to be difficult to shoot on action we pulled him out and he slid up and over lip nicotero stated it was challenging to get all those pieces to come together on a television schedule by time hilliard was pulled out of well producers used a second suit equipped with prosthetic legs and prosthetic body various blood bags were inserted in torso of suit each were filled with viscous liquids in a variety of colors entrails were lastly added inside suit as nicotero asserted that his team wanted a gigantic explosion of gore to induce splitting of costume series special effect coordinator darrell pritchett inserted squibs inside of suit nicotero stated on action my makeup effects crew pulled upper body apart and physical effects crew all bags then visual effects guys went in and added those few little tendrils of stretching ripping intestines because rubber constituted a large percentage of suit weights were added on to ensure that it would sink in water while recording commenced approximately 12 15 gallons of liquid were poured into well following dropping of prosthetic legs four takes were produced of that sequence reception ratings cherokee rose was originally broadcast on november 6 2011 in united states on amc upon airing episode garnered 6 29 million viewers and

dated november 13 critical response thumb upright conclusion sequence involving lori grimes sarah wayne callies pictured was well received by critics cherokee rose attained favorable reviews from television critics zach handlen of a v club gave episode a b and felt that it gave an accurate depiction of characters he opined i had a problem with show s tendency to wander into cul de sacs in first season mainly because so much of it felt redundant work of writers who had no real idea how to construct narrative television but this season i m starting to think they re getting a handle on things and cherokee rose is sort of episode i d like to see more off sic as walking dead continues paste josh jackson asserted that episode was superior to preceding installments describing it as simply a catch of breath similarly josh wigler of mtv evaluated that despite less violence than usual quality of cherokee rose improved from previous episode hitfix s alan sepinwall echoed analogous sentiments and argued that while show s character still need more development development displayed in episode was a definite step in right direction on that front time journalist nate rawlings concluded that episode contained many powerful scenes eric goldman of ign was critical of episode ultimately giving it a seven out of ten rating signifying a good rating goldman felt that cherokee rose was a disappointment citing that it lack any focus or direction henry hanks writing for cnn said that episode was weakest of season critics commended development of relationship between maggie green and glenn andrew conrad of baltimore sun stated that storyline epitomized a steamy romance while wall street journal aaron rutkoff called it funniest moment of series goldman opined that their sexual encounter felt genuine he s a nice guy she seems like a cool gal and it felt genuine when she noted she felt plenty lonely too and ready for some companionship nick venable of cinema blend asserted that interactions between maggie and glenn was highlight of episode i m glad writers are introducing this comic book plot point as this show seriously needs a couple without closets full of skeletons when glenn accidentally grabs a box of condoms for maggie to see i heartily ensuing conversation also made me smile which makes me wonder why humor is paid least amount of attention on show jackson was surprised with scene and called it unexpected jen of washington post compared glenn to little mikey from life advertisements and summated he has assumed this role without much choice in matter but he has done so with a certain quiet occasionally petrified baseball cap wearing dignity that makes him admirable water well sequence was critically acclaimed by critics darren franich of entertainment weekly described scene as hilarious and added i loved horrific pointlessness of that entire plot and it was yet more proof that makeup designer greg nicotero is real star of walking dead i m not sure anything else tv can come up with this season will match image of bloated half zombie crawling across ground with its water logged intestine hanging out jackson rawlings and houston chronicle pamela mitchell felt that sequence was one of series most grotesque moments rawlings added honestly that right there is why many people watch walking dead wigler expressed that it was very well done and noted that walker was most vile disgusting zombie that greg nicotero has ever created concluding sequence of cherokee rose was also well received by television critics morgan jeffrey of digital spy admired scene and described it as tense halden opined that scene was a reasonably solid storyline and felt that it was episode s biggest foreshadowing event references external links
