white on chest during next few years white or blue shirts without stripes were used in 1910 a kit comprising a blue and white vertically striped shirt and blue shorts was used for first time inspired by kit of boldklub this kit has remained as home colours ever since small amount of sponsor logos together with longtime use of blue and white stripes has made kit a classic in swedish football most

club ifk became popular amongst working class creating a fierce rivalry based upon both local pride and social class in early 20th century supporters were supposed to act as gentlemen applauding and supporting both their own team and opponents however this proved a hard task for supporters of gothenburg teams local patriotism and class differences sometimes resulted in fights and pitch invasions making swedish press view ifk and orgryte fans as scum of swedish football after world war i rivalry calmed and gothenburg supporters became known as friendly and sportsmanlike fans however this only applied to behaviour on home ground as ifk supporters continued to behave badly when travelling to away matches by train called gothenburg trains a phenomenon that grew quickly in 1920s this behaviour peaked in 1939 just after outbreak of world war ii when approximately 1 900 ifk fans travelled to boras to see ifk play elfsborg after a 2 3 loss fans fought with boras police before returning home to

1982 or by being main force behind move back to gamla ullevi in 1992 early 1990s saw a downward trend in attendance numbers even though club was successful on pitch but trend turned in later years of decade and first few years of new millennium brought club s highest average attendance since early 1980s in 2000s supporter culture in sweden started to shift from being english influenced to being
