draft of script originally called role boothroyd until it was realised that was also q s name and it was subsequently changed carmen du sautoy as saida a beirut belly dancer saida was originally written as overweight and wearing excessive make up but producers decided to cast a woman closer to classic bond girl francoise as chew mee hai fat s mistress whom bond memorably finds swimming nude in a swimming pool uncredited sonny as kra scaramanga s security chief uncredited production albert r broccoli and harry saltzman intended to follow you only live twice with man with golden gun inviting roger moore to bond role however filming was planned in cambodia and uprising made filming impractical leading to production being cancelled on her majesty s secret service was produced instead with george lazenby as bond lazenby s next bond film saltzman told a reporter would be either man with golden gun or diamonds are forever producers chose latter title with sean connery returning as bond broccoli and saltzman then decided to start production on man with golden gun after live and let die this was final bond film to be co produced by saltzman as his partnership with broccoli was dissolved after film s release saltzman sold his 50 stake in eon productions s parent company danjaq llc to united artists to alleviate his financial problems resulting legalities over bond property delayed production of next bond film spy who loved me for three years novel is mostly set in jamaica a location which had been already used in earlier films dr no and live and let die man with golden gun saw a change in location to put bond in far east for second time after considering beirut where part of film is set iran where location scouting was done but eventually discarded because of yom kippur war and ha long bay in vietnam production team chose thailand as a primary location following a suggestion of production designer peter murton after he saw pictures of phuket bay in a magazine saltzman was happy with choice of far east for setting as he had always wanted to go on location in thailand and hong kong during reconnaissance of locations in hong kong broccoli saw wreckage of former and came up with idea of using it as base for mi6 s far east operations writing and themes tom mankiewicz wrote a first draft for script in 1973 delivering a script that was a battle of wills between bond and scaramanga who he saw as bond s alter ego a super villain of stature of bond himself tensions between mankiewicz and guy hamilton and mankiewicz s growing sense that he was feeling really tapped out on bond led to re introduction of richard maibaum as bond screenwriter maibaum who had worked on six bond films previously delivered his own draft based on mankiewicz s work much of plot involving scaramanga being bond s equal was sidelined in later drafts for one of two main aspects of plot screenwriters used 1973 energy crisis as a backdrop to film allowing macguffin of solex agitator to be introduced broccoli s stepson michael g wilson researched solar power to create solex while live and let die had borrowed heavily from blaxploitation genre man with golden gun borrowed from martial arts genre that was popular in 1970s through films such as fist of fury 1972 and enter dragon 1973 however use of martial arts for a fight scene in film lapses into when lt hip and his two nieces defeat an entire dojo casting originally role of scaramanga was offered to jack palance but he turned opportunity down christopher lee who was eventually chosen to portray scaramanga was ian fleming s step cousin and fleming had suggested lee for role of dr julius no in 1962 series opener dr no lee noted that fleming was a forgetful man and by time he mentioned this to broccoli and saltzman they had cast joseph wiseman in part due to filming on location in bangkok his role in film affected lee s work following year as director ken russell was unable to sign lee to play specialist in 1975 film tommy a part eventually given to jack nicholson two swedish models were cast as bond girls britt ekland and maud adams ekland had been interested in playing a bond girl since she had seen dr no and contacted producers about main role of mary goodnight hamilton met adams in new york and cast her because she was elegant and beautiful that it seemed to me she was perfect bond girl when ekland read news that adams had been cast for man with golden gun she became upset thinking adams had been selected to play goodnight broccoli then called ekland to invite her for main role as after seeing her in a film broccoli thought ekland s generous looks made her a good contrast to adams hamilton decided to put marc lawrence whom he had worked with on diamonds are forever to play a gangster shot dead by scaramanga at start of film because he found it an interesting idea to put sort of a chicago gangster in middle of thailand filming thumb 1972 wreck of

elizabeth which acted as a top secret mi6 base grounded in victoria harbour in hong kong crew was small and a stunt double was used for james bond other hong kong locations included hong kong dragon garden as estate of hai fat which portrayed a location in bangkok major part of principal photography started on 18 april 1974 in thailand thai locations included bangkok thon buri phuket and nearby phang nga province on islands of ko khao phing kan and ko tapu scaramanga s hideout is on ko khao phing kan and ko tapu is often now referred to as james bond island both by locals and in tourist guidebooks scene during boxing match used an actual muay thai fixture at boxing stadium a car chase in bangkok occurred near a canal or on kasem road blame it all on honey and her white bikini production returned in late april to hong kong and also to macau for that island is famous for its casinos which hong kong lacks some scenes in thailand had to be finished and production had to move to studio work in pinewood studios this included sets such as scaramanga s solar energy plant and island interior academy award winner oswald morris was hired to finish job after cinematographer ted moore became ill morris was initially reluctant as he did not like his previous experiences taking over other cinematographers work but accepted after dining with broccoli production wrapped in pinewood in august 1974 thumb left one of scaramanga s island s outcrops high tide alt a tall rocky outcrop sitting in sea another island is visible dominating background one of main stunts in film consisted of stunt driver bumps willard as james bond driving an amc hornet leaping a broken bridge and spinning around 360 degrees in mid air about longitudinal axis doing an aerial twist willard successfully completed jump on first take stunt was shown in slow motion for scene was otherwise too fast composer john barry added a slide whistle sound effect over stunt which broccoli kept in despite thinking that it stunt barry later regretted his decision thinking whistle broke golden rule as stunt was for what it was all worth a truly dangerous moment true james bond style sound effect was described as simply crass writer jim smith suggested that stunt brings into focus lack of excitement in rest of film and is spoilt by use of comedy sound effects eon productions had licensed stunt which had been designed by raymond mchenry it was initially conceived at cornell aeronautical laboratory cal in buffalo new york as a test for their vehicle simulation software after development in simulation ramps were built and stunt was tested at cal s proving ground it toured as part of all american thrill show as astro spiral before it was picked up for film television programme top gear attempted to repeat stunt in june 2008 but failed scene where scaramanga s matador flies was shot at bovington camp with a model inspired by an actual car plane prototype bond s duel with scaramanga which mankewicz said was inspired by climactic faceoff in shane was shortened as producers felt it was causing pacing problems trailers featured some of cut scenes hamilton adapted an idea of his involving bond in disneyland for scaramanga s funhouse funhouse was designed to be a place where scaramanga could get upper hand by distracting adversary with obstacles and was described by murton as a melting pot of ideas which made it both a funhouse and a horror house while an actual wax figure of roger moore was used moore s stunt double les crawford was cowboy figure and ray played al capone figure canted sets such as funhouse and queen elizabeth had inspiration from german expressionist films such as cabinet of dr caligari for scaramanga s solar power plant hamilton used both pinewood set and a miniature projected by derek meddings often cutting between each other to show there was no discernible difference destruction of facility was a combination of practical effects on set and a destruction of miniature meddings based island blowing up on footage of battle of monte cassino golden gun prop thumb right golden gun alt a golden gun is held by a hand thumb right scaramanga s golden gun three golden gun props were made a solid piece one that could be fired with a cap and one that could be assembled and disassembled although christopher lee said that process was extremely

film which is estimated to be worth around ps80 000 was missing suspected stolen from elstree props a company based at hertfordshire studios music theme tune to man with golden gun released in 1974 was performed by scottish singer lulu and composed by john barry tony bramwell who worked for harry saltzman s music publishing company hilary music wanted elton john or cat stevens to sing title song however by this time producers were taking turns producing films albert broccoli whose turn it was to produce rejected bramwell s suggestions lyrics to lulu song were written by don black and have been described variously as ludicrous inane and one long stream of smut because of their sexual innuendo bramwell subsequently dismissed barry lulu tune as mundane alice cooper wrote a song titled man with golden gun to be used by producers of film but they opted for lulu s song instead cooper released his song in his album muscle of love barry had only three weeks to score man with golden gun and theme tune and score are generally considered by critics to be among weakest of barry s contributions to series an opinion shared by barry himself it s one i hate most it just never happened for me

silencer item is still in a box man with golden gun was premiered at odeon leicester square in london on with general release in united kingdom same day film was made with an estimated budget of 7 million despite initial good returns from box office man with golden gun grossed a total of 97 6 million at worldwide box office with 21 million earned in usa making it fourth lowest grossing bond film in series promotion of film had one of more anaemic advertising campaigns of series and there were few products available apart from soundtrack and paperback book although lone star toys produced a james bond 007 pistol in gold this differed from weapon used by scaramanga in film as it was little more than a walther p38 with a silencer fitted contemporary reviews man with golden gun met with mixed reviews upon its release derek malcolm in guardian savaged film saying that script is of lot and roger moore as 007 is last man on earth to make it sound better than it is there was some praise from malcolm although it was muted saying that christopher lee makes a goodish villain and britt ekland a passable mary goodnight up to scratch in production values film is otherwise merely a potboiler maybe enough s enough tom milne writing in observer was even more caustic writing that this series which has been scraping bottom of barrel for some time is now through bottom with depressing borrowings from hong kong kung fu movies not to mention even more depressing echoes of carry on smut he summed up film by saying it was sadly lacking in wit or imagination david robinson film critic at times dismissed film and moore s performance saying that moore was substituting non acting for connery s throwaway while britt ekland was his beautiful idiot side kick least appealing of bond heroines robinson was equally damning of changes in production crew observing that ken adam an attraction of early bond films had been replaced by decorators of competence but little of his flair writers get progressively more naive in their creation of a suburban dream of epicureanism and adventure writing for new york times nora sayre considered film to suffer from poverty of invention and excitement criticising writing and moore s performance and finding villechaize and lee as only positive points for their sinister vitality that cuts through narrative dough sunday mirror critic observed that man with golden gun isn t best bond ever but found it remarkable that messrs saltzman and broccoli can still produce such slick and inventive entertainment arthur thirkwell writing in sunday mirrors sister paper daily mirror concentrated more on lead actor roger moore than film itself what sean connery used to achieve with a touch of sardonic sadism roger moore conveys with roguish schoolboy charm and odd dry quip thirkwell also said that moore manages to make even this reduced voltage bond a character with plenty of sparkle judith crist of new york magazine gave a positive review saying scenery s grand lines nice and gadgetry entertaining also describing production as a film that capture s free wheeling non sense of early fleming s fairy tale for grown ups orientation jay cocks writing in time focused on gadgets such as scaramanga s flying car as what was wrong with both man with golden gun and more recent films in bond series calling them uninspired these exercises show strain of stretching fantasy well past wit cocks also criticised actors saying that moore lacks all connery s strengths and has several deep deficiencies while lee was an unusually unimpressive villain reflective reviews opinion on man with golden gun has for most part remained same as it was in 1974 and as of november 2015 film holds a 44 rating from rotten tomatoes although these contain contemporary reviews while ian freer of empire found film an entertaining 007 adventure something that tonally if not qualitatively could happily sit within connery era ign chose man with golden gun as worst bond film claiming it has a great concept but execution is sloppy and silly and entertainment weekly chose it as fourth worst saying that plot is almost as puny as sidekick on other hand norman wilner of msn chose it as tenth best with much praise for christopher lee s performance some critics saw film as uninspired tired and boring roger moore was also criticised for playing bond against type in a style more reminiscent of sean connery although lee s performance received acclaim danny peary wrote that man with golden gun lacks invention is one of least interesting bond films and a very laboured movie with bond a stiff bore adams and britt ekland uninspired leading ladies peary believes that shootout between bond and scaramanga in funhouse is one good scene in movie and even it has an unsatisfying finish and also bemoaned presence of clifton james unfortunately reprising his unfunny redneck sheriff from live and let die chris nashawaty of entertainment weekly argues that scaramanga is best villain of roger moore james bond films while listing mary goodnight among worst bond girls saying that ekland may have had one of series best bikinis but her dopey portrayal was a turnoff as much to filmgoers as to fans of ian fleming s novels times put scaramanga as fifth best bond villain in their list and ekland was third in their list of top 10 most fashionable bond girls maxim listed goodnight at fourth in their top bond babes list saying that agent goodnight is clumsiest spy alive but who cares as long as she s using her perfect bikini bottom
