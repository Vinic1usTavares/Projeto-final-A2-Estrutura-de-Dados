is also full of notable oddities such as moon having a face and twisted disturbed aspects most notably limbo of repeating destruction that world is stuck in this was a combined result of world being formed around skull kid s memories of hyrule his heart being stuck in limbo due to his past broken bond with four spirits and dark nature of ancient tribe that majora s mask belonged to hyrule is considered to be to termina s heaven and fits all typical descriptors it existed before and will exist following its formation and destruction deities that are worshiped in world as well as world s

light breaking through trees a drawing on a tree stump of link tatl tael skull kid and four giants is shown after although not shown within game it was only through link s pure heart that termina a land created in limbo was able to celebrate breaking of cycle of destruction temporarily and exist for a short time into dawn of new day after he leaves land ceases to exist nevertheless skull kid s heart true source of termina has now been freed of limbo of burden surrounding broken bond with four friends and begun dawn of its new day development following release of link s awakening in 1993 fans waited five years for ocarina of time active development of which took four years by re using game engine and graphics from ocarina of time a smaller team required only one year to finish majora s mask according to director eiji aonuma they were faced with very difficult question of just what kind of game could follow ocarina of time and its worldwide sales of seven million units and as a solution came up with three day system to make game data more compact while still providing deep gameplay shigeru miyamoto and yoshiaki koizumi came up with story that served as basis for script written by mitsuhiro takano idea of three day system came from miyamoto and koizumi majora s mask first appeared in media in may 1999 when famitsu stated that a long planned zelda expansion for 64dd was underway in japan this project was tentatively titled ura zelda ura translates roughly to hidden or behind this expansion would take ocarina of time and alter level designs similar to how master quest expanded upon original legend of zelda in june nintendo announced that zelda gaiden which roughly translates to zelda side story would appear as a playable demo at nintendo space world exhibition on august 27 1999 media assumed that zelda gaiden was new working title for ura zelda screenshots of zelda gaiden released in august 1999 show unmistakable elements of final version of majora s mask such as large clock that dominates center of clock town timer at bottom of screen and goron mask story and gameplay details revealed later that month show that story concept as well as use of transformation masks were already in place that same month miyamoto confirmed that ura zelda and zelda gaiden were separate projects it was unclear if zelda gaiden was an offshoot of ura zelda or if two were always separate ura zelda might have become ocarina of time master quest outside japan and was released on a bonus disc for gamecube given to those who pre ordered wind waker in us and bundled with gamecube game in europe in november nintendo announced a holiday 2000 release date for zelda gaiden by march 2000 what ultimately became final titles were announced zelda no densetsu no kamen in japan and legend of zelda majora s mask elsewhere technical differences from ocarina of time thumb 4 mb expansion pak is required to run majora s mask majora s mask runs on an upgraded version of engine used in ocarina of time and requires use of 4 mb expansion pak making it one of two games that require said peripheral alongside donkey kong 64 ign theorizes this requirement is due to majora s masks possible origin as a nintendo 64dd game which would necessitate an extra 4 mb of ram use of expansion pak allows for greater draw distances more accurate dynamic lighting more detailed texture mapping and animation complex effects such as motion blur and more characters displayed on screen this expanded draw distance allows player to see much farther and eliminates need for fog effect and cardboard panorama seen in ocarina of time which were used to obscure distant areas ign considered texture design to be one of best created for nintendo 64 saying that although some textures have a low resolution they are colorful and diverse which gives each area its own unique look lastly building interiors are rendered in real time unlike fixed 3d display featured in ocarina of time music music was composed primarily by koji kondo with three tracks written by toru minegishi soundtrack largely consists of reworked music from ocarina of time complemented with other traditional zelda music such as overworld theme and new material kondo describes music as having an exotic chinese opera sound as three day cycle progresses theme song of clock town changes between three variations one for each day ign relates shift in music to a shift in game s atmosphere saying that quickened tempo of clock town music on second day conveys a sense of time passing quickly soundtrack was released on june 23 2000 featuring 112 tracks from game over two compact discs nintendo 3ds version after release of legend of zelda ocarina of time 3d a remake of ocarina of time for nintendo 3ds director eiji aonuma suggested that a majora s mask remake was not an impossibility depending on interest and demand following this news a fan campaign called operation moonfall was launched to promote remake of majora s mask on 3ds campaign name is a reference to a similar fan based movement operation rainfall set up to persuade nintendo of america to release a trio of role playing video games for wii petition reached 10 000 signatures within five days in response to feedback nintendo of america released a statement at risk of dampening excitement you feel i must be clear that no official announcements have been made regarding a remake of legend of zelda majora s mask for nintendo 3ds however we like hearing what our consumers find important in an interview with gamesradar in november 2011 zelda producer eiji aonuma acknowledged operation moonfall and told fans that he hopes to respond to their request sometime in future at e3 2012 miyamoto stated that a 3d remake was still under consideration once again shortly after e3 2013 miyamoto commented that fans supporting a majora s mask 3d remake were still in his memory on november 5 2014 nintendo announced
