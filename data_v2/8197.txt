not your kind of people is fifth studio album by american rock band garbage it was released on may 11 2012 through band s own record label stunvolume album marks return of band after a seven year hiatus that started with previous album bleed like me guitarist duke erikson said at launch of record that working with garbage again was very instinctual like getting on a bicycle with three other people band emphasized that they did not want to reinvent themselves but embrace their sonic identity reflecting their classic sound whilst updating it for 2012 although shirley manson s morose dispositions have a presence on record many of songs share a more optimistic outlook on life influenced by some of manson s personal experiences during their hiatus recorded mostly at various recording studios in california not your kind of people was produced by garbage and was engineered and mixed by billy bush album contains bass guitar parts recorded by justin meldal johnsen while finnish actress irina bjorklund performs musical saw on one track both daughters of band members steve marker and butch vig laid down vocals on album s title track photos for album package were shot by autumn de wilde at paramour mansion in silver lake los angeles not your kind of people was preceded by release of blood for poppies as lead single internationally while in united kingdom battle in me was marketed as album s lead single album also spawned three more singles automatic systematic habit big bright world and control not your kind of people received a generally positive reception from critics it debuted at number 17 on billboard 200 at number 10 on uk albums chart peaked at number three on billboard s independent albums chart and topped alternative albums chart background garbage decided to take a hiatus in 2005 following troubled production of their fourth studio album bleed like me and cutting short album s promotional tour aside from a reunion in 2007 to compose new tracks for compilation absolute garbage band members found themselves involved in various projects with butch vig producing green day foo fighters and muse while singer shirley manson recorded an unreleased solo album and made her professional acting debut as a series regular on terminator sarah connor chronicles in 2009 vig and manson met at funeral of pablo castelaz six year old son of records founder jeff castelaz and had a conversation where according to vig we felt like we had some unfinished business and we realized how precious life is and how important music has been in our lives manson suggested calling guitarists duke erikson and steve marker to get together and write some songs one week later group informally convened in los angeles where they laughed drank and reminisced of old days leaving behind tensions among them and general weariness that was partly responsible for their 2005 breakup they set up their equipment and started fucking around we were all pleased to notice on first day there just didn t seem to be any personal tensions vig recalled enough time had passed that any sort of weirdness or tension that had risen between us all had dissipated so it was easy there was no one telling us what to do we weren t signed to a label we were between managers so we made this on our own terms in that session group wrote song battle in me in mid 2010 entire group were in los angeles for a birthday where manson suggested they book a studio and spend time writing along with garbage s long time engineer and manson s husband billy bush band as bush described hung out for a couple weeks drank some wine and played a bunch of music three or four song ideas came together during this time but we didn t go right into making a record mode erikson recalled it took a bit of time for us to realize that we were going to make an album erikson described reconvening as a piecemeal process saying that it informally began with first phone conversations among them since their hiatus as they discussed playing together again after convening and composing and performing song ideas together through multiple sessions they then decided to move forward with band and embark on a full length album project took off in february 2011 when manson called vig proposing to reunite band and try making a new record manson convoked group out of an eagerness to make loud music again i m a loud person she proclaimed i love noise and aggression i crave contact i needed to make that connection again i think we all did to get something back up when there was absolutely no momentum took a herculean effort on everybody s part it s like pulling yourself out of mud even to stand back up and say we re going to take another swing at this was a scary feeling and i m proud of us for trying it s much easier to stay at home band members stated that following troublesome final years signed to geffen records being an independent act again helped improve their mood and approach with vig remarking there were no expectations no one even knew we were recording so it was all under radar and pretty casual and we all felt inspired after having that amount of time off when we started writing songs they came fast and furious we probably wrote 24 25 songs over course of a couple of months marker commented that business stuff ends up taking over some of that fun we got really bogged down in people s expectations of what we were supposed to be doing being on bigger record labels and stuff with all that behind us it was suddenly exciting again and it felt a lot like it did when we first formed which was really just sort of a fun idea that we had manson added people at record companies live in fear of being wrong music cannot thrive in that environment it is an unruly art form you can t keep treating it like sausage meat you have to let it morph and move and breathe manson stated that eliminating corporate pressure and indifference as well as band having a relaxed approach to making of record was pivotal for a healthy regroup writing and recording process we didn t put any pressure on ourselves to finish an album we just took our time and got together in two week blocks of time any longer than that i m sure we would have started getting on each others nerves so we did two weeks and then we d take some time off and then when everybody felt ready we d get back in studio again as a result i think everybody really enjoyed our time together and really plugged in she remarked never much enjoying being in a studio manson relished record making process this time around recording unlike previous albums which were done at vig s smart studios in madison wisconsin not your kind of people was mostly recorded in los angeles where both vig and manson live smart was only used for some of erikson s parts as he was only bandmember still in wisconsin working process was also different while previous records had band gathering for an entire year at smart studios band would instead work two weeks per month in los angeles with erikson and marker flying in from wisconsin and colorado respectively then spend another two weeks in their home studios while e mailing ideas back and forth to develop songs manson would also visit vig s grungeisdead studio to experiment with vocals then they would get back together in studio which according to marker would be fun again because we hadn t seen these people for a couple of weeks first recordings were done in two weeks of jam sessions at pass in studio city band then moved to bush s studio red razor sounds at atwater village where engineer did a rough mix of tracks vig declared that album s mood emerged from combination of trashy and lo tech studio which he compared to a small clubhouse with band s protools and samplers band had a looser approach to recording and mixing compared to nano editing of version 2 0 band worked on 25 or 26 songs during album sessions while a few were still bits and pieces vig stated they might finish them as further bonus tracks b sides or as part of an ep at a later point erikson said that bonus tracks of deluxe edition are songs that were not ready in time to join regular track list he also said that while most songs were new compositions some were old ideas such as 10 years old or something track show me throughout recording sessions for album band mentioned several song titles via facebook and twitter these included alone animal choose your weapon time will destroy everything and t r o u b l e manson confirmed on twitter that animal became one a song from deluxe version while time will destroy everything was released as b side to band s 2014 record store day single girls talk composition and style according to vig not your kind of people evokes ambient vibes of garbage s first two albums garbage and version 2 0 there s lots of elements of things we ve always loved noisy guitars big electronic beats atmospheric film moments adding that band wanted to make a record sound like something that we want to hear when we re driving car while record was reminiscent vibe wise of band s early work production aimed for a rawer sound instead of cleaning up sound through computers to capture a performance and sound kind of trashy and for songs to blow out a little bit vig said we tried to leave a lot of performance raw on this album a lot of songs we sort of throw paint at wall and some of it sticks and some of it drips off he explained that group avoided reinventing themselves we wanted to just embrace exactly who we are and what we like to do and just sort of update it sonically for 2012 for better or worse when we approach a song it s going to end up sounding like garbage i think we have a strong sonic identity and i think that s an asset these days manson similarly noted that what mattered most was record sounding authentic to who they are as a band manson considered that while record recalled band s classic sound it fits in with radio programming right now she said that they are interested in also reaching a new generation and regarding their distinct sound we don t sound like anyone else on radio much to our surprise there hasn t been another band like ours since we came off road like band s earlier releases album features a variety of guitar configurations as well as electronic synths erikson said that initially they gather with standard guitar bass drum and keyboard gear and as they pass around different ideas and implement them songs take form in any which way a session takes them once we started on album proper it became a garbage record which is any number of approaches to writing a recording there were no rules certainly he explained a song like automatic systematic habit features more electronics than guitars and big bright world a guitar heavy song involves configurations that make some of guitars sound like synths guitar parts are normally divvied between guitarists marker and erikson erikson said it comes down to whoever comes up with what at any given time there s no job description as far as lead guitar rhythm guitar it s just whoever has an idea as a articular moment it s usually about 50 50 erikson and marker used a variety of guitars and pedals old new and defective vig recalled that title not your kind of people came to him when he was stuck in a traffic jam in los angeles he manson idea for a title and she loved it manson wrote all lyrics that night and next day four of them gathered with acoustic guitars and wrote music to song in about half an hour manson explained that album title not your kind of people was a call to arms in a way to anyone who feels like we do about world saying that it can be great to be outsider she felt that this applied to them as band never fit into a music scene and that in my life i ve never been an insider manson also described title as a two fingered salute to people who reject or criticize us stating band was only really interested in people who share our outlook as she considered that their fans were people who connect with what you re saying and how you say it most of lyrics were written by manson as she included and filtered some of her bandmates ideas on songwriting it was a very do it yourself homemade thing when it comes down to it erikson explained we all pitch in shirley had just as many comments on guitar parts or sound of guitars as anybody else and likewise if we don t like a lyric we say it right away many songs have a more optimistic view in life inspired by manson overcoming a desire to quit music after death of her mother and realizing how important her work is to her darker themes still appear as manson described herself as enthusiastic and passionate but i do see death marching toward me blood for poppies came from a lot of things manson said it s really an analogy for a story i read about afghanistan and opium wars over there it s from a few stories one about a platoon of soldiers in afghanistan and other about opium wars i use that as a backdrop for a story about maintaining sanity in an out of control place it s about remaining sane when faced with insanity she added i hate love criticized commercialized idea of love and what pain that puts us through along with knowing that there will be no more torture in your life than really truly loving somebody who doesn t love you back big bright world contains a lyrical sample from poem do not go gentle into that good night by dylan thomas both daughters of steve marker and butch vig laid down vocals on album s title track finnish actress irina bjorklund performs musical saw on sugar beloved freak includes a sample of klaus nomi as group felt artist fit manson s lyrics about people being an outsider feeling like a freak and not fitting in and trying to come to terms with that it s okay to feel like you re an outsider kroq fm and mtv buzzworthy described sound of album as electronic rock huffington post noted band has maintained their signature dark driving trip hoppy sound while jason heller of a v club wrote that group s shoegaze influences are more in vogue now than they were 15

like getting on a bicycle with three other people erikson added we haven t felt this good about a garbage record since last one los angeles based studio smog design handled album s artwork and creative campaign featuring band photographs by autumn de wilde according to duke erikson for cover there was some art that we wanted to do but we didn t want to spend what artist wanted us to so instead of a very colorful and complex cover they opted to go other way and be simplistic with only a lowercase g singles blood for poppies was confirmed as lead single to launch album song was made

touring upon release of not your kind of people marking band s first live performances since 2007 and their first tour since 2005 thinking about going back on road is both thrilling and terrifying in equal measure manson stated but we ve always enjoyed a little pain mixed in with our pleasure manson considered that self reflection helped change way group approached touring and as a result we re playing best shows of our career eric avery who performed with band during their bleed like me tour rejoined them as tour bassist band played concerts throughout north and south america europe oceania and asia critical your kind of people received generally positive reviews from critics at metacritic which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics it received a weighted average score of 63 based on 28 reviews indicating generally favorable reviews in his review for guardian dave simpson gave album four out of five stars stating that it returns to blueprint of their first two best albums while lessening electronics and augmenting crunchy guitars with a contemporary production he praised title track deeming it a surprise and a beautiful otherworldly cross between a john barry bond theme and a david bowie outsider anthem cameron adams of courier mail wrote that musically they still find that sweet spot between motown and nirvana via pretenders and prodigy and considered it refreshing that band is still pushing pop music to its darkest limits allmusics stephen thomas erlewine said that unlike their previous two albums there is no grappling with new sounds and styles only an embrace of thick aural onslaught of stupid girl and vow he complimented manson s keenly aware lyrics and said that their hooks are efficiently delivered while no flab in either composition or production is evident he summarized album as a simultaneous testament and revival of their strengths but what once was futuristic now sounds nostalgic tim grierson wrote in about group that out of many 90s bands that reunited in last few years none have done it with as much gusto as garbage as they return with their sexy edgy vibe intact and manson sounds as ferocious and bruised as ever bangkok post noted that band stick s firmly to their 90s alt rock guns their fuzzy guitar catchy hook formula continues to dominate album and amidst fuzz and electronics title track sugar and beloved freak do offer moments of relatively quiet bliss songs that refreshingly showcase essence of manson s voice it is proposed however that apart from older devoted 90 s fans album probably won t connect with contemporary audiences in his review for time adam kivel likewise stated that album is most likely to resonate with fans of 90 s alternative fusion characterizing it as an anomaly in current musical climate and not likely to gain significant radio play lindsay zoladz of pitchfork media summarized album as a statement from a band that s stuck to its guns times have changed but garbage haven t and now for better and for worse they ve at last become alternative to everything nme writer rick martin despite hearing flashes of their previous class proving they haven t completely lost their confrontational electro rock streak considered too much of it pedestrian anodyne and utterly unremarkable and wondered why they ever ditched near perfect mid 90s fm rock of stupid girl bbc music writer tom felt that band s relocation to l a made no discernible difference to band s sound but that despite occasional lapses into overproduced mess surprise here is their enthusiasm similarly jamie carson of clash disapproved of production calling it and annoying and mark davison of no ripcord remarked that for all interesting noises that band have come up production really doesn t do them any favours cramming them into a fairly narrow space and stripping them almost entirely of any sense of atmosphere concluding that album is nonetheless enjoyable and will probably go down better than their last two releases not your kind of people was listed at number 44 on rolling stones list of top 50 albums of 2012 commercial performance in united states not your
