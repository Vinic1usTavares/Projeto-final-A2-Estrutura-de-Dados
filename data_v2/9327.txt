cracker barrel licensed its name to smithfield foods john morrell division in a deal to create a line of meat products to be sold in supermarkets and through other retail channels in response kraft foods filed a trademark infringement lawsuit in february 2013 kraft has sold cheese in retail stores under their cracker barrel brand since 1954 corporation said that cracker barrel stores have not made significant sales of retail food products beyond their restaurant menu and asked that smithfield foods deal be nullified by u s district court in northern district of illinois on november 14 2013 in a unanimous ruling authored by judge richard posner seventh circuit court of appeals upheld a ruling by a lower district court judge granting an injunction against sale of cracker barrel s meat products to be sold in stores seventh circuit upheld injunction based on combined similarity of parties marks goods and channels of trade it s not fact that parties trade are so similar that is decisive nor even fact that products are similar low cost packaged food items it is those similarities coupled with fact that if cracker barrel prevails in this suit similar products with confusingly similar trade names will be sold through same distribution channel grocery stores and often same grocery stores and advertised together in judge posner s estimation these similarities despite differences in parties respective logos and regardless of where products are located in relation to each other in grocery stores might lead consumers to think all kraft products bearing cracker barrel name were produced in association with defendant in economics this behavior is referred to as traditional forward confusion court further concluded likelihood of confusion was exacerbated by fact that both products at issue were inexpensive thus consumers were unlikely to scrutinize their respective labels in response to ruling kraft foods and cracker barrel made an agreement regarding use of cracker barrel name in exchange for kraft dropping trademark infringement lawsuit cracker barrel agreed to sell its products under brand name cb old country store see also cracker barrel country store
