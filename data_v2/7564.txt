regiments were systematically pushed south in battles around chochiwon chonan and pyongtaek division made a final stand in battle of taejon and was almost completely destroyed but delayed kpa forces from advancing until july 20 by that time eighth army s combat troops were roughly equal to kpa forces attacking region at around 70 000 for each side with new un units arriving every day us 1st

ships could not be unloaded at pusan and eighth army rations dropped to one day s supply however landings were entirely unopposed by north korean forces transfer of 750 noncommissioned officers ncos from 1st cavalry division to 24th and 25th infantry divisions a move aimed at strengthening infantry divisions combat missions in korea had weakened 1st cavalry division it had been stripped of practically every nco except first sergeants of companies and batteries in division even though it had received 1 450 replacements before it left japan 100 of them from eighth army stockade division was understrength when it landed in korea and like preceding divisions it had only two battalions in its three regiments two firing batteries in artillery battalions and one tank company with m24 light tanks on july 19 5th cavalry regiment started toward taejon next day 8th cavalry regiment followed by railroad and in trucks and reformed in an assembly area east of yongdong that evening brigadier general charles d palmer division artillery commander took charge of these two forward regiments on july 22 8th cavalry regiment relieved us 24th infantry regiment 24th infantry division from its positions at yongdong at that point 1st cavalry division assumed responsibility for blocking kpa along main taejon taegu corridor to pusan 24th division s troops retreated through 1st cavalry division s lines as newly arrived soldiers advanced to their new defensive positions that day once it was fully assembled in city 1st cavalry division was ordered to move north of yongdong and set up defensive positions division moved one battalion of 8th cavalry northwest of yongdong on south side of kum river and another battalion southwest of yongdong first would cover approach along main taejon taegu highway second approach on ni road gay placed 5th cavalry regiment on high ground east of town in a blocking position by july 19 division numbered 10 027 men in korea this move coincided with a reorganization of rok consolidating their lines and making room for new division on july 22 1st cavalry division had finished preparing its defensive positions north of yongdong as battered 24th infantry division was moved to naktong bulge area along naktong river at same time 25th infantry division moved to sangju where it was caught in a battle with kpa forces in that town battle opening moves kpa quickly advanced after battle of taejon with four of their divisions attacking south from city along four different roads kpa 3rd division departed city on july 22 advancing down main highway toward taegu and yongdong to where 1st cavalry division was emplaced next morning july 23 1st battalion 8th cavalry regiment in front of yongdong reported it had destroyed three kpa t 34 tanks with 3 5 inch rocket launchers in its first use of that weapon on july 23 7th and 9th regiments of kpa 3rd division began their attack on yongdong defensive positions held by 1st cavalry division they made their first penetration southwest of yongdong establishing a roadblock behind 2nd battalion 8th cavalry and at same time other kpa units heavily engaged 1st battalion northwest of yongdong in frontal attack next day american m24 tanks attacked roadblock behind 2nd battalion four times in an attempt to break it but all were unsuccessful and lieutenant colonel eugene j field 2nd battalion commander was wounded at roadblock palmer sent 1st battalion 5th cavalry regiment and 16th reconnaissance company toward cut off battalion by 12 00 kpa troops were attacking 99th and 61st field artillery battalions which were supporting 2nd battalion 8th cavalry regiment indicating that kpa infiltration had been extensive by that point fighting on roads on other main approach to yongdong a road northwest of city heavy machine gun fire and 37 mm fire from a battery of 92nd antiaircraft artillery battalion and artillery fire from 77th field artillery battalion helped 1st battalion there to repel kpa attacks however large numbers of civilian refugees crowding yongdong area trying to move south helped kpa infiltrate 1st cavalry division s positions eighth army tried to control refugee movement through korean national police permitting it only during daylight hours and along predetermined routes kpa continued to move into city in civilian clothing with concealed weapons and us troops started shooting any koreans moving through their lines at night chain of command which issued these orders is not clear as they were generally not put on paper however these orders are thought to have contributed to war crimes committed against civilians by 1st cavalry division namely no gun ri massacre which took place around time of fighting at yongdong in no gun ri incident us soldiers are alleged to have killed a number of korean civilians believing them to be military infiltrators by morning of july 25 kpa forces had infiltrated positions of 1st cavalry division so thoroughly that they were disrupting its lines of supply and gay ordered division to withdrawal and re form its lines further south northwest of yongdong 1st battalion executed an orderly withdrawal covered by fire of heavy mortar company and two batteries of 77th field artillery battalion mortar operators fought as infantry in withdrawal during these retreats kpa troops disguised themselves as refugees and would form roadblocks in un troops rear areas or used hidden communications equipment to inform higher commands of un concentrations so those concentrations could be attacked when they were most vulnerable meanwhile kpa intensified their attack on 2nd battalion on road southwest of yongdong concentrated artillery support with shells falling so close to 2nd battalion positions that they wounded four us troops together with an attack by 2nd battalion briefly opened kpa roadblock at 04 30 july 25 and bulk of battalion escaped to yongdong however f company of 8th cavalry 16th reconnaissance company and 1st platoon of a company 71st tank battalion at rear of column were cut off only four of 11 light tanks broke through kpa positions crews abandoned other seven tanks and walked over hills in a two days journey as part of a group of 219 men most of them from f company all equipment except individual arms was abandoned by this group other groups of us troops escaped in same manner kpa had flanked 1st cavalry division in a double envelopment and forced them to withdraw in process division lost much of its equipment in its quick withdrawal actions on this same road closer to yongdong 2nd battalion 5th cavalry which was trying to help cutoff units of 8th cavalry was itself attacked by strong kpa units through some error us battalion s f company advanced to wrong hill and stumbled into a concentration of kpa soldiers only 26 men from f company returned rest were killed or captured in subsequent ambush altogether 5th cavalry regiment suffered 275 casualties on july 25 american withdrawal kpa 3rd division used essentially same tactics it employed against 24th infantry division at taejon against 1st cavalry division at yongdong in both fights kpa opened with a direct frontal attack to hold us division s elements in combat and then bulk of kpa force enveloped american left flank and established strongly held roadblocks behind front positions and forced americans in them to retreat from untenable positions kpa 3rd division entered yongdong night of july 25 at least one kpa unit was in town by 20 00 kpa expected a counterattack and immediately took up defensive positions at eastern edge of town however us troops had withdrawn 1st cavalry division troops set up another delaying action around hwanggan and hit kpa advance a second time in battle of hwanggan several days later aftermath north korean prisoners of war captured by us troops during battle reported that kpa 3rd division suffered about 2 000 casualties mostly from artillery fire in attack on yongdong on july 24 25 this brought it down to a strength of about 5 000 men approximately half strength it had when war began 1st cavalry division s actions were able to delay kpa advance for several days giving un forces valuable time to set up pusan perimeter un losses after this battle and subsequent fight at hwanggan cost 1st cavalry division 916 casualties defeat was a poor showing for division but its record quickly improved with experience and it became a more reliable fighting unit by time it was placed on pusan perimeter references notes citations
