lgbt themes in american mainstream comics is a relatively new concept as lesbian gay bisexual and transgender lgbt themes and characters were historically omitted intentionally from content of comic books due to either formal censorship or perception that comics were for children and thus lgbt themes were somehow inappropriate with any mention of homosexuality in mainstream united states comics forbidden by comics code authority cca until 1989 earlier attempts at exploring these issues in us took form of subtle hints or subtext regarding a character s sexual orientation lgbt themes were tackled earlier in underground comix from early 1970s onward independently published one off comic books and series often produced by gay creators and featuring autobiographical storylines tackled political issues of interest to lgbt readers mainstream comics genre of superhero comics published in united states since late 1930s have historically excluded gay characters and superhero genre and its two largest publishing houses marvel comics and dc comics have been criticised for their lack of inclusivity transgender characters have likewise been under represented although common storyline of a superhero having their sex changed by magical or technological means has been regarded as an oblique reference to transgender and transsexual issues queer theory analyses have noted that lgbt characters in mainstream comic books are often shown as assimilated into heterosexual society whereas in alternative comics diversity and uniqueness of lgbt culture is at forefront mainstream comics have also been labelled as heteronormative in comparison to integrationist alternative comics since 1990s lgbt themes have become more common in mainstream us comics including in a number of titles in which a gay character is star censorship criticism and inclusivity for much of 20th century creators were strongly discouraged from depicting gay relationships in comic books which were regarded as a medium for children until 1989 comics code authority cca which imposed de facto censorship on comics sold through newsstands in united states forbade any suggestion of homosexuality and lgbt characters were excluded from comics bearing cca seal cca itself came into being in response to fredric wertham s seduction of innocent in which comic book creators were accused of attempting to negatively influence children with images of violence and sexuality including subliminal homosexuality wertham claimed that wonder woman s strength and independence made her a lesbian and stated that batman type of story may stimulate children to homosexual fantasies storytellers subsequently had to drop subtle hints while not stating directly a character s orientation overt gay and lesbian themes were first found later in underground and alternative titles which did not carry cca s seal of approval in recent years number of lgbt characters in mainstream superhero comics has increased greatly at first gay characters appeared in supporting roles but their roles have become increasingly prominent trend has prompted both praise from lgbt community and organizations like gay lesbian alliance against defamation glaad and criticism from conservative groups critics make regular accusations that comics are attempting to subvert readers into a gay lifestyle trying to lure young american boys into kinky web of homosexuality and aids according to writer devin grayson amount of creative freedom allowed by editors in portrayal of lgbt characters depends upon how popular and established a character already is long standing characters that would require a retcon to change their sexuality are less likely to be shown as lgbt than newer characters when such changes to a character s continuity are made fans are often disgruntled particularly when sexuality is involved furey p 4 and alan moore suggests that creating a new character is preferable scott lobdell claims that it is more often fans rather than editors that have stronger negative reaction to lgbt issues moore notes however that it s probably quite fashionable to have odd gay character and that inclusion of lgbt people continues to improve in mainstream comics but that characters continue to be limited by stereotypes and do not represent a varied cross section of lgbt people greg rucka says that some scenes of same sex interactions are rejected by editors due to unease with sexual content in general rather than lgbt content on other hand inclusion of lgbt issues attract media attention in which hype makes some fans and creators uncomfortable faust points out for example that gay marriage in a comic issue is treated almost as an event when that series had already been significant with openly gay characters lobdell while wondering about attention media gives gay characters hopes that in near future they will not make news at all because they are as common as capes and cowls dc pre 1990s encyclopedia of gay histories and cultures 2000 notes that gay subtext can be found in dc comics publications as early as golden age of comic books with readers inferring homosexuality between superheroes and their same sex sidekicks and on women only paradise island batman s relationship with robin has famously come under scrutiny in spite of majority of creators associated with character denying that character is gay psychologist fredric wertham who in seduction of innocent asserted that batman stories are psychologically homosexual claimed to find a subtle atmosphere of homoeroticism which pervades adventures of mature batman and his young friend robin it has also been claimed that batman is interesting to gay audiences because he was one of first fictional characters to be attacked on grounds of his presumed homosexuality and 1960s tv series remains a touchstone of camp frank miller has described joker as a homophobic nightmare and views character as sublimating his sexual urges into crime fighting burt ward has also remarked upon this interpretation in his autobiography noting that relationship between two could be interpreted as a sexual one when creating character of jericho in teen titans marv wolfman and george perez considered making him gay which would have marked one of first appearances of a gay character in a major super hero book however they ultimately passed on idea after concluding that it would be too stereotypical to make sensitive artistic effeminate featured jericho a homosexual first obviously gay character was an effeminate hispanic man whose name means strange in spanish who was created by steve englehart and joe staton and appeared in millennium and new guardians in 1987 first appearance in millennium 2 1987 new guardians was not successful but during its short run it also featured a character dying of aids an official aftermath to millennium spectre vol 2 11 depicted a mostly male and mostly gay aids rally several characters including enchantress describing them as filthy disgusting men and a police helicopter pilot named ed screaming about fags are influenced into attempting to crush rally by a seven headed spirit thanks to actions of spectre doctor fate deadman madame xanadu and ben turner men are saved previous to this in hugely influential watchmen 1986 one of central characters ozymandias is referred to as possibly homosexual by rorschach who critics have interpreted as asexual watchmen 1 1986 series also strongly implied that minor characters hooded justice and captain metropolis were gay and that silhouette was kicked off minutemen superhero team when she was publicly outed as a lesbian in watchmen and philosophy mark white and william irwin write that gay relationships in watchmen remain ambiguous as lots of are out by and also that watchmen is particularly surprising and challenges preconceptions of homosexuality as if it s true that hooded justice and captain metropolis are gay they sure as heck don t act or look like they are gay alan moore was described by afterelton com writer lyle masaki as very gay friendly due to his inclusion of complex lgbt characters and realistic treatment of lgbt issues in watchmen and v for vendetta 1990s early 1990s saw a few more lgbt minor characters portrayed in dc titles transsexual themes were explored in a 1992 storyline in legion of super heroes in which element lad finds out that shvaughn erin woman he is in love with is actually a man who has taken a sex change drug to be with him element lad subsequently reveals that he prefers shvaughn as a male in legion of super heroes 31 1992 a lesbian relationship was also implied between legion of super heroes shrinking violet and lightning lass but all these non heterosexual characters were retconned during zero hour reboot to be straight camelot 3000 also explored transsexual themes by having sir tristan reincarnated into body of a woman to his initial dismay camelot 3000 1 12 1997 notable storylines featuring lgbt themes include 1991 s flash vol 2 53 which had received first glaad award for best comic book in 1992 here reformed villain pied piper was revealed as gay another is coming out of kyle rayner s assistant and an arc about his gay bashing in green lantern both written by judd in green lantern 137 june 2001 and 154 november 2001

patrol introduced a number of lgbt characters and explored transsexual themes doom patrol s base of operations in later stories is sentient transvestite street danny street danny is named after british female impersonator danny la rue and dresses in drag by hosting typically masculine shops such as gun shops but decorating them in bright frilly patterns and pastel curtains his inclusion is described by timothy callahan as part of increasingly absurd tone of book from twentieth issue created by grant morrison and brendan mccarthy and first appeared in doom patrol vol 2 35 august 1990 one member of team is transsexual bisexual coagula who can coagulate liquids and dissolve solids created by transsexual fantasy writer rachel pollack coagula gains her powers while working as a prostitute one of her customers is a radioactive hermaphrodite and coagula gains her powers after having sex with them first appearance in dc comics has a number of imprints including wildstorm and vertigo wildstorm was originally a studio producing work for image comics which is noted to have a greater proportion of lgbt characters vertigo is an imprint that produces comics for more mature audiences allowing more sexual themes george haggerty notes in gay histories and cultures an encyclopedia that substantive mainstream presentation of gay themes in future seems most likely in dc s adult orientated vertigo titles vertigo titles that have tackled lgbt themes include sandman shade changing man and enigma sandman a game of you 1991 had a transsexual character and its creator neil gaiman said that he included transgender characters in his works in response to lack of realistic representation of such people in comics title character of shade changing man was an alien who could change his surface form this resulted in people sometimes perceiving him as female and although he remained essentially male it was implied that he had relationships with both genders enigma 1992 deconstructed superhero genre with title characters homosexuality playing a large part john constantine protagonist of hellblazer was first hinted as bisexual in 1992 and confirmed in 2002 hellblazer 51 1992 hellblazer 170 2002 in television series however constantine was portrayed straight due to nbc guidelines which brought on criticism from both critics and fans an example of a gay character in a starring role is violent vigilante superhero midnighter who appears in comic books first published by wildstorm first appearance vol 2 4 1998 batman like midnighter was revealed to be in a relationship with superman like apollo during their time as members of superhero team authority portrayal of relationship was initially subtle with writer warren ellis not informing artist of his intentions however dc editorial board still censored a kiss between two characters in 2000 described as first openly gay couple in comics midnighter and apollo married in a later issue and have an adopted daughter midnighter starred in his own solo title from 2006 midnighter comic was criticised by francois for ignoring protagonist s relationship with his husband and also for continual use of homophobic insults by villains criticism has also been leveled at a storyline in which apollo is raped with critics saying that straight superheroes are never subjected to such treatment alan moore pointed to characters as an example of comics strange attitude towards lgbt themes describing them as vicious muscle queens furey p 1 starting 2015 midnighter once again stars in his own solo series published from dc comics making him first gay male superhero to have his own series in a mainstream publisher 2000s manhunter created by mark andreyko in 2004 caused reaction in fan community when it

justice league and later struggled to come to terms with his sexuality but it wasn t until his appearances manhunter that character was revealed to be gay and to have accepted his homosexuality andreyko said that making character openly gay could be seen as a retcon but that this seemed a logical step in character s growth homosexual interpretations of batman have continued into 21st century one notable example occurred in 2000 when dc comics refused permission for reprinting of four panels from batman 79 92 105 and 139 to illustrate christopher york s paper all in family homophobia and batman comics in 1950s in summer 2005 painter mark chamberlain displayed a number of watercolours depicting both batman and robin in suggestive and sexually explicit poses dc threatened both artist and kathleen cullen fine arts gallery with legal action if they did not cease selling works and demanded surrender of all remaining art as well as any profits derived from them in 2006 dc drew

existed in dc comics it was revealed at 2009 new york comic con that she would be dc comics highest profile gay superhero appearing in a new justice league comic book written by james robinson and taking over as lead character in detective comics with issue 854 greg rucka said that dc s editors had no problem with his writing montoya or batwoman as lesbian but media controversy over batwoman s sexuality nullified any positive effect batwoman might have had on industry and forced character into minor roles during major crossover storylines in 2011 batwoman gained her own title as part of new

says haters need to get over it about marvel 1990s marvel comics incorporation of lgbt themes has been unfavorably compared with that of dc its use of gay characters has been described as less prolific but more deliberate marvel reportedly had a no gays in marvel universe policy during jim shooter s 1980s tenure and marvel s policy from 1990s had stated that all series emphasizing solo gay characters must carry an adults only label in response to conservative protests yet in 2006 publisher joe quesada claimed that this policy is no longer in force although same sex couples are depicted

world discrimination directed at minority groups including lgbt people kaplan p 59 alpha flight s northstar a member of original alpha flight superhero team was first major gay character created by marvel comics creator john byrne said that northstar was planned to be gay from his inception in 1979 haggerty p 326 but although hints about northstar s sexual identity appeared during 1983 in issues 7 and 8 of alpha flight his apparent lack of interest in women was attributed to his obsessive drive to win as a ski champion character was finally revealed to be gay in 1992 s alpha flight issue 106

northstar has never been shown kissing another man although many interactions with other gay characters are shown as in marvel swimsuit special in which he is shown socializing with gay pantheon

some negative reactions including accusations of homophobia particularly with respect to phallic imagery of death with character being killed by being impaled with spikes prism comics kirkman commented on controversy stating freedom ring was always planned as an inexperienced hero who would get beaten up constantly and probably die i wanted to comment on fact that most superheroes get their powers and are okay at it and that s not how life works during working on book i was also noticing that most gay characters are all about being gay straight characters are well rounded characters who like chicks so i wanted to do a well rounded character who just happened to like dudes then i decided to combine two ideas in hindsight yeah killing a gay character is no good when there are so few of them but i really had only best of intentions in mind robert kirkman image comics community freedom ring controversy http www com image comics march 25 2005 retrieved november 4 2008 kirkman later stated frankly with small amount of gay characters in comics in general and how unfortunate portrayals have been thus far whether intentional or not i completely understand backlash
