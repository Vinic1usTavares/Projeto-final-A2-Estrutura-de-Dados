afghanistan sent by central powers in 1915 1916 purpose was to encourage afghanistan to declare full independence from british empire enter world war i on side of central powers and attack british india expedition was part of hindu german conspiracy a series of indo german efforts to provoke a nationalist revolution in india nominally headed by exiled indian prince raja mahendra pratap expedition was a joint operation of germany and turkey and was led by german army officers oskar niedermayer and werner otto von hentig other participants included members of an indian nationalist organisation called berlin committee including maulavi barkatullah and pillai while turks were represented by kazim bey a close confidante of enver pasha britain saw expedition as a serious threat britain and its ally russian empire unsuccessfully attempted to intercept it in persia during summer of 1915 britain waged a covert intelligence and diplomatic offensive including personal interventions by viceroy lord hardinge and king george v to maintain afghan neutrality mission failed in its main task of rallying afghanistan under emir habibullah khan to german and turkish war effort but it influenced other major events in afghanistan expedition triggered reforms and drove political turmoil that culminated in assassination of emir in 1919 which in turn precipitated third afghan war it influenced kalmyk project of nascent bolshevik russia to propagate socialist revolution in asia with one goal being overthrow of british raj other consequences included formation of rowlatt committee to investigate sedition in india as influenced by germany and bolshevism and changes in raj s approach to indian independence movement immediately after world war i background in august 1914 world war i began when alliance obligations arising from war between serbia and austria hungary brought germany and russia to war while germany s invasion of belgium directly triggered britain s entry after a series of military events and political intrigues russia declared war on turkey in november turkey then joined central powers in fighting entente powers in response to war with russia and britain and further motivated by its alliance with turkey germany accelerated its plans to weaken its enemies by targeting their colonial empires including russia in turkestan and britain in india using political agitation germany began by nurturing its pre war links with indian nationalists who had for years used germany turkey persia united states and other countries as bases for anti colonial work directed against britain as early as 1913 revolutionary publications in germany began referring to approaching war between germany and britain and possibility of german support for indian nationalists in war s early months german newspapers devoted considerable coverage to indian distress its social problems and british colonial exploitation german chancellor theobald von bethmann hollweg encouraged this activity effort was led by prominent archaeologist and historian max von oppenheim who headed new intelligence bureau for east and formed berlin committee which was later renamed indian independence committee berlin committee offered money arms and military advisors according to plans made by german foreign office and indian revolutionaries in exile such as members of ghadar party in north america planners hoped to trigger a nationalist rebellion using clandestine shipments of men and arms sent to india from elsewhere in asia and from united states thumb mehmed v sultan of turkey was then regarded as caliph by a substantial part of islamic world in turkey and persia nationalist work had begun by 1909 under leadership of sardar ajit singh and sufi amba prasad reports from 1910 indicate that germany was already contemplating efforts to threaten india through turkey persia and afghanistan germany had built close diplomatic and economic relationships with turkey and persia from late 19th century von oppenheim had mapped turkey and persia while working as a secret agent kaiser toured constantinople damascus and jerusalem in 1898 to bolster turkish relationship and to portray solidarity with islam a religion professed by millions of subjects of british empire in india and elsewhere referring to kaiser as haji wilhelm intelligence bureau for east spread propaganda throughout region fostering rumours that kaiser had converted to islam following a secret trip to mecca and portraying him as a saviour of islam led by enver pasha a coup in turkey in 1913 sidelined sultan mehmed v and concentrated power in hands of a junta despite secular nature of new government turkey retained its traditional influence over muslim world turkey ruled hejaz until arab revolt of 1916 and controlled muslim holy city of mecca throughout war sultan s title of caliph was recognised as legitimate by most muslims including those in afghanistan and india once at war turkey joined germany in taking aim at opposing entente powers and their extensive empires in muslim world enver pasha had sultan proclaim jihad his hope was to provoke and aid a vast muslim revolution particularly in india translations of proclamation were sent to berlin for propaganda purposes for distribution to muslim troops of entente powers however while widely heard proclamation did not have intended effect of mobilising global muslim opinion on behalf of turkey or central powers early in war emir of afghanistan declared neutrality emir feared sultan s call to jihad would have a destabilising influence on his subjects turkey s entry into war aroused widespread nationalist and pan islamic sentiments in afghanistan and persia anglo russian entente of 1907 designated afghanistan to british sphere of influence britain nominally controlled afghanistan s foreign policy and emir received a monetary subsidy from britain in reality however britain had almost no effective control over afghanistan british perceived afghanistan to be only state capable of invading india which remained a serious threat first afghan expedition in first week of august 1914 german foreign office and members of military suggested attempting to use pan islamic movement to destabilise british empire and begin an indian revolution argument was reinforced by germanophile explorer sven hedin in berlin two weeks later general staff memoranda in last weeks of august confirmed perceived feasibility of plan predicting that an invasion by afghanistan could cause a revolution in india with outbreak of war revolutionary unrest increased in india some hindu and muslim leaders secretly left to seek help of central powers in fomenting revolution pan islamic movement in india particularly darul uloom deoband made plans for an insurrection in north west frontier province with support from afghanistan and central powers mahmud al hasan principal of deobandi school left india to seek help of galib pasha turkish governor of hijaz while another deoband leader maulana ubaidullah sindhi travelled to kabul to seek support of emir of afghanistan they initially planned to raise an islamic army headquartered at medina with an indian contingent at kabul mahmud al hasan was to command this army while at kabul maulana came to conclusion that focusing on indian freedom movement would best serve pan islamic cause ubaidullah proposed to afghan emir that he declare war against britain maulana abul kalam azad was also involved in movement prior to his arrest in 1916 enver pasha conceived an expedition to afghanistan in 1914 he envisioned it as a pan islamic venture directed by turkey with some german participation german delegation to this expedition chosen by oppenheim and zimmermann included oskar niedermayer and wilhelm wassmuss an escort of nearly a thousand turkish troops and german advisers was to accompany delegation through persia into afghanistan where they hoped to rally local tribes to jihad in an ineffective ruse germans attempted to reach turkey by travelling overland through austria hungary in guise of a travelling circus eventually reaching neutral romania their equipment arms and mobile radios were confiscated when romanian officials discovered wireless aerials sticking out through packaging of tent poles replacements could not be arranged for weeks delegation waited at constantinople to reinforce islamic identity of expedition it was suggested that germans wear turkish army uniforms but they refused differences between turkish and german officers including reluctance of germans to accept turkish control further compromised effort eventually expedition was aborted attempted expedition had a significant consequence wassmuss left constantinople to organise tribes in south persia to act against british interests while evading british capture in persia wassmuss inadvertently abandoned his codebook its recovery by britain allowed allies to decipher german communications including zimmermann telegram in 1917 niedermayer led group following wassmuss s departure second expedition in 1915 a second expedition was organised mainly through german foreign office and indian leadership of berlin committee germany was now extensively involved in indian revolutionary conspiracy and provided it with arms and funds lala har dayal prominent among indian radicals liaising with germany was expected to lead expedition when he declined exiled indian prince raja mahendra pratap was named leader composition mahendra pratap was head of indian princely states of and hathras he had been involved with indian national congress in 1900s attending congress session of 1906 he toured world in 1907 and 1911 and in 1912 contributed substantial funds to gandhi s south african movement pratap left india for geneva at beginning of war where he was met by virendranath chattopadhyaya of berlin committee chattopadhyaya s efforts along with a letter from kaiser convinced pratap to lend his support to indian nationalist cause on condition that arrangements were made with kaiser himself a private audience with kaiser was arranged at which pratap agreed to nominally head expedition prominent among german members of delegation were niedermayer and von hentig von hentig was a prussian military officer who had served as military attache to beijing in 1910 and constantinople in 1912 fluent in persian he was appointed secretary of german legation to tehran in 1913 von hentig was serving on eastern front as a lieutenant with prussian 3rd cuirassiers when he was recalled to berlin for expedition like von hentig niedermayer had served in constantinople before war and spoke fluent persian and other regional languages a bavarian artillery officer and a graduate from university of erlangen niedermayer had travelled in persia and india in two years preceding war he returned to persia to await further orders after first afghan expedition was aborted niedermayer was tasked with military aspect of this new expedition as it proceeded through dangerous persian desert between british and russian areas of influence delegation also included german officers gunter voigt and kurt wagner accompanying pratap were other indians from berlin committee notably pillai and islamic scholar and indian nationalist maulavi barkatullah barkatullah had long been associated with indian revolutionary movement having worked with india house in london and new york from 1903 in 1909 he moved to japan where he continued his anti british activities taking post of professor of urdu at tokyo university he visited constantinople in 1911 however his tokyo tenure was terminated under diplomatic pressure from britain he returned to united states in 1914 later proceeding to berlin where he joined efforts of berlin committee barkatullah had as early as 1895 been acquainted with nasrullah khan brother of afghan emir habibullah khan pratap chose six hindu and pathan volunteers from prisoner of war camp at before mission left berlin two more germans joined group major dr karl becker who was familiar with tropical diseases and spoke persian and walter rohr a young merchant fluent in turkish and persian organisation titular head of expedition was mahendra pratap while von hentig was kaiser s representative he was to accompany and introduce mahendra pratap and was responsible for german diplomatic representations to emir to fund mission 100 000 pounds sterling in gold was deposited in an account at deutsche bank in constantinople expedition was also provided with gold and other gifts for emir including jewelled watches gold fountain pens ornamental rifles binoculars cameras cinema projectors and an alarm clock supervision of mission was assigned to german ambassador to turkey hans von wangenheim but as he was ill his functions were delegated to prince zu hohenlohe langenburg following wangenheim s death in 1915 count von wolff metternich was designated his successor he had little contact with expedition journey to evade british and russian intelligence group split up beginning their journeys on different days and separately making their way to constantinople accompanied by a german orderly and an indian cook pratap and von hentig began their journey in early spring 1915 travelling via vienna budapest bucharest sofia and adrianople to constantinople at vienna they were met briefly by deposed khedive of egypt abbas hilmi persia and isfahan reaching constantinople on 17 april party waited at pera palace hotel for three weeks while further travel arrangements were made during this time pratap and hentig met with enver pasha and enjoyed an audience with sultan on enver pasha s orders a turkish officer lieutenant kasim bey was deputed to expedition as turkish representative bearing official letters addressed to afghan emir and indian princely states two afghans from united states also joined expedition group now numbering approximately twenty people left constantinople in early may 1915 they crossed bosphorus to take unfinished baghdad railway to baghdad taurus mountains were crossed on horseback using as von hentig reflected same route taken by alexander great paul apostle and frederick i group crossed euphrates at high flood finally reaching baghdad towards end of may as baghdad raised spectre of an extensive network of british spies group again split pratap and von hentig s party left on 1 june 1915 to make their way towards persian border eight days later they were received by turkish military commander rauf at persian town of krynd leaving krynd party reached turkish occupied kermanshah on 14 june 1915 some members were sick with malaria and other tropical diseases leaving them under care of dr becker von hentig proceeded towards tehran to decide on subsequent plans with prince heinrich reuss and niedermayer persia at time was divided into british and russian spheres of influence with a neutral zone in between germany exercised influence over central parts of country through their consulate in isfahan local populace and clergy opposed to russian and british semi colonial designs on persia offered support to mission niedermayer and von hentig s groups reconnoitred isfahan until end of june viceroy of india lord hardinge was already receiving reports of pro german sympathies among persian and afghan tribes details of progress of expedition were being keenly sought by british intelligence by now british and russian columns close to afghan border including seistan force were hunting for expedition if expedition was to reach afghanistan it would have to outwit and outrun its pursuers over thousands of miles in extreme heat and natural hazards of persian desert while evading brigands and ambushes by early july sick at kermanshah had recovered and rejoined expedition camels and water bags were purchased and parties left isfahan separately on 3 july 1915 for journey through desert hoping to rendezvous at tebbes halfway to afghan border von hentig s group travelled with twelve pack horses twenty four mules and a camel caravan throughout march efforts were made to throw off british and russian patrols false dispatches spread disinformation on group s numbers destination and intention to avoid extreme daytime heat they travelled by night food was found or bought by persian messengers sent ahead of party these scouts also helped identify hostile villages and helped find water group crossed persian desert in forty nights dysentery and delirium plagued party some persian guides attempted to defect and camel drivers had to be constantly vigilant for robbers on 23 july group reached tebbes first europeans after sven hedin they were soon followed by niedermayer s party which now included explorer wilhelm paschen and six austrian and hungarian soldiers who had escaped from russian prisoner of war camps in turkestan arrival was marked by a grand welcome by town s mayor however welcome meant party had been spotted east persian cordon thumb a map by colonel reginald dyer illustrating sistan border with afghanistan dyer led seistan force hunting for infiltrating german agents through much of 1916 still 200 miles from afghan border expedition now had to race against time ahead were british patrols of east persia cordon later known as seistan force and russian patrols by september german codebook lost by wassmuss had been deciphered which further compromised situation niedermayer now in charge proved to be a brilliant tactician he sent three feint patrols one to north east to draw away russian troops and one to south east to draw away british while a third patrol of thirty armed persians led by a german officer lieutenant wagner was sent ahead to scout route after leading russians astray first group was to remain in persia to establish a secret desert base as a refuge for main party after luring away british second group was to fall back to kermanshah and link with a separate german force under lieutenants and all three parties were ordered to spread misleading information about their movements to any nomads or villagers they met meanwhile main body headed through deh for region of birjand close to afghan frontier party covered forty miles before it reached next village where niedermayer halted to await word from wagner s patrol villagers were meanwhile barred from leaving report from wagner was bad his patrol had run into a russian ambush and desert refuge had been eliminated expedition proceeded towards birjand using forced marches to keep a day ahead of british and russian patrols other problems still confronted niedermayer among them opium addiction of his persian camel drivers fearful of being spotted he had to stop persians a number of times from lighting up their pipes men who fell behind were abandoned some of persian drivers attempted to defect on one occasion a driver was shot while he attempted to flee and betray group thumb another map by reginald dyer birjand is in periphery of lut desert in persia near afghanistan although town of birjand was small it had a russian consulate niedermayer correctly guessed additional british forces were present he therefore had to decide whether to bypass town by northern route patrolled by russians or southern route where british patrols were present he could not send any reconnaissance his persian escort s advice that desert north of birjand was notoriously harsh convinced him that this would be route his enemies would least expect him to take sending a small decoy party south east to spread rumour that main body would soon follow niedermayer headed for north his feints and disinformation were taking effect pursuing forces were spread thin hunting for what they believed at times to be a large force at other times they looked for a second non existent german force heading east from kermanshah group now moved both day and night from nomads niedermayer learnt whereabouts of british patrols he lost men through exhaustion defection and desertion on occasions deserters would take party s spare water and horses at gunpoint nonetheless by second week of august forced march had brought expedition close to birjand meshed road eighty miles from afghanistan here kaiser s bulkier and heavier gifts to emir including german wireless sets were buried in desert for later retrieval since all caravans entering afghanistan must cross road niedermayer assumed it was watched by british spies an advance patrol reported seeing british columns with scouts on lookout expedition crossed under cover of night only one obstacle so called mountain path remained before they were clear of anglo russian cordon this heavily patrolled path thirty miles further east was site of entente telegraph lines for maintaining communication with remote posts however even here niedermayer escaped his group had covered 255 miles in seven days through barren dasht e on 19 august 1915 expedition reached afghan frontier mahendra pratap s memoirs describe group as left with approximately fifty men less than half number who had set out from isfahan seven weeks earlier dr becker s camel caravan was lost and he was later captured by russians only 70 of 170 horses and baggage animals survived afghanistan crossing into afghanistan group found fresh water in an irrigation channel by a deserted hamlet albeit teeming with leeches water saved group from dying of thirst marching for another two days they reached vicinity of herat where they made contact with afghan authorities unsure what reception awaited them von hentig sent barkatullah an islamic scholar of some fame to advise governor that expedition had arrived and was bearing kaiser s message and gifts for emir governor sent a grand welcome with noblemen bearing cloths and gifts a caravan of servants and a column of hundred armed escorts expedition was invited into city as guests of afghan government with von hentig in lead in his cuirassiers uniform they entered herat on 24 august in a procession welcomed by turkish troops they were housed at emir s provincial palace they were officially met by governor a few days later when according to british agents von hentig showed him turkish sultan s proclamation of jihad and announced kaiser s promise to recognise afghan sovereignty and provide german assistance kaiser also promised to grant territory to afghanistan as far north as samarkand in russian turkestan and as far into india as bombay viceroy of india had already warned emir of approaching german agents and hired assassins and emir had promised he would arrest expedition if it managed to reach afghanistan however under a close watch expedition members were given freedom of herat governor promised to arrange for 400 mile trip east to kabul in another two weeks suits were tailored and horses given new saddles to make everything presentable for meeting with emir southern route and city of kandahar were avoided possibly because afghan officials wished to prevent fomenting unrest in pathan region close to india on 7 september group left herat for kabul with afghan guides on a 24 day trip via harsher northern route through over barren mountains of central afghanistan en route expedition was careful to spend enough money and gold to ensure popularity amongst local people finally on 2 october 1915 expedition reached kabul it was received with a salaam from local turkish community and a guard of honour from afghan troops in turkish uniform von hentig later described receiving cheers and a grand welcome from inhabitants of kabul afghan intrigues at kabul group was accommodated as state guests at emir s palace at bagh e babur despite comfort and welcome it was soon clear that they were all but confined armed guards were stationed around palace ostensibly for group s own danger from british secret agents and armed guides escorted them on their journeys for nearly three weeks emir habibullah reportedly in his summer palace at paghman responded with only polite noncommittal replies to requests for an audience an astute politician he was in no hurry to receive his guests he used time to find out as much as he could about expedition members and liaised with british authorities at new delhi it was only after niedermayer and von hentig threatened to launch a hunger strike that meetings began in meantime von hentig learnt as much as he could about his eccentric host emir habibullah was by all measures lord of afghanistan he considered it his divine right to rule and land his property he owned only newspaper only drug store and all automobiles in country all rolls royces emir s brother prime minister nasrullah khan was a man of religious convictions unlike emir he fluently spoke pashto local language dressed in traditional afghan robes and interacted more closely with border tribes while emir favoured british india nasrullah khan was more pro german in his sympathies nasrullah s views were shared by his nephew amanullah khan youngest and most charismatic of emir s sons eldest son khan was in charge of afghan army mission therefore expected more sympathy and consideration from nasrullah and amanullah than from emir meeting emir habibullah thumb habibullah khan emir of afghanistan during world war i habibullah was closely allied to british india on 26 october 1915 emir finally granted an audience at his palace at paghman which provided privacy from british secret agents meeting which lasted entire day began on an uncomfortable note with habibullah summing up his views on expedition in a prolonged opening address he expressed surprise that a task as important as expedition s was entrusted to such young men von hentig had to convince emir that mission did not consider themselves merchants but instead brought word from kaiser ottoman sultan and from india wishing to recognise afghanistan s complete independence and sovereignty kaiser s typewritten letter which he compared to handsome greeting received from ottomans failed to settle emir s suspicions he doubted its authenticity von hentig s explanation that kaiser had written letter using only instrument available at his field headquarters before group s hurried departure may not have entirely convinced him passing along kaiser s invitation to join war on side of central powers von hentig described war situation as favourable and invited emir to declare independence this was followed by a presentation from kasim bey explaining ottoman sultan s declaration of jihad and turkey s desire to avoid a fratricidal war between islamic peoples he passed along a message to afghanistan similar to kaiser s barkatullah invited habibullah to declare war against british empire and to come to aid of india s muslims he proposed that emir should allow turco german forces to cross afghanistan for a campaign towards indian frontier a campaign which he hoped emir would join barkatullah and mahendra pratap both eloquent speakers pointed out rich territorial gains emir stood to acquire by joining central powers emir s reply was shrewd but frank he noted afghanistan s vulnerable strategic position between two allied nations of russia and britain and difficulties of any possible turco german assistance to afghanistan especially given presence of anglo russian east persian cordon further he was financially vulnerable dependent on british subsidies and institutions for his fortune and financial welfare of his army and kingdom members of mission had no immediate answers to his questions regarding strategic assistance arms and funds merely tasked to entreat emir to join a holy war they did not have authority to promise anything nonetheless they expressed hopes of an alliance with persia in near future a task prince henry of reuss and wilhelm wassmuss worked on which would help meet emir s needs although it reached no firm outcome this first meeting has been noted by historians as being cordial helping open communications with emir and allowing mission to hope for success this conference was followed by an eight hour meeting in october 1915 at paghman and more audiences at kabul message was same as at first audience meetings would typically begin with habibullah describing his daily routine followed by words from von hentig on politics and history next discussions veered towards afghanistan s position on propositions of allowing central powers troops right of passage breaking with britain and declaring independence expedition members expected a persian move to central side and held out on hopes that this would convince emir to join as well niedermayer argued that german victory was imminent he outlined compromised and isolated position afghanistan would find herself in if she was still allied to britain at times emir met with indian and german delegates separately promising to consider their propositions but never committing himself he sought concrete proof that turco german assurances of military and financial assistance were feasible in a letter to prince henry of reuss in tehran a message that was intercepted and delivered to russians instead von hentig asked for turkish troops walter rohr later wrote to prince that a thousand turkish troops armed with machine guns along with another german expedition headed by himself should be able to draw afghanistan into war meanwhile niedermayer advised habibullah on how to reform his army with mobile units and modern weaponry meetings with nasrullah thumb nasrullah khan then prime minister of afghanistan nasrullah supported expedition while emir vacillated mission found a more sympathetic and ready audience in emir s brother prime minister nasrullah khan and emir s younger son amanullah khan nasrullah khan had been present at first meeting at paghman in secret meetings with amanullah party at his residence he encouraged mission amanullah khan gave group reasons to feel confident even as rumours of these meetings reached emir messages from von hentig to prince henry intercepted by british and russian intelligence were subsequently passed on to emir habibullah these suggested that to draw afghanistan into war von hentig was prepared to organise internal revulsions in afghanistan if necessary habibullah found these reports concerning and discouraged expedition members from meeting with his sons except in his presence all of afghanistan s immediate preceding rulers save habibullah s father had died of unnatural causes fact that his immediate relatives were pro german while he was allied with britain gave him justifiable grounds to fear for his safety and his kingdom von hentig described one audience with habibullah where von hentig set off his pocket alarm clock action designed to impress habibullah instead frightened him he may have believed it was a bomb about to go off despite von hentig s reassurances and explanations meeting was a short one during months that expedition remained in kabul habibullah fended off pressure to commit to central war effort with what has been described as masterly inactivity he waited for outcome of war to be predictable announcing to mission his sympathy for central powers and asserting his willingness to lead an army into india if and when turco german troops were able to offer support hints that mission would leave if nothing could be achieved were placated with flattery and invitations to stay on meanwhile expedition members were allowed to freely venture into kabul a liberty which was put to good use on a successful hearts and minds campaign with expedition members spending freely on local goods and paying cash two dozen austrian prisoners of war who had escaped from russian camps were recruited by niedermayer to construct a hospital meanwhile kasim bey acquainted himself with local turkish community spreading enver pasha s message of unity and pan turanian jihad habibullah tolerated increasingly anti british and pro central tone being taken by his newspaper siraj al akhbar whose editor his father in law mahmud tarzi had accepted barkatullah as an officiating editor in early 1916 tarzi published a series of inflammatory articles by raja mahendra pratap and printed anti british and pro central articles and propaganda by may 1916 tone in paper was deemed serious enough for raj to intercept copies intended for india through german links with ottoman turkey berlin committee at this time established contact with mahmud al hasan at hijaz while expedition itself was now met at kabul by ubaidullah sindhi s group political developments political events and progress attained during december 1915 allowed mission to celebrate at kabul on christmas day with wine and cognac left behind by durand mission forty years previously which habibullah lay at their disposal these events included foundation of provisional government of india that month and a shift from emir s usual stance to an offer of discussions on a german afghan treaty of friendship in november indian members decided to take a political initiative which they believed would convince emir to declare jihad and if that proved unlikely to have his hand forced by his advisors on 1 december 1915 provisional government of india was founded at habibullah s bagh e babur palace in presence of indian german and turkish members of expedition this revolutionary government in exile was to take charge of an independent india when british authority had been overthrown mahendra pratap was proclaimed president barkatullah prime minister deobandi leader maulana ubaidullah sindhi minister for india maulavi bashir war minister and pillai foreign minister support was obtained from galib pasha for proclaiming jihad against britain while recognition was sought from russia republican china and japan after february revolution in russia in 1917 pratap s government corresponded with nascent bolshevik government in an attempt to gain their support in 1918 mahendra pratap met trotsky in petrograd before meeting kaiser in berlin urging both to mobilise against british india draft afghan german friendship treaty december 1915 also saw concrete progress on mission s turco german objective emir informed von hentig he was ready to discuss a treaty of afghan german friendship but said it would take time and require extensive historical research work on treaty began with drafts proposed by von hentig final draft of ten articles presented on 24 january 1916 included clauses recognising afghan independence a declaration of friendship with germany and establishment of diplomatic relations von hentig was to be accredited embassy secretary of german empire in addition treaty would guarantee german assistance against russian and british threats if afghanistan joined war on central side emir s army was to be modernised with germany providing 100 000 modern rifles 300 artillery pieces and other modern warfare equipment germans were to be responsible for maintaining advisors and engineers and to maintain an overland supply route through persia for arms and ammunition further emir was to be paid ps1 000 000 both von hentig and niedermayer signed this document which created as von hentig argued in a telegram to foreign office an initial basis to prepare for an afghan invasion of india niedermayer explained that emir intended to begin his campaign as soon as germany could make available 20 000 troops to protect afghan russian front and asked for urgently for wireless sets a substantial shipment of arms and at least a million pounds initial funding he judged conditions to be ideal for an offensive into india and informed general staff to expect campaign to begin in april mission s conclusion in end emir habibullah returned to his vacillating inactivity he was aware mission had found support within his council and had excited his volatile subjects four days after draft treaty was signed habibullah called for a durbar a grand meeting where a jihad was expected to be called instead habibullah reaffirmed his neutrality explaining that war s outcome was still unpredictable and that he stood for national unity throughout spring of 1916 he continuously deflected mission s overtures and gradually increased stakes demanding that india rise in revolution before he began his campaign it was clear to habibullah that for treaty to hold any value it required kaiser s signature and that for germany to even attempt to honour treaty she would have to be in a strong position in war it was a good insurance policy for habibullah meanwhile he had received worrying british intelligence reports that said he was in danger of being assassinated and his country may face a coup d etat his tribesmen were unhappy at habibullah s perceived subservience to british and his council and relatives openly spoke of their suspicions at his inactivity habibullah began purging his court of officials who were known to be close to nasrullah and amanullah he recalled emissaries he had sent to persia for talks with germany and turkey for military aid meanwhile war took a turn for worse for central powers arab revolt against turkey and loss of erzurum to russians ended hopes of sending a turkish division to afghanistan german influence in persia also declined rapidly ending hopes that goltz pasha could lead a persian volunteer division into afghanistan mission came to realise that emir deeply mistrusted them a further attempt by british intelligence to feed false information to mission purportedly originating from goltz pasha convinced von hentig of emir s lack of trust a last offer was made by nasrullah in may 1916 to remove habibullah from power and lead frontier tribes in a campaign against british india however von hentig knew it would come to nothing and germans left kabul on 21 may 1916 niedermayer instructed wagner to stay in herat as a liaison officer indian members also stayed persisting in their attempts at an alliance though ancient rules of hospitality had protected expedition they knew that once they were out of emir s lands anglo russian forces as well as marauding tribesmen of persia would chase them mercilessly party split up into several groups each independently making its way back to germany niedermayer headed west attempting to run anglo russian cordon and escape through persia while von hentig made for route over pamir mountains towards chinese central asia having served in peking before war von hentig was familiar with region and planned to make yarkand a base from which to make a last attempt to create local muslim unrest against anglo russian interests in region he later escaped over hindu kush avoiding his pursuers for 130 days as he made his way on foot and horseback through chinese turkestan over gobi desert and through china and shanghai from there he stowed away on an american vessel to honolulu following american declaration of war he was exchanged as a diplomat travelling via san francisco halifax and bergen he finally reached berlin on 9 june 1917 meanwhile niedermayer escaped towards persia through russian turkestan robbed and left for dead a wounded niedermayer was at times reduced to begging before he finally reached friendly lines arriving in tehran on 20 july 1916 wagner left herat on 25 october 1917 making his way through northern persia to reach turkey on 30 january 1918 at he tried to rally persian democratic and nationalist leaders who promised to raise an army of 12 000 if germany provided military assistance mahendra pratap attempted to seek an alliance with tsar nicholas ii from february 1916 but his messages remained unacknowledged 1917 kerensky government refused a visa to pratap aware that he was considered a dangerous seditionist by british government pratap was able to correspond more closely with lenin s bolshevik government at invitation of turkestan authorities he visited tashkent in february 1918 this was followed by a visit to petrograd where he met trotsky he and barkatullah remained in touch with german government and with berlin committee through latter s secret office in stockholm after lenin s coup pratap at times acted as liaison between afghan government and germans hoping to revive indian cause in 1918 pratap suggested to trotsky a joint german russian invasion of indian frontiers he recommended a similar plan to lenin in 1919 he was accompanied in moscow by indian revolutionaries of berlin committee who were at time turning to communism british counter efforts seistan force thumb a column of troops of sistan force at in july 1916 force was then commanded by reginald dyer later notorious for having ordered amritsar massacre east persian cordon later called seistan force consisting of british indian army troops was established in sistan province of south east persia to prevent germans from crossing into afghanistan and to protect british supply caravans in sarhad from damani reki and kurdish tribes who might be tempted by german gold 2nd quetta brigade a small force maintained in western balochistan since beginning of war was expanded in july 1915 and became east persia cordon with troops stationed from russian turkestan to baluchistan a similar russian cordon was established to prevent infiltration into north west afghanistan from march 1916 force was renamed seistan force under direction of general george macaulay kirkpatrick chief of general staff in india cordon was initially under command of colonel j m before it was taken over by reginald dyer in february 1916 cordon s task was to intercept capture or destroy any german parties attempting to enter sistan or afghanistan to establish an intelligence system and to watch birjand road persian subjects were not to be targeted as long as they were not accompanying germans or acting as their couriers and as long as persia remained neutral following revolution in russia malleson mission was sent to trans caspia and seistan force became main line of communication for mission with withdrawal of force from trans caspia troops in persia were withdrawn last elements left in november 1920 intelligence efforts british efforts against conspiracy and expedition began in europe even before mahendra pratap met with kaiser attempts were made by british intelligence to assassinate v n chatterjee while he was on his way to geneva to invite pratap to berlin british agents were present in constantinople cairo and persia their main efforts were directed at intercepting expedition before it could reach afghanistan and thence to exert pressure to ensure that emir maintained his neutrality under efforts of sir percy sykes british intelligence officers in persia intercepted communications between expedition and prince reuss in tehran through various means among these were letters captured in november 1915 in which von hentig gave details of meetings with emir and messages from walter rohr outlining requirements for arms ammunition and men most dramatic intelligence coup was a message from von hentig asking for a thousand turkish troops and necessity for internal revulsions in afghanistan if need be this message found its way to russian intelligence and thence to viceroy who passed on an exaggerated summary warning emir of a possible coup funded by germans and a threat to his life in mid 1916 intelligence officers in punjab captured letters sent by indian provisional government s ubaidullah sindhi to mahmud al hasan which were addressed to turkish authority and sharif of mecca letters written in persian on silk cloth were sewn into a messenger s clothing when he was betrayed in punjab event was named silk letter conspiracy in august 1915 mahendra pratap s private secretary harish chandra had returned to switzerland after a visit to india at which time he had carried messages to various indian princes he was captured in europe in october 1915 chandra divulged details of provisional government of india and of expedition he also gave to british intelligence officers letters from theobald von bethmann hollweg and pratap addressed to indian princes subsequently chandra was sent as a double agent to united states in 1917 to investigate and report on revolutionary movement in washington and finances of ghadar party also used as a double agent was a man by name of who claimed to be from a royal family of rajputana he attempted to infiltrate germans and berlin committee in zurich diplomatic measures afghan emir was warned by new delhi of approach of expedition even while efforts were underway to intercept it in persian desert after it crossed into afghanistan emir was asked to arrest members however habibullah humoured british without obeying viceroy s requests he told viceroy that he intended to remain neutral and could not take any actions that were overtly pro british indian intelligence became aware after expedition had already been kabul for some time that they carried with them highly inflammatory letters from kaiser and turkish sultan through british channels russians voiced their concerns about emir s tolerance of german presence and their intrigues with pro german afghan counsellors by december 1915 new delhi felt it necessary to put more pressure on afghans communications between british empire and kabul had been hitherto through viceroy at delhi acutely aware of pressure on habibullah from his pro german relatives and strong anti british feeling among tribes viceroy hardinge suggested that a letter from king george might help habibullah maintain his neutrality accordingly george v personally sent a handwritten letter on buckingham palace stationery to habibullah praising emir for his steadfast neutrality and promising an increase to his subsidy letter which addressed habibullah as your majesty was intended to encourage habibullah and make him feel an equal partner in empire it had intended effect habibullah sent verbal communication through british agents in kabul that he could not formally acknowledge letter because of political pressure but he nonetheless sent reassurances he would remain neutral following draft treaty of january 1916 apprehensions grew in delhi of trouble from tribes in north west frontier province that spring indian intelligence received rumours of letters from habibullah to his tribal chiefs exhorting holy jihad alarmed hardinge called 3 000 tribal chiefs to a grand jirga in peshawar where aerial bombing displays were held hardinge demonstrated empire s goodwill by increasing british subsidies to chiefs these measures helped convince frontier tribes that britain s wartime position remained strong and that indian defences were impregnable influence on afghanistan expedition greatly disturbed russian and british influence in central and south asia raising concerns about security of their interests in region further it nearly succeeded in propelling afghanistan into war offers and liaisons made between mission and figures in afghani politics influenced political and social situation in country starting a process of political change left thumb foremost among afghan intellectuals who supported mission mahmud tarzi later influenced king amanullah khan s reforms historians have pointed out that in its political objectives expedition was three years premature however it planted seeds of sovereignty and reform in afghanistan and its main themes of encouraging afghan independence and breaking away from british influence were gaining ground in afghanistan by 1919 habibullah s steadfast neutrality alienated a substantial proportion of his family members and council advisors and fed discontent among his subjects his communication to viceroy in early february 1919 demanding complete sovereignty and independence regarding foreign policy was rebuffed habibullah was assassinated while on a hunting trip two weeks later afghan crown passed first to nasrullah khan before habibullah s younger son amanullah khan assumed power both had been staunch supporters of expedition immediate effect of this upheaval was precipitation of third anglo afghan war in which a number of brief skirmishes were followed by anglo afghan treaty of 1919 in which britain finally recognised afghan independence amanullah proclaimed himself king germany was among first countries to recognise independent afghan government throughout next decade amanullah khan instituted a number of social and constitutional reforms which had first been advocated by niedermayer hentig expedition reforms were instituted under a ministerial cabinet an initial step was made towards female emancipation when women of royal family removed their veils educational institutions were opened to women education system was reformed with a secular emphasis and with teachers arriving from outside afghanistan a german school that opened in kabul at one point offered von hentig fellowship devoted to postgraduate study in germany medical services were reformed and a number of hospitals were built amanullah khan also embarked on an industrialisation drive and nation building projects which received substantial german collaboration by 1929 germans were largest group of europeans in afghanistan german corporations like telefunken and siemens were amongst most prominent firms involved in afghanistan and german flag carrier deutsche luft hansa became first european airline to initiate service to afghanistan soviet eastern policy thumb fyodor shcherbatskoy under whom people s commissariat for foreign affairs proposed to send a scientific expedition to tibet as part of its strategy against british imperialism soviet russia intended to nurture political upheaval in british india in 1919 russia sent a diplomatic mission headed by an orientalist by name of n z bravin among other works this expedition established links with austrian and german remnants of niedermayer hentig expedition at herat and liaised with indian revolutionaries in kabul bravin proposed to amanullah a military alliance against british india and a military campaign with soviet turkestan bearing costs these negotiations failed to reach a concrete conclusion before soviet advances were detected by british indian intelligence other options were explored including kalmyk project a soviet plan to launch a surprise attack on north west frontier of india via tibet and other himalayan buffer states such as bhutan sikkim nepal thailand and burma through buddhist kalmyk people intention was to use these places as a staging ground for revolution in india as they offered shortest route to revolutionary heartland of bengal historians suggest that plan may have been prompted by mahendra pratap s efforts and advice to soviet leadership in 1919 when along with other indian revolutionaries he pressed for a joint soviet afghan campaign into india under cover of a scientific expedition to tibet headed by indologist fyodor shcherbatskoy plan was to arm indigenous people in north east indian region with modern weaponry project had approval of lenin pratap obsessed with tibet made efforts as early as 1916 to penetrate kingdom to cultivate anti british propaganda he resumed his efforts after his return from moscow in 1919 pratap was close to shcherbatskoy and sergey oldenburg privy to people s commissariat for foreign affairs designs in region he intended to participate in kalmyk project to tibet in summer of 1919 planned expedition was ultimately shelved following czech uprising on trans siberian railway pratap set out alone to unsuccessfully pursue his goal british india hindu german conspiracy which had initially led to conception of expedition pratap s mission in afghanistan and his overtures to bolshevik russia and presence of active revolutionary movements in punjab and bengal led to appointment in british india of a sedition committee in 1918 chaired by sydney rowlatt an english judge in midst of worsening civil unrest throughout india it was tasked to evaluate german and bolshevik links to indian militant movement especially in punjab and bengal on recommendations of committee rowlatt act 1919 an extension of defence of india act of 1915 was enforced in india a number of events that followed passage of rowlatt act were influenced by conspiracy at time british indian army troops were returning from battlefields of europe and mesopotamia to an economic depression in india ghadar conspiracy of 1915 and lahore conspiracy trials were still garnering public attention news was also beginning to reach india of indian voluntary corps who influenced by ghadarites fought on behalf of turkish caliphate mahendra pratap was shadowed by british agents among them frederick marshman bailey during his journeys to and from germany and bolshevik russia third anglo afghan war began in 1919 in wake of amir habibullah s assassination and institution of amanullah in a system blatantly influenced by kabul mission when news of outbreak of war reached pratap in berlin he returned to kabul using air transport provided by germany it was at this time that pan islamic khilafat movement began in india gandhi until then relatively unknown on indian political scene began emerging as a mass leader his call for protests against rowlatt act achieved an unprecedented response of furious unrest and protests situation especially in punjab deteriorated rapidly with disruptions of rail telegraph and communication systems movement peaked in first week of april with some recording that practically whole of lahore was on streets immense crowd that passed through anarkali was estimated to be around 20 000 in amritsar over 5 000 people gathered at jallianwala bagh situation deteriorated perceptibly over next few days british feared that a more sinister conspiracy for rebellion was brewing under veneer of peaceful protests o dwyer is said to have believed that these were early and ill concealed signs of a coordinated uprising on lines of 1857 revolt that he expected to take place in may when british troops would have withdrawn to hills for summer contrary to being an isolated incident amritsar massacre as well as responses to other events that preceded and succeeded it was end result of a concerted plan of response from punjab administration to suppress such a conspiracy james houssemayne du boulay is said to have ascribed a direct relationship between fear of a ghadarite uprising in midst of an increasingly tense situation in punjab and british response that ended in massacre epilogue after 1919 members of provisional government of india as well as indian revolutionaries of berlin committee sought lenin s help for indian independence movement some of these revolutionaries were involved in early indian communist movement with a price on his head mahendra pratap travelled under an afghan nationality for a number of years before returning to india after 1947 he was subsequently elected to indian parliament barkatullah and c r pillai returned to germany after a brief period in russia barkatullah later moved back to united states where he died in san francisco in 1927 pillai was associated with league against imperialism in germany where he
