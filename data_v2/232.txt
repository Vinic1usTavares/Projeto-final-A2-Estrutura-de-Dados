black isle s torn was a role playing video game developed for windows by black isle studios announced on march 22 2001 and cancelled in july of that year game was to use a modified version of special role playing system which had been implemented in fallout series developed on various editions of lithtech engine torn possessed features unseen in previous black isle studios games such as 3d graphics and real time camera movement in torn player assumed role of a wanderer who was cursed to bring misfortune to people and places around it under a king s orders player undertook quests to clarify a series of conflicting prophecies unlike several other black isle studios games game was to take place in an original world titled torn instead of a traditional dungeons dragons location gameplay torn was to use a modified version of special system combat occurred in quasi real time rather than strictly being turn based to achieve this black isle studios created recovery system in which action points were used to determine amount a combatant could accomplish in a given amount of time action points were spent with each action and based on what percentage of an acting character s total action points were used that character would need to wait a varying amount of time before taking action again for example if two characters expend half of their action points they will attack each other at same speed regardless of point totals for each character exceptions to this were to include recovery being hindered by movement using items or switching equipment which was always allowed though it reset recovery time like fallout game was not to support character classes instead designers opted for a system where a player defined their character by skills and special abilities selected when leveling up for example a character with skill choices of stealth and assassination would become rough equivalent of a rogue system would have allowed players to choose their characters race which would change types of abilities selectable companions left thumb 200px a player character with two companions torn was to allow player direct control over only protagonist character however up to five artificial intelligence controlled companions could be hired at once and would have replaced a conventional adventuring party companions would have interacted with one another obligating player to find companions who worked well together torn would have introduced a unique method for player to communicate with and control allies altering their behaviour through conversation and a command menu and hot key driven command system which allowed player to give companions commands at any time system was based around concept of simple behaviors such as attack which could be combined into complex strings companions could be ordered to attack support defend themselves follow player character without attacking and or remain behind it was also possible for player to command them to carry these orders out in aggressive or passive manners lastly commands and manners could be leashed to other party members or player character for example support entire party aggressively or support another companion passively depending on playable character s personality and orders companions were given their level of co operation would vary companions would have followed commands to best of their ability but in accordance with their personality for example a berserker type companion told to attack aggressively would charge into melee combat while an assassin type companion would attempt to hide and then creep about knocking foes unconscious or backstabbing in contrast a priestess type companion might support player character by casting beneficial spells while a paladin type would give support by attacking player character s target and then healing protagonist after battle or if he or she came close to dying while these features were publicized feargus urquhart later stated that even at end of our work on torn we were still considering going back to a system that gave players direct full control over party members magic system torn was to contain four types of magic chaos order alchemy and summoning order magic primarily consisted of healing protective and empowering spells conversely chaos magic was to have consisted of harmful elemental attacks detrimental status afflictions and invisibility spells alchemical magic was used to create or alter potions to achieve more powerful effects repair or enchant items identify unknown items or creatures and combine different order or chaos spells to create spells with multiple elements such as earth and fire spells creating a molten metal spell alchemical magic could also imbue a target with elemental attributes for example a warrior imbued with water element would deal extra cold type damage but receive additional heat type damage lastly summoning magic was to consist of call and gate spells former summoning entities able to exist for a set duration of time or until slain summoned creatures behaved in different manners one type might simply defend caster while another worked to heal caster and his or her allies gate spells opened a portal allowing different things access to game s world lead designer david maldonado called resulting spells generally amongst weirdest in game with effect often being a combination of normal spells fired simultaneously unlike black isle studios previous games torn would have used a mana point system each spell cast would deplete mana points when fully depleted a spell caster would have been unable to cast spells until their mana had been restored certain races were more adept at casting certain types of magic than others increasing importance of racial choice in how player wished to experience game setting and plot torn s background plot established an omnipotent being dubbed architect as ultimate creator of game s universe architect created a number of god like beings who in turn created world torn gods eventually divided into three separate factions each pursuing a different philosophy one faction worshipped chaos believing in constant alteration of world while another worshipped order believing that all things should remain unchanged between these two was a third faction which promoted balance between chaos and order game s various races were originally created for combat purposes by three factions of gods as deities struggled to dominate torn with their respective viewpoints name of game s world was to have been derived from this conflict due to ravaging of world which took place in end architect banished feuding chaos and order factions to ethereal realms of nightmare and dream respectively and left torn in hands of faction that advocated balance while isolated order and chaos factions continued influencing world s development although their segregation forced them to act indirectly through agents still residing in torn s world resulting from ability of torn s inhabitants to draw energy from separate realms occupied by gods of chaos and order magic became available black isle studios stated on multiple occasions that their goal was to create a world that was both familiar to role playing game fans while simultaneously new david maldonado once commented on this in an interview with ign i feel that a sense of familiarity and association is a powerful thing and may be used to heighten a player s emotional experience in game if something can be tied into existing imagery even if only subtly so and be enhanced by or play off of pre existing feelings and conceptions within player why throw away that extra bit of power at your disposal later in interview maldonado explained how world of torn came about i was given a set of directives by feargus urquhart black isle studios division head he was clear that he would encourage sort of mature gritty setting that we used in fallout or planescape torment but didn t want a world that was simply covered in darkness there should places of light darkness and a whole lot o gray in between he also wanted some sort of clear conflict that influenced all things on some level but didn t simply overpower everything we decided on order vs chaos as it s far less black and white than good vs evil after all agents of order or chaos could potentially use any means at their disposal to bring about rise of their cause meaning that either side has its share of goodies and baddies to this end game s plot was to contain a splinter group of order followers who would scheme to destroy entire world in order to re create it as a new unblemished one so as to achieve ultimate order torn s primary narrative revolved around a wandering protagonist character cursed to bring pain and misfortune wherever he or she traveled and to whomever he or she traveled with a misguided king later revealed to be game s ultimate antagonist would have acted as player s benefactor assigning them various quests in order to discover truth about a series of apparently conflicting prophecies it would eventually have been revealed that all prophecies and even protagonist character s mysterious curse could be rationalized and were in fact related to protagonist character effectively granting player control over which interpretation of future was realized development announced during gdc 2001 torn was subject to much interest by press because team behind cult classic planescape torment was revealed to be developing it and game itself was to use much praised special system according to lead designer david maldonado game had been in development for about fourteen months before its announcement torn made a playable showing at e3 2001 although preview was an early build of game with several graphical features disabled it was generally well received however division director of black isle studios feargus urquhart later stated that switch from lithtech 2 3 engine to upgraded 3 0 version shortly before e3 presentation had significant ramifications and amount of changing and recoding necessitated by switch caused game s e3 showing to suffer in july 2001 after circulation of rumors torn was officially cancelled following incident five members of black isle studios staff were laid off ultimate reason for torn s cancellation was eventually revealed by feargus urquhart i don t know if we ever released an official reason on why torn was canceled but in a nutshell game was canceled because it was not going to be done in time to get interplay revenue company needed to continue operations that sounds like it was all interplay s fault but that s really not case project was not going well and continued to be an ongoing challenge notes external links
