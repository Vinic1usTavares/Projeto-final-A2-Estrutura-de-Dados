despite this they still had not cracked code as pair was working on a hook idea of having a mass of multi tracked lordes came up they proceeded to belt out words together beneath main vocal like a choir of clones during recording lorde sang multiple takes and changed sound by moving away or getting closer to microphone in different parts in post production her takes were layered on top of each
