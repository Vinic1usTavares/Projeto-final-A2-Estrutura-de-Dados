s 1 also known as explorer s 1 and explorer 7x was a geoscience satellite equipped with a suite of scientific instruments to study environment around earth spacecraft and its juno ii launch vehicle were destroyed five seconds after launch on july 16 1959 in a spectacular launch failure caused by complications with rocket s power supply a relaunch of mission in october 1959 explorer 7 s 1a was successful mission s 1 mission was planned to be sixth flight of explorers program designated explorer s 1 and explorer 7x retrospectively objectives of mission were to measure earth s radiation balance and abundance of lyman alpha x rays and cosmic rays including heavy primary cosmic rays spacecraft was also designed as a test bed for satellite capabilities being equipped with instruments to measure spacecraft s temperature micrometeorite impacts and erosion of solar cells exposed to vacuum of space spin stabilized spacecraft was in size and had a launch mass of spacecraft s power was drawn from a bank of fifteen nickel cadmium batteries recharged by 3 000 solar cells mounted on exterior of spacecraft launch s 1 spacecraft was mounted atop a juno ii launch vehicle with serial am 16 it was launched on july 16 1959 at 16 37 utc from cape canaveral air force station launch complex 5 immediately after liftoff a short circuit of rocket s guidance system caused rocketdyne s 3d engines to gimbal tilting rocket sharply to west before almost flipping upside down five and a half seconds after launch range safety officer destroyed rocket rocket s payload impacted ground northwest of launch site resulting in a massive fireball aftermath in an investigation conducted after launch failure it was found that short circuit occurred between two diodes in rocket s power supply inverter voltage regulator cutting off power to guidance system and causing a full gimbal circuit board designs for juno ii and similar rockets subsequently used conformal coating to reduce chances for a recurrence launch described by commentators as infamous and one of most spectacular failures ever seen at cape canaveral was third of juno ii rocket after it failed to carry pioneer 3 into heliocentric orbit in december 1958 but succeeded in same objective in march 1959 carrying united states first interplanetary mission pioneer 4 s 1 was first geocentric orbit launch attempt for rocket its second attempt on august 14 1959 carrying beacon 2 inflatable sphere experiment to low earth orbit also failed eventually both juno ii and a re launch of s 1 mission designated explorer 7 or s 1a found success on october 13 1959 satellite which ended its mission in august 1961 is still orbiting earth today see also list of explorers program missions vanguard tv3 references external links footage of s 1 launch narrated by dave mohr on youtube category spacecraft launched in 1959 category satellite launch failures category explorers program nasa
