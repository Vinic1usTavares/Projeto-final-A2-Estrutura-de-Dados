in modern english term wicca refers to wicca religion of contemporary pagan witchcraft it is used within pagan community under competing definitions one refers to entirety of pagan witchcraft movement while other refers explicitly to traditions included in what is now called british traditional wicca although pronounced differently wicca is related to old english word wicca which referred to sorcerers in anglo saxon england in early 1950s english wiccan gerald gardner founder of gardnerian tradition referred to pagan witchcraft community as wica he claimed to have learned term during his initiation into new forest coven in 1939 by late 1950s gardner s rival charles cardell founder of his own tradition had begun referring to religion s followers as wiccens and possibly used wicca in reference to religion itself inclusive use of term wicca referring to entirety of pagan witchcraft religion has been traced to britain in early 1960s when it was used by various groups and publicised through use in adverts magazines and other literary sources it was later adopted by figures like alex sanders and gavin and yvonne frost who took it to united states there practitioners of british traditional wicca adopted it exclusively for themselves as a means to differentiate their practices from those of other pagan witches this exclusive meaning was countered by its popularisation as a generic term by prolific authors such as raymond buckland scott cunningham and silver ravenwolf as it entered popular culture it gained an increasingly eclectic character in its usage during 1990s some attempted to distance themselves from it by utilising term traditional witchcraft definitions there are two separate definitions of term wicca that have been used in paganism and pagan studies since circa 1980 first developed in england during 1960s broad and inclusive it covers most if not all forms of modern pagan witchcraft especially if they share sufficient theological beliefs and ritual practices to be considered denominations within a common religious movement in contrast second developed in united states during late 1970s it refers specifically to gardnerian tradition of witchcraft and those descended from it with little variation namely alexandrian and witchcraft which are together known as british traditional wicca usage within pagan studies development and use of term wicca within contemporary paganism has been a recurring topic of discussion in field of pagan studies majority of academics and independent scholars use first more inclusive definition given its historical status and prevalent usage within paganism pagan studies scholar ethan doyle white thought it logical and easier choice for academia although there is still some disagreement and confusion among researchers as to what defines wicca among those who have used former definition are american sociologist margot adler literary scholar chas s clifton and religious studies scholar aidan a kelly while others such as britons graham harvey and ronald hutton failed to make their usage clear to deal with this problem in future doyle white urged scholars to specify which definition they used in their work origins old english wicca and wicce in early medieval language of old english term wicca was a masculine noun for sorcerer wicce was its feminine counterpart they are ancestral to modern english witch modern english term wicca took old english wicca as its basis although two are fundamentally two distinct words with differing meanings pronunciation and grammatical usage with nearly a millennium between their respective in 1932 lewis spence writes in weekly scotsman in response to popularisation of margaret murray s witch cult hypothesis in scotland that saxon word wicca a witch was of immemorial usage in scottish lowlands doyle white suggests that early wiccans adopted term wicca as basis for name of their burgeoning faith because theirs was a new religious movement that took iconography and inspiration from polytheistic cults of pre christian britain gerald gardner s wica 1939 1966 gerald gardner 1884 1964 man largely responsible for propagating wiccan religion in britain during 1950s and 1960s and founder of gardnerian tradition never used term wicca in either sense that it is used today he referred to religion as cult of witchcraft or witch cult latter likely being a term borrowed from margaret murray who wrote a book entitled witch cult in western europe 1921 gardner did use term wica which he always spelled with only one c in his writings but this did not refer to religion itself instead referring to religion s practitioners in a plural sense in contrast with this plural use of word in a 1954 article written by arnold field a reporter for daily dispatch gardner had apparently explained to him that there are man and woman witches each is called a wica this quote offers only piece of evidence that gardner also referred to pagan witches individually as a wica it is possible that field misunderstood what gardner was saying by not capitalising wica and that therefore gardner might have never used wica in a singular sense in his book meaning of witchcraft 1959 gardner states that he first heard term wica while being initiated into new forest coven in september 1939 stating that i realised i had stumbled on something interesting but i was half initiated before word wica which they used hit me like a thunderbolt and i knew where i was and that old religion still existed this account was repeated in his biography gerald gardner witch 1960 written by idries shah but attributed to jack l bracelin in which he is quoted as saying that it was halfway through when word wica was first mentioned and i knew that that which i had thought burnt out hundreds of years ago still survived if gardner s account was accurate and new forest coven had really existed then fact that gardner spelled word as wica would not necessarily indicate that coven members had spelled it same way as he relates from gardner s account it seems that he had heard rather than read word in midst of his initiatory rite and that suffering from a poor grasp of spelling punctuation and grammar something caused by fact that he was self educated and possibly also influenced by dyslexia he would have therefore spelled word phonetically as wica in meaning of witchcraft gardner also notes term wica s resemblance to old english word wicca stating that it is a curious fact that when witches became english speaking they adopted their saxon name wica in his published writings gardner propounds idea that his pagan witchcraft religion dated back at least to anglo saxon period when old english was dominant language wica soon became an accepted term among early gardnerians as gardner s followers and initiates became known patricia and arnold crowther a gardnerian high priestess and high priest who operated a coven in sheffield use term in their book witches speak 1959 writing that t he red queen told alice that she made words mean what she wanted them to mean she might very well have been talking about witchcraft for today it is used to describe anything that one wishes to use it for from simple meaning craft of wica it is used in connection with black magic satanism black masses charles cardell s wiccen 1958 1960 charles cardell 1892 1977 was founder of a pagan witchcraft tradition that rivalled that of gerald gardner s in southern england during 1950s a psychologist and stage conjurer cardell ran a company named magick productions from his home in charlwood surrey from where he also controlled a local coven that was spied on by press leading to a well publicised court case having been involved with spiritualism as well as pagan witchcraft cardell initially befriended gardner but in 1958 they had an argument and in 1964 cardell tried to discredit him by publishing much of then secret gardnerian book of shadows cardell used term wiccen to refer not just to members of his own tradition but to all followers of pagan witchcraft religion placing an advert in light magazine journal of college of psychic science entitled craft of wiccens in 1958 advert asked fellow wiccens to get in contact with him this advert shows that cardell was responsible for propagation and possibly invention of term wiccen it is possible cardell had also used term wicca evidenced by fact that margaret bruce owner of a mail order business selling occult titles wrote a letter to her friend gerald gardner on 23 february 1960 in which she consoled him on attacks made against him by cardell and included a poem in which she referred to wicca in melissa opinion this use of wicca was explicitly in reference to cardellian craft and therefore meant that this spelling along with wiccan was used by cardell however it is also possible that bruce was referring to wicca as a community of pagan witches in which case it would be a misspelling of gardner s wica emergence of wicca 1962 1970 term wicca appears to have developed within pagan witchcraft community during early 1960s as increasing numbers of pagan witches learned of old english term wicca etymological origin of modern term witch this etymological fact had been referred to five times in gerald gardner s book meaning of witchcraft 1959 as well as in other early texts propagating pagan witchcraft such as doreen valiente s where witchcraft lives 1962 and justine glass witchcraft sixth sense and us 1965 none of these specifically referred to pagan witchcraft religion as wicca earliest known published reference for word wicca is within an advertisement published in a 1962 issue of fate magazine in this a cardiff based group of pagan witches advertised a tradition as wicca dianic and advert may have been linked to charles and mary cardell because mary was allegedly born in wales and cardellian witchcraft had apparently venerated a goddess under name of diana however many pagan witchcraft groups would have adopted deity name diana and aradia these being goddesses featured in american folklorist charles leland s supposed account of a tuscan witch tradition aradia or gospel of witches 1899 another early use could be found from december 1965 in penultimate issue of pentagram newsletter of witchcraft research association here a small column on halloween made reference to craft of wiccan apparently referring to entire pagan witchcraft community author s name was not printed although it had probably been produced by one of figures involved in editing pentagram such as gerard noel or doreen valiente in july 1968 a group of british gardnerians began publishing a magazine titled wiccan while welshman gavin frost founded church of wicca in united states that same year in 1960s gardnerian initiate alex sanders founded his own tradition which became known as alexandrian wicca he used terms wicca and wicca in reference to entire pagan witchcraft religion one of sanders initiates stewart farrar describes wicca as witches name for their craft in his book what witches do 1971 widespread adoption of wicca in reference to pagan witchcraft would have brought benefits to its practitioners who were widely maligned and faced persecution for their practice of witchcraft an emotive term often associated with satanism that had negative connotations in western imagination doyle white argued that practitioners presentation of themselves as wiccans rather than witches removed some of social stigma that they faced popularisation developments in north america 1970 1990 from 1970 onward increasing numbers of books teaching readers how to become pagan witches were published earliest was paul s mastering witchcraft 1970 which made no reference to wicca this was followed by raymond buckland s tree complete book of saxon witchcraft in which he propagated his newly developed tradition of wica utilising wica as name of tradition he also referenced wicca as name of religion as a whole contrastingly during 1970s term wicca was rejected by feminist pagan witchcraft groups in united states in particular dianic tradition term does not appear in early works of budapest and starhawk although latter would adopt it by 21st century this was part of a phenomenon that took place during 1970s and 1980s as term wicca became increasingly associated purely with gardnerianism and together known as british traditional wicca in north america rather than with other variants of pagan witchcraft this was encouraged by elements within gardnerian and alexandrian communities who wished to emphasise what they perceived as their special position within pagan community word wicca first appeared in a book title in 1981 as wicca ancient way written by janus mithras nuit hilaria and mer amun and published in canada it discussed a gardnerian based tradition increasing popularisation and reaction 1990 2010 in ensuing years many other authors would publish books containing wicca in their titles which advocated solitary practice of pagan witchcraft best known were scott cunningham s wicca a guide for solitary practitioner 1988 and silver ravenwolf s teen witch wicca for a new generation 1998 but other examples included dunwich s wicca garden 1996 d j conway s wicca complete craft 2001 raymond buckland s wicca for life 2004 and wicca for one 2004 murphy hiscock s solitary wicca for life 2005 and ann marie gallagher s wicca bible 2005 it was also adopted by american novelist cate tiernan as title of her series of young adult novels term wicca was employed in an increasingly eclectic manner by authors like ravenwolf who considered it to be a synonym for witchcraft in turn it began to be adopted on a wider scale being popularised in india by roy and being adopted by a french luciferian group le wicca francaise becoming widely known in western popular culture it was utilised by script writers of two popular american television shows buffy vampire slayer and charmed first episode of latter was titled something wicca this way comes while tenth was titled wicca envy reacting against increasingly inclusive use of term were pagan witches who instead characterised their practices as forms of traditional witchcraft many pagan witches who considered themselves to be traditional witches exhibited an us and them mentality against gardnerianism and allied traditions for whom they reserved term wicca doyle white suggests that they had done so in order to distance themselves from increasing influence of new age movement over wiccan mainstream with its iconographical emphasis on white light instead embracing traditional european view that associated witchcraft with darkness historian ronald hutton states that he knew of three wiccan covens founded in 1980s who began to describe themselves as traditional witches in 1990s notes references footnotes etymologies bibliography etymology wicca
