pilots were sent to replace them despite fact that fully trained black bomber pilots were available even though flying fighter planes requires skills quite different from flying a bomber parrish also commented it is a discouraging fact that officers of army air force whose scientific achievements are unsurpassed and whose scientific skill is unquestioned in mechanical matters and in many personnel
