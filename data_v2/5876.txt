portal 2 is a puzzle platform game developed by valve it was released in april 2011 for windows mac os x linux playstation 3 and xbox 360 digital pc version is distributed online by valve s steam service while all retail editions were distributed by electronic arts like original portal 2007 players solve puzzles by placing portals and teleporting between them portal 2 adds features including tractor beams lasers light bridges and paint like gels that alter player movement or allow portals to be placed on any surface in single player campaign players control chell who navigates dilapidated aperture science enrichment center during its reconstruction by supercomputer glados ellen mclain new characters include robot wheatley stephen merchant and aperture founder cave johnson j k simmons in new cooperative mode players solve puzzles together as robots atlas and p body both voiced by dee bradley baker jonathan coulton and national produced songs for game valve announced portal 2 in march 2010 and promoted it with alternate reality games including potato sack a collaboration with several independent game developers after release valve released downloadable content and a simplified map editor to allow players to create and share levels portal 2 received acclaim for its gameplay balanced learning curve pacing dark humor writing and acting it has been described as one of greatest video games of all time by numerous publications and critics gameplay thumb portal 2 challenges player to use teleportation to traverse obstacle courses player s speed does not change upon passing through portals in this example vertical velocity of falling character is converted into horizontal velocity by portal alt a schematic of two platforms separated by a gap and by height one portal opening is located at bottom of gap other on a wall high above lower platform a human figure is shown by a trajectory path to be able to jump from lower platform into bottom portal and exit top portal to land on higher platform left portal 2 is a first person perspective puzzle game player takes role of chell in single player campaign as one of two and p cooperative campaign or as a simplistic humanoid icon in community developed puzzles these three characters can explore and interact with environment characters can withstand limited damage but will die after sustained injury there is no penalty for falling onto a solid surface but falling into bottomless pits or toxic pools kills player character immediately when chell dies in single player game game restarts from a recent checkpoint in cooperative game robot respawns shortly afterwards without restarting puzzle goal of both campaigns is to explore aperture science laboratory a complicated malleable mechanized maze while most of game takes place in modular test chambers with clearly defined entrances and exits other parts occur in behind scenes areas where objective is less clear initial tutorial levels guide player through general movement controls and illustrate how to interact with environment player must solve puzzles using portal gun or aperture science handheld portal device which can create two portals connecting two distant surfaces depicted as matte white continuous and flat characters can use these portals to move between rooms or to fling objects or themselves across a distance outlines of placed portals are visible through walls and other obstacles for easy location game elements include thermal discouragement beams lasers excursion funnels tractor beams and hard light bridges all of which can be transmitted through portals aerial faith plates launch player or objects through air and sometimes into portals player must disable turrets or avoid their line of sight weighted storage cube has been redesigned and there are new types redirection cubes which have prismatic lenses that redirect laser beams spherical safety cubes an antique version of weighted storage cube used in underground levels and a cube turret hybrid created by wheatley after taking control of aperture heart decorated weighted companion cube reappears briefly early demonstrations included pneumatic diversity vents shown to transport objects and transfer suction power through portals but these do not appear in final game also available as ipad or steam application all of these game elements open locked doors or help or hamper character from reaching exit paint like gels which are dispensed from pipes and can be transported through portals impart certain properties to surfaces or objects coated with them players can use orange propulsion gel to cross surfaces more quickly blue repulsion gel to bounce from a surface and white conversion gel to allow surfaces to accept portals only one type of gel can affect a certain surface at a time some surfaces such as grilles cannot be coated with a gel water can block or wash away gels returning surface or object to its normal state game includes a two player cooperative mode two players can use same console with a split screen or can use a separate computer or console windows mac os x and playstation 3 users can play with each other regardless of platform both player characters are robots that control separate portal guns and can use other character s portals each player s portals are of a different color scheme whereof one is blue and purple and other is orange and red a calibration chamber separates characters to teach players to use communication tools and portals most later chambers are less structured and require players to use both sets of portals for laser or funnel redirection launches and other maneuvers game provides voice communication between players and online players can temporarily enter a split screen view to help coordinate actions players can ping to draw other player s attention to walls or objects start countdown timers for synchronized actions and perform joint gestures such as waving or hugging game tracks which chambers each player has completed and allows players to replay chambers they have completed with new partners portal 2s lead writer erik wolpaw estimates each campaign to be about six hours long portal 2 contains in game commentary from game developers writers and artists commentary accessible after completing game once appears on node icons scattered through chambers according to valve each of single player and cooperative campaigns is 2 to 2 5 times as long as campaign in portal with overall game five times as long plot backstory portal series is linked to half life series events in portal take place between first and second half life games while most of portal 2 is set a long time after events in portal and half life 2 before portal aperture science conducted experiments to determine whether human subjects could safely navigate dangerous test chambers until artificial intelligence glados governing laboratory killed its employees at end of first game protagonist chell destroys glados and momentarily escapes facility but is dragged back inside by an unseen figure later identified by writer erik wolpaw as party escort bot a promotional comic shows estranged aperture science employee doug who used graffiti to guide player in portal placing chell into suspended animation to save her life until beginning of portal 2 single player campaign in aperture science complex chell wakes in a stasis chamber resembling a motel room complex has become dilapidated and is on verge of collapse wheatley stephen merchant a personality core guides her through old test chambers in an attempt to escape they accidentally reactivate dormant glados ellen mclain who separates chell from wheatley and begins rebuilding laboratory thumb potatoes are a motif of portal 2 wheatley attaches glados s core personality to a potato battery while he takes over aperture science facility alt a potato with two wires marked with plus and minus signs at terminal signs glados subjects chell to new tests until wheatley helps her escape again they sabotage aperture manufacturing plants then confront glados and perform a core exchange replacing her with wheatley as laboratory s controller wheatley seemingly driven mad with power attaches glados s personality core to a potato battery glados tells chell that wheatley was designed as an intelligence dampening core producing illogical thoughts created to hamper her own personality infuriated wheatley drops chell and glados through an elevator shaft to laboratories lowest levels chell retrieves glados and they form a reluctant partnership to stop wheatley before his incompetence destroys complex ascending through laboratories built in 1960s 70s and 80s they discover audio recordings by aperture founder cave johnson j k simmons recordings reveal how aperture slowly lost money and prestige and that johnson was poisoned by moon dust used to manufacture portal conductive surfaces his last request was for mind of his assistant caroline mclain to be transferred to an advanced computer designed to store a human consciousness which he had previously commissioned for himself creating glados glados is troubled by discovery chell and glados return to modern chambers and navigate wheatley s test chambers chell attaches three corrupted personality cores nolan north to wheatley and prepares to restore glados as controller however wheatley destroys button needed to activate transfer and facility begins to self destruct when roof collapses chell places a portal on moon she and wheatley are pulled into vacuum of space while glados reasserts her control glados retrieves chell and wheatley is left in space when chell awakens glados claims to have learned valuable lessons about humanity from remnants of caroline but deletes caroline s personality deciding that chell is not worth trouble of killing glados releases her cooperative campaign cooperative story takes place after single player campaign and has some ties into it but players are not required to play them in order player characters atlas and p body are bipedal robots who navigate five sets of test chambers together each with a fully functioning portal gun after completing a test chamber robots are disassembled and reassembled at next chamber after completing each set of chambers they are returned to a central hub puzzles in each set of chambers focus on a particular testing element or puzzle solving technique in first four sets glados prepares robots to venture outside of test systems of aperture laboratories to recover data disks she destroys them and restores their memories to new also happens when they die in a test chamber hazard at first glados is excited about her non human test subjects but later becomes dissatisfied because two robots cannot truly die and at one point also gets uncomfortable with their close partnership at end of story robots gain entry to vault where humans are stored in stasis glados gives thanks to robots on locating humans whom she sees as new test subjects and game ends development after success of portal valve decided to make portal 2 a standalone product partly because of pressure from other developers within valve who wanted to work on a portal product work began almost immediately after release of portal valve committed more resources to portal 2s development than they had for first game portal had a team of seven or eight people but portal 2 had a team of 30 or 40 initial team of four was expanded as subgroups formed to devise game mechanics and to plot story participants in internal review processes were inspired by what they saw to join project according to erik wolpaw some portal 2 developers worked on left 4 dead games to help them meet milestones but returned to portal 2 with extra people in tow kim swift portals designer left valve for airtight games halfway through portal 2s development project manager erik johnson said valve s goal for portal 2 was to find a way to re surprise players which he considered a pretty terrifying prospect in march 2011 one month before game s release valve president gabe newell called portal 2 best game we ve ever done after portal 2s release geoff keighley wrote that according to newell portal 2 will probably be valve s last game with an isolated single player experience keighley later stated that use of word probably suggests that this could change newell said that valve is not giving up on single player but intends to include more social features on top of single player experience akin to cooperative mode in portal 2 design initially valve planned to exclude portals from portal 2 for five months they focused on a gameplay mechanic called f stop valve did not discuss specifics of idea as they may use it in a future game though playtesters liked f stop they expressed disappointment at omission of portals following a report in kotaku about some leaked plot elements newell directed team to reconsider thumb several test chambers from portal top reappear in portal 2 bottom decayed by passage of time alt two images showing same test chamber from same vantage point consisting of a red button a weighted cube dispenser an exit door and a translucent observation window in both portal and portal 2 top picture shows these elements in pristine condition while second shows discoloration deterioration and overgrowth from plants left valve did not aim to make portal 2 more difficult than portal but instead to produce a game where you think your way through particular parts of level and feel really smart when you solve it to allow players to learn game rules incrementally valve designed two basic types of test chamber one which valve called provides a safe environment for player to experiment with a new concept while other combines elements in new ways to force player to think laterally test chambers began as isometric drawings on whiteboard developers ran a sanity check before crafting simple levels with hammer editor valve s level construction tool iterative playtesting ensured solutions were neither too obvious nor too difficult playtesters sometimes discovered alternative solutions which team removed if they were considered too easy valve aimed to teach new players portal mechanics while still entertaining experienced players to this end they streamlined some elements for example moving energy balls of portal were replaced with lasers which provide immediate feedback to evoke a sense of nostalgia and time having passed between games valve included test chambers from original portal they used higher resolution textures supported by new game engine and applied decay collapse and overgrowth effects middle section of single player campaign takes place in large spaces where few portals can be placed forcing players to find creative ways to cross architecture in these sections was inspired by photographs of industrial complexes such as cern nasa and abandoned soviet space program when wheatley controls aperture facility designers had a blast creating deranged chambers reflecting wheatley s stupidity as solving constant puzzles would tire players designers inserted occasional experiences to provide respite and advance plot thumb portal 2 features gels that impart special properties to surfaces or objects they touch here blue repulsion gel causes painted turrets to bounce off any surface alt repulsion jumping and propulsion running gels in portal 2 originated in tag power of paint valve hired tag creators to develop idea further and later decided to include it in portal 2 journalists have likened tag to drop digipen student project that became portal as third tag gel which allows character to walk on any surface regardless of gravity gave playtesters motion sickness it was replaced by conversion gel which integrates with portal mechanic gels give player more control over environment which increased challenge for puzzle designers gels are rendered using fluid dynamics routines specially developed at valve by former tag team rendering techniques developed for left 4 dead 2 were used to render pools of liquid portal 2 combines flowing surface maps to mimic motion of water with debris flow maps and random noise to create realistic real time rendering of water effects cooperative mode cooperative mode originated from players requests and from anecdotes of players working together on same computer or console to solve game s puzzles wolpaw likened this to players working together on same computer to solve point and click adventure games cooperative campaign was also inspired by valve s left 4 dead cooperative games in which players enjoyed discussing their personal experiences with game when they had finished playing it while single player campaign in portal 2 is designed to avoid frustrating player cooperative levels focus on coordination and communication and valve recognizes they are much more difficult than single player puzzles valve did not include timed puzzles in single player campaigns in portal and portal 2 but found that their inclusion in cooperative mode is effective and gives players a positive feeling after they successfully plan and execute difficult maneuvers each puzzle chamber in cooperative mode requires actions from both players as soon as a playtester discovered a way to complete a puzzle with one set of portals level was sent back to designers for further work with few exceptions valve designed chambers so that both players would remain in sight of each other to promote communication and cooperation some of puzzle chambers were designed asymmetrically one player would manipulate portals and controls to allow other player to cross room emphasizing that two characters while working together are separate entities designers soon realized that ability to tag surfaces with instructional icons for one s partner was a necessary element since they found this to be more effective for cooperation than simple verbal instructions valve considered a competitive mode according to wolpaw mode was similar to video game one team would try to transport a ball from one side of playing field to other using portals while other team would attempt to stop them with their own use of portals matches would commence with this objective in mind but quickly descended into chaos valve realized that people enjoyed solving puzzles with portals more and therefore they focused on cooperative mode writing 300x300px thumb writers jay pinkerton left erik wolpaw and chet faliszek at 2012 game developers conference receiving best narrative award for portal 2 alt left wolpaw and ex national lampoon writer jay pinkerton wrote single player story while left 4 dead writer chet faliszek wrote glados s lines for cooperative campaign game has 13 000 lines of dialogue writers felt they needed to create a larger story for a stand alone title and wanted game to feel relatively intimate and avoided adding too many new characters they considered expanding sterility and dryness of portal and adding more comedy to script wolpaw said that while some developers have been moving towards art games no one had made a comedic video game game s story development was tightly coordinated with gameplay development and testing developers initially envisioned a prequel set in 1950s long before glados took over aperture science facility with events set in motion when aperture ceo cave johnson is put into a computer only to realize it was a mistake johnson would have led an army of robots which would battle against player to rise to power within aperture in june 2008 based on information from a casting call website and leaked script samples kotaku reported that valve was seeking voice actors to play johnson named him as an ai and identified game as a prequel valve attributed this leak to an overeager agent following negative playtester feedback about omission of chell and glados portal 2 was re conceived as a sequel team returned to idea of exploring parts of facility from aperture s early days and reincorporated johnson through a series of recordings writers originally conceived several premature joke game endings if player performed certain actions but these required too much development effort for little payback and were scrapped one of these joke endings was triggered by shooting a portal onto moon s surface after which player s character would die from asphyxiation over a closing song but idea of creating a portal on moon was incorporated into game s final ending writers planned that chell would say a single word during ending but this was not considered funny enough in an early version of script chell finds a lost tribe of turrets looking for their leader a huge animal king turret which can be seen in in game videos of retail product as a reward animal king would have married chell to a turret which would have followed chell around game without visible movement cooperative campaign was planned to feature a more detailed storyline in which glados would send two robots to discover human artifacts such as a comic based on a pastiche of garfield writers hoped to use this idea to make robots human like for testing purposes but recognized that unlike captive audience of single player campaign two players in cooperative mode may simply talk over story and thus story was condensed into very basic elements wolpaw said that while many story elements of portal are revisited in portal 2 he avoided some of memes such as frequently repeated cake is a lie he said if you thought you were sick of memes i was sick of it way ahead of you wolpaw couldn t resist putting in just one cake joke writers did not try to predict or write new memes and wolpaw said you can t really plan for dialogue to become a meme because if you do it probably seems weird and forced portal 2 produced its own memes including a space obsessed personality core valve later created a space core modification for game elder scrolls v skyrim see below and space core also appeared as a laser based engraving on a panel manufactured by nasa for international space station writers saw aperture science itself as a character it is depicted as a living breathing place and a science company that s gone mad with science in lab rat comic facility is described as a beautiful and terrible place a metastasized amalgam of add ons additions and appropriations building itself out of itself richard mccormick of playstation 3 magazine identified several elements of portal 2s story that reference myth of prometheus mccormick wrote that glados is a personification of prometheus who grants knowledge to humanity in form of portal gun and is then punished by being bound to a rock pecked at by birds and is cast into pits of tartarus mccormick also likens wheatley to prometheus foolish brother epimetheus within game a sentry gun makes reference to prometheus myth word tartarus is visible on supporting columns in depths of aperture science and a portrait of cave and caroline also shows aeschylus presumed author of prometheus bound journalists and players have also found connections between portal 2 and half life 2 in a crossover in portal 2 an experiment accidentally teleported aperture science s cargo ship borealis into position in which it is discovered at end of half life 2 episode two character design thumb upright alt j k simmons at 2007 toronto international film festival j k simmons voices cave johnson eccentric ceo of aperture science though portal 2 introduced some new characters writers wanted to maintain one on one relationships between each character and player character valve explored possibility of introducing a new protagonist for portal 2 playtesters accepted playing as a different character for first part of game but they became disoriented when glados did not recognize them writers returned to using chell protagonist of portal valve artists experimented with chell s attire and considered changing her ambiguous nationality they returned to orange dehumanizing jumpsuit from portal with top tied around chell s waist to enhance her freedom of movement and help her stand out more as an individual psm3 called new look controversially sexy as in first game chell s facial appearance is based on that of voice actress alesia chell continues her role as a silent observer as straight man in response to insanity around her and refuses to give her antagonists any satisfaction as part of her character arc plot moves glados from her anger with chell for her actions in portal which wolpaw said was going to get old pretty quick to an internal struggle reuse of mclain s voice led to creation of a backstory and subplot about glados s creation writers panicked when they realized that their plans to have chell and glados play off each other would only work if both players spoke to remedy this they created caroline subplot to give glados an external situation to deal with and to drive story during middle act of game writers considered introducing about six personality cores stored in portable spheres whose main function would be story advancement they planned cores based on morgan freeman s character red from shawshank redemption and quint from jaws among others ultimately they decided to concentrate on a single core wheatley recycling two of rejected cores in final boss fight karen a veteran performer for muppets led animation team for wheatley and other personality cores pictures of cave johnson based on face of lead animator bill fletcher appear throughout portal 2 though comparisons have been made between johnson and andrew ryan wealthy industrialist who created fictional underwater city of rapture in bioshock wolpaw says writers did not consider this character while creating johnson two robotic characters provide some amusing death scenes in cooperative mode such as struggling while being crushed by a lowering ceiling artists thought look of robots would help tell story and fact that they are holding hands emphasizes cooperative mode expressive noises and mannerisms are used in place of distinguishable dialogue and robotic characters were designed as a double act similar to laurel and hardy voice cast thumb upright stephen merchant voices wheatley a personality core alt glados returns from portal as a major character and game s antagonist and is voiced by ellen mclain writers found that they needed another character to play off johnson but did not want to hire another voice actor having already recruited mclain to play glados they asked her to provide voice for caroline cave johnson s assistant wheatley is voiced by stephen merchant early demonstrations at trade shows used voice of valve animator richard lord writers wrote wheatley s lines with merchant in mind citing his unique vocal silhouette and his ability to ad lib in a frantic manner they had assumed that merchant would be unavailable and contacted it crowds writer graham linehan to try to get richard but then discovered that merchant was interested merchant spent around sixteen hours recording lines and was given freedom to improvise j k simmons voices cave johnson aperture science s founder and ceo simmons s selection helped to solidify character s development robots voices were provided by dee bradley baker who had performed similar robotic voices for star wars clone wars media in cooperative campaign a separate story involves two robotic characters and glados designers initially planned to use chell and a new human character called mel glados dialogue would play off humans image issues and this aspect was retained after designers switched to using robots glados seems troubled by robots cooperation and tries to aggravate their relationship through psychological tactics such as praising one robot over other valve initially considered having glados deliver separate lines to each player but they found this to be a significant effort for minimal benefit writers also tried adding lines for glados that would encourage players to compete against each other for rewards such as meaningless points but playtesters did not respond well faliszek said that in cooperative games it can be difficult to deliver key dialogue or in game events to players who may not be looking in right direction at right time instead using their experience from previous games faliszek and wolpaw kept story and key comedic lines short and repeated them frequently music portal 2 contains both scored and procedurally generated music created by valve s composer mike and two songs want you gone recorded by jonathan coulton used on final credits of single player mode and exile vilify by national used in background of one of rat man s dens full soundtrack songs to test by containing most of songs in game was released as three free downloads between may and september 2011 and later in october 2012 as a retail collector s edition including soundtrack from portal release announcement in january 2008 valve spokesman doug lombardi told eurogamer there ll be more portal for sure and portal designer kim swift confirmed that work on portal 2 would begin following month swift said that a multiplayer mode in portal was technically possible but that it was less fun than you d think portal 2 was officially announced on march 5 2010 via game informer events during preceding week foreshadowed announcement on march 1 valve released a patch for portal that included a new achievement transmission received requiring player to manipulate in game radios this revealed new sound effects that became part of an alternate reality game arg some of new effects were of morse code strings that suggested glados was rebooting while others could be decoded as sstv images from grainy aperture science videos images included hints to a bbs phone number that when accessed provided a large number of ascii based images relating to portal and segments of aperture science documents many of these ascii pictures were later published in game informer reveal of title new ascii images continued to appear on bbs after official announcement background on arg is embedded in additional sstv images found in a hidden room in portal 2 valve s adam foster came up with idea for arg tying it to game informer reveal and he provided his own home phone line to run bbs software on as valve s offices at time were too modern to support protocol foster estimates arg cost less than 100 to run left thumb gabe newell and glados blue screen of death at 2010 game developers conference alt gabe newell stands at a podium in front of a large screen screen is blue similar to blue screen of death for windows but with different text including word glados a second portal patch released on march 3 altered game s ending sequence to show chell being pulled back into aperture facility gaming journalists speculated that an announcement of portal 2 was imminent on march 5 game informer announced portal 2s official release on cover of its april issue during following week gabe newell s speech accepting pioneer award at game developers conference 2010 ended with a fake blue screen of death appearing on a screen behind him with a message purported to be from glados which hinted of further portal 2 news at upcoming e3 2010 two weeks before e3 game journalists received a cryptic e mail worded as a press release from aperture science hinting that presentation on portal 2 would be replaced with a surprise jointly hosted by aperture science and valve this prompted speculation that surprise would be announcement of half life 2 episode three but valve confirmed that it would be about portal 2 surprise was announcement of portal 2 on playstation 3 marketing and release march 2010 announcement said that portal 2 would be released in late 2010 in august 2010 valve postponed release to february 2011 with a steam release date of february 9 to allow it to complete changes to game s dialogue to fill and connect about sixty test chambers and to finish refinements to gel gameplay mechanic valve announced a further delay in november 2010 and gave a worldwide release date through retail and online channels of april 18 2011 wolpaw stated that this eight week delay was used to expand game s content before reaching an internal milestone called a content lock after which no further content could be added remaining development work involved debugging newell allowed delay considering added benefits of new content because he thought company would not lose any commercial opportunities because of it on february 18 2011 newell confirmed that valve had completed development work on portal 2 and that they were waiting for final approvals and to get discs manufactured portal 2 was first valve product simultaneously released for windows and mac os x computers through steam platform retail copies for all platforms were distributed by electronic arts on april 1 2011 valve released another alternate reality game called potato sack players tried to solve multi tiered puzzle coordinating efforts through web sites and chat rooms some journalists believed game denoted release of portal 2 on april 15 2011 instead of target release date of april 19 2011 on april 15 players discovered glados home a distributed computing spoof that encouraged participants to play games to unlock portal 2 early once puzzles were solved portal 2 was unlocked about ten hours before its planned release valve created a series of television commercials to promote portal 2 valve had worked with advertising agencies in past but lombardi found advertisements created had shown little ingenuity valve s doug lombardi had been disappointed by copycat treatments cliche treatments treatments that reveal agency wasn t listening in initial meeting using viewer feedback valve tailored ad content until they were satisfied with results ads took eight weeks to complete valve also developed online promotional videos featuring j k simmons narrating as cave johnson to promote new elements of portal 2s gameplay these videos were part of a larger effort described by newell as a documentary style investment opportunity for portal 2 an earlier video released on february 14 2011 promoted cooperative aspect of portal 2 as a st valentine s gift and lit up our preorders our buzz all metrics that are used and collected by publishers and retailers lombardi said videos dwarfed demos and interviews we did valve also offered portal 2 themed merchandise such as posters drinking glasses and t shirts additional and downloadable content portal 2 includes bonus content including four promotional videos a lab rat comic and an interactive trailer for 2011 film super 8 constructed with source game engine a feature called robot enrichment allows players to customize cooperative campaign characters with new gestures and cosmetic items such as hats or flags these can be earned in game traded with other players or bought through microtransactions at in game store valve planned to produce downloadable content for portal 2 beginning with peer review released on october 4 2011 content which is free regardless of platform includes a new cooperative campaign which extends game s story a week from end of cooperative campaign glados prepares atlas and p body to deal with an intruder within aperture science bird that had previously abducted her as a potato content also adds a challenge mode similar to that in portal players try to complete specific chambers with shortest time or fewest portals used both which are tracked on overall and friends leaderboards challenge modes are available for both single player and cooperative modes according to faliszek user generated content for portal 2 would be available on all platforms but because of software dependencies necessary modding tools would only be available for windows valve released beta versions of modding tools on may 10 2011 and supported a competition held by community mapping website thinking with portals in may 2011 providing prizes for most selected maps perpetual testing initiative a free title update for windows and mac versions was released on may 8 2012 and includes a new level editor and a means of obtaining and sharing user created levels through steam workshop in november 2011 gttv host geoff keighley said that valve was developing a simplified level editing tool to allow novice editors to assemble test chambers without learning how to use modified valve hammer editor and an in game system to distribute user created levels via steam workshop this mapping system entered beta testing in march 2012 within a few days of release perpetual testing initiative add on had been used to create 35 000 maps with 1 3 million downloads of these maps through steam within a month more than 150 000 user created maps were available first release of perpetual testing initiative was limited to single player maps but a patch released in august 2012 enabled users to create new levels for cooperative play valve supports fan reuse of portal 2 content offering selected assets and assistance windows release of bastion includes a weapon inspired by portal 2s conversion gel and turrets its developer supergiant games received writing assistance from eric wolpaw and mclain voiced new lines for turrets an add on scenario for hidden path entertainment s tower defense game defense grid awakening incorporates glados as an antagonist using new dialogue from mclain and assets from portal 2 wolpaw and mclain also helped to create additional lines for glados for a custom single player map commissioned by gary which he used to propose marriage to his fiancee stephanie for a patch for bethesda s elder scrolls v skyrim that incorporated support for steam workshop content valve developed a free add on module that introduced space core as a non player character that follows player around valve collaborated with zen studios to create a portal 2 themed pinball table among other valve themed tables for their games pinball fx 2 and zen pinball a portal 2 themed set is available for lego dimensions by warner bros entertainment and traveller s tales game features additional stories written by traveller s tales with valve s blessing set after events of portal 2 with ellen mclain stephen merchant and j k simmons reprising their respective voice roles as well as a new glados credits song written by jonathan coulton and performed by mclain xbox 360 version was added to backwards compatibility feature for xbox one in june 2016 use in education teach with portals valve announced teach with portals and steam for schools in june 2012 initiatives that offered portal 2 and portal 2 puzzle maker for education educational version was free but only contained single player campaign and puzzle maker and was only available for steam for schools users several critics wrote that portal 2 excels in teaching player to solve puzzles in a review for new york times seth schiesel wrote somewhere out there an innovative dynamic high school physics teacher will use portal 2 as linchpin of an entire series of lessons and will immediately become most important science teacher those lucky students have ever had mathematics and science teachers wrote e mails to valve to tell them how they had included portal in their classroom lessons as part of a project to promote of learning portal developers joshua weier and yasser malaika led a team within valve to explore ways of using portal 2 for education this led to development of puzzle maker a level editor for portal 2 players built from professional tools used to develop game weier and malaika did not want to design curricula themselves but wanted to provide educators with tools for creating lesson plans hammer only tool freely available before release of built in level editor in 2012 was difficult for educators to learn and understand to address this valve gave puzzle maker an easy to learn interface and ability to share puzzles and lesson plans tools were developed with a mathematics teacher and her students this formed basis of a new steam for schools initiative launched in june 2012 under which educators could acquire portal 2 and puzzle maker software free of charge for classroom use through its teach with portals program in november 2012 valve estimated that over 2 500 educators were using teach with portals software within their lesson plans research in 2016 a study demonstrated that portal 2 puzzle maker can be used as a measure of fluid intelligence similar to referred to as portal 2 test battery participants of study completed a series of test chambers that progressively became harder some studies have been conducted to determine if video games can have a significant impact on cognitive and non cognitive skills through multiple and post tests a 2014 study has shown that portal 2 can improve problem solving skills spatial skills and persistence for a designated task participants of this study did not need to have previous gaming experience another study done in 2017 found that commercial video games like portal 2 can also increase communication adaptability and resourcefulness hardware support razer hydra sixense developed a version of portal 2 to support razer hydra motion controller for pc that allows enhanced control of some game elements ten extra single player levels are available as downloadable content for this version writer chet faliszek said sixense developers spent nine months to a year in house at valve preparing native version a limited edition of razer hydra comes bundled with a copy of portal 2 for pc playstation 3 announcement that portal 2 would be available on playstation 3 came as a surprise to industry because gabe newell had criticized that console in past citing difficulties in port of orange box move toward playstation 3 was a result of growing frustration with microsoft s policies for xbox 360 content including difficulty of releasing patches and new content newell saw sony s publication model as more open allowing steam like features to be used on console portal 2 was first playstation 3 game to support a subset of features from steamworks including automatic updates downloadable content and community support game supports cross platform play between playstation 3 windows and os x versions steam overlay shows player s friends on both steam and playstation network with achievements rewarded for both steam and playstation network trophies players can unlock game on steam for windows and os x for no additional charge integration of steamworks on playstation 3 allows valve to collect data about problems that arise after shipping and push

avoids normal pitfalls that developers introduce in sequels stating that portal is perfect portal 2 is not it s something better than that gus mastrapa of a v club wrote that with portal 2 valve had alleviated any doubts that portal could be expanded into a big narrative experience with all bells and whistles of a mainstream gaming hit ign s charles onyett wrote that sequel makes original look like prototype it was by expanding game in gameplay and story most reviewers praised writing and voice acting in game entertainment weekly dan stapleton of pc gamer was able to predict many of plot twists within portal 2 story but still looked forward to witnessing exactly how characters would react he praised development of characters as their charm makes what would otherwise be an empty and lifeless world feel boisterous and alive characters were well received wrote that merchant s obvious enthusiasm for role benefits game and that consistently clever writing perfectly complements onscreen action game informer adam biessener considered johnson to be an even better character than glados and praised game s pitch perfect delivery and brilliant comedic timing in contrast peter bright of ars technica wrote that compared to loneliness and despair he felt while playing first game characters wheatley and glados lost some of this feeling and inane babble served only to disrupt mood portal 2s additional gameplay elements like light bridges lasers and gels were praised as appropriate additions to game reviewers were pleased with difficulty of puzzles throughout game which appeared visually complicated at first but had uncomplicated solutions times evan narcisse said that he feared addition of new gameplay elements would dilute purity of experience but everything s still executed with valve s high level of charm and panache tom hoggins of telegraph praised manner with which these elements were introduced through a brilliant learning curve of direction rather than instruction and considered it a design ethos that is supremely generous but dealt with marvellous economy chris kohler of wired wrote that game s puzzles never require excessively complicated solutions and that much of puzzle solving is filled with moments that will have you slapping your forehead and thinking oh my god i m such an didn t i see that before stapleton was not as pleased with gel additions as with other new mechanics calling it difficult to control he felt that they have only a couple of uses at most bright felt that portal 2 was easier than its predecessor in part that he felt much of game was effectively tutorials for new gameplay additions requiring careful use of tools provided leaving him with impression that game was on rails cooperative puzzle solving aspect was highlighted as a valuable addition to game welsh called cooperative mode one of most satisfying and genuinely collaborative gaming experiences you can have with a friend onyett wrote valve knows how a good co operative mode requires a game design that doesn t simply encourage but requires you to work together in portal 2 communication is vital to success several reviewers praised non verbal cues that players could initiate to work with their partners portal 2 was praised for amount of detail in its design sound and music nelson credited sheer amount of detail put into game s world and wrote it all feels very real and natural with brief moments where you re simply sucked into this world onyett was impressed with amount of visual details and capabilities valve achieved from their source game engine and that added details and animations of levels consistently serv ed not only to entertain eye but to expand our understanding of game s characters hoggins wrote that game s world reacted to player character chell s presence in a startlingly organic way and praised valve s design as an achievement of world building that compares favourably with bioshock underwater city of rapture some reviewers said that second act of game taking place in less structured portion of old aperture facilities may be confusing to some players young wrote that in second act game cranks up difficulty level at a speed that may dishearten casual gamers and said that particularly when traveling between chambers he had absolutely no idea where i was supposed to head next kohler wrote that while player can explore abandoned areas of aperture none of it ever does s just a lot of sterile duplicated non interactive environments watters wrote that loading time between game s levels in contrast to earlier valve games are long enough to make you take notice and wish they were shorter watters also said that it was unfortunate that game lacks stand alone test chambers and leaderboards but even so portal 2 is not light on content without these welsh said that attempt to recapture spirit of song still alive at end credits of portal 2 was a mistake video game critic ben yahtzee croshaw named it best game of 2011 in his review show zero punctuation however he wrote in his extra punctuation column that while portal 2 was a very good game it unnecessarily retconned portions of origin game s story and did not really further game s concept however this criticism was directed solely at campaign and he stated that he found game s co op to be much more appealing and much more within spirit of original on april 20 2011 it was reported that customers had launched a protest against perceived shortcomings of portal 2 users complained that game was too saying that it is only four hours long
