linguini and colette as rat colony settles into their new home in bistro s attic voice cast patton oswalt as remy a rat with heightened senses of taste and smell enabling a talent and desire for

a broken heart two years prior to film s events following his five star restaurant being downgraded to four stars due to a negative review by anton ego many reviewers believe that gusteau is inspired by real life chef bernard who committed suicide after media speculation that his flagship restaurant la cote d or was going to be downgraded from three michelin stars to two la cote d or was one of restaurants visited by brad bird and others in france brian dennehy as django remy and emile s father and leader of rats peter o toole as anton ego a negative and easily displeased restaurant critic

thomas keller restaurateur as a dining patron who asks what s new in other language versions this role is also voiced by a chef production jan pinkava came up with concept in 2000 creating original design sets and characters and core storyline but he was never formally named director of film by 2004 pixar added bob peterson as a co director and was given exclusive control of story lacking confidence in story development pixar management replaced pinkava with bird in 2005 while peterson left film to work on up bird was attracted to film because of outlandishness of concept and conflict that drove it that rats feared kitchens yet a rat wanted to work in one bird was also delighted that film could be made a highly physical comedy with character of linguini providing endless fun for animators bird rewrote story with a change in emphasis he killed off gusteau gave larger roles to skinner and colette and also changed appearance of rats to be less anthropomorphic because ratatouille is intended to be a romantic lush vision of paris giving it an identity distinct from previous pixar films director brad bird producer brad lewis and some of crew spent a week in city to properly understand its environment taking a motorcycle tour and eating at five top restaurants there are also many water based sequences in film one of which is set in sewers and is more complex than blue whale scene in finding nemo one scene has linguini wet after jumping into seine to fetch remy a pixar employee shade paint department coordinator kesten migdal jumped into pixar s swimming pool wearing a chef s uniform and apron to see which parts of suit stuck to his body and which became translucent from water absorption thumb film s take on traditional ratatouille dish was designed by gourmet chef thomas keller and later came to be known as confit byaldi a challenge for filmmakers was creating computer generated images of food that would appear delicious gourmet chefs in both u s and france were consulted and animators attended cooking classes at san francisco area culinary schools to understand workings of a commercial kitchen sets layout department manager michael a culinary academy trained professional chef before working at pixar helped teach and consult animators as they worked he also prepared dishes used by art shade paint effects and sets modeling departments renowned chef thomas keller allowed producer brad lewis to intern in his french laundry kitchen for film s climax keller designed a fancy layered version of title dish for rat characters to cook which he called confit byaldi in honor of original turkish name same sub surface light scattering technique that was used on skin in incredibles was used on fruits and vegetables while new programs gave an organic texture and movement to food completing illusion were music dialogue and abstract imagery representing characters mental sensations while appreciating food visual flavor metaphors were created by animator michel gagne inspired by work of oscar and norman mclaren to create a realistic compost pile art department photographed fifteen different kinds of produce such as apples berries bananas mushrooms oranges broccoli and lettuce in process of rotting cast members strove to make their french accents authentic yet understandable john ratzenberger notes that he often segued into an italian accent according to pixar designer jason deamer most of characters were designed while jan pinkava was still directing he has a real eye for sculpture according to pinkava critic anton ego was designed to resemble a vulture to save time human characters were designed and animated without toes rat expert debbie ducommun a k a rat lady was consulted on rat habits and characteristics along with ducommun s insight a vivarium containing pet rats sat in a hallway for more than a year so animators could study movement of animals fur noses ears paws and tails as they ran promotional material for intel credits their platform for a 30 percent performance improvement in rendering software they used remy in some of their marketing materials music brad bird reteamed with michael giacchino on score for ratatouille after having worked together on incredibles it was giacchino s second collaboration with pixar giacchino had written two themes for remy one about his self with rat colony and other about his hopes and dreams he also wrote a buddy theme for both remy and linguini that plays when they re together in addition to score giacchino wrote main theme song le festin about remy and his wishes to be a chef french artist camille was hired to perform le festin after giacchino listened to her music and realized she was perfect for song as a result song is sung in french in all versions of film music for ratatouille gave giacchino his first academy award nomination for best original score as well as his first grammy award for best score soundtrack album giacchino returned to pixar to score their 2009 blockbuster up release ratatouille was originally going to be released in 2006 however in december 2004 date was changed to 2007 this happened because disney pixar changed release date of cars from november 2005 to june 2006 thus pushing ratatouille to 2007 ratatouilles world premiere was on june 22 2007 at los angeles kodak theater commercial release was one week later with short film lifted preceding ratatouille in theaters earlier in year it had received an academy award nomination a test screening of film was shown at harkins cine capri theater in scottsdale

trailers scene was not present in final film release a second trailer was released on march 23 2007 ratatouille big cheese tour began on may 11 2007 with cooking demonstrations and a film preview voice actor lou romano attended san francisco leg of tour for autograph signings right thumb front label of planned ratatouille wine to have been promoted by disney pixar and costco and subsequently pulled for its use of a cartoon character disney and pixar were working to bring a french produced ratatouille branded wine to costco stores in august 2007 but abandoned plans because of complaints from california wine institute citing standards in labelling that restrict use of cartoon characters to avoid attracting under age drinkers in united kingdom in place of releasing a theatrical trailer a commercial featuring remy and emile was released in cinemas before its release to discourage obtaining unlicensed copies of films also in united kingdom main characters were used for a commercial for nissan note with remy and emile watching an original commercial for it made for surprisingly spacious ad campaign and also parodying it respectively disney pixar was concerned that audiences particularly children would not be familiar with word ratatouille and its pronunciation title was therefore also spelled phonetically within trailers and on posters for similar reasons in american
