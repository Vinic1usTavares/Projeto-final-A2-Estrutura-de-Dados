fallen under liao control since 938 chinese agreed but jurchens quick defeat of liao dynasty combined with song dynasty military failures made jin reluctant to cede these territories after a series of negotiations that embittered both sides jurchens attacked song dynasty in 1125 dispatching one army to taiyuan and other to bianjing modern kaifeng song capital surprised by news of an invasion song general tong guan retreated from taiyuan which was besieged and later captured as second jin army approached capital song emperor huizong abdicated and fled south qinzong his eldest son was enthroned jurchens laid siege to kaifeng in 1126 but qinzong negotiated their retreat from capital by agreeing to a large annual indemnity qinzong reneged on deal and ordered song forces to defend prefectures instead of fortifying capital jin resumed war and again besieged kaifeng in 1127 they captured emperor qinzong of song many members of imperial family and high officials of song imperial court in an event known as incident this separated north and south china between jin and song remnants of song imperial family retreated to southern china and after brief stays in several temporary capitals

against song begun by 4th jin emperor wanyan liang was unsuccessful he lost battle of caishi 1161 and was later assassinated by his own disaffected officers an invasion of jin territory motivated by song revanchism 1206 1208 was also unsuccessful a decade later jin launched an abortive military campaign against song in 1217 to replace territory they had lost to invading mongols song allied with mongols in 1233 and in next year jointly captured caizhou last refuge of jin emperor jin dynasty collapsed that year in 1234 after demise of jin song dynasty itself became a target of mongols and collapsed in 1279 wars engendered an era of swift technological cultural and demographic changes in china battles between song and jin brought about introduction of various gunpowder weapons siege of

combat in 1120 aguda agreed to cede sixteen prefectures to song in exchange for transfer to jin of annual tributary payments that song had been giving liao by end of 1120 however jurchens had seized liao supreme capital and offered song only parts of sixteen prefectures among other things jin would keep liao western capital of datong at western end of sixteen prefectures two sides agreed that jin

february 23 of that year jin captured liao central capital as promised song delayed their entry into war because it diverted resources to fighting western xia in northwest and suppressing a large popular rebellion led by fang la in south when a song army under tong guan s command finally attacked yanjing in may 1122 smaller forces of weakened liao repelled invaders with ease another attack failed in fall both times tong was forced to retreat back to kaifeng after first attack aguda changed terms of agreement and only promised yanjing and six other prefectures to song in early 1123 it was jurchen forces that easily took liao southern capital they sacked it and enslaved its population quick collapse of liao led to more negotiations between song and jin jurchen military success and their effective control over sixteen prefectures gave them more leverage aguda grew increasingly frustrated as he realized that despite their military failures song still intended to seize most of prefectures in spring of 1123 two sides finally set terms of first song jin treaty only seven prefectures including yanjing would be returned to song and song would pay an annual indemnity of 300 000

about 180 years of annual tribute song had been paying to jin since 1123 with little prospect of help from afar arriving infighting broke out in song court between officials who supported jin offer and those who opposed it opponents of treaty like li gang 1083 1140 rallied around proposal of remaining in defensive positions until reinforcements arrived and jurchen supplies ran out they botched an ambush against jin that was carried out at night and were replaced by officials who supported peace negotiations failed attack pushed qinzong into meeting jurchen demands and his officials convinced him to go through with deal song recognized jin control over three prefectures jurchen army ended siege in march after 33 days second campaign almost as soon as jin armies had left kaifeng emperor qinzong reneged on deal and dispatched two armies to repel jurchen troops attacking taiyuan and bolster defenses of zhongshan and hejian an army of 90 000 soldiers and another of 60 000 were

overwhelmed taiyuan fell in september 1126 after 260 days of siege when song court received news of fall of taiyuan officials who had advocated defending empire militarily fell from favor again and were replaced by counselors who favored appeasement in mid december two jurchen armies converged on kaifeng for second time that year second siege of kaifeng after defeat of several song armies in north emperor qinzong wanted to negotiate a truce with jin but he committed a massive strategic blunder when he commanded his remaining armies to protect prefectural cities instead of kaifeng neglecting importance of capital he left kaifeng defended with fewer than 100 000 soldiers song forces were dispersed throughout china powerless to stop second jurchen siege of city jin assault commenced in mid december 1126 even as fighting raged on qinzong continued to sue for peace but jin demands for territory were enormous they wanted all provinces north of yellow river after more than twenty days of heavy combat against besieging forces song defenses were decimated and morale of song soldiers was on decline on january 9 1127 jurchens broke through and started to loot conquered city

surrender a few days later qinzong former emperor huizong and members of song court were captured by jurchens as hostages they were taken north to huining modern harbin where they were stripped of their royal privileges and reduced to commoners former emperors were humiliated by their captors they were mocked with disparaging titles like muddled virtue and double muddled in 1128 jin made them perform a ritual meant for war criminals harsh treatment of song royalty softened after death of huizong in 1135 titles were granted to deceased monarch and his son qinzong was promoted to duke a

chinese man playing zither with another man sitting on a stone listening to music many factors contributed to song s repeated military blunders and subsequent loss of northern china to jurchens traditional accounts of song history held of huizong s imperial court responsible for decline of dynasty these narratives condemned huizong and his officials for their moral failures early song emperors were eager to enact political reforms and revive ethical framework of confucianism but enthusiasm for reforms gradually died after reformist wang anshi s expulsion as chancellor in 1076 corruption marred reign of huizong who was more skilled as a painter than as a ruler huizong was known for his extravagance and funded costly construction of gardens and temples while rebellions threatened state s grip on power a modern analysis by ari daniel levine places more of blame on deficiencies in military and bureaucratic leadership loss of northern china was not inevitable military was overextended by a government too assured of its own military prowess huizong diverted state s resources to failed wars against western xia song insistence on a greater share of liao territory only succeeded in provoking their jin allies song diplomatic oversights underestimated jin and allowed unimpeded rise of jurchen military power state had plentiful resources with exception of horses but managed its assets poorly during battles unlike expansive han and tang empires that preceded song song did not have a significant foothold in central asia where a large proportion of its horses could be bred or procured as song general li gang noted without a consistent supply of horses dynasty was at a significant disadvantage against jurchen cavalry jin were victorious only because they used iron shielded cavalry while we opposed them with foot soldiers it is only to be expected that our soldiers were scattered and dispersed wars with southern song southern retreat of song court enthronement of emperor gaozong jin leadership had not expected or desired fall of song dynasty their intention was to weaken song in order to demand more tribute and they were unprepared for magnitude of their victory jurchens were preoccupied with strengthening their rule over areas once controlled by liao instead of continuing their invasion of song an empire with a military that outnumbered their own they adopted strategy of using chinese to control chinese jin hoped a proxy state would be capable of administering northern china and collecting annual indemnity without requiring jurchen interventions to quell anti jin uprisings in 1127 jurchens installed a former song official zhang bangchang zhang bang chang 1081 1127 as puppet emperor of newly established da chu great chu dynasty puppet government did not deter resistance in northern china but insurgents were motivated by their anger towards jurchens looting rather than by a sense of loyalty towards inept song court a number of song commanders stationed in towns scattered across northern china retained their allegiance to song and armed volunteers organized militias opposed to jurchen military presence insurgency hampered ability of jin to exert control over north meanwhile one song prince zhao gou had escaped capture he had been held up in while on a diplomatic mission and never made it back to kaifeng he was not present in capital when city fell to jurchens future emperor gaozong managed to evade jurchen troops tailing him by moving from one province to next traveling across hebei henan and shandong jurchens tried to lure him back to kaifeng where they could finally capture him but did not succeed zhao gou finally arrived in song southern capital at yingtianfu modern shangqiu in early june 1127 for gaozong r 1127 1162 yingtianfu was first in a series of temporary capitals called court moved to yingtianfu because of its historical importance to emperor of song founder of dynasty who had previously served in that city as a military governor symbolism of city was meant to secure political legitimacy of new emperor who was enthroned there on june 12 after reigning for barely one month zhang bangchang was persuaded by song to step down as emperor of great chu and to recognize legitimacy of song imperial line li gang pressured gaozong to execute zhang for betraying song emperor relented and zhang was coerced into suicide killing of zhang showed that song was willing to provoke jin and that jin had yet to solidify their control over newly conquered territories submission and abolition of chu meant that kaifeng was now back under song control zong ze 1059 1128 song general responsible for fortifying kaifeng entreated gaozong to move court back to city but gaozong refused and retreated south southward move marked end of northern song and beginning of southern song era of chinese history descendant of confucius at qufu duke yansheng kong duanyou fled south with song

zhang zai also fled south with gaozong move south song disbandment of great chu and execution of zhang bangchang antagonized jurchens and violated treaty that two parties had negotiated jin renewed their attacks on song and quickly reconquered much of northern china in late 1127 gaozong moved his court further south from yingtianfu to yangzhou south of huai river and north of yangtze river by sailing down grand canal court spent over a year in city when jurchens advanced to huai river court was partially evacuated to hangzhou in 1129 days later gaozong narrowly escaped on horseback just a few hours ahead of jurchen vanguard troops after a coup in hangzhou almost dethroned him in may 1129 he moved his capital back north to jiankang modern nanjing on south bank of yangtze one month later however zong ze s successor du chong vacated his forces from kaifeng exposing jiankang to attack emperor moved back to hangzhou in september leaving jiankang in du chong s hands jin eventually captured kaifeng in early 1130 from 1127 to 1129 song sent thirteen embassies to jin to discuss peace terms and to negotiate release of gaozong s mother and huizong but jin court ignored them in december 1129 jin started a new military offensive dispatching two armies across huai river in east and west on western front an army invaded jiangxi area where song dowager empress resided and captured present day nanchang they were ordered to retreat a few months later when eastern army withdrew meanwhile on eastern front wuzhu commanded main jin army he crossed yangtze southwest of jiankang and took that city when du chong surrendered wuzhu set out from jiankang and advanced rapidly to try to capture gaozong jin seized hangzhou january 22 1130 and then shaoxing further south february 4 but general zhang jun s 1086 1154 battle with wuzhu near ningbo gave gaozong time to escape by time wuzhu resumed pursuit song court was fleeing on ships to islands off coast of zhejiang and then further south to wenzhou jin sent ships to chase after gaozong but failed to catch him they gave up pursuit and jurchens retreated north after they plundered undefended cities of hangzhou and suzhou they finally started to face resistance from song armies led by yue fei and han shizhong latter even inflicted a major defeat on jurchen forces and tried to prevent wuzhu from crossing back to north bank of yangtze small boats of jin army were outmatched by han shizhong s fleet of seagoing vessels wuzhu eventually managed to cross river when he had his troops use incendiary arrows to neutralize han s ships by burning their sails wuzhu s troops came back south of yangtze one last time to jiankang which they pillaged and then headed north yet jin had been caught off guard by strength of song navy and wuzhu never tried to cross yangtze river again in early 1131 jin armies between huai and yangtze were repelled by bandits loyal to song zhang rong leader of bandits was given a government position for his victory against jin after jin incursion that almost captured gaozong sovereign ordered pacification commissioner zhang jun 1097 1164 who was in charge of shaanxi and sichuan in far west to attack jin there to relieve pressure on court zhang put together a large army but was defeated by wuzhu near xi an in late 1130 wuzhu advanced further west into gansu and drove as far south as modern most important battles between jin and song in 1131 and 1132 took place in shaanxi gansu and sichuan jin lost two battles at heshang yuan in 1131 after failing to enter sichuan wuzhu retreated to yanjing he returned to western front again from 1132 to 1134 jin attacked hubei and shaanxi in 1132 wuzhu captured heshang yuan in 1133 but his advance was halted by a defeat at xianren pass he gave up on taking sichuan and no more major battles were fought between jin and song for rest of decade song court returned to hangzhou in 1133 and city was renamed lin an imperial ancestral temple was built in lin an later that same year a sign that court had in practice established lin an as song capital without a formal declaration it was treated as a temporary capital between 1130 and 1137 court would sporadically move to jiankang and back to lin an there were proposals to make jiankang new capital but lin an won out because court considered it a more secure city natural barriers that surrounded lin an including lakes and rice paddies made it more difficult for jurchen cavalry to breach its fortifications access to sea made it easier to retreat from city in 1138 gaozong officially declared lin an capital of dynasty but label of temporary capital would still be in place lin an would remain capital of southern song for next 150 years growing into a major commercial and cultural center da qi invades song qin hui an official of song court recommended a peaceful solution to conflict in 1130 saying that if it is desirable that there will be no more conflicts under heaven it is necessary for southerners to stay in south and northerners in north gaozong who considered himself a northerner initially rejected proposal there were gestures toward peace in 1132 when jin freed an imprisoned song diplomat and in 1133 when song offered to become a jin vassal but a treaty never materialized jin requirement that border between two states be moved south from huai river to yangtze was too large of a hurdle for two sides to reach an agreement continuing insurgency of anti jin forces in northern china hampered jurchen campaigns south of yangtze reluctant to let war drag on jin decided to create da qi great qi their second attempt at a puppet state in northern china jurchens believed that this state nominally ruled by someone of han chinese descent would be able to attract allegiance of disaffected members of insurgency jurchens also suffered from a shortage of skilled manpower and controlling entirety of northern china was not

year however qi and jin initiated a new offensive further east along huai river for first time gaozong issued an edict officially condemning da qi armies of qi and jin won a series of victories in huai valley but were repelled by han shizhong near yangzhou and by yue fei at modern hefei their sudden withdrawal in 1135 in response to death of jin emperor taizong gave song time to regroup war

two states and recognized gaozong as a subject of jin but because there remained opposition to treaty in both courts of jin and song treaty never came into effect a jurchen army led by wuzhu invaded

lasted for next 70 years but was interrupted twice one military campaign was initiated by song and other by jin further campaigns wanyan liang s war wanyan liang led a coup against emperor xizong and became fourth emperor of jin dynasty in 1150 wanyan liang presented himself as a chinese emperor and planned to unite china by conquering song in 1158 wanyan liang provided a casus belli by announcing that song had broken 1142 peace treaty by acquiring horses he instituted an unpopular draft that was source of widespread unrest in empire anti jin revolts erupted among khitans and in jin provinces bordering song wanyan liang did not allow dissent and opposition to war was severely punished song had been notified beforehand of wanyan liang s plan they prepared by securing their defenses along border mainly near yangtze river but were hampered by emperor gaozong s indecisiveness gaozong s desire for peace made him averse to provoking jin wanyan liang began invasion in 1161 without formally declaring war jurchen armies personally led by wanyan liang left kaifeng on october 15 reached huai river border on october 28 and marched in direction of yangtze song lost huai to jurchens but

ships of jin fleet jin ships were unable to compete because they were smaller and hastily constructed bombs launched by song contained mixtures of gunpowder lime scraps of iron and a poison that was likely arsenic traditional chinese accounts consider this turning point of war characterizing it as a military upset that secured southern china from northern invaders significance of battle is said to have rivaled a similarly revered victory at battle of fei river in 4th century contemporaneous song accounts claimed that 18 000 song soldiers commanded by yu yunwen and tasked with defending caishi were able to defeat invading jurchen army of 400 000 soldiers modern historians are more skeptical and consider jurchen numbers an exaggeration song historians may have confused number of jurchen soldiers at battle of caishi with total number of soldiers under command of wanyan liang conflict was not one sided battle that traditional accounts imply and song had numerous advantages over jin song fleet was larger than jin s and jin were unable to use their greatest asset cavalry in a naval battle a modern analysis of battlefield has shown that it was a minor battle although victory did boost song morale jin lost but only suffered about 4 000 casualties and battle was not fatal to jurchen war effort it was wanyan liang s poor relationships with jurchen generals who despised him that doomed chances of a jin victory on december 15 wanyan liang was assassinated in his military camp by disaffected officers he was succeeded by emperor shizong r 1161 1189 shizong was pressured into ending unpopular war with song and ordered withdrawal of jin forces in 1162 emperor gaozong retired from throne that same year his mishandling of war with wanyan liang was one of many reasons for his abdication skirmishes between song and jin continued along border but subsided in 1165 after negotiation of a peace treaty there were no major territorial changes treaty dictated that song still had to pay annual indemnity but indemnity was renamed from tribute which had implied a subordinate relationship to payment song revanchism thumb right jurchen warrior with a bow on an early 17th

to jin capital and started provoking their northern neighbor hostilities were instigated by chancellor han tuozhou song emperor r 1194 1224 took little interest in war effort under han tuozhou s supervision preparations for war proceeded gradually and cautiously court venerated hero yue fei and han orchestrated publishing of historical records that justified war with jin from 1204 onwards chinese armed groups raided jurchen settlements han tuozhou was designated head of national security in 1205 song funded insurgents in north that professed loyalist sympathies these early clashes continued to escalate partly abetted by song officials and war against jin was officially declared on june 14 1206 document that announced war claimed jin lost mandate of heaven a sign that they were unfit to rule and called for an insurrection of han chinese against jin state song armies led by general bi zaiyu d 1217 captured barely defended border city of sizhou on north bank of huai river across from modern county but suffered large losses against jurchens in hebei jin repelled song and moved south to besiege song town of on grand canal just south of huai river bi defended town and jurchens withdrew from siege after three months by fall of 1206 however jurchens had captured multiple towns and military bases jin initiated an offensive against song prefectures in central front of war capturing zaoyang and on han river near modern by fall of 1206 song offensive had already failed disastrously soldier morale sank as weather conditions worsened supplies ran out and hunger spread forcing many to desert massive defections of han chinese in northern china that song had expected never materialized a notable betrayal did occur on song side however wu xi d 1207 governor general of sichuan defected to jin in december 1206 song had depended on wu s success in west to divert jin soldiers away from eastern front he had attacked jin positions earlier in 1206 but his army of about 50 000 men had been repelled wu s defection could have meant loss of entire western front of war but song loyalists assassinated wu on march 29 1207 before jin troops could take control of surrendered territories an bing d 1221 was given wu xi s position but cohesion of song forces in west fell apart after wu s demise and commanders turned on each other in ensuing infighting fighting continued in 1207 but by end of that year war was at a stalemate song was now on defensive while jin failed to make gains in song territory failure of han tuozhou s aggressive policies led to his demise on december 15 1207 han was beaten to death by imperial palace guards his accomplice su was executed and other officials connected to han were dismissed or exiled since neither combatant was eager to continue war they returned to negotiations a peace treaty was signed on november 2 1208 and song tribute to jin was reinstated song annual indemnity increased by 50 000 taels of silver and 50 000

cavalry mongols a nomadic confederation had unified in middle of twelfth century they and other steppe nomads occasionally raided jin empire from northwest jin shied away from punitive expeditions and was content with appeasement similar to practices of song mongols formerly a jin tributary ended their jurchen vassalage in 1210 and attacked jin in 1211 in light of this event song court debated ending tributary payments to weakened jin but they again chose to avoid antagonizing jin they refused western xia s offers of allying against jin in 1214 and willingly complied when in 1215 jin rejected a request to lower annual indemnity meanwhile in 1214 jin retreated from besieged capital of to kaifeng which became new capital of dynasty as mongols expanded jin suffered territorial losses and attacked song in 1217 to compensate for their shrinking territory periodic song raids against jin were official justification for war another likely motive was that conquest of song would have given jin a place to escape should mongols succeed in taking control of north shi 1164 1233 chancellor of song emperor r 1224 1264 was hesitant to fight jin and delayed declaration of war for two months song generals were largely autonomous allowing shi to evade blame for their military blunders jin advanced across border from center and western fronts jurchen military successes were limited and jin faced repeated raids from neighboring state of western xia in 1217 song generals meng zongzheng and hu zaixing defeated jin and prevented them from capturing zaoyang and suizhou a second jin campaign in late 1217 did marginally better than first in east jin made little headway in huai river valley but in west they captured and pass modern shaanxi in late 1217 jin tried to captured suizhou in jingxi south circuit again in 1218 and 1219 but failed a song counteroffensive in early 1218 captured sizhou and in 1219 jin cities of and were pillaged twice by a song army commanded by zhao fang d 1221 in west command of song forces in sichuan was given to an bing who had previously been dismissed from this position he successfully defended western front but was unable to advance further because of local uprisings in area jin tried to extort an indemnity from song but never received it in last of three campaigns in early 1221 jin captured city of qizhou in huainan west deep in song territory song armies led by hu zaixing and li quan d 1231 defeated jin who then withdrew in 1224 both sides agreed on a peace treaty that ended annual tributes to jin diplomatic missions between jin and song were also cut off mongol song alliance thumb mongol song conquest of jurchen jin in february 1233 mongols took kaifeng after a siege of more than 10 months and jin court retreated to town of caizhou in 1233 emperor aizong r 1224 1234 of jin dispatched diplomats to implore song for supplies jin envoys reported to song that mongols would invade song after they were done with jin a forecast that would later be proven true but song ignored warning and rebuffed request they instead formed an alliance with mongols against jin song provided supplies to mongols in return for parts of henan jin dynasty collapsed when mongol and song troops defeated jurchens at siege of caizhou in 1234 general meng gong led song army against caizhou penultimate emperor of jin emperor aizong took his own life his short lived successor emperor mo was killed in town a few days later mongols later turned their sights towards song after decades of war song dynasty also fell in 1279 when remaining song loyalists lost to mongols in a naval battle near guangdong historical significance cultural and demographic changes jurchen migrants from northeastern reaches of jin territory settled in jin controlled lands of northern china constituting less than ten percent of total population two to three million ruling jurchens were a minority in a region that was still dominated by 30 million han chinese southward expansion of jurchens caused jin to transition their decentralized government of semi agrarian tribes to a bureaucratic chinese style dynasty thumb 170px left a medallion with writing in jurchen script one of jin empire s three working languages alt a medallion inscribed with jurchen script jin government initially promoted an independent jurchen culture alongside their adoption of centralized chinese imperial bureaucracy but empire was gradually sinicized over time jurchens became fluent in chinese language and philosophy of confucianism was used to legitimize ruling government confucian state rituals were adopted during reign of emperor xizong 1135 1150 jin implemented imperial exams on confucian classics first regionally and then for entire empire classics and other works of chinese literature were translated into jurchen and studied by jin intellectuals but very few jurchens actively contributed to classical literature of jin khitan script from chinese family of scripts formed basis of a national writing system for empire jurchen script all three scripts were working languages of government jurchen clans adopted chinese personal names with their jurchen names wanyan liang prince of hailing r 1150 1161 was an enthusiastic proponent of jurchen sinicization and enacted policies to encourage it wanyan liang had been by song diplomats from childhood and his emulation of song practices earned him jurchen nickname of aping chinese he studied chinese classics drank tea and played chinese chess for recreation under his reign administrative core of jin state was moved south from huining he instated beijing as jin main capital in 1153 palaces were erected in beijing and kaifeng while original more northerly residences of jurchen chieftains were demolished emperor s political reforms were connected with his desire to conquer all of china and to legitimize himself as a chinese emperor prospect of conquering southern china was cut short by wanyan liang s assassination wanyan liang s successor emperor shizong was less enthusiastic about sinicization and reversed several of wanyan liang s edicts he sanctioned new policies with intent to slow assimilation of jurchens shizong s prohibitions were abandoned by emperor r 1189 1208 who promoted reforms that transformed political structure of dynasty closer to that of song and tang dynasties despite cultural and demographic changes military hostilities between jin and song persisted until fall of jin in south retreat of song dynasty led to major demographic changes population of refugees from north that resettled in lin an and jiankang modern hangzhou and nanjing eventually grew greater than population of original residents whose numbers had dwindled from repeated jurchen raids government encouraged resettlement of peasant migrants from southern provinces of song to underpopulated territories between yangtze and huai rivers new capital lin an grew into a major commercial and cultural center it rose from a middling city of no special importance to one of world s largest and most prosperous during his stay in lin an in yuan dynasty 1260 1368 when city was not as wealthy as it had been under song marco polo remarked that this city is greater than any in world once retaking northern china became less plausible and lin an grew into a significant trading city government buildings were extended and renovated to better befit its status as an imperial capital modestly sized imperial palace was expanded in 1133 with new roofed alleyways and in 1148 with an extension of palace walls loss of northern china cultural center of chinese civilization diminished regional status of song dynasty after jurchen conquest of north korea recognized jin not song as legitimate dynasty of china song s military failures reduced it to a subordinate of jin turning it into a china among equals song economy however recovered quickly after move south government revenues earned from taxing foreign trade nearly doubled between closing of northern song era in 1127 and final years of gaozong s reign in early 1160s recovery was not uniform and areas like huainan and hubei that had been directly affected by war took decades to return to their pre war levels in spite of multiple wars jin remained one of main trading partners of song song demand for foreign products like fur and horses went unabated historian believes that song commerce with north was profitable enough that it compensated for silver delivered annually as an indemnity to jin jin song wars were one of several wars in northern china along with uprising of five barbarians an lushan rebellion huang chao rebellion and wars of five dynasties and ten kingdoms which caused a mass

recorded at siege of de an in 1132 shown in ming dynasty huolongjing firing pellets as projectiles alt fire lance firing pellets battles between song and jin spurred invention and use of gunpowder weapons there are reports that fire lance one of earliest ancestors of firearm was used by song against jurchens besieging de an modern in eastern hubei in 1132 during jin invasion of hubei and shaanxi weapon consisted of a spear attached with a flamethrower capable of firing projectiles from a barrel constructed of bamboo or paper they were built by soldiers under command of chen gui who led song army defending de an fire lances with which song soldiers were equipped at de an were built for destroying wooden siege engines of jin and not for combat against jin infantry song soldiers compensated for limited range and mobility of weapon by timing their attacks on jin siege engines waiting until they were within range of fire lances later fire lances used metal barrels fired projectiles farther and with greater force and could be used against infantry thumb left pili huoqiu bombs at caishi contained mixtures of lime and gunpowder this huoqiu is from earlier wujing zongyao

ships of jin fleet commanded by wanyan liang gunpowder mixture of bomb contained powdered lime which produced blinding smoke once casing of bomb shattered song also deployed incendiary weapons at battle of during same year gunpowder was also applied to arrows in 1206 by a song army stationed in xiangyang arrows were most likely an incendiary weapon but its function may also have resembled that of an early rocket at jin siege of qizhou in 1221 jurchens fought song with gunpowder bombs and arrows jin tiehuopao iron huopao which had cast iron casings are first known bombs that could explode bomb needed to be capable of detonating in order to penetrate iron casing song army had a large supply of incendiary bombs but there are no reports of them having a weapon similar to jin s detonating
