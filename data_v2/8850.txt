balaur bondoc is a species of theropod dinosaur from late cretaceous period in what is now romania it is type species of monotypic genus balaur after balaur a dragon of romanian folklore specific name bondoc means stocky so balaur bondoc means stocky dragon in romanian this name refers to greater musculature that balaur had compared to its relatives genus which was first described by scientists in august 2010 is known from two partial skeletons including type specimen fossils of balaur were found in and sebes formations part of cretaceous romania called hateg island hateg island is commonly referred to as island of dwarf dinosaurs and was part of european archipelago of tethys sea approximately 70 million years ago when world sea levels were higher and much of europe was tropical or sub tropical early studies of fossils placed animal among group of dromaeosaurid dinosaurs that includes velociraptor which was similar in size subsequent phylogenetic analyses have since placed balaur among basal avialans group that includes modern birds unlike other early paravians balaur had not just one but two large retractable sickle shaped claws on each foot and its limbs were proportionally shorter and heavier than those of its relatives as with other dinosaurs from hateg such as a dwarf sauropod its strange features have been argued to show effects of its island habitat on its evolution description left thumb balaur bondoc compared in size to a human balaur is a genus of theropod dinosaurs estimated to have lived about years ago in late cretaceous maastrichtian and contains single species b bondoc bones of this species were shorter and heavier than those of basal paravians while feet of most early paravians bore a single large sickle claw on second toe which was held retracted off ground balaur had large retractable sickle claws on both first and second toes of each foot in addition to its strange feet type specimen of balaur is unique for its status of being most complete theropod fossil from late cretaceous of europe it also possesses a great number of additional autapomorphies including a reduced and presumably nonfunctional third finger consisting of only one rudimentary phalanx partial skeleton was collected from red floodplain mudstone of sebes formation of romania it consists of a variety of vertebrae as well as much of pectoral and pelvic girdles and a large part of limbs it is first reasonably complete and well preserved theropod from late cretaceous of europe thumb balaur reconstructed as an avialan it is similar in size to velociraptor with balaur s recovered skeletal elements suggesting an overall length of around balaur had re evolved a functional first toe used to support its weight which bore a large claw that could be hyperextended it had short and stocky feet and legs and large muscle attachment areas on pelvis which indicate that it was adapted for strength rather than speed csiki et al describe this novel body plan as a dramatic example of aberrant morphology developed in island dwelling taxa stocky feet are exemplified by length of metatarsus being only two times its width it is 1 5 times wider than lower leg both traits are unique in theropoda skeleton of balaur also shows extensive fusion of limb bones wrist bones and metacarpals are fused into a carpometacarpus pelvic bones are fused shinbone calf bone and upper ankle bones have been fused into a tibiotarsus and lower ankle bones and metatarsals into a tarsometatarsus degree of fusion is typical for avialae evolutionary branch of birds and their direct relatives discovery and naming thumb skeletal reconstruction showing known remains in white first small bones belonging to balaur bondoc consisted of six elements of front limbs named specimens r 1580 1585 these were discovered in 1997 in romania by dan grigorescu but morphology of arm was so unusual that scientists could not correctly combine them mistaking them for remains of an oviraptorosaur first partial skeleton was discovered in september 2009 in romania approximately 2 5 kilometers north of sebes along sebes river in sebes formation dating from early maastrichtian and was given preliminary field number sbg a later it received holotype inventory number eme vp 313 discovery was made by geologist and paleontologist matyas of transylvanian museum society of cluj napoca who sent them for analysis to zoltan csiki of university of bucharest findings were described on august 31 2010 in proceedings of national academy of sciences 1997 specimens indicate an individual about 45 longer than holotype they were also found in a younger stratum generic name balaur three syllables stressed on second a is from romanian word for a dragon of romanian folklore while specific epithet bondoc pronounced like boned oak meaning a squat chubby individual refers to small robust shape of animal as balaur is a winged dragon name additionally hints at close relation of balaur to birds within bondoc was chosen by discoverers also because it is derived from turkish small ball thus alluding to probable asian origin of ancestors of balaur classification thumb left left foot of holotype position of balaur relative to other bird like dinosaurs and early birds has been difficult to determine initial phylogenetic analysis placed balaur bondoc closest to asiatic mainland dromaeosaurid species velociraptor mongoliensis a 2013 study by brusatte and colleagues using a modified version of same data found it in an unresolved close relationship with dromaeosaurids deinonychus and adasaurus with some possible alternative trees suggesting it branched off before common ancestor of deinonychus and velociraptor while others maintained it as closest relative of velociraptor with adasaurus as their next closest relative brusatte s l et al 2013 osteology of balaur bondoc an island dwelling dromaeosaurid dinosauria theropoda from late cretaceous of romania bulletin of american museum of natural history 374 1 100 more recent analyses using different sets of anatomical data have since cast doubt on a dromaeosaurid classification for balaur in 2013 a larger analysis containing a wide variety of coelurosaurs found that balaur was not a dromaeosaurid at all but a basal avialan more closely related to modern birds than to but more basal than a study published in 2014 found balaur to be sister to an independent analysis using an expanded version of original data set one that found balaur to be a dromaeosaurid drew a similar conclusion in 2014 in 2015 researchers andrea cau tom brougham and darren naish published a study which specifically attempted to clarify which theropods were close relatives of balaur while their analysis could not completely rule out possibility that b bondoc was a dromaeosaurid they concluded that this result was less likely than classification of balaur as a non avialan based on several important bird like features many of presumed unique traits would in fact have been normal for a member of avialae typical bird features included degree of fusion of limb bones functional first toe first toe claw not being smaller than second claw a long penultimate phalanx of third toe a small fourth toe claw and a long fifth metatarsal paleobiology diet and lifestyle thumb reconstruction of balaur as a dromaeosaur using originally proposed kicking motion little is known about behavior of balaur because of lack of skull material it is impossible to determine by shape of teeth whether balaur was a carnivore or a herbivore original description assumed it was carnivorous because it had been found that it was closely related to velociraptor csiki speculated in 2010 that it may have been one of apex predators in its limited island ecosystem as neither skeletons nor teeth of larger theropods have been discovered in romania he also believed that it likely used its double sickle claws for slashing prey and that atrophied state of its hands indicates that it probably did not use them to hunt one of original discoverers indicated that it was probably more of a kickboxer than a sprinter compared to velociraptor and was probably able to hunt larger animals than itself however more recent studies by denver fowler and others have shown that foot anatomy of paravians like balaur indicate that they used their large claws to grip and pin prey to ground while flapping with their proto wings to stay on top of their victim once it was worn out they might have proceeded to feast while it was still alive as some modern birds of prey still do due to shape of claws they would not have been effective in slashing attacks very short fused metatarsus of balaur and enlarged first claw strange even by true dromaeosaur standards are thought to be consistent with these newer studies lending further support to idea that balaur was a predator italian paleontologist andrea cau has speculated that aberrant features present in balaur may have been a result of this theropod being omnivorous or herbivorous rather than carnivorous like most non avian theropods lack of third finger may be a sign of reduced predatory behavior and robust first toe could be interpreted as a weight supporting adaptation rather than a weapon these characteristics are consistent with relatively short stocky limbs and wide swept back pubis which may indicate enlarged intestines for digesting vegetation as well as reduced speed cau referred to this as dodoraptor model cau a 2010 balaur more than just a double sickle clawed raptor theropoda september 1 2010 however in light of research done by fowler et al cau has remarked that anatomy of balaur may be more congruent with hypothesis that balaur was predatory after all cau a 2011 extinction of dodoraptor theropoda december 30 2011 in 2015 cau et al reconsidered ecology of balaur again in their reevaluation of its phylogenetic position arguing that if balaur was an avialan it would be phylogenetically bracketed by taxa known to have been herbivorous such as sapeornis and jeholornis this suggests a non hypercarnivorous lifestyle to be a more parsimonious conclusion and supports cau s initial interpretations of its specializations this is also indicated by reduced third finger lack of a lower articulation of second metatarsal and rather small and moderately recurved second toe claw balaur had a broad pelvis a broad foot a large first toe and broad lower ends of metatarsals relative to articulation surfaces such a combination can in remainder of theropoda only be found with herbivorous island effects thumb left pair of balaur bondoc in their native hateg island environment of what is now romania during maastrichtian age much of europe was fragmented into islands and a number of bizarre features of balaur are thought to be a result of an island effect relatively isolated conditions imposed on many of populations in this area species which are isolated on islands can be subject to effects of genetic drift and founder effect which can magnify effect of mutations which might be diluted in a larger population other island effects such as foster s rule which describes how small mainland species become larger and large mainland species become smaller can take effect cretaceous romania is known for example for its dwarf sauropods in 2010 this island effect was assumed to consist in rapid changes in a relatively recently arrived invading species and not seen as result of an isolated development of an endemic form during tens of millions of years assumed close relationship to velociraptor would have implied that isolation of hateg island must have been relative and intermittent in 2010 increased robustness of balaur was compared to parallel changes seen in isolated herbivorous mammals in 2013 it was claimed that balaur was only vertebrate predatory island species known to have become more robust and it was suggested that its broad feet had evolved to improve stability 2015 interpretation of balaur as an omnivorous member of avialae suggested it was descendant of a flying species that had developed a larger size similar to development in several other island herbivores this would then be a rare instance of secondary flightlessness in a paravian looking like a dromaeosaurid as predicted by gregory s paul
