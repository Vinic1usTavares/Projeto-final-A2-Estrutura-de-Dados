they were also subject to paying restitution to affected consumers alleged violations of law alleged violations of washington state law included taking control of a user s computer in violation of spyware act and consumer protection act cpa by remotely installing billing software that initiates and controls pop up cycle misrepresenting ability to uninstall software in violation of same acts by listing software in add remove programs although software cannot be uninstalled unconscionable business practices in violation of cpa by aggressive and harassing billing method used and failure to disclose it including use of a billing method that forces payment by completely obstructing users access to their computers threats harassment and intimidation in billing practices in violation of cpa by threatening collection proceedings and an adverse effect on users credit records while in fact defendants do not even know consumer s name and referring to consumers legal obligation to pay when in fact there is no legally binding contract failure to disclose material facts in violation of cpa aggressive relentless threatening form of payment demands fact that option for software will be disabled and that defendants transmit software to user s computer surreptitiously and misrepresentations in violation of cpa including stating software contains no spyware when in fact software itself constitutes spyware by its behavior in announcing suit following a seven month investigation washington attorney general rob mckenna rejected one possible defense defendants claim that users are legally obligated to pay for their service lacks merit because consumers did not provide knowing consent to installation of relentless pop up demands he said furthermore computer owners are not responsible to satisfy contracts that other people including minors entered into while using a computer he also said that defendants threats of collection proceedings and adverse effects on users credit ratings were empty as defendants had no way to personally identify computer users assistant attorney general paula selis said tactics forced some consumers to give in and pay between 20 and 100 for service she said we sued them because we were getting complaints from consumers who felt that they were being harassed and held over a barrel for payments that they didn t agree to make selis said it was harassment it was intimidation of consumer it was using a high pressure tactic to make him or her pay for something they were not legally obligated to pay settlement movieland settled with washington in april 2007 under terms similar to ftc settlement but specific to washington consumers agreeing to pay washington 50 000 as consumer reimbursement and to prominently state all important
