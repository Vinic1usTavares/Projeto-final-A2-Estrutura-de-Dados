wheat into flour thelnetham windmill worked by wind power until 1924 latterly on two sails after which it became derelict in 1979 a group of enthusiasts purchased thelnetham windmill for restoration numerous volunteers helped to restore mill to full working order over an eight year period mill is open to public and flour ground at mill can be bought at site mill is a small four storey tower mill with patent sails and winded by a fantail it drives two pairs of millstones with a third pair driven by an auxiliary engine history earliest record of a windmill in thelnetham was a post mill which was shown of joseph hodgkinson s map of suffolk of 1778 in 1818 post mill was moved to sandy lane diss norfolk post mill was replaced by a tower mill which was built by millwright george bloomfield for william button in 1819 mill was set to work on christmas day 1819 in 1832 mill was modernised by fitting of a cast iron windshaft patent sails and a fantail new windshaft was fitted on 16 july 1832 it was made by j king s lynn millwright and weighs 1 3 4 tons 1 780 kg a new stock was fitted in september 1836 william button died on 11 february 1837 mill passed jointly to his widow rebecca and their son richard richard button worked mill until 1860 at which date it was conveyed to his sons richard and william who sold it to richard peverett from kenninghall norfolk in 1862 mill was

ran mill until 1920 when he sold it to alphonso vincent a retired millwright from norfolk hornsby engine was sold in early 1920s mill was tailwinded c1920 and as a result one pair of sails was removed vincent carried out some repairs to mill and ran it until he retired in 1924 one of remaining two sails was wrecked in 1926 when mill was again tailwinded if wind is blowing from opposite direction to that which mill it is facing mill is tailwinded in this situation a fantail will not be able to turn mill into wind on death of alphonso vincent in 1932 his son george inherited property he lived at site in an old lorry until his death in 1973 mill passed to his daughter who sold it in 1974 to mr and mrs humphries who intended to convert it into a house they later changed their minds and offered

village hall being unavailable due to it undergoing a major refurbishment restoration thumb derelict mill before restoration began mill was restored over a period of six years much of work was carried out by enthusiasts who used working holidays to repair mill 1979 1980 consortium took possession of mill in november 1979 first priority was to make mill as as possible polythene sheets were spread on dust floor of mill to prevent further water penetration of structure mill was surveyed and recorded in spring 1980 dust floor partially collapsed and was removed as a safety measure scaffolding was erected to allow to be dismantled and cap centering wheels were removed in preparation for removal of cap frame a two week work in was held at end of july and beginning of august 1980 thirty three volunteers worked on mill over work in two new main floor beams for dust floor were made from baulks of pitch pine which had previously been in a maltings at bury st edmunds on 3 august 1980 windshaft and remaining sail fragments were removed by a mobile crane followed by cap frame and cast iron curb sections new oak joists were laid on dust floor and temporary boarding laid to provide a working platform for repairs to top of mill tower bin floor was removed apart from one oak main beam which was repairable a replacement main beam was made from pitch pine and oak beam was repaired new oak joists were fitted along with some salvaged from original floor which were fit to be reused one of these had previously been a whip from a common sail some of joists were made from pitch pine from which following its collapse on 19 february 1977 had been re erected at museum of east anglian life stowmarket sack hoist was dismantled to enable its repair brickwork was repaired and new lintels were made for some of windows a tarpaulin was secured over mill tower to keep weather out over winter floorboards on bin floor were replaced and one of two pairs of millstones was removed work was financed by grants of ps500 from council for preservation of rural essex in recognition of work carried out by suffolk mills group between 1974 and 1978 on ramsey windmill essex ps250 from st edmundsbury borough council ps200 from scarfe trust and ps200 from suffolk mills group other donations and income amounted to ps65 with balance of expenditure being met jointly by five owners work in

1981 season two separate work ins were held first from 25 july to 2 august and second from 22 august to 30 august a total of 37 volunteers participated over two weeks millstones were removed from stone floor which was then repaired one of main beams was found to have been attacked by death watch beetles and over a third of elm beam was replaced with oak six supports for hurst frame were repaired one at a time as they bore whole of weight of machinery above one post required replacement it had rotted and floor had sunk by causing second main floor beam to fracture when this work had been completed stone floor was removed including second main floor beam which was removed in one piece so that most suitable route to install its replacement could be assessed new main beam for stone floor was installed and ground floor was concreted stone floor was reconstructed reusing old stone bearers and those joists that were fit for reuse other joists were made new from oak or pitch pine new floorboards were laid in dust floor thick elm boards being double grooved with a metal tongue between them those on bin floor are of a similar configuration top four courses of brickwork of mill tower were removed and work began on rebuilding them aided by a trammel attached to upright shaft during second work in remainder of stone floor was boarded again using double grooved boards with a metal tongue between them window on dust floor was rebuilt and reconstruction of top four courses of brickwork continued top two courses were rebuilt with red engineering bricks dust floor window had a reinforced concrete lintel cast as tower was weak at this point and had distorted windshaft curb segments and fantail gearing were given two coats of red lead paint a new finial for cap was made from a piece of oak long by diameter a start was made on removing old pointing on brickwork and repointing with gauged mortar after work in had finished boarding of stone floor was completed and mill thoroughly cleaned in preparation for an open day which was held in late autumn work done in 1981 cost ps3 250 donations received were ps2 000 from rank xerox ps1 704 from historic buildings council and ps130 from st edmundsbury borough council other donations and income received amounted to ps70 project received further coverage in local media eastern daily press and south norfolk news 1982 1982 work ins took place from 24 july to 1 august and 21 august to 29 august work planned included completion of brickwork at top of tower installation of elm curb a start on construction of new cap installing machinery and making and fitting various doors and windows cap frame was constructed incorporating two beams from original cap frame that were fit to be reused cap frame was completed in autumn 1982 it had been constructed upside down and a mobile crane was used to turn it over and place windshaft into position 1983 work in early part of 1983 was mainly confined to smaller jobs such as casting various brasses and overhaul of various parts of fantail drivetrain and mechanism for controlling patent sails mill was generally made as safe as possible inside in preparation for scheduled visits including one from wind and watermill section of society for protection of ancient buildings other work included overhaul of final drive to stones including dismantling stone nut and replacement of three cogs in beech when weather improved work commenced outside cap circle was mostly constructed before first work in commenced work ins took place over two separate weeks in july and august with 35 people participating during first work in fantail posts and braces were fitted oak cap ribs which had been prefabricated offsite were fitted and finial was supported by scaffolding ready for final fitting noggings of oak were fitted and finial was pulled into position using a windlass cap frame was competed with fitting of intermediate ribs and noggings rear of cap circle was also completed during this time between two work ins rear dormer was completed and fitting of noggings to cap frame completed this enabled a start to be made on boarding cap on monday of second work in boards for cap are 1 2 inch 13 mm thick and wide at petticoat tapering towards top a new neck bearing was installed under windshaft not without difficulty and much machining before it would fit when boarding of cap was completed cover strips were fitted over joints petticoat was drawn into position using a rope and windlass and galvanised steel reinforcing band screwed into position producing a sturdy structure striking rod was fitted through windshaft and axle for fantail fitted in position on top of fantail posts at top of mill tower curb was prepared to accept cap and cast iron curb track plates bolted into position repointing of brickwork of tower continued with nearly half of it completed at end of second work in after work ins had ended work continued on finishing cap which was scheduled for lift on in october weather hampered work initially but application of a modern paint designed to withstand normal movement of timber and yet remain waterproof was completed in time for lift on a mini work in was held weekend before cap was lifted with 17 people participating over weekend final work was done to cap and a new window was fitted to stone floor of mill tarpaulin was removed and trammel dismantled 5 ton cap was lifted into place by a mobile crane on 24 october 1983 watched by a crowd of some 70 people fitting of cap was toasted with beer from brewery southwold restoration work in 1983 cost ps1 408 grants were received from association of independent museums norton women s institute ipswich historical transport society national association for gifted children mr d porter and society for protection of ancient buildings further income came from sale of guide books and a drawing of mill by wilf foreman 1984 four work ins were held during 1984 first two were by apprentices from eastern electricity board thelnetham windmill was chosen at project to benefit from young person s development project for that year pakenham watermill had previously benefited from project and its owners suffolk preservation trust had suggested that thelnetham windmill would be a good candidate for scheme two separate parties spent a week each at mill a mains electricity supply was provided an underground cable was laid with assistance from british telecom who were trialling a thrust borer which had been developed at their research facility at martlesham heath thrust borer laid of ducting through which mains cable was pulled into position mill was then supplied with lights and sockets on each floor other work undertaken by apprentices involved repairing some frost damage to foundation brickwork digging a drainage trench around mill and moving auxiliary engine into position a concrete path around tower was trapping moisture leading to rising damp a french drain was constructed around mill to remedy these problem a ruston hornsby diesel engine had been purchased in 1981 and was fitted onto a permanent concrete base with aid of a mobile crane after fitting it was then painted some missing or broken parts were made or repaired as necessary off site new brake wheel and fantail were made original brake wheel was too rotten to repair and showed evidence that it had been altered from original one installed in 1819 original brake wheel was diameter to allow common sails to run at their optimum speed when mill was modernised in 1832 it was necessary to alter gear ratios within mill as patent sails run at a slower speed than common sails great spur wheel was increased in diameter and stone nuts reduced in diameter brake wheel was also rebuilt with a cast iron segment ring fitted in place of original cogs resulting in a wheel in diameter opinion of professional was sought and it was decided that a scaled up version of original brake wheel would be made but retaining cast iron teeth segments remains of original brake wheel were retained as an exhibit in mill original iron segments were all broken so a pattern was made and new segments were cast in heat treated malleable cast iron when brake wheel was completed it was dismantled and transported to mill ready for reassembly fantail was made some of small gears were replaced stocks were made from pitch pine and blades from douglas fir work at mill over winter included repairs to brickwork and windows with only one window still needing attention when first work in began new beech cogs were fitted to crown wheel which was restored to its correct position on upright shaft stocks and sails were made during two work ins held in july and august a total of 41 people attending over two weeks a second hand stock had been bought in 1920s and preserved at mill but upon examination it was found to be unfit for use thus two new stocks were required instead of one modern steel stocks had already been discounted on cost and durability grounds leaving two options traditional stocks made from a single piece of timber or laminated stocks good quality pitch pine was not obtainable in lengths required douglas fir was obtainable in such lengths but was discounted on strength and durability grounds a douglas fir stock on a nearby mill had rotted after only seven years thus it was decided that laminated stocks would be made long stocks were made from douglas fir all timber had been pressure treated with preservative and well seasoned it was estimated that a laminated stock would be up to 20 stronger than a similar stock of solid timber timber used was thick and nine laminations were required at centre where stock passes through poll end of windshaft careful attention was paid to where individual joints occurred between different pieces of timber both stocks were made during work in with one of them being trimmed and finished ready for use stocks were first laminated stocks made by amateurs four sails were made originals being slightly different pairs those on inner stock having bays of pitch and those on outer stock having bays of pitch it was decided that new sails would be identical at larger pitch four long whips were cut from a baulk of pitch pine obtained from a demolished maltings at bury st edmunds whips are square at their inner end sail bars and were made from modern pitch pine selected for quality for sail bars were cut that at heel of sail being at 27deg and that at tip being 15deg decreasing by 1 1 2deg at each sail bar three of four sails had been completed at end of work in fantail and associated gearing was fitted to mill at end of second work in cap could be turned by means of hand crank fantail itself with blades painted red white and blue was installed shortly afterwards clasp arm brake wheel was assembled around windshaft it was found that wallower was eccentric on upright shaft by 1 2 inch 13 mm when this was corrected brake wheel was within 1 16 th of an inch less than 1 mm of true clamps for stocks were sawn from a baulk of pitch pine ready for completion later in year other work included a new frame for one of ground floor doors cleaning and painting ironwork and further repointing on brickwork four sails were fitted to mill with aid of a mobile crane at end of second work in stock with one sail attached was carefully inserted through poll end of windshaft and when wedged in position and clamps had been attached second sail was fitted to stock process was repeated for second pair of sails mill turned by wind again on last day of second work in work later in year included finishing of fourth sail balancing fantail and sorting out teething troubles with fantail gearing brake and brake lever were made and installed and shutter cranks for sails were cast restoration work in 1984 cost ps2 918 grants received were ps1 209 from english heritage ps500 from st edmundsbury borough council other donations amounted to ps52 income from open days at mill came to ps151 a boost to funds was ps2 000 from hervey benham this money had been allocated to allow moving of a derelict post mill buck to thelnetham in end removal was not proceeded with and mr benham allowed donation to remain with thelnetham mill preservation trust project received further support in local media including east anglian daily times one of work ins being featured on anglia television s about anglia programme 1985 87 work planned for 1985 included replacement of dust floor window and completion of stocks and sails external walls of mill were tarred and internal walls plastered two work ins were held from 20 july to 28 july and 17 august to 26 august further work over next two years saw restoration completed in 1987 restoration team restoration of thelnetham windmill was made possible by efforts of 135 individuals and 61 organisations this was achieved by donation of labour plant materials or grants of money or by giving discounts for materials purchased or providing publicity for project description thumb restored mill may 1989 terms explained in mill machinery article are in italics as
