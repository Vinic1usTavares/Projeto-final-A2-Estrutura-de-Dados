rosenstiel school of marine and atmospheric science rsmas is an academic and research institution for study of oceanography and atmospheric sciences within university of miami um it is located on a 16 acre 65 000 m2 campus on virginia key in miami florida it is only subtropical applied and basic marine and atmospheric research institute in continental united states up until 2008 rsmas was solely a graduate school within university of miami while it jointly administrated an undergraduate program with um s college of arts and sciences in 2008 rosenstiel school has taken over administrative responsibilities for undergraduate program granting bachelor of science in marine and atmospheric science and bachelor of arts in marine affairs bama baccalaureate degree master s including a master of professional science degree and doctorates are also awarded to rsmas students by um graduate school rosenstiel school s research includes study of marine life particularly aplysia and coral climate change air sea interactions coastal ecology and admiralty law school operates a marine research laboratory ship and has a research site at an inland sinkhole research also includes use of data from weather satellites and school operates its own satellite downlink facility school is home to worlds largest hurricane simulation tank history thumb left sign near entrance to rsmas in 1940 university of miami president bowman ashe recruited f g walton smith a young british marine biologist who was working in bahamas smith joined department of zoology and began organizing development of a marine laboratory in 1943 board of trustees of university of miami established marine laboratory for university they invited researchers and oceanographers to associate themselves with this laboratory its three original objectives were teaching basic research and applied marine research laboratory focused on subjects specific to tropical environment initially marine lab was located in a private boathouse on an estate on belle isle in miami beach florida in 1945 when boathouse became structurally unsafe lab moved to a converted apartment building in coral gables florida near main campus in 1947 a delegation from dade county prompted florida state legislature to support development of a state marine laboratory in conjunction with um lab it reported to state board of conservation which had no marine research facility and little budget of its own at time relationship lasted for 12 years until state of florida built board a lab in st petersburg in 1953 school s classrooms and laboratories were built at current virginia key location it was renamed institute of marine science in 1961 it became part of university of miami s school of environmental and planetary sciences in 1969 institution was made into an independent school and named to honor lewis and dorothy rosenstiel after a major contribution from rosenstiel s foundation to support progress in atmospheric and marine sciences in 1977 school began a joint undergraduate program with miami s college of arts sciences school bought research vessels and built more facilities to further research projects from 2003 to 2008 school operated pew institute for ocean science as a joint venture with pew charitable trusts and in 2008 program relocated to suny at stony brook in 2008 rsmas took over administrative functions of university of miami s undergraduate marine science marine affairs and meteorology programs also in 2008 rsmas s library merged with central university of miami library recently rsmas started unique a one year master of professional science degree program aimed at students planning non research careers in business government or non profit organizations academics thumb rosenstiel

vessel designed to met school s specifications catamaran was put on water in 2000 it is equipped with a special sea water flow system that can take samples on board lab can perform chemical analysis of those water samples it also has for measuring ocean currents sub bottom profiling and deep water bathymetry in response to deepwater horizon oil spill vessel was reassigned to environmental monitoring of affected areas and to track underwater plumes of oil rosenstiel school s research invertebrate museum houses one of world s most extensive collections of invertebrate tropical marine life with 400 000 specimens it includes atlantic tropical marine invertebrates collection consists of 60 000 specimen lots out of which 38 900 are cataloged and identified species since 2005 rsmas has conducted an underwater photography contest that draws international submissions rsmas also makes underwater photographs available through its digital atlas of marine species and locations which is a database that includes photos of specific marine species since 1951 rsmas has published bulletin of marine science a scientific journal which publishes research papers in marine subject areas covered by school it is published four times a year united states national research council ranked graduate research programs based on 2008 data and rsmas ranked 11th to 40th among oceanography atmospheric sciences and meteorology rankings rsmas entering graduate students average quantitative graduate record examination score was 681 campus thumb left rsmas s marine science center virginia key campus
