hibbertopterus is a genus of eurypterid a group of extinct aquatic arthropods fossils of hibbertopterus have been discovered in deposits ranging from devonian period in belgium scotland and united states to carboniferous period in scotland ireland czech republic and south africa type species h scouleri was first named as a species of significantly different eurypterus by samuel hibbert in 1836 generic name hibbertopterus coined more than a century later combines his name and greek word pteron pteron meaning wing hibbertopterus was largest eurypterid within stylonurine suborder with largest fossil specimens suggesting that h scouleri could reach lengths around 180 200 centimetres 5 9 6 6 ft though this is significantly smaller than largest eurypterid overall jaekelopterus which could reach lengths of around hibbertopterus is likely to have been heaviest due to its broad and compact body furthermore trackway evidence indicates that south african species h wittebergensis might have reached lengths similar to jaekelopterus like many other stylonurine eurypterids hibbertopterus fed through a method called sweep feeding it used its specialised forward facing appendages limbs equipped with several spines to rake through substrate of environments in which it lived in search for small invertebrates to eat which it could then push towards its mouth though long hypothesised fact that eurypterids were capable of terrestrial locomotion was definitely proven through discovery of a fossil trackway made by hibbertopterus in scotland trackway showed that an animal measuring around had slowly lumbered across a stretch of land dragging its telson tail spike across ground after it how hibbertopterus could survive on land however briefly is unknown but it might have been possible through either its gills being able to function in air as long as they were wet or by animal possessing a dual respiratory system theorised to have been present in at least some eurypterids though sometimes and often historically treated as distinct genera hibbertopterid eurypterids cyrtoctenus and dunsopterus are generally agreed to represent adult ontogenetic stages of hibbertopterus hughes emily samantha 2019 discerning diets of sweep feeding eurypterids through analyses of mesh modified appendage armature graduate theses dissertations and problem reports features of fossils associated with these genera suggest that sweep feeding strategy of hibbertopterus changed significantly over course of its life from simpler raking organs present in younger specimens to specialised comb like organs capable of trapping prey rather than simply pushing it towards mouth in adults description left thumb restoration of h scouleri like other known hibbertopterid eurypterids hibbertopterus was a large broad bodied and heavy animal it was largest known eurypterid of suborder stylonurina composed of those eurypterids that lacked swimming paddles a carapace part of exoskeleton which covered head referred to species h scouleri from carboniferous scotland measures wide since hibbertopterus was unusually wide relative to its length for a eurypterid animal in question would probably have measured around 180 200 centimetres 5 9 6 6 ft in length even though there were eurypterids of greater length such as jaekelopterus and carcinosoma hibbertopterus was very deep bodied and compact in comparison to other eurypterids and mass of specimen in question would likely have rivalled that of other giant eurypterids and other giant arthropods if not surpassed them in addition to fossil finds of large specimens fossil trackways attributed to species h wittebergensis from south africa indicates an animal around in length same size attributed to largest known eurypterid jaekelopterus though largest known fossil specimens of species only appear to have reached lengths of lamsdell james c braddy simon j 2009 cope s rule and romer s theory patterns of

a human alt forward facing appendages limbs of hibbertopterus pairs 2 3 and 4 were specialised for gathering food distal podomeres leg segments of these three pairs of limbs were covered with long spines and end of each limb was covered with sensory organs these adaptations suggest that hibbertopterus like other hibbertopterids would have fed by a method referred to as sweep feeding using its limbs to sweep through substrate of its environment in search for food fourth pair of appendages though used in feeding like second and third pairs was also used for locomotion and two final pairs of legs pairs five and six overall were solely locomotory as such hibbertopterus would have used a six legged gait although not enough fossil material is known of other hibbertopterid eurypterids to discuss differences between them with full confidence hibbertopterus is defined based on a collection of definite characteristics telson tail spike was hastate e g shaped like a gladius a roman sword and had a keel running down middle with in turn had a small indentation in its own centre walking legs of hibbertopterus had extensions at their base and lacked longitudinal posterior grooves in all

lower size estimate follows known fossil evidence higher size estimate derives from trackway evidence h wittebergensis can be distinguished from other species by oval shape of its node raised portion

in united states fossil material of h wrightianus is too limited to confidently establish any distinguishing features but it is noted to be similar to h stevensoni history of research left thumb outdated 1872 reconstruction by henry woodward of h scouleri with a telson and appendages based on those of eurypterus with swimming paddles and unspecialised walking appendages in 1831 scottish naturalist john scouler described remains consisting of a massive and unusual prosoma head and several tergites segments from back of animal of a large and strange arthropod discovered in deposits in scotland of lower carboniferous age but did not assign a name to fossils through scouler s examination fossils represent second eurypterid to be scientifically studied just six years after 1825 description of eurypterus itself five years later in 1836 british geologist samuel hibbert redescribed same fossil specimens giving them name eurypterus scouleri eurypterid genus glyptoscorpius was named by british geologist ben peach who also named species g perornatus treated as type species of glyptoscorpius by later researchers although it had not originally been designated as such in 1882 genus was based on g perornatus and fragmentary species g caledonicus previously described as plant caledonicus by english paleontologist john william salter in 1863 this designation was reinforced with more fossil fragments discovered in burn which peach referred to glyptoscorpius caledonicus in 1887 peach described g minutisculptus from mount vernon glasgow and g kidstoni from radstock in somerset peach s glyptoscorpius is highly problematic some of diagnostic characteristics used when describing it are either questionable or outright meaningless for instance original description had been based on g caledonicus and g perornatus but since parts of body preserved in fossils described don t completely overlap it is impossible to say if peach s diagnostic characteristics actually apply to two original species thumb two fossil fragments referred to h wrightianus though only represented by two small jointed and vaguely cylindrical fossil fragments both discovered in portage sandstones of italy new york species today recognised as h wrightianus has had a complicated taxonomic history originally described in 1881 as a species of plant fragmentary fossil referred to as was noted to represent fossil remains of a eurypterid by american paleontologist james hall in 1884 three years later though hall assigned species to stylonurus that same year british paleontologists henry woodward and thomas rupert jones assigned fossil to genus echinocaris believing fossils represented a crustacean assignment to echinocaris was probably based on slightly surface of fossils but in 1888 hall and american paleontologist john mason clarke pointed out that no described echinocaris actually had spines similar to what woodward and jones suggested and as such reassigned species back to stylonurus interpreting fossils as fragments of long walking legs an assignment to stylonurus was affirmed by clarke and american paleontologist rudolf ruedemann in their influential eurypterida of new york in 1912 though no distinguishing features of fossils were given due to their fragmentary nature though no specification was given as to why pterygotus hibernicus a species described from ireland by british paleontologist william hellier baily in 1872 was reassigned to hibbertopterus by american paleontologist erik n kjellesvig waering in 1964 as part of a greater re examination of various species assigned to family pterygotidae kjellesvig waering retained p dicki as part of pterygotus scottish paleontologists lyall i anderson and nigel h trewin and german paleontologist jason a dunlop noted in 2000 that kjellesvig acception of original designation for pterygotus dicki was burdensome as it is based on highly fragmentary material they noted that like many other pterygotid species p dicki represented yet another name applied to some scattered segments a practice they deemed taxonomically unsound though they suggested that further research was required to determine whether or not taxon was valid at all they did note that presence of a fringe to segments formed by their ornamentation was absent in all other species of pterygotus but strikingly similar to what was present in cyrtoctenus subsequent research treated p dicki as a species of cyrtoctenus when kjellesvig waering designated genus hibbertopterus in 1959 eurypterus scouleri had already been referred to considered a species of related campylocephalus for some time kjellesvig waering recognised campylocephalus scouleri as distinct from type species of that genus c oculatus in that prosoma of campylocephalus was more narrow had a subelliptical almost elliptical shape and had its widest point in middle rather than at base further differences were noted in position and shape of animal s compound eyes which in hibbertopterus are surrounded by a ring like shape of hardened integument absent in campylocephalus eyes of hibbertopterus are also located near center of head whereas those of campylocephalus are located further back generic name hibbertopterus was selected to honor original descriptor of h scouleri samuel hibbert thumb fossil tergites of h scouleri drawn by henry woodward in 1866 1878 fact that glyptoscorpius was questionable at best and that its type species g perornatus and other species such as g kidstoni had recently been referred to genus adelophthalmus prompted norwegian paleontologist leif stormer and british paleontologist charles d waterston to in 1968 re examine various species that had been referred to it because g perornatus was type species of glyptoscorpius genus itself became synonymous with adelophthalmus that same year species g minutisculptus had been designated type species of a distinct eurypterid genus vernonopterus stormer and waterston concluded that glyptoscorpius species g caledonicus was to be part of a new genus which they named cyrtoctenus name deriving from greek a curved comb and they named a new species c peachi named in honour of ben peach as its type both of these species were based on fragmentary fossil remains furthermore species g stevensoni named in 1936 was referred to new genus dunsopterus key diagnostic feature of cyrtoctenus was its comb like first appendages waterston remarked in another 1968 paper that controversial stylonurus wrightianus was similar to unusual and massive prosomal appendage of dunsopterus and as such reassigned s wrightianus to dunsopterus creating dunsopterus wrightianus other than c peachi and c caledonicus further species were added to cyrtoctenus by stormer and waterston eurypterus dewalquei described in 1889 and ostraviensis described in 1951 became cyrtoctenus dewalquei and c ostraviensis respectively despite noting presence of eurypterid type tergites stormer and waterston thought that cyrtoctenus fossils represented remains of a new order of aquatic arthropods which they dubbed species c dewalquei had originally been described as fragmentary remains of a eurypterid in 1889 was assigned to cyrtoctenus on basis of perceived filaments present on its appendages similar to those of c peachi stormer and waterston disregarded specimens referred to c caledonicus other than unique fragmentary type specimen which at this point had been plastically preserved in sandstone like c caledonicus c ostraviensis was also known only from a single specimen a fragment of an appendage described in 1951 no distinguishing features were given for species and authors noted that it was possibly synonymous with c peachi but they chose to maintain it as distinct due to very limited fossil material known from a single specimen described in 1985 h wittebergensis described as cyrtoctenus wittebergensis is only species of hibbertopterus known from reasonably complete remains other than type species itself fossil discovered in waaipoort formation near cape province south africa is remarkably complete preserving not only prosoma telson and several tergites but also coxae and even part of digestive system discovery was also important for eurypterid research in general since it represents one of few eurypterids known from southern hemisphere where eurypterid finds are rare and usually fragmentary presence of gut in fossil proves that specimen represents a dead individual and not only exuviae and scientists it could conclude that it had been preserved as lying on its back description of h wittebergensis affirmed that were definitely hibbertopterus type eurypterids not representatives of a new order of arthropods classification alt thumb restoration of closely related hibbertopterid campylocephalus hibbertopterus is classified as part of family hibbertopteridae which it also lends its name to a family of eurypterids within superfamily mycteropoidea alongside genera campylocephalus and vernonopterus hibbertopterids are united as a group by being large mycteropoids with broad prosomas a hastate telson similar to that of hibbertopterus ornamentation consisting of scales or other similar structures on exoskeleton fourth pair of appendages possessing spines more posterior tergites of abdomen possessing tongue shaped scales near their edges and there being lobes positioned poterolaterally posteriorly on both sides on prosoma historically morphology of hibbertopterus and other hibbertopterids has been seen as so unusual that they have been thought to be an order separate from eurypterida features of campylocephalus and vernonopterus makes it clear that both genera represent hibbertopterid eurypterids but incomplete nature of all fossil specimens referred to them make any further study of precise phylogenetic relationships within hibbertopteridae difficult both genera could even represent synonyms of hibbertopterus itself though highly incomplete nature of their remains again makes that hypothesis impossible to confirm cladogram below is adapted from lamsdell 2012 collapsed to only show superfamily mycteropoidea cyrtoctenus and dunsopterus thumb fossil spines of h stevensoni sometimes treated as type species of a distinct genus called dunsopterus alt left many analyses and overviews treat ten species assigned to hibbertopterus as composing three separate but closely related hibbertopterid genera in these arrangements hibbertopterus is typically restricted to species h scouleri and h hibernicus with species h stevensoni being type and only species of genus dunsopterus and species h caledonicus h dewalquei h dicki h ostraviensis h peachi and h wittebergensis being referred to genus cyrtoctenus where h peachi is type species idea that dunsopterus and cyrtoctenus were congeneric e g synonymous was first suggested by british geologist charles d waterston in 1985 dunsopterus is known from very fragmentary material mainly sclerites various hardened body parts which have little diagnostic potential and are poorly known in fossils attributed to cyrtoctenus morphology of fossils attributed to dunsopterus and cyrtoctenus does suggest that they were more specialised than h scouleri particularly in their adaptations to sweep feeding if valid cyrtoctenus would have had further adaptations towards sweep feeding than any other hibbertopterid with its blades modified into comb like rachis that could entrap smaller prey or other organic food particles it was suggested as early as 1993 by american paleontologist paul selden and british paleontologist andrew j jeram that these adaptations might not have been due to dunsopterus and cyrtoctenus representing more derived genera of hibbertopterids but rather due to both genera perhaps representing adult forms of hibbertopterus in this case development of more specialized sweep feeding method of cyrtoctenus can directly be explained by larger size of specimens referred to cyrtoctenus method of hibbertopterus which involves raking would have become significantly less effective larger animal grew since a larger and larger portion of its prey would be small enough to pass between its sweep feeding spines any specimen over size of a metre 3 2 ft which continued to feed on small invertebrates would need modified sweep feeding appendages or would need to employ a different feeding method altogether as such it is more than possible that later ontogenetic stages of hibbertopterus developed structures seen in cyrtoctenus to be able to continue to feed at larger body sizes thumb more fossil spines and fossil ornamentation referred to h stevensoni fossil specimens of hibbertopterus frequently occur together with fragments referred to cyrtoctenus dunsopterus and vernonopterus three fragmentary genera were suggested to by synonyms of each other by american paleontologist james lamsdell in 2010 which would have meant oldest name dunsopterus taking priority and subsuming both cyrtoctenus and vernonopterus as junior synonyms following studies on ontogeny of drepanopterus a more eurypterid large scale changes in developments of appendages over course of life of a single animal have been proven to have happened in some eurypterids one of key features distinguishing cyrtoctenus from hibbertopterus is presence of grooves on its podomeres which studies on drepanopterus suggest might have been a feature which appeared late in an animal s life cycle differences in positions of eyes in specimens of hibbertopterus and cyrtoctenus is not surprising as movements of eyes through ontogeny has been described in other eurypterid genera lamsdell considered it almost certain that dunsopterus was a junior synonym of hibbertopterus and that cyrtoctenus and vernonopterus in turn represented junior synonyms of dunsopterus which would subsume all three into hibbertopterus synonymizing hibbertopterus with cyrtoctenus and dunsopterus would also explain why smaller hibbertopterus specimens are more complete than known fossil remains of cyrtoctenus often fragmentary majority of hibbertopterus specimens would then represent exuviae whilst cyrtoctenus specimens represent actual mortalities susceptible to scavengers in 2019 american geologist emily hughes synonymized hibbertopterus and dunsopterus due to strong morphological similarities between them and as dunsopterus was found to be paraphyletic in regard to cyrtoctenus all three were subsumed into just hibbertopterus in particular she noted that though feeding appendages were different ornamentation and form of raking tools seen in hibbertopterus were probably precursors of more moveable finger like organs present in cyrtoctenus hughes suggested that vernonopterus due to its distinct ornamentation represented a genus distinct from hibbertopterus palaeoecology thumb fossil trackway discovered in scotland attributed to hibbertopterus alt such as hibbertopterus were sweep feeders having modified spines on their forward facing prosomal appendages that allowed them to rake through substrate of their living environments though sweep feeding was used as a strategy by many genera within stylonurina it was most developed within hibbertopterids which possessed blades on second third and fourth pair of appendages inhabiting freshwater swamps and rivers diet of hibbertopterus and other sweep feeders was probably composed of what they could find raking through its living environment likely primarily small invertebrates this method of feeding is quite similar to filter feeding this has led some researchers to suggest that hibbertopterus would have been a pelagic animal as modern filter feeding crustaceans but robust and massive nature of genus in contrast to modern filter feeding crustaceans which are typically very small makes such a conclusion unlikely chelicerae pincers of hibbertopterus were weak and they would not have been able to grasp any potential prey which means hibbertopterus would probably have been incapable of preying on larger animals conclusion that hibbertopterus wasn t preying on large animals is also supported by complete lack of adaptations towards any organs used for trapping prey in younger specimens though they are present on adult specimens once referred to cyrtoctenus and a lack of swimming adaptations through sweep feeding hibbertopterus could sweep up small animals from soft sediments of shallow bodies of water presumably small crustaceans and other arthropods and could then sweep them into its mouth when it detected them through different adaptations of juveniles and adults cyrtoctenus individuals of different ages would possibly have preferred different types of prey which would have reduced competition between members of same genus a fossil trackway discovered near st andrews in fife scotland reveals that hibbertopterus was capable of at least limited terrestrial locomotion trackway found was roughly long and wide and suggests that eurypterid responsible was long consistent with other giant sizes attributed to hibbertopterus tracks indicate a lumbering jerky and dragging movement scarps with crescent shapes were left by outer limbs inner markings were made by keeled belly and telson carved a central groove slow progression and dragging of tail indicate that animal responsible was moving out of water presence of terrestrial tracks indicate that hibbertopterus was able to survive on land at least briefly possible due to probability that their gills could function in air as long as they remained wet additionally some studies suggest that eurypterids possessed a dual respiratory system which would allow short periods of time in terrestrial environments in midland valley of scotland 27 kilometres 16 8 miles to west of edinburgh east

strange fossil carapaces of h scouleri have been given common name scouler s heid being scots for head waaipoort formation where h wittebergensis has been discovered also preserves a diverse carboniferous fauna and some species of plants interpreted as having been a large and open fresh to brackish water lake with possibly occasional influences by storms and glacial processes fossil remains recovered is most commonly that of various types of fish among these types are palaeoniscoids sharks and acanthodians though shark material is too fragmentary to be identifiable at least some fossils might represent remains of among acanthodians at least three genera have been identified from fossil scales and spines including derived among palaeoniscoids eight distinct genera have been identified severa of these genera also occur in deposits of similar age in scotland other than h wittebergensis only known invertebrates are two rare species of bivalves possibly representing plant fossils in formation are notably less diverse than those of preceding ages in same location possibly because of climate reasons among genera present are common possibly representing a progymnosperm
