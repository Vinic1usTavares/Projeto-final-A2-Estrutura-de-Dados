on september 7 2007 a high school cheerleader moonlighting as a teenage crime fighter majority of kim s missions involve her thwarting plans of her dr drakken a mad scientist all while coping with everyday challenges commonly associated with adolescence inspired by their own daughters schooley and mccorkle conceived kim as a teenage girl capable of doing anything basing character on their own childhood hero james bond upon noticing lack of strong female leads in children s animated television they decided to reverse traditional gender roles by making kim show s action hero accompanied by a male comedic sidekick in form of best friend turned boyfriend ron stoppable devoid of both superpowers and a secret identity unlike traditional superheroes character s crime fighting abilities are instead drawn from her cheerleading experience thus making her more relatable to young viewers originally designed as a bombshell based on video game character lara croft kim s appearance was ultimately altered to resemble a teenage girl instead when kim possible premiered in 2002 kim was instantly well liked by both female and male audiences character has since been very positively received by critics who hailed her as a positive role model for young women while heavily comparing her to similar crime fighting television heroines buffy summers from buffy vampire slayer and sydney bristow from alias both of whom preceded her kim has also earned respect of feminist critics who appreciated character for both defying gender roles and challenging negative stereotypes commonly associated with cheerleaders a fashion trendsetter character s wardrobe is also believed to have helped popularize wearing of crop tops and cargo pants during early 2000s success of show inspired release of two television films kim possible a sitch in time 2003 and kim possible movie so drama 2005 as well as a video game series in all of which kim stars role in kim possible high school student kim possible christy carlson romano fights crime alongside her best friend and sidekick ron stoppable will friedle aided by his pet naked mole rat rufus nancy cartwright and computer genius wade mowry character lives in fictional middleton usa with her parents james gary cole and ann jean smart a rocket scientist and neurosurgeon respectively and her younger brothers identical twins jim and tim kim goes on extraordinary missions to save world from danger at hands of various supervillains and evil geniuses her most consistent adversaries are mad scientist dr drakken and his sidekick shego latter of whom is a former superheroine and skilled martial artist who has ability to generate powerful energy blasts from her hands and thus poses as her main combatant and threat kim becomes a crime fighter unintentionally in need of a job character creates her own website on which she promotes her own babysitting and lawn mowing services using slogan i can do anything when a wealthy entrepreneur accidentally contacts kim possible instead of team impossible when he becomes trapped by his own laser security system kim rushes to his aid using her gymnastic abilities to disable device as news of kim s heroism spreads and requests for her help increase character finally decides to pursue it as a career although hardly a normal teenager kim insists that she is just a basic average girl and must nonetheless cope with usual adolescent affairs such as maintaining good grades in school pleasing her parents learning how to drive dating and relationships and attending cheerleading practice development conception and writing long time co workers and writing partners bob schooley and mark mccorkle explained that idea for kim possible arrived from out of blue when they realized that there were few animated shows starring strong female characters in lead roles both mccorkle and schooley had worked as writers on male led animated series aladdin and hercules for several years but longed to write something original and had just recently learned that young people were beginning to yearn for shows that depicted ordinary kids in extraordinary circumstances thus schooley and mccorkle conceived kim as a girl who can do anything kim possible offered writers a first time opportunity to create an entirely new character from scratch which schooley described as a refreshing experience in comparison to writing for characters who had already been long established both schooley s and mccorkle s own daughters inspired them to conceive kim as a character that our daughters and other girls can look up to all while aware of ancient truism that while girls seldom hesitate to watch a show about a male lead boys are usually less willing to do opposite thus writers decided to reverse traditional gender roles by making kim show s competent action hero and ron her fumbling sidekick longing to provide young girls with a character that they can pretend to be similar to their own childhood heroes fictional spy james bond and captain kirk from star trek according to mccorkle kim has much more in common with james bond than comic book superheroes recurring character monique was created because schooley and mccorkle felt that it would be more realistic if kim had a female best friend in addition to ron after three years production on kim possible had virtually ceased following premiere of film so drama because writers felt that finally establishing kim and ron as a couple would serve as great wrap up to series and thus had long abandoned creating new outlets for character during show s third season schooley and mccorkle had always wanted kim and ron to eventually end up a couple but avoided this storyline for as long as possible in fear of paint ing themselves into a corner when show was surprisingly renewed for a fourth season by popular demand schooley and mccorkle realized that pursuing kim and ron s relationship provided series with new story ideas and opportunities for comedy and ultimately learned to appreciate characters new dynamic to prevent kim and ron s relationship from becoming soap opera ish writers strove to maintain basics of their friendship with kim continuing to save world with ron as her sidekick in terms of character development show s main titles were finally adjusted to reflect grade in which kim is currently enrolled changing it from high school sophomore to high school senior additionally kim finally gets her own car which she inherits from her father while her younger brothers jim and tim begin enrollment at middleton high school having skipped several grades due to their genius level intellect much to kim s chagrin however kim eventually relents and insists that her brothers continue attending same school as her threatening to leave if they do design personality and abilities thumb upright kim possible as she appeared in animated series kim possible during season 4 aware of what does and does not work in television animation schooley and mccorkle knew that kim needed to be a physically attractive character kim s appearance evolved dramatically over course of three months character was originally designed to look like a pretty standard looking athletic blonde which was gradually changed in favor of a more distinctive appearance at one point kim s design was based on that of video game character lara croft from tomb raider however disney channel eventually determined that lara is not a very real character finally creators decided to give kim a more realistic appearance akin to that of a 14 year old girl as opposed to a bombshell concluding she has a nice very appealing design but we just wanted to keep it out of that realm of video game heroine creators admitted that kim would have been their dream girl in high school joking she would have been way out of our class though director chris baily wanted kim to be designed with graphic sensibilities similar to those of show s backgrounds creating a 3d character whose feet can be planted on ground and communicate a sense of space for example when character is dressed in all black kim was drawn without a white outline so that she virtually disappears when she moves in front of a black background yet her simple design and flesh allows audiences to fill in where her body is naturally show s female characters are only characters drawn with lips only upper of which is visible describing kim as a mostly graphic heroine animation a world history volume iii contemporary times author agreed that character s limited animation was intentional in fourth season character s signature crop top and cargo pants are replaced by a t shirt and pants because former outfit was damaged during a fight with shego some viewers noted that kim s face appeared to be rounder than it had been drawn in previous seasons kim was animated by rough draft korea creators wanted to make kim as believable as possible schooley s and mccorkle s own daughters inspired them to conceive kim as a character with dimension that girls could watch and appreciate mccorkle was quick in deciding very early on that kim does not belong to a spy organization nor does she possess any superpowers although admitting that character s accomplishments are generally implausible schooley and mccorkle wanted kim to remain relatable to young viewers and avoided making her impervious like superheroes by giving her real problems and teen issues mccorkle described kim as incredibly competent in action world but challenged in real world by all things we all have trouble with including embarrassment school work and family schooley explained that what makes kim effective in action world is gymnastics cheerleading physical activity something that any kid any girl in world could do additionally character is skilled in 17 different types of kung fu at one point an indestructible complete with special abilities was created for kim but outfit was ultimately abandoned to avoid contradicting with character s she can do anything motto elaborating on her role in pilot schooley believes that kim s mix of tenacity intelligence and heart makes for a very strong female role model for kids however sure she can save world but that doesn t help her a bit when she comes face to face with her latest school crush furthermore writers envisioned character having her own website and hand held communicator named kimmunicator after character with video chat both of which were considered revolutionary back in 2000 a time when few young people owned cellphones kim s use of advanced technology represents her ability to effortlessly hop around world and get back in time for dinner which is pretty unrealistic but it s what kids can do on internet now they can talk to somebody anywhere kim s main goal in series is simply to help those in need regardless of money or rewards which schooley and mccorkle deliberately instilled in character s personality one of her trademark gags involves her thanking people for providing her with transportation to which they respond no thank you for saving us although primarily writers schooley and mccorkle remained thoroughly involved in determining overall appearance of series as well as design of its characters however they accredit majority of series aesthetics to season one director chris baily and artistic director alan bodner cartoonist stephen silver served as a character animator on show voice kim is voiced by american actress christy carlson romano who was only

original series that s so raven before being cast as kim romano had already been well known for starring as ren stevens in disney channel sitcom even stevens actress was finally introduced to show s creators by disney channel executives after schooley and mccorkle had already auditioned several people for role according to mccorkle romano nailed her audition which he described as just fantastic thumb actress christy carlson romano voices kim kim was romano s first voice acting role upon being cast as kim romano immediately identified with character because they were both dealing with teenage issues at time during show s first season romano and rest of kim possible cast recorded at different locations like her character romano also balanced her acting profession with schoolwork and agreed that they are both confident in their endeavors because actress was enrolled in high school in new york city at time she was often required to participate in cast meetings and table reads via telephone romano was actually unable to attend her own senior prom because she was working on kim possible occasionally actress herself would serve as creative inspiration for writers one episode in particular blush was based on fact that romano is a shy and easily embarrassed person who tends to blush at even slightest compliment awkward situation writers also gave kim several interests that are similar to romano s own schooley enthused that actress add s something to her character that makes it more than a typical gag oriented cartoon crediting both her and co star will friedle voice of ron among reasons fans connected with characters romano described kim as a very ambitious very skilled very smart character and attempted to make her as much of a role model as possible actress also described character as a really confident sweet girl who everybody loves and she is a heroine who little girls look up to she is a typical role model perfect in every way how could you not like kim romano initially doubted that show would be successful but eventually admitted that animation was great and writing was amazing it s done so that kids and adults can enjoy it families can share an

games in which kim and ron switch bodies as her favorite by end of series romano was 21 years old and attending columbia university for political science kim s final recorded line in series is huh

comics jamie kingston observed that middleton high school ignores her as a heroine unless something happens on school grounds where she has to do her thing thus kim rarely receives attention for her work from her family and peers although her customers remain grateful however while describing kim as a power fantasy stealing commas believes that kim is simply preventing regime change and preserving status quo rather than doing any real world saving according to metacritic kim is stubborn strong willed and has a fuse shorter than a grenade with a three second delay but remains

typical cheerleader reflecting what kim could have become described by tracey mcloone of popmatters as clever as well as graceful and physically fit character also belief that brawn is superior to brains in battle however kim is not a tomboy and exhibits personality traits and interests typically associated with teenage girls such as shopping boy bands over popular trends etc her best female friend monique represents kim s bridge between world of super spy superhero action and world of high school and stuff teen girls care about keeping character grounded despite her confidence as a young woman kim remains very much concerned about her love life which is sometimes treated as one of her weaknesses mike mcdaniel of houston chronicle joked that nothing s impossible with kim possible

not drama and no big as well as her signature catchphrase what s sitch kim s unconventional relationship with her inept unpopular best friend ron ultimately unveils best in both characters with kim keeping ron out of trouble and ron keeping kim from over stressing kim possible a sitch in time further demonstrates how much kim actually depends on ron ron helps remove negative qualities from kim

remain platonic friends for majority of series although their romantic interests in each other is hinted at throughout more so ron s feelings for kim while kim has been jealous of ron s girlfriends at

relationship with her parents is atypically healthy for a teenager kim s father james views women as equals and thus has a good relationship with kim although he struggles to come to terms with

kim also admits to being impressed by her mother s work as a brain surgeon artifice observed that kim and shego are strikingly similar in appearance believes that shego is essentially kim s dark
