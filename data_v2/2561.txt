a bumblebee or bumble bee bumble bee or humble bee is any of over 250 species in genus bombus part of apidae one of bee families this genus is only extant group in tribe bombini though a few extinct related genera e g calyptapis are known from fossils they are found primarily in higher altitudes or latitudes in northern hemisphere although they are also found in south america where a few lowland tropical species have been identified european bumblebees have also been introduced to new zealand and tasmania female bumblebees can sting repeatedly but generally ignore humans and other animals most bumblebees are social insects that form colonies with a single queen colonies are smaller than those of honey bees growing to as few as 50 individuals in a nest cuckoo bumblebees are brood parasitic and do not make nests their queens aggressively invade nests of other bumblebee species kill resident queens and then lay their own eggs which are cared for by resident workers cuckoo bumblebees were previously classified as a separate genus but are now usually treated as members of bombus bumblebees have round bodies covered in soft hair long branched setae called pile making them appear and feel fuzzy they have aposematic warning coloration often consisting of contrasting bands of colour and different species of bumblebee in a region often resemble each other in mutually protective mullerian mimicry harmless insects such as hoverflies often derive protection from resembling bumblebees in batesian mimicry and may be confused with them nest making bumblebees can be distinguished from similarly large fuzzy cuckoo bees by form of female hind leg in nesting bumblebees it is modified to form a pollen basket a bare shiny area surrounded by a fringe of hairs used to transport pollen whereas in cuckoo bees hind leg is hairy all round and pollen grains are wedged among hairs for transport like their relatives honeybees bumblebees feed on nectar using their long hairy tongues to lap up liquid proboscis is folded under head during flight bumblebees gather nectar to add to stores in nest and pollen to feed their young they forage using colour and spatial relationships to identify flowers to feed from some bumblebees steal nectar making a hole near base of a flower to access nectar while avoiding pollen transfer bumblebees are important agricultural pollinators so their decline in europe north america and asia is a cause for concern decline has been caused by habitat loss mechanisation of agriculture and pesticides etymology and common names thumb upright beatrix potter called babbity bumble a in tale of mrs tittlemouse 1910 word bumblebee is a compound of bumble bee bumble meaning to hum buzz drone or move ineptly or generic name bombus assigned by pierre andre latreille in 1802 is derived from latin word for a buzzing or humming sound borrowed from ancient greek bombos bombos wiktionary entry for bombus according to oxford english dictionary oed term bumblebee was first recorded as having been used in english language in 1530 work by john i as a bee dothe however oed also states that term humblebee predates it having first been used in 1450 in angle in in latter term was used in a midsummer night s dream circa 1600 by william shakespeare bags steale from humble bees similar terms are used in other germanic languages e g german hummel dutch hommel or swedish an old provincial name dumbledor also denoted a buzzing insect such as a bumblebee or probably imitating sound of these insects while dor meant beetle in on origin of species 1859 charles darwin speculated about humble bees and their interactions with other species however bumblebee remained in use for example in tale of mrs tittlemouse 1910 by beatrix potter suddenly round a corner she met bumble zizz said bumble bee since world war ii humblebee has fallen into near total disuse phylogeny bumblebee tribe bombini is one of four groups of corbiculate bees those with pollen baskets in apidae others being apini honey bees euglossini orchid bees and meliponini stingless bees corbiculate bees are a monophyletic group advanced eusocial behaviour appears to have evolved twice in group giving rise to controversy now largely settled as to phylogenetic origins of four tribes it had been supposed that eusocial behaviour had evolved only once requiring apini to be close to meliponini which they do not resemble it is now thought that apini with advanced societies and euglossini are closely related while primitively eusocial bombini are close to meliponini which have somewhat more advanced eusocial behaviour sophie cardinal and bryan danforth comment that while remarkable a hypothesis of dual origins of advanced eusociality is congruent with early studies on corbiculate morphology and social behavior their analysis combining molecular morphological and behavioural data gives following cladogram on this hypothesis molecular data suggest that bombini are 25 to 40 million years old while meliponini and thus clade that includes bombini and meliponini are 81 to 96 million years old about same age as corbiculate group however a more recent phylogeny using transcriptome data from 3 647 genes of ten corbiculate bee species supports single origin of eusociality hypothesis in corbiculate bees they find that bombini is in fact sister to meliponini corroborating that previous finding from sophie cardinal and bryan danforth 2011 however et al 2015 shows that bombini meliponini and apini form a monophyletic group where apini shares a most recent common ancestor with bombini and meliponini clade while euglossini is most distantly related to all three since it does not share same most recent common ancestor as bombini meliponini and apini thus their analysis supports single origin of eusociality hypothesis within corbiculate bees where eusociality evolved in common ancestor of bombini apini and meliponini fossil record for bees is incomplete around 11 specimens that might possibly be bombini some poorly documented had been described by 2011 some such as calyptapis from florissant usa and from turkey dated from oligocene in 2012 a fossil bumblebee bombus bombus was described from miocene maar in southwestern germany and confidently placed in subgenus bombus in 2014 another species bombus was described from late miocene lacustrine beds of la spain but not placed into any subgenus while a new genus and species was described from late eocene bembridge marls of isle of wight species bombus was described in october 2017 and placed in bombus subgenus taxonomy genus bombus only one extant genus in tribe bombini comprises over 250 species for an overview of differences between bumblebees and other bees and wasps see characteristics of common wasps and bees genus has been divided variously into up to 49 subgenera a degree of complexity criticised by williams 2008 cuckoo bumblebees psithyrus have sometimes been treated as a separate genus but are now considered to be part of bombus in one or more subgenera examples of bombus species include bombus atratus bombus dahlbomii bombus bombus lapidarius bombus ruderatus and bombus rupestris subgenera of genus bombus general description bumblebees vary in appearance but are generally plump and densely furry they are larger broader and stouter bodied than honeybees and their abdomen tip is more rounded many species have broad bands of colour patterns helping to distinguish different species whereas honeybees have short tongues and therefore mainly pollinate open flowers some bumblebee species have long tongues and collect nectar from flowers that are closed into a tube bumblebees have fewer stripes or none and usually have part of body covered in black fur while honeybees have many stripes including several grey stripes on abdomen sizes are very variable even within species largest british species b terrestris has queens up to long males up to long and workers between long largest bumblebee species in world is b dahlbomii of chile up to about long and described as flying mice and a monstrous fluffy ginger beast distribution and habitat bumblebees are typically found in temperate climates and are often found at higher latitudes and altitudes than other bees although a few lowland tropical species exist a few species b polaris and b alpinus range into very cold climates where other bees might not be found b polaris occurs in northern ellesmere island in high arctic along with another bumblebee b hyperboreus which its nest this is most northernmost occurrence of any eusocial insect one reason for their presence in cold places is that bumblebees can regulate their body temperature via solar radiation internal mechanisms of shivering and radiative cooling from abdomen called other bees have similar physiology but mechanisms seem best developed and have been most studied in bumblebees they adapt to higher elevations by extending their wing stroke amplitude bumblebees have a largely cosmopolitan distribution but are absent from australia apart from tasmania where they have been introduced and are found in africa only north of sahara more than a hundred years ago they have also been introduced to new zealand where they play an important role as efficient pollinators biology thumb right upright a common carder bumblebee bombus pascuorum extending its tongue towards a inflorescence feeding bumblebee tongue proboscis is a long hairy structure that extends from a sheath like modified maxilla primary action of tongue is lapping that is repeated dipping of tongue into liquid tip of tongue probably acts as a suction cup and during lapping nectar may be drawn up proboscis by capillary action when at rest or flying proboscis is kept folded under head longer tongue deeper bumblebee can probe into a flower and bees probably learn from experience which flower source is best suited to their tongue length bees with shorter proboscides like bombus bifarius have a more difficult time foraging nectar relative to other bumblebees with longer proboscides to overcome this disadvantage b bifarius workers were observed to lick back of spurs on nectar duct which resulted in a small reward wax production exoskeleton of abdomen is divided into plates called dorsal tergites and ventral sternites wax is secreted from glands on abdomen and extruded between sternites where it resembles flakes of dandruff it is secreted by queen when she starts a nest and by young workers it is scraped from abdomen by legs moulded until malleable and used in construction of honeypots to cover eggs to line empty cocoons for use as storage containers and sometimes to cover exterior of nest coloration thumb upright cuckoo bumblebees like this bombus have similar aposematic warning coloration to nest making bumblebees and may also mimic their host species brightly coloured pile of bumblebee is an aposematic warning signal given that females can inflict a painful sting depending on species and morph warning colours range from entirely black to bright yellow red orange white and pink dipteran flies in families syrphidae hoverflies asilidae robber flies tabanidae horseflies oestridae bot or warble flies and bombyliidae bee flies such as bombylius major all include batesian mimics of bumblebees resembling them closely enough to deceive at least some predators many species of bombus including group sometimes called psithyrus cuckoo bumblebees have evolved mullerian mimicry where different bumblebees in a region resemble each other so that a young predator need only learn to avoid any of them once for example in california a group of bumblebees consists of largely black species including b californicus b caliginosus b b b insularis and b other bees in california include a group of species all banded black and yellow in each case mullerian mimicry provides bees in group with a selective advantage in addition parasitic cuckoo bumblebees resemble their hosts more closely than would be expected by chance at least in areas like europe where parasite host co speciation is common but this too may be explained as mullerian mimicry rather than requiring parasite s coloration to deceive host aggressive mimicry temperature control bumblebees are active under conditions during which honeybees stay at home and can readily absorb heat from even weak sunshine macdonald 2003 p 6 thick pile created by long setae bristles acts as insulation to keep bumblebees warm in cold weather species from cold climates have longer setae and thus thicker insulation than those from tropics temperature of flight muscles which occupy much of thorax needs to be at least before flight can take place muscle temperature can be raised by shivering it takes about five minutes for muscles to reach this temperature at an air temperature of chill coma temperature chill coma temperature in relation to flying insects is temperature at which flight muscles cannot be activated compared to honey bees and carpenter bees bumblebees have lowest chill coma temperature of bumblebees bombus has lowest at however bumblebees have been seen to fly in colder ambient temperatures this discrepancy is likely because chill coma temperature was determined by tests done in a laboratory setting however bumblebees live in insulated shelters and can shiver to warm up before venturing into cold communication and social learning bumblebees do not have ears and it is not known whether or how well they can hear however they are sensitive to vibrations made by sound travelling through wood or other materials bumblebees do not exhibit bee dances used by honeybees to tell other workers locations of food sources instead when they return from a successful foraging expedition they run excitedly around in nest for several minutes before going out to forage once more these bees may be offering some form of communication based on buzzing sounds made by their wings which may stimulate other bees to start foraging another stimulant to foraging activity is level of food reserves in colony bees monitor amount of honey in honeypots and when little is left or when high quality food is added they are more likely to go out to forage bumblebees have been observed to partake in social learning in a 2017 study involving bombus terrestris bees were taught to complete an unnatural task of moving large objects to obtain a reward bees that first observed another bee complete task were significantly more successful in learning task than bees that observed same action performed by a magnet indicating importance of social information bees did not copy each other exactly in fact study suggested that bees were instead attempting to emulate each other s goals reproduction and nesting thumb nest of red tailed bumblebee bombus lapidarius showing wax pots full of honey nest size depends on species of bumblebee most form colonies of between 50 and 400 individuals but colonies have been documented as small as 20 individuals and as large as 1700 these nests are small compared to honeybee hives which hold about 50 000 bees many species nest underground choosing old rodent burrows or sheltered places and avoiding places that receive direct sunlight that could result in overheating other species make nests above ground whether in thick grass or in holes in trees a bumblebee nest is not organised into hexagonal combs like that of a honeybee cells are instead clustered together workers remove dead bees or larvae from nest and deposit them outside nest entrance helping to prevent disease nests in temperate regions last only for a single season and do not survive winter in early spring queen comes out of diapause and finds a suitable place to create her colony then she builds wax cells in which to lay her eggs which were fertilised previous year eggs that hatch develop into female workers and in time queen colony with workers feeding young and performing other duties similar to honeybee workers in temperate zones young queens gynes leave nest in autumn and mate often more than once with males drones that are forcibly driven out of colony drones and workers die as weather turns colder young queens feed intensively to build up stores of fat for winter they survive in a resting state diapause generally below ground until weather warms up in spring with early bumblebee being species that is among first to emerge many species of bumblebee follow this general trend within year bombus is a species that follows this type of colony cycle for this species cycle begins in february reproduction starts in july or august and ends in winter months queen remains in hibernation until spring of following year in order to optimize conditions to search for a nest thumb left upright 1 2 bumblebee life cycle showing adults and larvae in nest of b terrestris engraved in 1840 by william home lizars after drawing probably by james hope stewart nest of common humble bee b terrestris plate 15 from naturalist s library vol vi entomology by sir william jardine edinburgh w h lizars 1840 in fertilised queens ovaries only become active when queen starts to lay an egg passes along oviduct to vagina where there is a chamber called spermatheca in which sperm from mating is stored depending on need she may allow her egg to be fertilised unfertilised eggs become haploid males fertilised eggs grow into diploid females and queens hormones that stimulate development of ovaries are suppressed in female worker bees while queen remains dominant to develop larvae must be fed both nectar for carbohydrates and pollen for protein bumblebees feed nectar to larvae by chewing a small hole in brood cell into which they regurgitate nectar larvae are fed pollen in one of two ways depending on bumblebee species pocket making bumblebees create pockets of pollen at base of brood cell clump from which larvae feed themselves pollen storing bumblebees keep pollen in separate wax pots and feed it to larvae thumb an above ground nest hidden in grass and moss of common carder bee bombus pascuorum wax canopy or has been removed to show winged workers and pupae in irregularly placed wax cells after emergence of first or second group of offspring workers take over task of foraging and queen spends most of her time laying eggs and caring for larvae colony grows progressively larger and eventually begins to produce males and new queens goulson 2013 pp 16 24 bumblebee workers can lay unfertilised haploid eggs with only a single set of chromosomes that develop into viable male bumblebees only fertilised queens can lay diploid eggs one set of chromosomes from a drone one from queen that mature into workers and new queens goulson 2013 pp 108 114 in a young colony queen minimises reproductive competition from workers by suppressing their egg laying through physical aggression and pheromones worker policing leads to nearly all eggs laid by workers being eaten thus queen is usually mother of all of first males laid workers eventually begin to lay male eggs later in season when queen s ability to suppress their reproduction diminishes because of reproductive competition between workers and queen bumblebees are considered primitively eusocial although a large majority of bumblebees follow such monogynous colony cycles that only involve one queen some select bombus species such as bombus atratus will spend part of their life cycle in a polygynous phase have multiple queens in one nest during these periods of polygyny foraging behaviour thumb left a bumblebee loaded with pollen in its pollen baskets bumblebees generally visit flowers that exhibit bee pollination syndrome and these patches of flowers may be up to 1 2 km from their colony they tend to visit same patches of flowers every day as long as they continue to find nectar and pollen there a habit known as pollinator or flower constancy while foraging bumblebees can reach ground speeds of up to bumblebees use a combination of colour and spatial relationships to learn which flowers to forage from they can also detect both presence and pattern of electric fields on flowers which occur due to atmospheric electricity and take a while to leak away into ground they use this information to find out if a flower has been recently visited by another bee bumblebees can detect temperature of flowers as well as which parts of flower are hotter or cooler and use this information to recognise flowers after arriving at a flower they extract nectar using their long tongues and store it in their crops many species of bumblebees also exhibit nectar robbing instead of inserting mouthparts into flower in normal way these bees bite directly through base of corolla to extract nectar avoiding pollen transfer pollen is removed from flowers deliberately or incidentally by bumblebees incidental removal occurs when bumblebees come in contact with anthers of a flower while collecting nectar when it enters a flower bumblebee s body hairs receive a dusting of pollen from anthers in queens and workers this is then groomed into corbiculae pollen baskets on hind legs where it can be seen as bulging masses that may contain as many as a million pollen grains male bumblebees do not have corbiculae and do not collect pollen bumblebees are also capable of buzz pollination in which they dislodge pollen from anthers by creating a resonant vibration with their flight muscles in at least some species once a bumblebee has visited a flower it leaves a scent mark on it this scent mark deters bumblebees from visiting that flower until scent degrades this scent mark is a general chemical bouquet that bumblebees leave behind in different locations e g nest neutral and food sites and they learn to use this bouquet to identify both rewarding and unrewarding flowers and may be able to identify who else has visited a flower bumblebees rely on this chemical bouquet more when flower has a high handling time that is where it takes a longer time for bee to find nectar once inside flower once they have collected nectar and pollen female workers return to nest and deposit harvest into brood cells or into wax cells for storage unlike honeybees bumblebees only store a few days worth of food so are much more vulnerable to food shortages male bumblebees collect only nectar and do so to feed themselves they may visit quite different flowers from workers because of their different nutritional needs macdonald 2003 p 7 asynchronous flight muscles bees beat their wings about 200 times a second their thorax muscles do not contract on each nerve firing but rather vibrate like a plucked rubber band this is efficient since it lets system consisting of muscle and wing operate at its resonant frequency leading to low energy consumption further it is necessary since insect motor nerves generally cannot fire 200 times per second these types of muscles are called asynchronous muscles and are found in insect wing systems in families such as hymenoptera diptera coleoptera and hemiptera bumblebees must warm up their bodies considerably to get airborne at low ambient temperatures bumblebees can reach an internal thoracic temperature of 30 degc 86 degf using this method cuckoo bumblebees thumb left cuckoo bumblebee b vestalis a parasite of b terrestris bumblebees of subgenus psithyrus known as cuckoo bumblebees and formerly considered a separate genus are brood parasites sometimes called kleptoparasites in colonies of other bumblebees and have lost ability to collect pollen before finding and invading a host colony a psithyrus female such as that of psithyrus species of b sylvestris pierre bombus psithyrus sylvestris lepeletier 1832 universite de mons retrieved 6 january 2013 feeds directly from flowers once she has infiltrated a host colony psithyrus female kills or subdues queen of that colony and uses pheromones and physical attacks to force workers of that colony to feed her and her young usually cuckoo bumblebees can be described as queen intolerant since host queen is often killed to enable parasite to produce more offspring though some species such as b bohemicus actually enjoy increased success when they leave host queen alive female psithyrus has a number of morphological adaptations for combat such as larger mandibles a tough cuticle and a larger venom sac that increase her chances of taking over a nest upon emerging from their cocoons psithyrus males and females disperse and mate males do not survive winter but like bumblebee queens psithyrus females find suitable locations to spend winter and enter diapause after mating they usually emerge from hibernation later than their host species each species of cuckoo bee has a specific host species which it may physically resemble macdonald 2003 p 12 in case of parasitism of b terrestris by b psithyrus vestalis genetic analysis of individuals captured in wild showed that about 42 of host species nests at a single location had lost their fight against their parasite sting queen and worker bumblebees can sting unlike in honeybees a bumblebee s stinger lacks barbs so bee can sting repeatedly without injuring itself by same token stinger is not left in wound bumblebee species are not normally aggressive but may sting in defence of their nest or if harmed female cuckoo bumblebees aggressively attack host colony members and sting host queen but ignore other animals unless disturbed goulson 2013 pp 118 121 predators parasites and pathogens thumb left bumblebee nest dug up and destroyed by a predator probably a badger bumblebees despite their ability to sting are eaten by certain predators nests may be dug up by badgers and eaten whole including any adults present goulson 2013 p 132 adults are preyed upon by robber flies and beewolves in north america goulson 2013 p 126 in europe birds including bee eaters and shrikes capture adult bumblebees on wing smaller birds such as great tits also occasionally learn to take bumblebees while camouflaged crab spiders catch them as they visit flowers goulson 2013 pp 126 129 thumb upright 0 6 bumblebee stored as food by a great grey shrike great grey shrike is able to detect flying

agricultural use bumblebees are important pollinators of both crops and wildflowers because bumblebees do not overwinter entire colony they do not stockpile honey and therefore are not useful as honey producers bumblebees are increasingly cultured for agricultural use as pollinators among other reasons because they can pollinate plants such as tomato in greenhouses by buzz pollination whereas other pollinators cannot commercial production began in 1987 when roland de founded company in 1988 they produced enough nests to pollinate 40 hectares of tomatoes industry grew quickly starting with other companies in netherlands bumblebee nests mainly of buff tailed bumblebees are produced in at least 30 factories around world over a million nests are grown annually in europe turkey is a major producer goulson 2013 pp 169 170 bumblebees are northern hemisphere animals when red clover was introduced as a crop to new zealand in nineteenth century it was found to have no local pollinators and clover seed had accordingly to be imported each year four species of bumblebee from united kingdom were therefore imported as pollinators in 1885 and 1886 canterbury acclimatization society brought in 442 queens of which 93 survived and quickly multiplied as planned red clover was soon being produced from locally grown seed bumblebees are also reared commercially to pollinate tomatoes grown in greenhouses new zealand population of buff tailed bumblebees began colonising tasmania away after being introduced there in 1992 under unclear circumstances goulson 2013 pp 69 70 some concerns exist about impact of international trade in mass produced bumblebee colonies evidence from japan and south america indicates bumblebees can escape and naturalise in new environments causing damage to native pollinators greater use of native pollinators such as bombus in china and japan has occurred as a result in addition mounting evidence indicates mass produced bumblebees may also carry diseases harmful to wild bumblebees and honeybees in canada and sweden it has been shown that growing a mosaic of different crops encourages bumblebees and provides higher yields than does a monoculture of rape despite fact that bees were attracted to crop goulson 2013 pp 169 172 population decline bumblebee species are declining in europe north america and asia due to a number of factors including land use change that reduces their food plants in north america pathogens are possibly having a stronger negative effect especially for subgenus bombus a major impact on bumblebees was caused by mechanisation of agriculture accelerated by urgent need to increase food production during second world war small farms depended on horses to pull implements and carts horses were fed on clover and hay both of which were permanently grown on a typical farm little artificial fertiliser was used farms thus provided flowering clover and flower rich meadows favouring bumblebees mechanisation removed need for horses and most of clover artificial fertilisers encouraged growth of taller grasses outcompeting meadow flowers most of flowers and bumblebees that fed on them disappeared from britain by early 1980s last native british short haired bumblebee was captured near dungeness in 1988 goulson 2013 pp 4 6 this significant increase in pesticide and fertilizer use associated with industrialization of agriculture has had adverse effects on genus bombus bees are directly exposed to chemicals in two ways by consuming nectar that has been directly treated with pesticide or through physical contact with treated plants and flowers species bombus in particular has been found to be impacted by pesticides their brood development has been reduced and their memory has been negatively affected additionally pesticide use negatively impacts colony development and size bumblebees are in danger in many developed countries due to habitat destruction and collateral pesticide damage european food safety authority ruled that three neonicotinoid pesticides clothianidin imidacloprid and thiamethoxam presented a high risk for bees while most work on neonicotinoid toxicity has looked at honeybees a study on b terrestris showed that field realistic levels of imidacloprid significantly reduced growth rate and cut production of new queens by 85 implying a considerable negative effect on wild bumblebee populations throughout developed world however in another study following chronic exposure to field realistic levels of neonicotinoid pesticide thiamethoxam colony weight gain was not affected nor were number or mass of sexuals produced low levels of neonicotinoids can reduce number of bumblebees in a colony by as much as 55 and cause dysfunction in bumblebees brains bumblebee conservation trust considers this evidence of reduced brain function particularly alarming given that bumblebees rely upon their intelligence to go about their daily tasks research was published in journal of federation of american societies for experimental biology by chris connolly and others a study on b terrestris had results that suggests that use of neonicotinoid pesticides can affect how well bumblebees are able to forage and pollinate bee colonies that had been affected by pesticide released more foragers and collected more pollen than bees who had not been dosed with neonicotinoid although bees affected by pesticide were able to collect more pollen they took a longer amount of time doing so of 19 species of native bumblebees and six species of cuckoo bumblebees formerly widespread in britain three have been extirpated eight are in serious decline and only six remain widespread similar declines have been reported in ireland with four species designated endangered and another two considered vulnerable to extinction a decline in bumblebee numbers could cause large scale changes to countryside resulting from inadequate pollination of certain plants some bumblebees native to north america are also vanishing such as bombus balteatus bombus bombus affinis and bombus occidentalis and one bombus may be extinct in south america bombus bellicosus was extirpated in northern limit of its distribution range probably due to intense land use and climate change effects conservation efforts thumb left drone short haired bumblebee bombus subterraneus species was

establishment of an international union for conservation of nature bumblebee specialist group chaired by dr paul h williams to assess threat status of bumblebee species worldwide using red list criteria bumblebee conservation is in its infancy in many parts of world but with realization of important part they play in pollination of crops efforts are being made to manage farmland better enhancing wild bee population can be done by planting of wildflower strips and in new zealand bee nesting boxes have achieved some success perhaps because there are few burrowing mammals to provide potential nesting sites in that country misconception about flight thumb right a widely believed falsehood holds that scientists proved bumblebees to be incapable of flight venerable line about scientists having proved that a bumblebee can t fly appears regularly in magazine and newspaper stories it s also kind of item that can come up in a cocktail party conversation when subject turns to science or technology often statement is made in a distinctly disparaging tone aimed at putting down those know it all scientists and engineers who are so smart yet can t manage to understand something that s apparent to everyone else story has had remarkable staying power and myth persists that science says a bumblebee can t fly indeed this myth has taken on a new life of its own as a piece of urban folklore on internet alt a bumblebee landing on a purple flower according to 20th century folklore laws of aerodynamics prove bumblebee should be incapable of flight as it does not have capacity in terms of wing size or beats per second to achieve flight with degree of wing loading necessary origin of this claim has been difficult to pin down with any certainty john h mcmasters recounted an anecdote about an unnamed swiss aerodynamicist at a dinner party who performed some rough calculations and concluded presumably in jest that according to equations bumblebees cannot fly cited in in later years mcmasters backed away from this origin suggesting there could be multiple sources and earliest he has found was a reference in 1934 book by french entomologist antoine magnan 1881 1938 they had applied equations of air resistance to insects and found their flight was impossible but one shouldn t be surprised that results of calculations don t square with reality following passage appears in introduction to le vol des insectes this translates to magnan refers to his assistant andre sainte lague bumblebee story can be traced back to a 1934 book by entomologist antoine magnan who refers to a calculation by his assistant andre sainte lague who was an engineer conclusion was presumably based on fact that maximum possible lift produced by aircraft wings as small as a bumblebee s wings and traveling as slowly as a bee in flight would be much less than weight of a bee some credit physicist ludwig prandtl 1875 1953 of university of gottingen in germany with popularizing idea others say swiss gas dynamicist jacob 1898 1981 did calculations thumb left bumblebee in flight it has its tongue extended and a laden pollen basket calculations that purported to show that bumblebees cannot fly are based upon a simplified linear treatment of oscillating aerofoils method assumes small amplitude oscillations without flow separation this ignores effect of dynamic stall an airflow separation inducing a large vortex above wing which briefly produces several times lift of aerofoil in regular flight more sophisticated aerodynamic analysis shows bumblebee can fly because its wings encounter dynamic stall in every oscillation cycle additionally john maynard smith a noted biologist with a strong background in aeronautics has pointed out that bumblebees would not be expected to sustain flight as they would need to generate too much power given their tiny wing area however in aerodynamics experiments with other insects he found that viscosity at scale of small insects meant even their small wings can move a very large volume of air relative to their size and this reduces power required to sustain flight by an order of magnitude in music and literature thumb

prince guidon into a bumblebee so he can fly away to visit his father tsar saltan in opera tale of tsar saltan although music may reflect flight of a bluebottle rather than a bumblebee music inspired walt disney to feature a bumblebee in his 1940 animated musical fantasia and have it sound as if it were flying in all parts of theater this early attempt at surround sound was unsuccessful and music was excluded from film s release in 1599 during reign of queen elizabeth i someone possibly tailboys published or bumble bee under pseudonym t this was one of nine books censored under bishop s ban
