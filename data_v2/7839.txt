thumb king harold depicted on bayeux tapestry alt king harold depicted on bayeux tapestry very little is known for certain of ancestry of godwins family of last anglo saxon king of england harold ii when king edward confessor died in january 1066 his closest relative was his great nephew edgar aetheling but he was young and lacked powerful supporters harold was head of most powerful family in england and edward s brother in law and he became king in september 1066 harold defeated and killed king harald hardrada of norway at battle of stamford bridge and harold was himself defeated and killed following month by william conqueror at battle of hastings family is named after harold s father earl godwin who had risen to a position of wealth and influence in 1020s under danish king cnut great in 1045 godwin s daughter edith married king edward confessor and by mid 1050s harold and his brothers had become dominant almost monopolising english earldoms godwin s origin is obscure he was probably son of wulfnoth cild a south saxon thegn but wulfnoth s ancestry is disputed a few genealogists and historians argue that he was descended from alfred great s elder brother king aethelred i 865 71 but almost all historians of anglo saxon england reject this theory background earl godwin is probably first recorded in 1014 when godwin son of wulfnoth was left land at a place called compton in will of king aethelred unready s son aethelstan aetheling as earl godwin was later recorded as holding land at compton in sussex it is likely that he was godwin mentioned in aethelstan aetheling s will historians think that he was probably son of outlawed south saxon thegn wulfnoth cild in 1009 wulfnoth was accused of unknown crimes at a muster of king aethelred s fleet and fled with twenty ships a force sent in pursuit was destroyed in a storm according to twelfth century chronicler john of worcester godwin was son of a wulfnoth who was son of aethelmaer brother of eadric streona both sons of an otherwise unknown aethelric but in view of historian ann williams this is chronologically impossible if relationship were true pedigree would result in a significant generational displacement with two children of aethelred unready marrying son and great great granddaughter of aethelric aethelred s daughter eadgyth married aethelric s son eadric streona while eadgyth s half brother edward confessor married godwin s daughter edith if godwin was aethelric s great grandson then edith was his great great granddaughter david kelley however argues that edward being a child of a later marriage could have been almost a generation younger than his sister and if both he and eadric married much younger wives and if eadric was among youngest brothers of aethelmaer this could close up chronological differences john of worcester also stated that wulfnoth s rebellion was provoked by unjust charges brought by eadric streona s brother life of edward confessor commissioned by his widow edith who was harold s sister is silent on her family s origin in a section designed to her family godwin is described as blessed in his ancestral stock but nothing further is said of this stock in view of historian frank barlow there is massive evasion here historians generally discount a later medieval tradition that he was son of a churl or a farmer in her oxford dictionary of national biography odnb article on godwin s son king harold godwinson robin fleming says of godwin origins of this parvenu are extremely obscure he was quintessential new man however williams says that anglo saxon chronicle s reference to wulfnoth cild south saxon implies a man of rank cild means child young man warrior his ability to detach twenty ships from royal fleet suggests a man of at least local importance frank barlow goes further arguing that godwin must have been of aristocratic origin and that family s massive land holdings in sussex are indisputable evidence that wulfnoth who was godwin s father was saxon thegn aethelred i theory thumb right upright will of alfred great ad 873 888 11th century copy british library stowe ms 944 ff 29v 33r charter s 1507 at electronic sawyer a few scholars have put forward a genealogical reconstruction making godwins descend from alfred great s elder brother king aethelred i of wessex theory was first proposed by historian alfred anscombe in 1913 and advocated by genealogist lundie w barlow in 1957 and mayanist scholar and genealogist david h kelley in 1989 theory depends in part on tracing ownership of certain estates especially compton in west sussex which was probably compton left to aethelred s son aethelhelm in alfred great s will it was later in possession of wulfnoth presumably confiscated after his rebellion and left to godwin wulfnoth s son in 1014 in aethelstan aetheling s will immediately before bequest to godwin is one to an calling him anscombe identifies this legatee as ealdorman aethelmaer stout in his view father of wulfnoth cild he supports this relationship with two further arguments he finds significance in occurrence in documents of an aethelmaer with same epithet as wulfnoth cild though another advocate of theory lundie barlow found anscombe s cild argument untenable anscombe likewise places value in john of worcester s pedigree that shows godwin s father wulfnoth as son of agelmaer a brother of eadric streona though worcester chronicler gives his agelmaer a different father from known father of ealdorman aethelmaer and anscombe points out its inherent chronological problems he argues that though flawed pedigree retains memory of a father son relationship between aethelmaer stout and wulfnoth cild aethelmaer was son of late tenth century chronicler and ealdorman aethelweard whose own writings record that he was descended from aethelred i although exact nature of this descent has been debated in his 2002 book godwins frank barlow sympathetically examined arguments put forward by anscombe and lundie barlow he included a family tree based on their work showing godwin s descent from aethelred i and at one point described wulfnoth cild as son of aethelmaer stout elsewhere he was more cautious describing wulfnoth as probable son of aethelmaer and questioning whether a family which had used names for seven generations almost all starting with or would suddenly have thrown up a wulfnoth particularly as aethelmaer stout s known sons continued tradition he stated nevertheless that this pedigree even if mistaken is of right type frank barlow is almost alone among modern scholars in taking theory seriously peter rex in his biography of harold describes godwin as one of cnut s new men and dismisses claims that family had aristocratic ancestry emma mason in her history of godwin family describes wulfnoth as a mystery man who was probably a minor figure at court in late tenth century and ian walker in his biography of harold gives a similar description of wulfnoth as a relatively minor figure who attended court only infrequently williams in her odnb article on godwin and robin fleming in her odnb article on harold do not mention theory when discussing godwin s ancestry and according to stenton of his origin nothing can be said with any assurance succession to throne even if harold was descended from aethelred i it would not have given him a hereditary claim to throne according to rules of royal succession in later anglo saxon england eligibility was confined to aethelings that is throne worthy princes of royal house in earlier anglo saxon times eligibility depended on descent from fifth or sixth century founder of each kingdom but it later became more restricted according to david dumville anglo saxon aetheling in period from ninth century scandinavian settlements to norman conquest was a prince of royal house he shared with reigning king descent from a common grandfather at least all known west saxon aethelings after 900 were sons of kings except for harold s rival for throne in 1066 edgar aetheling who was grandson of king edmund ironside edgar was thus an aetheling according to dumville s definition but in view of pauline stafford only son of a present or former king could be an aetheling and when edward confessor gave this designation to his great nephew edgar it was a form of adoption without known recent precedent because for first time since beginning of ninth century there was no living aetheling in strict sense of a son of a king danish ancestry godwin s wife and mother of his children including harold and edith was gytha her father was a dane whose origin is unknown although he was probably a dane from scania which was then in denmark but is now part of sweden gytha was very well connected as her brother ulf married king cnut s sister cnut probably arranged marriage between godwin and gytha in about 1022 references sources external links category house of godwin category anglo norse
