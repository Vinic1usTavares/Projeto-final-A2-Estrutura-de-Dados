dearest jesus my desire is a church cantata by johann sebastian bach he composed dialogue cantata in leipzig for first sunday after epiphany and first performed it on 13 january 1726 as part of his third cantata cycle bach composed cantata in his third year as thomaskantor on a text which georg christian lehms a court poet in darmstadt had published already in 1711 lehms derived from prescribed gospel finding in temple a dialogue instead of a parent missing a son as in gospel an allegorical soul soprano misses jesus bass motifs of story loss and anxious search are placed in a more general situation in which listener can identify with soul as lehms did not provide a closing chorale bach chose twelfth and final stanza of paul gerhardt s hymn bach structured cantata in six movements first alternating arias and recitative then uniting voices in recitative and aria finally a chorale two soloists are supported by an intimate baroque instrumental ensemble of oboe strings and continuo oboe accompanies soprano a solo violin bass both play when voices are united history and words bach composed cantata in his third year as thomaskantor director of church music in leipzig for first sunday after epiphany prescribed readings for sunday were taken from epistle to romans speaking of duties of a christian and from gospel of luke finding in temple bach composed a text written by georg christian lehms court poet in darmstadt who published it in 1711 bach had set texts by lehms already when he composed cantatas for weimar court from 1714 to 1717 he had set a similar work by lehms a few weeks earlier for second day of christmas lehms treated gospel to an allegorical dialogue of jesus and soul in concerto in dialogue bach assigned soul to soprano voice and gave words of jesus to bass as voice of christ disregarding that jesus in gospel is still a boy lehms imagines not a parent searching for a missing son but more generally christian soul with whom we are expected to identify as john eliot gardiner notes bach scholar klaus hofmann comments that poet takes up general motifs of story loss search for jesus and his rediscovery and places them in context of believer s relationship with jesus dialogue also refers to medieval mysticism and to imagery of song of songs lehms did not provide a closing chorale bach added twelfth and final stanza of paul gerhardt s hymn 1647 it is sung to melody of which was codified by louis bourgeois when setting geneva psalm 42 in his collection of trios de david geneva 1551 bourgeois seems to have been influenced by secular song

neue bach ausgabe keys and time signatures are taken from book on all cantatas by bach scholar alfred durr using symbols for common time 4 4 and alla breve 2 2 continuo playing throughout is not shown movements dialogue set in arias and recitatives for a solo voice and in duets shows that bach was familiar with italian contemporary opera 1 dialogue is opened by soprano as soul in an aria in e minor marked lento dearest jesus my desire voice is complemented by an obbligato oboe described by john eliot gardiner as a solo oboe as her accomplice in spinning most ravishing in manner of one of bach s concerto slow movements julian mincham distinguishes in oboe line two different ideas in first five measures a sense of striving effort and stretching upwards then garlands of content in achieving a union as last lines of text say ah my treasure bring me joy let me embrace you with greatest delight 2 bass answers in a short recitative how is it that you sought me a paraphrase of jesus saying in gospel that he has to be in his father s place 3 he expands reasoning in a da capo aria in b minor here in my father s place embellished by a solo violin which encircles voice with triplets and trills words troubled spirit appear whenever mentioned in minor mode colourings in melody and harmony 4 in following dialogue recitative ah holy and great god soul answers with a paraphrase of opening line of psalm 84 how amiable is thy dwelling which both heinrich schutz and johannes brahms set to music brahms as central movement of bach sets text as an evocative arioso with a pulsating string accompaniment two voices never sing at same time 5 a duet now all trouble disappears finally unites both voices and also their associated obbligato instruments oboe and violin so far heard only separately gardiner writes it is one of those duets in which he seems to throw caution to winds rivalling fine conclusions to operas of his day but with far more skill substance and even panache 6 a four part setting of paul gerhardt s hymn my god open gates returns cantata also in terms of style to sphere of reverence appropriate for a church service recordings entries are taken from listing on
