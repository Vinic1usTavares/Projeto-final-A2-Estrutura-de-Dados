dolebury means idol hill from old english and beorg thumb left earthworks at dolebury warren early hill forts developed in late bronze and early iron age roughly start of first millennium bc reason for their emergence in britain and their purpose has been a subject of debate it has been argued that they could have been military sites constructed in response to invasion from continental europe sites built by invaders or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and consequent pressure on agriculture dominant view since 1960s has been that increasing use of iron led to social changes in britain deposits of iron ore were located in different places to tin and copper ore necessary to make bronze and as a result trading patterns shifted and old elites lost their economic and social status power passed into hands of a new group of people archaeologist barry cunliffe believes that population increase still played a role and has stated forts provided defensive possibilities for community at those times when stress of an increasing population burst out into open warfare but i wouldn t see them as having been built because there was a state of war they would be functional as defensive strongholds when there were tensions and undoubtedly some of them were attacked and destroyed but this was not only or even most significant factor in their construction thumb southern ramparts various artefacts have been uncovered representing long period of occupation of site at dolebury warren these include flintwork from palaeolithic bronze spearheads bronze age pottery and roman pottery and coins there is evidence of occupation of site during iron age defences and celtic field systems there date back to 7th century 3rd century bce though they might mask earlier developments hillfort was occupied until approximately 100bc though it is possible that it was reoccupied in roman and post roman periods archeological consultant peter leach has suggested there may even have been a roman temple built within hillfort while aerial photographs suggest probable remains of an iron age or roman coaxial field system local historian robin atthill also suggests that dolebury may have re emerged as an important centre of population in 5th century thumb left looking west towards highest point medieval in medieval or post medieval period remains of hillfort were used as a rabbit warren which was used to breed rabbits providing valuable meat and fur many warrens were surrounded by banks or walls to prevent rabbits from escaping escaped rabbits caused damage to nearby farmland and meant a loss in profit warren at dolebury is completely enclosed by substantial ramparts of iron age hill fort and thus provided an ideal location to breed rabbits presence of pillow mounds and vermin traps demonstrate man s management of site for husbandry ridge and furrow agriculture has also been identified from aerial photographs within fort some of these structures along with earlier iron age features have been damaged by subsequent quarrying which may have been for lead ochre or calamine site was described by john leland in 16th century a three storey building believed to be warrener s house and possibly a watch tower surrounded by a garden was in ruins by 1830 19th and 20th centuries site was visited in early 19th century by john skinner
