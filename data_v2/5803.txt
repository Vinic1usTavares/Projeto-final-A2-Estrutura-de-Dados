right thumb upright young polio victims receiving physiotherapy in 1950s social history of viruses describes influence of viruses and viral infections on human history epidemics caused by viruses began when human behaviour changed during neolithic period around 12 000 years ago when humans developed more densely populated agricultural communities this allowed viruses to spread rapidly and subsequently to become endemic viruses of plants and livestock also increased and as humans became dependent on agriculture and farming diseases such as potyviruses of potatoes and rinderpest of cattle had devastating consequences smallpox and measles viruses are among oldest that infect humans having evolved from viruses that infected other animals they first appeared in humans in europe and north africa thousands of years ago viruses were later carried to new world by europeans during time of spanish conquests but indigenous people had no natural resistance to viruses and millions of them died during epidemics influenza pandemics have been recorded since 1580 and they have occurred with increasing frequency in subsequent centuries pandemic of 1918 19 in which 40 50 million died in less than a year was one of most devastating in history louis pasteur and edward jenner were first to develop vaccines to protect against viral infections nature of viruses remained unknown until invention of electron microscope in 1930s when science of virology gained momentum in 20th century many diseases both old and new were found to be caused by viruses there were epidemics of poliomyelitis that were only controlled following development of a vaccine in 1950s hiv is one of most pathogenic new viruses to have emerged in centuries although scientific interest in them arose because of diseases they cause most viruses are beneficial they drive evolution by transferring genes across species play important roles in ecosystems and are essential to life in prehistory over past 50 000 100 000 years as modern humans increased in numbers and dispersed throughout world new infectious diseases emerged including those caused by viruses earlier humans lived in small isolated communities and most epidemic diseases did not exist clark p and armelagos p 28 smallpox which is most lethal and devastating viral infection in history first emerged among agricultural communities in india about 11 000 years ago villarreal p 344 virus which only infected humans probably descended from poxviruses of rodents humans probably came into contact with these rodents and some people became infected by viruses they carried when viruses cross this so called species barrier their effects can be severe and humans may have had little natural resistance contemporary humans lived in small communities and those who succumbed to infection either died or developed immunity this acquired immunity is only passed down to offspring temporarily by antibodies in breast milk and other antibodies that cross placenta from mother s blood to unborn child s therefore sporadic outbreaks probably occurred in each generation in about 9000 bc when many people began to settle on fertile flood plains of river nile population became dense enough for virus to maintain a constant presence because of high concentration of susceptible people tucker p 6 other epidemics of viral diseases that depend on large concentrations of people such as mumps rubella and polio also first occurred at this time clark p 20 neolithic age which began in middle east in about 9500 bc was a time when humans became farmers barker p 1 this agricultural revolution embraced development of monoculture and presented an opportunity for rapid spread of several species of plant viruses divergence and spread of southern bean mosaic virus date from this time spread of potyviruses of potatoes and other fruits and vegetables began about 6 600 years ago about 10 000 years ago humans who inhabited lands around mediterranean basin began to domesticate wild animals pigs cattle goats sheep horses camels cats and dogs were all kept and bred in captivity these animals would have brought their viruses with them mcneill p 71 transmission of viruses from animals to humans can occur but such zoonotic infections are rare and subsequent human to human transmission of animal viruses is even rarer although there are notable exceptions such as influenza most viruses are species specific and would have posed no threat to humans baker pp 40 50 rare epidemics of viral diseases originating in animals would have been short lived because viruses were not fully adapted to p 73 and human populations were too small to maintain chains of infection clark p 57 58 other more ancient viruses have been less of a threat herpes viruses first infected ancestors of modern humans over 80 million years ago crawford 2000 p 225 humans have developed a tolerance to these viruses and most are infected with at least one species records of these milder virus infections are rare but it is likely that early hominids suffered from colds influenza and diarrhoea caused by viruses just as humans do today more recently evolved viruses cause epidemics and pandemics and it is these that history records influenza virus is one that seems to have crossed species barrier from pigs to ducks and water fowl and hence to humans it is possible that a fatal plague in middle east at time of late 18th dynasty was associated with this transmission at amarna in antiquity right thumb upright an egyptian stele thought to

arabic name for measles it has had many other names including from latin word rubeus red and small plague dobson pp 140 141 close similarities between measles virus canine distemper virus and rinderpest virus have given rise to speculation that measles was first transmitted to humans from domesticated dogs or cattle karlen p 57 measles virus appears to have fully diverged from then widespread rinderpest virus by 12th century a measles infection confers lifelong immunity therefore virus requires a high population density to become endemic and this probably did not occur in neolithic age following emergence of virus in middle east it reached india by 2500 bc measles was so common in children at time that it was not recognised as a disease in egyptian hieroglyphs it was described as a normal stage of human development one of earliest descriptions of a virus infected plant can be found in a poem written by japanese empress 718 770 in which she describes a plant in

into skin her younger brother had died of smallpox and she too had had disease determined to spare her five year old son edward from similar suffering she ordered embassy surgeon charles maitland to variolate him on her return to london she asked maitland to variolate her four year old daughter in presence of king s physicians tucker pp 16 17 later montagu persuaded prince and princess of wales to sponsor a public demonstration of procedure six prisoners who had been condemned to death and were awaiting execution at newgate prison were offered a full pardon for serving as subjects of public

louis pasteur rabies is an often fatal disease caused by infection of mammals with rabies virus in 21st century it is mainly a disease that affects wild mammals such as foxes and bats but it is one of oldest known virus diseases rabies is a sanskrit word that dates from 3000 bc which means madness or rage and disease has been known for over 4000 years descriptions of rabies can be found in mesopotamian texts and ancient greeks called it or meaning madness references to rabies can be found in laws of eshnunna which date from 2300 bc aristotle 384 322 bc wrote one of earliest undisputed descriptions of disease and how it was passed to humans celsus in first century ad first recorded symptom called hydrophobia and suggested that saliva of infected animals and humans contained a slime or poison to describe this he invented word virus rabies does not cause epidemics but infection was greatly feared because of its terrible symptoms which include insanity hydrophobia and death in france during time of louis pasteur 1822 1895 there were only a few hundred rabies infections in humans each year but cures were desperately sought aware of possible danger pasteur began to look for microbe in mad dogs reid pp 93 94 pasteur showed that when dried spinal cords from dogs that had died from rabies were crushed and injected into healthy dogs they did not become infected he repeated experiment several times on same dog with tissue that had been dried for fewer and fewer days until dog survived even after injections of fresh rabies infected spinal tissue pasteur had dog against rabies as he later did with 50 more reid p 96 left thumb a cartoon from 1826 depicting a rabid dog on a london street although pasteur had little idea how his method worked he tested it on a boy joseph meister 1876 1940 who was brought to pasteur by his mother on 6 july 1885 he was covered in bites having been set upon by a mad dog meister s mother begged pasteur to help her son pasteur was a scientist not a physician and he was well aware of consequences for him if things were to go wrong he nevertheless decided to help boy and injected him with increasingly virulent rabid rabbit spinal tissue over following 10 days reid pp 97 98 later pasteur wrote as death of this child appeared inevitable i decided not without deep and severe unease to try out on joseph meister procedure which had consistently worked on dogs dobson p 159 meister recovered and returned home with his mother on 27 july pasteur successfully treated a second boy in october that same year jean baptiste 1869 1923 was a 15 year old shepherd boy who had been severely bitten as he tried to protect other children from a rabid dog dobson pp 159 160 pasteur s method of treatment remained in use for over 50 years little was known about cause of disease until 1903 when negri 1876 1912 first saw microscopic lesions now called negri bodies in brains of rabid animals he wrongly thought they were protozoan parasites paul remlinger 1871 1964 soon showed by filtration experiments that they were much smaller than protozoa and even smaller than bacteria thirty years later negri bodies were shown to be accumulations of

immunodeficiency syndrome clark p 149 most virologists believe that hiv originated in sub saharan africa during 20th century and over 70 million individuals have been infected by virus by 2011 an estimated 35 million had died from aids making it one of most destructive epidemics in recorded history hiv 1 is one of most significant viruses to have emerged in last quarter of 20th century when in 1981 a scientific article was published that reported deaths of five young gay men no one knew that they had died from aids full scale of epidemic and that virus had been silently emerging over several decades was not known weeks pp 15 21 hiv crossed species barrier between chimpanzees and humans in africa in early decades of 20th century crawford 2013 pp 122 123 during years that followed there were enormous social changes and turmoil in africa population shifts were unprecedented as vast numbers of people moved from rural farms to expanding cities and virus was spread from remote regions to densely populated urban conurbations crawford 2013 p 173 incubation period for aids is around 10 years so a global epidemic starting in early 1980s is credible weeks p 19 at this time there was much scapegoating and levins p 279 out of africa theory for origin of hiv pandemic was not well received by africans who felt that blame was misplaced this led world health assembly to pass a 1987 resolution which stated that hiv is a naturally occurring virus of undetermined geographic origin quoted in weeks p 20 hiv pandemic has challenged communities and brought about social changes

american red cross removing a victim of spanish influenza from a house in 1918 when influenza virus undergoes a genetic shift many humans have no immunity to new strain and if population of susceptible individuals is high enough to maintain chain of infection pandemics occur genetic changes usually happen when different strains of virus co infect animals particularly birds and swine although many viruses of vertebrates are restricted to one species influenza virus is an exception barry p 111 last pandemic of 19th century occurred in 1899 and resulted in deaths of 250 000 people in europe virus which originated in russia or asia was first to be rapidly spread by people on trains and steamships karlen p 144 a new strain of virus emerged in 1918 and subsequent pandemic of spanish flu was one of worst natural disasters in history death toll was enormous throughout world around 50 million people died from infection there were 550 000 reported deaths caused by disease in us ten times country s losses during first world war karlen p 145 and 228 000 deaths in uk jenkins p 230 in india there were more than 20 million deaths and in western samoa 22 per cent of population died barry pp 364 365 although cases of influenza occurred every winter there were only two other pandemics in 20th century barry p 114 in 1957 another new strain of virus emerged and caused a pandemic of asian flu although virus was not as virulent as 1918 strain over one million died worldwide next pandemic occurred when hong kong flu emerged in 1968 a new strain of virus that replaced 1957 strain mahy b p 174 affecting mainly elderly 1968 pandemic was least severe but 33 800 were killed in us shors p 332 new strains of influenza virus often originate in east asia in rural china concentration of ducks pigs and humans in close proximity is highest in world crawford 2000 p 95 most recent pandemic occurred in 2009 but none of last three has caused anything near devastation seen in 1918 exactly why strain of influenza that emerged in 1918 was so devastating is a question that still remains unanswered yellow fever dengue and other arboviruses thumb aedes aegypti feeding on human blood arboviruses are viruses that are transmitted to humans and other vertebrates by blood sucking insects these viruses are diverse term arbovirus which was derived from arthropod borne virus is no longer used in formal taxonomy because many species of virus are known to be spread in this way there are more than 500 species of arboviruses but in 1930s only three were known to cause disease in humans yellow fever virus dengue virus and fever virus levins p 138 more than 100 of such viruses are now known to cause human diseases including encephalitis mahy b p 24 yellow fever is most notorious disease caused by a flavivirus chakraborty p 38 last major epidemic in us occurred in 1905 during building of panama canal thousands of workers died from disease yellow fever originated in africa and virus was brought to americas on cargo ships which were harbouring aedes aegypti mosquito that carries virus first recorded epidemic in africa occurred in ghana in west africa in 1926 dobson p 148 in 1930s disease re emerged in brazil fred soper an american epidemiologist 1893 1977 discovered importance of cycle of infection in non human hosts and that infection of humans was a dead end that broke this cycle although yellow fever vaccine is one of most successful ever developed epidemics continue to occur in 1986 91 in west africa over 20 000 people were infected 4 000 of whom died in 1930s st louis encephalitis eastern equine encephalitis and western equine encephalitis emerged in us virus that causes la crosse encephalitis was discovered in 1960s karlen p 157 and west nile virus arrived in new york in 1999 as of 2010 dengue virus is most prevalent arbovirus and increasingly virulent strains of virus have spread across asia and americas hepatitis viruses hepatitis is a disease of liver that has been recognised since antiquity sussman p 745 symptoms include jaundice a yellowing of skin eyes and body fluids zuckerman p 135 there are numerous causes including viruses particularly hepatitis a virus hepatitis b virus and hepatitis c virus throughout history epidemics of jaundice have been reported mainly affecting soldiers at war this campaign jaundice was common in middle ages it occurred among napoleon s armies and during most of major conflicts of 19th and 20th centuries including american civil war where over 40 000 cases and around 150 deaths were reported howard p 4 viruses that cause epidemic jaundice were not discovered until middle of 20th century names for epidemic jaundice hepatitis a and for blood borne infectious jaundice hepatitis b were first used in 1947 howard p 13 following a publication in 1946 giving evidence that two diseases were distinct in 1960s first virus that could cause hepatitis was discovered this was hepatitis b virus which was named after disease it causes hepatitis a virus was discovered in 1974 discovery of hepatitis b virus and invention of tests to detect it have radically changed many medical and some cosmetic procedures screening of donated blood which was introduced in early 1970s has dramatically reduced transmission of virus donations of human blood plasma and factor viii collected before 1975 often contained infectious levels of hepatitis b virus howard p 191 until late 1960s hypodermic needles were often reused by medical professionals and tattoo artists needles were a common source of infection in late 1990s needle exchange programmes were established in europe and us to prevent spread of infections by intravenous drug users these measures also helped to reduce subsequent impact of hiv and hepatitis c virus non human animal viruses epizootics are outbreaks epidemics of disease among non human animals dubovi p 126 during 20th century significant epizootics of viral diseases in animals particularly livestock occurred worldwide many diseases caused by viruses included foot and mouth disease rinderpest of cattle avian and swine influenza swine fever and bluetongue of sheep viral diseases of livestock can be devastating both to farmers and wider community as outbreak of foot and mouth disease in uk in 2001 showed shors pp 19 20 first appearing in east africa in 1891 rinderpest a disease of cattle spread rapidly across africa mcneill p 70 by 1892 95 per cent of cattle in east africa had died this resulted in a famine that devastated farmers and nomadic people some of whom were entirely dependent on their cattle two thirds of population of maasai people died situation was made worse by epidemics of smallpox that followed in wake of famine norton griffiths p 3 in early years of 20th century rinderpest was common in asia and parts of europe barrett p 105 prevalence of disease was steadily reduced during century by control measures that included vaccination barrett p 106 by 1908 europe was free from disease outbreaks did occur following second world war but these were quickly controlled prevalence of disease increased in asia and in 1957 thailand had to appeal for aid because so many buffaloes had died that paddy fields could not be prepared for rice growing barrett p 109 russia west of ural mountains remained free from disease lenin approved several laws on control of disease but cattle in eastern russia were constantly infected with rinderpest that originated in mongolia and china where prevalence remained high barrett pp 108 109 india controlled spread of disease which had retained a foothold in southern states of tamil nadu and kerala throughout 20th century barrett p 112 and had eradicated disease by 1995 barrett p 119 africa suffered two major in 1920s and 1980s barrett pp 120 121 there was a severe outbreak in somalia in 1928 and disease was widespread in country until 1953 in 1980s outbreaks in tanzania and kenya were controlled by use of 26 million doses of vaccine and a recurrence of disease in 1997 was suppressed by an intensive vaccination campaign barrett p 122 by end of century rinderpest had been eradicated from most countries a few pockets of infection remained in ethiopia and sudan barrett p 137 and in 1994 global rinderpest eradication programme was launched by food and agriculture organization fao with aim of global eradication by 2010 barrett pp 136 138 in may 2011 fao and world organisation for animal health announced that rinderpest as a freely circulating viral disease has been eliminated from world foot and mouth disease is a highly contagious infection caused by an and is classified in same family as poliovirus virus has infected animals mainly ungulates in africa since ancient times and was probably brought to americas in 19th century by imported livestock foot and mouth disease is rarely fatal but economic losses incurred by outbreaks in sheep and cattle herds can be high last occurrence of disease in us was in 1929 but as recently as 2001 several large outbreaks occurred throughout uk and thousands of animals were killed and burnt natural hosts of influenza viruses are pigs and birds although it has probably infected humans since antiquity sussman p 386 virus can cause mild to severe epizootics in wild and domesticated animals many species of wild birds migrate and this has spread influenza across continents throughout ages virus has evolved into numerous strains and continues to do so posing an ever present threat in early years of 21st century epizootics in livestock caused by viruses continue to have serious consequences bluetongue disease a disease caused by an broke out in sheep in france in 2007 until then disease had been mainly confined to americas africa southern asia and northern australia but it is now an emerging disease around mediterranean payment required for doi plant viruses right thumb whiteflies are vector of cassava mosaic virus during 20th century many old diseases of plants were found to be caused by viruses these included maize streak and cassava mosaic disease carr p 251 as with humans when plants thrive in close proximity so do their viruses this can cause huge economic losses and human tragedies in jordan during 1970s where tomatoes and cucumbers melons and gourds were extensively grown entire fields were infected with viruses p 463 similarly in cote d ivoire thirty different viruses infected crops such as legumes and vegetables in kenya cassava mosaic virus maize streak virus and groundnut viral diseases caused loss of up to 70 per cent of crop cassava is most abundant crop that is grown in eastern africa and it is a staple crop for more than 200 million people it was introduced to africa from south america and grows well in soils with poor fertility most important disease of cassava is caused by cassava mosaic virus a which is transmitted between plants by whiteflies disease was first recorded in 1894 and outbreaks of disease occurred in eastern africa throughout 20th century often resulting in famine in 1920s growers in western us suffered huge economic loss caused by damage done to their crops by leafhopper transmitted beet curly top virus in 1956 between 25 and 50 per cent of rice crop in cuba and venezuela was destroyed by rice blanca virus in 1958 it caused loss of many rice fields in colombia outbreaks recurred in 1981 which caused losses of up to 100 per cent levins pp 181 183 in ghana between 1936 and 1977 transmitted cacao swollen shoot virus caused loss of 162 million cacao trees and additional trees were lost at rate of 15 million each year levins p 183 in 1948 in kansas us seven per cent of wheat crop was destroyed by wheat streak mosaic virus spread by wheat curl mite tulipae in 1950s papaya ringspot virus a potyvirus caused a devastating loss of solo papaya crops on oahu hawaii solo papaya had been introduced to island in previous century but disease had not been seen on island before 1940s hasegawa p 125 such disasters occurred when human intervention caused ecological changes by introduction of crops to new vectors and viruses cacao is native to south america and was introduced to west africa in late 19th century in 1936 swollen root disease had been transmitted to plantations by mealybugs from indigenous trees levins pp 184 195 new habitats can trigger outbreaks of plant virus diseases before 1970 rice yellow mottle virus was only found in kisumu district of kenya but following irrigation of large areas of east africa and extensive rice cultivation virus spread throughout east africa levins p 185 human activity introduced plant viruses to native crops citrus virus ctv was introduced to south america from africa between 1926 and 1930 at same time aphid was carried from asia to south america and this accelerated transmission of virus by 1950 more than six million citrus trees had been killed by virus in sao paulo brazil ctv and citrus trees probably coevolved for centuries in their original countries dispersal of ctv to other regions and its interaction with new citrus varieties resulted in devastating outbreaks of plant diseases because of problems caused by introduction by humans of plant viruses many countries have strict importation controls on any materials that can harbour dangerous plant viruses or their insect vectors thresh p 217 emerging viruses emerging viruses are those that have only relatively recently infected host species crawford 2011 p 34 in humans many emerging viruses have come from other animals crawford 2011 pp 34 50 when viruses jump to other species diseases caused in humans are called zoonoses or zoonotic infections levins p 419 sars severe acute respiratory syndrome sars is caused by a new type of coronavirus mahy b p 459 other were known to cause mild infections in humans so virulence and rapid spread of this novel virus strain caused alarm among health professionals as well as public fear fears of a major pandemic were not realised and by july 2003 after causing around 8 000 cases and 800 deaths outbreak had ended crawford 2011 p 37 exact origin of sars virus is not known but evidence suggests that it came from bats dubovi p 409 west nile virus west nile virus a flavivirus was first identified in 1937 when it was found in blood of a feverish woman virus which is carried by mosquitoes and birds caused outbreaks of infection in north africa and middle east in 1950s and by 1960s horses in europe fell victim largest outbreak in humans occurred in 1974 in cape province south africa and 10 000 people became ill mahy b pp 504 505 an increasing frequency of epidemics and epizootics in horses began in 1996 around mediterranean basin and by 1999 virus had reached new york city since then virus has spread throughout us in us mosquitoes carry highest amounts of virus in late summer and number of cases of disease increases in mid july to early september when weather becomes colder mosquitoes die and risk of disease decreases in europe many outbreaks have occurred in 2000 a surveillance programme began in uk to monitor incidence of virus in humans dead birds mosquitoes and horses mosquito culex modestus that can carry virus breeds on marshes of north kent this mosquito species was not previously thought to be present in uk but it is widespread in southern europe where it carries west nile virus nipah virus in 1997 an outbreak of respiratory disease occurred in malaysian farmers and their pigs more than 265 cases of encephalitis of which 105 were fatal were recorded crawford 2011 p 44 45 a new paramyxovirus was discovered in a victim s brain it was named nipah virus after village where he had lived infection was caused by a virus from fruit bats after their colony had been disrupted by deforestation bats had moved to trees nearer pig farm and pigs caught virus from their droppings viral haemorrhagic fevers thumb marburg virus several highly lethal viral pathogens are members of are filament like viruses that cause viral haemorrhagic fever and include ebola and marburg viruses marburg virus attracted widespread press attention in april 2005 after an outbreak in angola beginning in october 2004 and continuing into 2005 there were 252 cases including 227 deaths ebola virus epidemic in west africa which began in 2013 is most devastating since emergence of hiv initial outbreak occurred in december 2013 in a village in southern guinea quammen p 106 among first victims were a two year old boy his three year old sister their mother and grandmother after grandmother s funeral which was attended by her family and caregivers disease spread to neighbouring villages by march 2014 outbreak was severe enough to raise concern of local health officials who reported it to guinean ministry of health by middle of year epidemic had spread to liberia and sierra leone quammen pp 106 107 as of june 2015 world health organization reported over 27 000 cases of disease which had resulted in more than 11 000 deaths natural source of ebola virus is probably bats quammen p 97 marburg viruses are transmitted to humans by monkeys mahy b p 382 and fever by rats natalensis zoonotic infections can be severe because humans often have no natural resistance to infection and it is only when viruses become well adapted to new host that their virulence decreases some zoonotic infections are often dead ends in that after initial outbreak rate of subsequent infections subsides because viruses are not efficient at spreading from person to person beginning of 21st century saw an increase in global awareness of devastating epidemics in developing countries which in previous decades had passed relatively unnoticed by international health community beneficial viruses sir peter medawar 1915 1987 described a virus as a piece of bad news wrapped in a protein coat quoted in with exception of bacteriophages viruses had a well deserved reputation for being nothing but cause of diseases and death discovery of abundance of viruses and their overwhelming presence in many ecosystems has led modern virologists to reconsider their role in biosphere it is estimated that there are about 1031 viruses on earth most of them are bacteriophages and most are in oceans microorganisms constitute more than 90 per cent of biomass in sea and it has been estimated that viruses kill approximately 20 per cent of this biomass each day and that there are fifteen times as many viruses in oceans as there are bacteria and archaea viruses are main agents responsible for rapid destruction of harmful algal blooms which often kill other marine life and help maintain ecological balance of different species of marine blue green algae and thus adequate oxygen production for life on earth pp 347 349 emergence of strains of bacteria that are resistant to a broad range of antibiotics has become a problem in treatment of bacterial infections only two new classes of antibiotics have been developed in past 30 years and novel ways of combating bacterial infections are being sought bacteriophages were first used to control bacteria in 1920s and a large clinical trial was conducted by soviet scientists in 1963 zimmer p 37 this work was unknown outside soviet union until results of trial were published in west in 1989 zimmer pp 37 38 recent and escalating problems caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria has stimulated a renewed interest in use of bacteriophages and phage therapy human genome project has revealed presence of numerous viral dna sequences scattered throughout human genome these sequences make up around eight per cent of human dna and appear to be remains of ancient retrovirus infections of human ancestors these pieces of dna have firmly established themselves in human dna most of this dna is no longer functional but some of these friendly viruses have brought with them novel genes that are important in human development baker p 37 carl zimmer ancient viruses once foes may now serve as friends new york times april 23 2015 viruses have
