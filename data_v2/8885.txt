prussian war prussia created north german confederation and prussian navy became north german federal navy to protect expanded scale of north german maritime commerce and overseas interests new federal navy began to examine plans to acquire foreign stations where warships could be based initial plans called for bases in east asia and central america or caribbean but chancellor otto von bismarck was averse to provoking a conflict with united states over its monroe doctrine and so instructed ship s captain kk franz kinderling to avoid appearance of having colonial designs on region before augusta could depart however repairs were necessary to reinforce hull and patch leaks work was done in bremerhaven on 11 december she left port but she had to stop in portsmouth great britain after having been damaged in a storm in north sea repairs there lasted until february 1868 when she could resume her voyage to central america she stopped in funchal madiera before crossing atlantic

regular french armies and formation of french third republic british and united states arms manufacturers began to ship weapons to arm new french armies being formed and so german command decided to embark on a strategy of commerce raiding to interdict arms shipments augusta was recommissioned for this purpose on 26 october and owing to lack of manpower crew from nymphe had to be transferred to activate ship a shortage of coal delayed her sortie until 12 december she remained in swedish territorial waters to avoid danish vessels that might warn france of her departure flying flag of a

inspected three neutral vessels on 7 january she proceeded to vigo spain to replenish her coal supply ship s commander inexplicably did not order coaling to begin until 12 january which allowed french warships to arrive and blockade harbor first of which was ironclad three more vessels arrived in following days trapping augusta in neutral harbor armistice of versailles was signed on 28 january

there to protect german interests she arrived there on 29 january and over next three months situation calmed to extent that gunboats and were sufficient for task as a result augusta left and after visiting lisbon portugal from 5 to 25 may returned to central american waters in july augusta visited haiti though her stay was interrupted by unrest in uruguay that necessitated her presence in august and september she went to colombia for same reason on 25 november her sister ship arrived to replace her on central american station augusta began voyage back to germany and arrived in
