mexico setting was later changed to new york city which tadjedin described as a place where diverse characters could come together she clarified that location change did not affect plot because she

working couple rather than a very rarefied couple in new york though she settled for larger set due to time constraints in reference to film s overall look she wanted to represent everyday life in
