page report in november 2009 that aimed to restore britain s consent based model of policing o connor wrote that there had been a hardening of police attitudes with officers believing that proportionality meant reciprocity deployment of officers in riot gear had become a routine response to lawful protest largely result of an ignorance of law and a lack of leadership from home office and police chiefs officers were being trained to use their riot shields as weapons police forces across country differed in their training equipment they had access to and their understanding of law

director of cps announced in 2010 that there would be no prosecution because of disagreement between pathologists in april 2010 guardian published an open letter from several public figures asking crown prosecution service cps to proceed with a prosecution or explain its position a year on we still wait for answers about ian tomlinson s death guardian 1 april 2010 in july that year keir starmer director of cps announced that there would be no prosecution because of medical disagreement between three pathologists starmer said there was enough evidence for an assault charge but six month deadline for that had expired area of conflict concerned patel s finding during first autopsy of intraabdominal fluid blood about 3l with small blood clot this was interpreted by other medical experts to mean that patel had found three litres of blood in tomlinson s abdomen starmer said this would have been around 60 percent of tomlinson s blood volume a highly significant indicator of cause of death in april 2010 patel introduced an ambiguity in a second report for cps saying he had found intraabdominal fluid blood about 3l with small blood clot emphasis added ambiguity had to be clarified because second and third pathologists had relied in part on patel s original notes to form their views patel was interviewed twice by cps according to starmer patel maintained that total fluid was somewhat in excess of three litres but that it was mainly ascites a substance which forms in a damaged liver which had been stained with blood he had not retained fluid nor had he sampled it in order to ascertain proportion of blood because he said he had handled blood all his professional life and he knew that this was not blood but blood stained ascites patel also said he had found no internal rupture that would have led to this degree of blood loss cps statement on death of ian tomlinson guardian 22 july 2010 several conclusions were drawn from discussions between patel and cps starmer said a because patel had not retained or sampled three litres of fluid no firm conclusions could be drawn about nature of it b for tomlinson s death to have resulted so quickly from blood loss there would have to have been a significant internal rupture c patel found no such rupture d later also found no visible rupture and e because patel was only person to have examined tomlinson s intact body he was in best position to judge nature of fluid and whether there was a rupture that could have caused it this meant that patel s evidence would significantly undermine evidence of second and third pathologists nathaniel cary second pathologist objected to cps s decision cary told guardian that push had caused a haemorrhage to tomlinson s abdomen and haemorrhage caused him to collapse cary said tomlinson was vulnerable to this because he had liver disease cps had erred in dismissing a charge of actual bodily harm abh in his view in a letter to tomlinson s family cps described tomlinson s injuries as relatively minor and therefore insufficient to support such a charge but cary told guardian injuries were not relatively minor he sustained quite a large area of bruising such injuries are consistent with a baton strike which could amount to abh it s extraordinary if that s not abh i would like to know what is vikram dodd paul lewis advice to charge police officer over ian tomlinson death ignored guardian 23 july 2010 inquest inquest was opened and adjourned in april 2009 city of london coroner paul matthews expressed concern about whether he had appropriate expertise and peter

on tomlinson he said readings were inconsistent with an arrhythmic heart attack but consistent with death from internal bleeding pathologist nat carey concurred regarding cause of death graeme alexander a said that in his opinion tomlinson had died of internal bleeding as a result of trauma to liver after fall he told court that tomlinson had been suffering from serious liver disease which would have made him susceptible to collapse from internal bleeding paul lewis ian tomlinson did not die of heart attack specialist tells inquest guardian 18 april 2011 giving evidence over three days
