common firecrest regulus ignicapilla also known as firecrest is a very small passerine bird in kinglet family it breeds in most of temperate europe and northwestern africa and is partially migratory with birds from central europe wintering to south and west of their breeding range firecrests in balearic islands and north africa are widely recognised as a separate subspecies but population on madeira previously also treated as a subspecies is now treated as a distinct species madeira firecrest regulus madeirensis a fossil ancestor of firecrest has been identified from a single wing bone this kinglet is greenish above and has whitish underparts it has two white wingbars a black eye stripe and a white supercilium head crest orange in male and yellow in female is displayed during breeding and gives rise to english and scientific names for species this bird superficially resembles goldcrest which largely shares its european range but firecrest s bronze shoulders and strong face pattern are distinctive song is a repetition of high thin notes slightly lower pitched than those of its relative common firecrest breeds in broadleaved or coniferous woodland and gardens building its compact three layered nest on a tree branch seven to twelve eggs are incubated by female alone both parents feed chicks which fledge 22 24 days after hatching this kinglet is constantly on move and frequently hovers as it searches for insects to eat and in winter it is often found with flocks of tits despite some possible local declines species is not subject of significant conservation concerns owing to its large european population and an expansion of its range over last century it may be hunted and killed by birds of prey and can carry parasites it is possible that this species was original king of birds in european folklore description common firecrest is a small plump bird in length with a wingspan of and weighs it has bright olive green upperparts with a bronze coloured patch on each shoulder and whitish underparts washed with brownish grey on breast and flanks it has two white wingbars a tiny black pointed bill and brownish black legs head pattern is striking with a black eye stripe long white supercilium and a crest which is bright yellow in female and mainly orange in male sexes are very similar apart from crest colour although female is a little duller in plumage and on average slightly smaller juveniles have a grey tinge to duller upperparts and lack coloured crown other head markings are present but duller than in adult by their first winter only flight and tail feathers remain and young birds are virtually indistinguishable from adults in field this kinglet usually hops with its body held horizontally and its flight is weak and whirring with occasional quick evasive turns adult firecrests are unlikely to be confused with any other species pallas s warbler has a similar head and wing pattern but its crown stripe is pale lemon not bright yellow or orange and its supercilium is also pale yellow not bright white juvenile common firecrest might be confused with goldcrest but usually shows enough face pattern to distinguish it from its relative which has a very plain face at all ages firecrest can also be separated from pallas s warbler by warbler s pale crown stripe and yellow rump there is more likelihood of confusing juvenile firecrest with yellow browed warbler which has a similar head pattern warbler an asiatic species has pale fringes to feathers of closed wing a whitish belly and darker brown legs yellow browed warbler also lacks pale half circle present below young firecrest s eye taxonomy and systematics thumb a temporarily stunned adult male found on a pavement in lille france pattern on its head is seen clearly kinglets are a small group of birds sometimes included in old world warblers but frequently given family status especially as recent research shows that despite superficial similarities crests are phylogenetically remote from warblers names of family regulidae and its only genus regulus are derived from latin regulus a diminutive of rex a king and refer to characteristic orange or yellow crests of adult kinglets common firecrest was first formally described by dutch zoologist coenraad jacob temminck in 1820 as sylvia ignicapilla relatively late identification of this common european bird arose from a perception that it was just a variety of goldcrest species name is derived from latin ignis fire and hair binomial is frequently given as r due to a misunderstanding of latin grammar there are two widely recognised subspecies of common firecrest nominate r i ignicapilla and mediterranean r i balearicus jordans 1923 latter form is found on balearic islands and in north africa and is slightly paler below and greyer above than nominate subspecies other subspecies have been claimed including southeastern r i caucasicus north african r i and crimean r i tauricus madeira firecrest r madeirensis was formerly also considered to be a subspecies of common firecrest but phylogenetic analysis based on cytochrome b gene showed that madeiran form is distinct at species level cytochrome b gene divergence between madeira firecrest and european bird is 8 5 comparable with divergence level between other recognised regulus species such as 9 between goldcrest and golden crowned kinglet martens jochen martin family regulidae kinglets firecrests pp 330 349 in island form also differs in morphology and vocalisations proposed split was accepted by association of european rarities committees aerc in 2003 although some authorities like clements checklist have not yet recognised new species flamecrest or taiwan firecrest regulus of taiwan has sometimes been viewed as a race of common firecrest however flamecrest s territorial song which resembles those of himalayan races of goldcrest and genetic data indicate that flamecrest is closely related to himalayan goldcrest and only distantly to two firecrest species kinglets on canary islands which were also considered to be close to firecrests have now been shown to comprise two subspecies of goldcrest fossils there are a few pleistocene 2 6 million to 12 000 years ago records from europe and israel of extant regulus species mostly goldcrests or unidentifiable to species but also a spanish specimen of firecrest a left ulna from bulgaria was identified as belonging to a fossil species regulus bulgaricus from 2 6 1 95 mya this appears to be ancestral to common firecrest with goldcrest diverging from this lineage in middle pleistocene distribution and habitat thumb cork woodland is favoured for breeding common firecrest breeds in lowland broadleaf forest preferring cork oak and alder where available otherwise beech and holly it also uses mixed broadleaf and conifer woodland and stands of spruce european silver fir cedar and pines often with undergrowth of juniper ivy and wild rose in drier mediterranean habitats it is found in conifers evergreen oak and mixed woodlands up to unlike more specialised birds such as eurasian nuthatch and common both of which forage on trunks crests do not need large woodlands and their population density is independent of forest size in winter it is less reliant on conifers than goldcrest moving from forest to fringes and scrub it occurs singly or in pairs spending much time in tree canopy although frequently venturing into bushes and other lower vegetation this species can thrive in fairly urban areas provided that suitable habitat is available in parks or large gardens population densities in gardens can be comparable with maximum levels found in natural habitats nominate subspecies breeds in europe from southern england france spain and portugal east to belarus northwestern ukraine and greece and north to baltic and southern latvia there are isolated populations east of main range in abkhazia crimea and turkey its range lies between july isotherms southern birds are largely resident unlike northern and eastern populations which are migratory wintering mainly in mediterranean areas and far west of europe from portugal north to britain r i balearicus is resident in balearic islands and northern parts of morocco algeria and tunisia this species has been recorded as a vagrant from norway finland estonia cyprus egypt and lebanon behaviour and ecology breeding thumb singing in a conifer tree in galicia spain thumb eggs of regulus ignicapilla mhnt common firecrest is monogamous male sings during breeding season often with its crest raised and has a display which involves pointing its bill at another bird showing crest and strong face pattern this differs from display of plainer faced goldcrest which bows its head to emphasise crest breeding territory is about and may overlap with neighbouring goldcrest territories firecrests will sometimes defend their territories against goldcrests with crest raised and a great deal of wing fluttering but amount of actual competition between species may not be very great a spanish study suggested that territorial conflicts between species and other phenomena like males singing mixed or alternating songs were most frequent when one species locally far outnumbered other in other circumstances two kinglets learned to ignore each other s songs in his courtship display male firecrest raises his crest points it towards his mate and hovers over her before mating takes place nest is often suspended from a hanging branch usually at no great altitude although eric simms reported nests at heights from firecrests may favour breeding close to northern goshawk nests that large bird will prey on potential predators of firecrest such as eurasian sparrowhawks and nest robbers like grey squirrels eurasian jays and great spotted woodpeckers as is typical for family nest is a closed cup built in three layers with a small entrance hole near its top nest s outer layer is made from moss small twigs cobwebs and lichen spider webs also being used to attach nest to thin branches that support it middle layer is moss and this is lined with feathers up to 3 000 and hair nest is smaller deeper and more compact than that of goldcrest about across and deep with a wall thickness of about nest is constructed by female alone although male will accompany female while she builds nest over a period of a few days to three weeks laying starts in western europe at end of april and in east of range in late may second clutches which are common commence in june to july eggs are pink with very indistinct reddish markings at broad end unlike those of madeira firecrest which are described as like those of a phylloscopus warbler white with some brown speckles eggs are and weigh of which 5 is shell clutch size in europe is 7 12 eggs but probably smaller in northwest africa female incubates eggs for 14 5 to 16 5 days to hatching and broods chicks which fledge eight to ten days later both parents feed chicks and fledged young this species becomes sexually mature after one year and has a life expectancy of less than two years although their ranges overlap substantially hybridisation between goldcrests and firecrests seems to be prevented by differences in courtship rituals and different facial patterns even in aviary studies in which a female goldcrest was given an artificial eyestripe to facilitate mating with a male firecrest chicks were never raised by mixed pair and appeared to be poorly adapted compared to parent species feeding upright thumb firecrest parents mainly feed young chicks during their first four days of life with springtails average length 4 mm after which time larger food items are given as chicks grow all species of kinglet are almost exclusively insectivorous preying on small arthropods with soft cuticles such as springtails aphids and spiders they also feed on cocoons and eggs of spiders and insects and occasionally take pollen all species will hover to catch flying insects although similarly sized firecrest and goldcrest are often found together there are a number of factors that reduce direct competition for food common firecrests prefer larger prey than goldcrests although both will take trapped insects from spider webs on autumn migration firecrests will also eat large orb web spiders on rare occasions kinglets have been found stuck in a spider web either unable to move or dead common firecrest feeds in trees exploiting mainly upper surface of branches in coniferous habitat and of leaves in deciduous trees this is in contrast to goldcrest which frequently feeds on undersides of branches and leaves in winter flocks of common firecrests cover a given distance about three times faster than do goldcrests and ignore smallest prey items preferred by their relative large invertebrates are killed by beating them repeatedly against a branch differences in behaviour are facilitated by subtle morphological differences firecrests have broader bills with longer rictal bristles which protect a bird s eye from food items it is trying to capture and these features reflect larger prey taken by species firecrest s less forked tail may reflect its longer episodes of hovering while hunting firecrests forage more often while standing and have a foot better adapted for perching whereas goldcrest s longer hind toe reflects its habit of moving vertically along branches while feeding it also has a deep grooves in soles of its feet capable of gripping individual needles while firecrests have a smoother underside to foot young common firecrests are fed almost exclusively with springtails larger food items are not accepted and spiders are occasionally regurgitated from fifth day onwards nestling diet includes aphids and a high amount of snail shells latter being needed for bone growth after second week food includes larger moths and caterpillars as well as various arthropods typically avoided by adults such as harvestmen earwigs and centipedes in winter firecrest joins loose flocks of other wanderers such as tits and warblers this kinglet like other species that prefer mixed species foraging flocks in winter hunts over a greater range of heights and vegetation types than when feeding alone for species that tend to feed in flocks foraging success while in a flock was about twice that for solitary birds in some areas wintering birds have developed habit of coming to feeding stations and bird tables for fatty food sometimes with goldcrests or warblers such as common and kinglet s digestive system is adapted to an entirely insectivorous diet whereas sylvia warblers include fruit in their autumn diet a spanish study compared that genus with insectivorous firecrest and phylloscopus warblers results showed that relative to body weight insect eaters had shorter intestines but longer gut passage times than sylvia species insect eaters are also generally slightly smaller than omnivores voice contact call is three or four thin high notes similar to that of goldcrest but slightly lower in pitch zit zit zit rather than see see see song is a succession of call notes in a longer and slightly more varied sequence typically there are 11 14 notes per song becoming louder and faster with final three notes slightly different from preceding ones zit zit zit zit zit zit zit zit zit zit zirt zirt zirt song usually lasts 0 5 2 5 seconds shorter than 3 5 4 0 seconds for goldcrest and may be repeated up to eight times a minute in may and june singing is most frequent after dawn but continues less often throughout day later in breeding season song becomes largely confined to morning song of mediterranean subspecies of common firecrest r i balearicus is very similar to that of nominate form but one factor in separating madeiran firecrest from common firecrest is that island bird s song is divided into three phrases two of them consisting of modified display and anger calls its display calls also use a larger frequency range and more harmonics than those of continental subspecies male goldcrests and madeiran firecrests sometimes show a territorial response to recordings of songs or calls of common firecrest but reverse is apparently not true because songs of common firecrest are simpler in construction than those of its relatives predators and parasites upright thumb eurasian sparrowhawk is a major predator of small songbirds throughout firecrest s range main predator of small woodland birds is eurasian sparrowhawk which takes avian prey as up to 98 of its diet tawny owl relies more on mammalian catches but about one third of its food is forest birds eggs and young may be taken by grey squirrels eurasian jays and great spotted woodpeckers firecrest appears to be virtually unknown as a host of common cuckoo a widespread european brood parasite invasive argentine ant linepithema is common in mediterranean area and reduces arthropod numbers by removing most native ant species reduction in prey items is greatest in tree canopy and has a greater effect on species like firecrest that feed high in foliage less food is available for chicks and parents have to spend more time foraging data on specific parasites of firecrest is lacking but widespread moorhen flea dasypsyllus gallinulae has been recorded in a related regulus species a number of feather mites have been recorded in genus including proctophyllodes on firecrest these mites live on fungi growing on feathers retrieved 22 october 2010 fungi found on plumage may feed on keratin of outer feathers or on feather oil status common firecrest expanded its range in nineteenth and twentieth centuries colonising northern france followed by first breeding in netherlands in 1928 and denmark in 1961 in britain it had only been recorded a handful of times by 1839 but first bred in 1962 and is now widespread as a breeding bird in much of southern england milder winters have meant that more birds can winter further north and therefore breeding range can expand without incurring risks involved in lengthy migrations fiedler wolfgang 2003 recent changes in migratory behaviour of birds a compilation of field observations and ringing data pp 21 29 in a population was found in northern morocco in 1986 population growth may be limited by lack of suitable habitat and there may be local declines due to loss of conifers through storms or replacement by plantations of native deciduous trees there may also be localised losses in areas of high heavy metal pollution which particularly affects ground feeders like thrushes and conifer foliage including both european regulus species conifer specialists suffer from loss and poor quality of needles and consequent decrease in abundance of their invertebrate food common firecrest has a large range and a population estimated at 10 30 million individuals most in europe population is believed to be stable in absence of evidence for any declines or serious threats and it is therefore classed as least concern on iucn red list in culture aristotle and pliny relate legend of a contest amongst birds to see who should be their king title to be awarded to one that could fly highest initially it looked as though eagle would win easily but as he began to tire a small bird which had hidden under eagle s tail feathers emerged to fly even higher and claimed title aristotle history of animals 9 11 pliny natural history 10 74 following from this legend in much european folklore wren has been described as king of birds or as a flame bearer however these terms were also applied to regulus species fiery crowns of goldcrest and firecrest making them more likely to be original bearers of these titles and because of legend s reference to smallest of birds becoming king title was probably transferred to equally tiny wren confusion was assisted by similarity and consequent interchangeability of ancient greek words for wren basileus basileus king and crests basiliskos basiliskos kinglet in english association between firecrest and eurasian wren was reinforced by kinglet s old name of fire
