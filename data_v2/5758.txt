which was often critical of supreme court precedents he felt bound as a lower court judge to follow scalia s opinions drew attention of reagan administration officials who according to new york times liked virtually everything they saw and listed him as a leading supreme court prospect supreme court of united states 1986 2016 in 1986 chief justice warren burger informed white house of his intent to retire reagan first decided to nominate associate justice william rehnquist to become chief justice that choice meant that reagan would also have to choose a nominee to fill rehnquist s seat as associate justice attorney general edwin meese who advised reagan on choice seriously considered only bork and scalia feeling that this might well be reagan s last opportunity to pick a supreme court justice president and his advisers chose scalia over bork many factors influenced decision reagan wanted to appoint first italian american justice in addition scalia was ten years younger and would likely serve longer on court scalia also had advantage of not having bork s paper trail elder judge had written controversial articles about individual rights scalia was called to white house and accepted reagan s nomination bork was nominated for supreme court following year but his nomination was rejected by senate when senate judiciary committee hearings on scalia s nomination opened in august 1986 he faced a committee that had just argued over rehnquist nomination witnesses and democratic senators contended that before becoming a judge rehnquist had engaged in activities designed to discourage minorities from voting committee members had little taste for a second battle over scalia and were in any event reluctant to oppose first italian american supreme court nominee judge was not pressed heavily on controversial issues such as abortion or civil rights scalia who attended hearing with his wife and nine children seated behind him found time for a humorous exchange with democratic ohio senator howard metzenbaum whom he had defeated in a tennis match in as nominee put it a case of my integrity overcoming my judgment scalia met no opposition from committee full senate debated scalia s nomination only briefly confirming him 98 0 on september 17 1986 and thereby making him first italian american justice that vote followed rehnquist s confirmation as chief justice by

so effective governmental structure and powers separation of powers thumb left upright 1 15 u s supreme court justice antonin scalia testified before senate judiciary committee about separation of powers and checks and balances of u s government it was scalia s view that clear lines of separation among legislative executive and judicial branches follow directly from constitution with no branch allowed to exercise powers granted to another branch in his early days on court he authored a powerful and solitary dissent in 1988 s morrison v olson in which court s majority upheld independent counsel law scalia s thirty page draft dissent surprised justice harry blackmun for its emotional content blackmun felt it could be cut down to ten pages if scalia omitted screaming scalia indicated that law was an unwarranted encroachment on executive branch by legislative he warned frequently an issue of this sort will come before court clad so to speak in sheep s clothing but this wolf comes as a wolf 1989 case of mistretta v united states challenged united states sentencing commission an independent body within judicial branch whose members some of whom were federal judges were removable only for good cause petitioner argued that arrangement violated separation of powers and that united states sentencing guidelines promulgated by commission were invalid eight justices joined in majority opinion written by blackmun upholding guidelines as constitutional scalia dissented stating that issuance of guidelines was a lawmaking function that congress could not delegate and dubbed commission a sort of junior varsity congress in 1996 congress passed line item veto act which allowed president to cancel items from an appropriations bill a bill authorizing spending once passed into law statute was challenged following year matter rapidly reached supreme court which struck down law as violating presentment clause of constitution which governs what president is permitted to do with a bill once it has passed both houses of congress scalia dissented seeing no presentment clause difficulties and feeling that act did not violate separation of powers scalia indicated he felt that authorizing president to cancel an appropriation was no different from allowing him to spend an appropriation at his discretion which had long been accepted as constitutional detainee cases thumb

souter with scalia fourth from right in 2004 in rasul v bush court held that federal courts had jurisdiction to hear habeas corpus petitions brought by detainees at guantanamo bay detainment camp scalia accused majority of spring ing a trap on executive by ruling that it could hear cases involving persons at guantanamo when no federal court had ever ruled that it had authority to hear cases involving people there scalia joined by justice john paul stevens also dissented in 2004 case of hamdi v rumsfeld involving hamdi an american citizen detained in united states on allegation he was an enemy combatant court held that although congress had authorized hamdi s detention fifth amendment due process guarantees give a citizen held in united states as an enemy combatant hamdi right to contest that detention before a neutral decision maker scalia wrote that authorization for use of military force against terrorists could not be read to suspend habeas corpus and that court faced with legislation by congress that did not grant president power to detain hamdi was trying to make everything come out right in march 2006 scalia gave a talk at university of fribourg in switzerland where he was asked about detainee rights he responded give me a break i had a son on that battlefield and they were shooting at my son and i m not about to give this man who was captured in a war a full jury trial i mean it s crazy although scalia was not referring to any particular individual supreme court was about to consider case of salim ahmed hamdan supposed driver to osama bin laden who was challenging military commissions at guantanamo bay a group of retired military officers that supported hamdan s position asked scalia to recuse himself or step aside from hearing case which he declined to do court held 5 3 in hamdan v rumsfeld that federal courts had jurisdiction to consider hamdan s claims scalia in dissent contended that any court authority to consider hamdan s petition had been eliminated by jurisdiction stripping detainee treatment act of 2005 federalism in federalism cases pitting powers of federal government against those of states scalia often took states positions in 1997 supreme court considered case of printz v united states a challenge to certain provisions of brady handgun violence prevention act which required chief law enforcement officers of localities in states to perform certain duties in printz scalia wrote court s majority decision supreme court ruled unconstitutional provision that imposed those duties as violating tenth amendment which reserves to states and to people those powers not granted to federal government in 2005 scalia concurred in gonzales v raich which read commerce clause to hold that congress could ban use of marijuana even when states approve its use for medicinal purposes scalia opined that commerce clause together with necessary and proper clause permitted regulation in addition scalia felt that congress may regulate intrastate activities if doing so is a necessary part of a more general regulation of interstate commerce he based that decision on v which he now wrote expanded commerce clause beyond all reason scalia rejected existence of negative commerce clause doctrine pdf via university of michigan law school scholarship repository calling it a judicial fraud scalia took a broad view of eleventh amendment which bars certain lawsuits against states in federal courts in his 1989 dissent in pennsylvania v union gas co scalia stated that there was no intent on part of framers to have states surrender any sovereign immunity and that case that provoked eleventh amendment chisholm v georgia came as a surprise to them professor ralph rossum who wrote a survey of scalia s constitutional views suggests that justice s view of eleventh amendment was actually contradictory to language of amendment individual rights abortion scalia argued that there is no constitutional right to abortion and that if people desire legalized abortion a law should be passed to accomplish it scalia wrote in his dissenting opinion in 1992 case of planned parenthood v casey scalia repeatedly called upon his colleagues to strike down roe v wade scalia hoped to find five votes to strike down roe in 1989 case of webster v reproductive health services but was not successful in doing so justice sandra day o connor authored decision of court allowing abortion regulations at issue in case to stand but not overriding roe scalia concurred only in part scalia wrote justice o connor s assertion that a fundamental rule of judicial restraint requires us to avoid reconsidering roe cannot be taken seriously he noted we can now look forward to at least another term of carts full of mail from public and streets full of demonstrators court returned to issue of abortion in 2000 case of stenberg v carhart in which it invalidated a nebraska statute outlawing partial birth abortion justice stephen breyer wrote for court that law was unconstitutional because it did not allow an exception for health of woman scalia dissented comparing stenberg case to two of most reviled cases in supreme court history i am optimistic enough to believe that one day stenberg v carhart will be assigned its rightful place in history of this court s jurisprudence beside korematsu and dred scott method of killing a human child proscribed by this statute is so horrible that most clinical description of it evokes a shudder of revulsion in 2007 court upheld a federal statute banning partial birth abortion in gonzales v carhart university of chicago law professor geoffrey r stone a former colleague of scalia s criticized gonzales stating that religion had influenced outcome because all five justices in majority were catholic whereas dissenters were protestant or jewish this angered scalia to such an extent that he stated he would not speak at university of chicago as long as stone was there race gender and sexual orientation scalia generally voted to strike down laws that make distinctions by race gender or sexual orientation in 1989 he concurred with court s judgment in city of richmond v j a co in which court applied strict scrutiny to a city program requiring a certain percentage of contracts to go to minorities and struck down program scalia did not join majority opinion however he disagreed with o connor s opinion for court that states and localities could institute race based programs if they identified past discrimination and if programs were designed to remedy past racism five years later in constructors inc v pena he concurred in court s judgment and in part with opinion that extended strict scrutiny to federal programs scalia noted in that matter his view that government can never have a compelling interest in making up for past discrimination by racial preferences in 2003 case of grutter v bollinger involving racial preferences in university of michigan s law school scalia mocked court majority s finding that school was entitled to continue using race as a factor in admissions to promote diversity and to increase cross racial understanding scalia noted scalia argued that laws that make distinctions between genders should be subjected to intermediate scrutiny requiring that gender classification be substantially related to important government objectives when in 1996 court upheld a suit brought by a woman who wished to enter virginia military institute in case of united states v virginia scalia filed a lone lengthy dissent scalia said that court in requiring virginia to show an extremely persuasive justification for single sex admission policy had redefined intermediate scrutiny in such a way that makes it indistinguishable from strict scrutiny in one of final decisions of burger court court ruled in 1986 in bowers v hardwick that homosexual sodomy was not protected by right of privacy and could be criminally prosecuted by states in 1995 however that ruling was effectively gutted by romer v evans which struck down a colorado state constitutional amendment passed by popular vote that forbade laws being extended to sexual orientation scalia dissented from opinion by justice kennedy believing that bowers had protected right of states to pass such measures and that colorado amendment was not discriminatory but merely prevented homosexuals from gaining favored status under colorado law scalia later said of romer and supreme court said yes it is unconstitutional on basis of i don t know sexual preference clause of bill of rights presumably and liberals loved it and conservatives gnashed their teeth in 2003 bowers was formally overruled by lawrence v texas from which scalia dissented according to mark v in his survey of rehnquist court during oral argument in case scalia seemed so intent on making state s argument for it that chief justice intervened according to his biographer joan scalia ridiculed majority in his dissent for being so ready to cast aside bowers when many of same justices had refused to overturn roe in planned parenthood v casey in march 2009 openly gay congressman barney frank described him as a maureen dowd described scalia in a 2003 column as archie bunker in a high backed chair in an op ed for new york times federal appeals judge richard posner and georgia state university law professor eric segall described as radical scalia s positions on homosexuality reflecting an apparent belief that religious stances supposedly held by majority of us citizens should take precedence over constitution and characterizing scalia s political ideal as ing on majoritarian theocracy in 2013 case of hollingsworth v perry which involved a california ballot initiative known as proposition 8 that amended california state constitution to ban same sex marriage scalia voted with majority to uphold a lower court decision overturning ban decision was based on appellants lack of standing to appeal and not on substantive issue of constitutionality of proposition 8 also in 2013 scalia dissented from majority opinion in united states v windsor in windsor court held that restricting u s federal interpretation of marriage and spouse to apply only to opposite sex unions by section 3 of defense of marriage act doma is unconstitutional under due process clause of fifth amendment united states v windsor retrieved june 26 2013 scalia s dissent which was joined in full by justice thomas and in part by chief justice roberts windsor scalia j dissenting slip op opened scalia argued that judgment effectively characterized opponents of same sex marriage as enemies of human race he argued that court s ruling would affect state bans on same sex marriage as well scalia concluded by saying that supreme court has cheated both sides robbing winners of an honest victory and losers of peace that comes from a fair defeat in 2015 scalia dissented from majority opinion in obergefell v hodges in which court ruled that fundamental right to marry was guaranteed to same sex couples by both due process clause and equal protection clause of fourteenth amendment in his dissent scalia stated that court s decision effectively robs people of freedom to govern themselves noting that a rigorous debate on same sex marriage had been taking place and that by deciding issue nationwide democratic process had been unduly halted obergefell v hodges no 14 556 slip op at 2 u s june 26 2015 scalia j dissenting addressing claimed fourteenth amendment violation scalia asserted that because a same sex marriage ban would not have been considered unconstitutional at time of fourteenth amendment s adoption such bans are not unconstitutional today obergefell slip op at 4 scalia j dissenting he claimed there was no basis for court s decision striking down legislation that fourteenth amendment does not expressly forbid and directly attacked majority opinion for lacking even a thin veneer of law lastly scalia faulted actual writing in opinion for diminish ing this court s reputation for clear thinking and sober analysis and for descend ing from disciplined legal reasoning of john marshall and joseph story to mystical aphorisms of fortune cookie obergefell slip op at 9 8 n 22 scalia j dissenting criminal law upright 1 15 thumb alt scalia wearing a beige jacket over shirt and tie shakes hands with jurij of european election law association while looking forward towards camera right scalia right at harvard law school on november 30 2006 scalia believed death penalty to be constitutional he dissented in decisions that hold death penalty unconstitutional as applied to certain groups such as those who were under age of 18 at time of offense in thompson v oklahoma 1988 he dissented from court s ruling that death penalty could not be applied to those aged 15 at time of offense and following year authored court s opinion in stanford v kentucky sustaining death penalty for those who killed at age 16 however in 2005 court overturned stanford in roper v simmons and scalia again dissented mocking majority s claims that a national consensus had emerged against execution of those who killed while underage noting that less than half of states that permitted death penalty prohibited it for underage killers he castigated majority for including in their count states that had abolished death penalty entirely stating that doing so was rather like including old order in a consumer preference poll on electric car of course they don t like it but that sheds no light whatever on point at issue in 2002 in atkins v virginia court ruled death penalty unconstitutional as applied to mentally retarded scalia dissented stating that it would not have been considered cruel or unusual to execute mildly mentally retarded at time of 1791 adoption of bill of rights and that court had failed to show that a national consensus had formed against practice scalia strongly disfavored court s ruling in miranda v arizona which held that a confession by an arrested suspect who had not been advised of his rights was inadmissible in court and he voted to overrule miranda in 2000 case of dickerson v united states but was in a minority of two with justice clarence thomas calling miranda decision a milestone of judicial overreaching scalia stated that court should not fear to correct its mistakes although in many areas scalia s approach was unfavorable to criminal defendants he took side of defendants in matters involving confrontation clause of sixth amendment which guarantees defendants right to confront their accusers in multiple cases scalia wrote against laws that allowed alleged victims of child abuse to testify behind screens or by closed circuit television in a 2009 case scalia wrote majority opinion in melendez diaz v massachusetts holding that defendants must have opportunity to confront lab technicians in drug cases and that a certificate of analysis is not enough to prove a substance was a drug scalia maintained that every element of an offense that helps determine sentence must be either admitted by defendant or found by a jury under sixth amendment s jury guarantee in 2000 case of v new jersey scalia wrote court s majority opinion that struck down a state statute that allowed trial judge to increase sentence if judge found offense was a hate crime scalia found procedure impermissible because whether it was a hate crime had not been decided by jury in 2004 he wrote for court in blakely v washington striking down washington state s sentencing guidelines on similar grounds dissenters in blakely foresaw that scalia would use case to attack federal sentencing guidelines which he had failed to strike down in mistretta and they proved correct as scalia led a five member majority in united states v booker which made those guidelines no longer mandatory for federal judges to follow they remained advisory in 2001 case of v united states scalia wrote court s opinion in a 5 4 decision that cut across ideological lines scalia was joined by justices thomas souter breyer and ginsburg that decision found thermal imaging of a home to be an unreasonable search under fourth amendment court struck down a conviction for marijuana manufacture based on a search warrant issued after such scans were conducted which showed that garage was considerably hotter than rest of house because of indoor growing lights applying that fourth amendment prohibition on unreasonable search and seizure to arrest scalia dissented from court s 1991 decision in county of riverside v mclaughlin allowing a 48 hour delay before a person arrested without a warrant is taken before a magistrate on ground that at time of adoption of fourth amendment an arrested person was to be taken before a magistrate as quickly as practicable in a 1990 first amendment case r a v v st paul scalia wrote court s opinion striking down a st paul minnesota hate speech ordinance in a prosecution for burning a cross scalia noted let there be no mistake about our belief that burning a cross in someone s front yard is reprehensible but st paul has sufficient means at its disposal to prevent such behavior without adding first amendment to fire second amendment in 2008 court considered a challenge to gun laws in district of columbia scalia wrote majority opinion in district of columbia v heller which found an individual right to own a firearm under second amendment scalia traced word militia found in second amendment as it would have been understood at time of its ratification stating that it then meant body of all citizens court upheld heller s claim to own a firearm in district scalia s opinion for heller court was criticized by liberals and applauded by conservatives seventh circuit judge richard posner disagreed with scalia s opinion stating that second amendment creates no right to private possession of guns posner called scalia s opinion faux originalism and a historicizing glaze on personal values and policy preferences in october 2008 scalia stated that court s originalists needed to show only that at time second amendment was ratified right to bear arms did not have an exclusively military context and that they were successful in so showing litigation and standing following death of scalia paul barrett writing for bloomberg businessweek reported that translating into liberal scalia changed rules for who could sue issue elevated recognition of scalia as a notable influence on establishing and determining conditions under which cases could be brought to trial and for litigation and by whom such litigation could take place david rivkin from conservative standpoint said he scalia did more to clarify and limit bounds and scope of judicial power than any supreme court justice in history particularly in area of standing and class actions scalia indicated his long held position from time of his 1983 law review article titled doctrine of standing as an essential element of separation of powers as summarized by barrett he scalia wrote that courts had misappropriated authority from other branches of government by allowing too many people to sue corporations and government agencies especially in environmental cases in a practical sense scalia brought to attention of court authority to restrict standing in class action suits in which litigants may be defined in descriptive terms rather than as well defined and unambiguous litigants paul barrett justice for big guys bloomberg news weekly feb 15 2016 p13 other cases scalia concurred in 1990 case of v director missouri department of health in which family of a woman in a vegetative state sought to have her feeding tube removed so she would die believing that to have been her wish court found for state of missouri requiring clear and convincing evidence of such a desire scalia stated that court should have remained away from dispute and that issues are not better known to nine justices of this court any better than they are known to nine people picked at random from kansas city telephone directory scalia joined majority per curiam opinion in 2000 case of bush v gore which effectively ended recounts of ballots in florida following 2000 us presidential election and also both concurred separately and joined rehnquist s concurrence in 2007 he said of case i and my court owe no apology whatever for bush v gore we did right thing so there get over it it s so old by now during an interview on charlie rose show he defended court s action thumb right scalia in 2010 legal philosophy and approach judicial performance during oral argument before court scalia asked more questions and made more comments than any other justice a 2005 study found that he provoked laughter more often than any of his colleagues did his goal during oral arguments was to get across his position to other justices university of kansas social psychologist lawrence wrote of justice he communicates a sense of urgency on bench and his style is forever forceful after chief justice john roberts joined court in 2005 he took to quizzing lawyers in a manner similar to scalia s and sometimes two questioned counsel in seeming coordination dahlia of slate described scalia s technique scalia wrote numerous opinions from start of his career on supreme court during his tenure he wrote more concurring opinions than any other justice and only two justices have written more dissents according to kevin ring who compiled a book of scalia s dissenting and concurring opinions his opinions are highly readable his entertaining writing style can make even most mundane areas of law interesting conor clarke of slate comments on scalia s written opinions especially his dissents at supreme court justices meet after case is briefed and argued and they vote on result task of writing opinion is assigned by chief justice or if chief justice is in minority or not participating by senior justice in majority after assignment justices generally communicate about a case by sending notes and draft opinions to one other s chambers in give and take of opinion writing scalia did not compromise his views in order to attract five votes for a majority unlike late justice william j brennan jr who would accept less than what he wanted in order to gain a partial victory scalia known to his friends and colleagues as nino attempted to influence his colleagues by sending them ninograms short memorandums aimed at trying to get them to include his views in their opinions in an october 2013 issue of new york magazine scalia revealed that he scanned wall street journal and washington times got most of his news from talk radio and did not read new york times or washington post latter he described as shrilly liberal statutory and constitutional interpretation thumb left alt an elderly white haired man in judicial robes swears in a middle aged man in a suit as several people look on judge and mrs scalia left and president reagan right watch as chief justice warren burger swears william rehnquist in as next chief justice september 26 1986 scalia was a textualist in statutory interpretation believing that ordinary meaning of a statute should govern in 1998 scalia vociferously opposed idea of a living constitution or power of judiciary to modify meaning of constitutional provisions to adapt them to changing times scalia warned that if one accepted that constitutional standards should evolve with a maturing society risk of assessing evolving standards is that it is all too easy to believe that evolution has culminated in one s own views he compared constitution to statutes he contended were not understood to change their meaning through time constitutional amendments such as 1868 fourteenth amendment according to scalia were to be interpreted based on their meaning at time of ratification scalia was often asked how that approach justified result in 1954 case of brown v board of education which held that segregated schools were unconstitutional and which relied on fourteenth amendment for result scalia responded to this argument in two ways he noted research by michael that persuasively establishes that this was original understanding of post civil war amendments however scalia continues by arguing that even if non originalist methods occasionally produce better results than originalism it is in no way remarkable that taking power from people and placing it instead with a judicial aristocracy can produce some creditable results that democracy might not achieve same can be said of monarchy and totalitarianism but once a nation has decided that democracy is best system of government crucial question becomes which theory of textual interpretation is compatible with democracy originalism unquestionably is non originalism by contrast imposes on society statutory prescriptions that were never democratically adopted when applied to constitution limits democratic process itself prohibiting acts that we people never ever voted to outlaw reading law interpretation of legal texts pages 87 88 in interpreting statutes scalia did not look to legislative history in 2006 case of v united states he joined majority opinion written by justice samuel alito all except one paragraph of opinion in which alito cited legislative history in a concurring opinion in that case scalia noted use of legislative history is illegitimate and ill advised in interpretation of any statute his dislike of legislative history may have been a reason that other justices have become more cautious in its use gregory maggs wrote in public interest law review in 1995 that by early 1990s legislative history was being cited in only about forty percent of supreme court cases involving interpretation of statutes and that no case of that era used legislative history as an essential reason for outcome maggs suggested scalia described himself as an originalist meaning that he interpreted united states constitution as it would have been understood when it was adopted according to scalia in 2008 it s what did words mean to people who ratified bill of rights or who ratified constitution in 2006 before george w bush appointees roberts and alito had had time to make an impact rossum wrote that scalia had failed to win converts among his conservative colleagues for his use of originalism whereas roberts and alito as younger men with an originalist approach greatly admired scalia battling for what he believed in following appointments of roberts and alito both gorsuch and kavanaugh are identified in their judicial temperament as being originalists with referred to as a stalwart originalist in tradition of scalia alana abramson president trump names new supreme court justice time magazine july 10 2018 brian bennett trump s justice time magazine july 23 2018 p 22 in a 2009 public conversation justice stephen breyer questioned scalia indicating that those who ratified fourteenth amendment did not intend to end school segregation scalia called this argument waving bloody shirt of brown and indicated that he would have joined first justice harlan s solitary dissent in plessy v ferguson 1896 case that brown overruled scalia s originalist approach came under attack from critics who viewed it as a cover for what they see as scalia s real intention to turn back some pivotal court decisions of 1960s and 70s reached by warren and burger courts ralph nader argued in 2008 that scalia s originalist philosophy was inconsistent with justice s acceptance of extension of certain constitutional rights to corporations when at time of fourteenth amendment s ratification corporations were not commonly understood to possess constitutional rights nader s view preceded court s 2010 decision in citizens united v federal election commission scalia in his concurrence in that case traced his understanding of rights of groups of individuals at time of adoption of bill of rights his argument was based on lack of an exception for groups such as corporations in free speech guarantee in bill of rights and on several examples of corporate political speech from time of adoption of bill of rights professor thomas colby of george washington university national law center argued that scalia s votes in establishment clause cases do not stem from originalist views but simply from conservative political convictions scalia responded to his critics that his
