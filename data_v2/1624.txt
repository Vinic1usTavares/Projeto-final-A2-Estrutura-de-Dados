a transitional fossil is any fossilized remains of a life form that exhibits traits common to both an ancestral group and its derived descendant group this is especially important where descendant group is sharply differentiated by gross anatomy and mode of living from ancestral group these fossils serve as a reminder that taxonomic divisions are human constructs that have been imposed in hindsight on a continuum of variation because of incompleteness of fossil record there is usually no way to know exactly how close a transitional fossil is to point of divergence therefore it cannot be assumed that transitional fossils are direct ancestors of more recent groups though they are frequently used as models for such ancestors in 1859 when charles darwin s on origin of species was first published fossil record was poorly known darwin described perceived lack of transitional fossils as most obvious and gravest objection which can be urged against my theory but explained it by relating it to extreme imperfection of geological record he noted limited collections available at that time but described available information as showing patterns that followed from his theory of descent with modification through natural selection indeed archaeopteryx was discovered just two years later in 1861 and represents a classic transitional form between earlier non avian dinosaurs and birds many more transitional fossils have been discovered since then and there is now abundant evidence of how all classes of vertebrates are related including many transitional fossils specific examples of class level transitions are tetrapods and fish birds and dinosaurs and mammals and mammal like reptiles term missing link has been used extensively in popular writings on human evolution to refer to a perceived gap in hominid evolutionary record it is most commonly used to refer to any new transitional fossil finds scientists however do not use term as it refers to a pre evolutionary view of nature evolutionary and phylogenetic taxonomy transitions in phylogenetic nomenclature thumb left traditional spindle diagram showing vertebrates classes budding off from each other transitional fossils typically represent animals from near branching points in evolutionary taxonomy prevailing form of taxonomy during much of 20th century and still used in non specialist textbooks taxa based on morphological similarity are often drawn as bubbles or spindles branching off from each other forming evolutionary trees for example see transitional forms are seen as falling between various groups in terms of anatomy having a mixture of characteristics from inside and outside newly branched clade with establishment of cladistics in 1990s relationships commonly came to be expressed in cladograms that illustrate branching of evolutionary lineages in stick like figures different so called natural or monophyletic groups form nested units and only these are given phylogenetic names while in traditional classification tetrapods and fish are seen as two different groups phylogenetically tetrapods are considered a branch of fish thus with cladistics there is no longer a transition between established groups and term transitional fossils is a misnomer differentiation occurs within groups represented as branches in cladogram in a cladistic context transitional organisms can be seen as representing early examples of a branch where not all of traits typical of previously known descendants on that branch have yet evolved such early representatives of a group are usually termed basal taxa or sister taxa depending on whether fossil organism belongs to daughter clade or not transitional versus ancestral a source of confusion is notion that a transitional form between two different taxonomic groups must be a direct ancestor of one or both groups difficulty is exacerbated by fact that one of goals of evolutionary taxonomy is to identify taxa that were ancestors of other taxa however it is almost impossible to be sure that any form represented in fossil record is a direct ancestor of any other in fact because evolution is a branching process that produces a complex bush pattern of related species rather than a linear process producing a ladder like progression and because of incompleteness of fossil record it is unlikely that any particular form represented in fossil record is a direct ancestor of any other cladistics concept of one taxonomic group being an ancestor of another and instead emphasizes identification of sister taxa that share a more recent common ancestor with one another than they do with other groups there are a few exceptional cases such as some marine plankton microfossils where fossil record is complete enough to suggest with confidence that certain fossils represent a population that was actually ancestral to a later population of a different species but in general transitional fossils are considered to have features that illustrate transitional anatomical features of actual common ancestors of different taxa rather than to be actual ancestors prominent examples archaeopteryx thumb upright archaeopteryx is one of most famous transitional fossils and gives evidence for evolution of birds from theropod dinosaurs archaeopteryx is a genus of theropod dinosaur closely related to birds since late 19th century it has been accepted by palaeontologists and celebrated in lay reference works as being oldest known bird though a study in 2011 has cast doubt on this assessment suggesting instead that it is a non avialan dinosaur closely related to origin of birds it lived in what is now southern germany in late jurassic period around 150 million years ago when europe was an archipelago in a shallow warm tropical sea much closer to equator than it is now similar in shape to a european magpie with largest individuals possibly attaining size of a raven archaeopteryx could grow to about 0 5 metres 1 6 ft in length despite its small size broad wings and inferred ability to fly or glide archaeopteryx has more in common with other small mesozoic dinosaurs than it does with modern birds in particular it shares following features with dromaeosaurs and troodontids jaws with sharp teeth three fingers with claws a long bony tail second toes killing claw feathers which suggest homeothermy and various skeletal features these features make archaeopteryx a clear candidate for a transitional fossil between dinosaurs and birds making it important in study both of dinosaurs and of origin of birds first complete specimen was announced in 1861 and ten more archaeopteryx fossils have been found since then most of eleven known fossils include impressions of feathers among oldest direct evidence of such structures moreover because these feathers take advanced form of flight feathers archaeopteryx fossils are evidence that feathers began to evolve before late jurassic australopithecus afarensis thumb 75px a afarensis walking posture hominid australopithecus afarensis represents an evolutionary transition between modern bipedal humans and their quadrupedal ape ancestors a number of traits of a afarensis skeleton strongly reflect bipedalism to extent that some researchers have suggested that bipedality evolved long before a afarensis in overall anatomy pelvis is far more human like than ape like iliac blades are short and wide sacrum is wide and positioned directly behind hip joint and there is clear evidence of a strong attachment for knee extensors implying an upright posture while pelvis is not entirely like that of a human being markedly wide or flared with laterally orientated iliac blades these features point to a structure radically remodelled to accommodate a significant degree of bipedalism femur angles in toward knee from hip this trait allows foot to fall closer to midline of body and strongly indicates habitual bipedal locomotion present day humans orangutans and spider monkeys possess this same feature feet feature adducted big toes making it difficult if not impossible to grasp branches with hindlimbs besides locomotion a afarensis also had a slightly larger brain than a modern chimpanzee closest living relative of humans and had teeth that were more human than ape like pakicetids ambulocetus cetaceans whales dolphins and porpoises are marine mammal descendants of land mammals pakicetids are an extinct family of hoofed mammals that are earliest whales whose closest sister group is indohyus from family they lived in early eocene around 53 million years ago their fossils were first discovered in north pakistan in 1979 at a river not far from shores of former tethys sea pakicetids could hear under water using enhanced bone conduction rather than depending on tympanic membranes like most land mammals this arrangement does not give directional hearing under water ambulocetus natans which lived about 49 million years ago was discovered in pakistan in 1994 it was probably amphibious and looked like a crocodile in eocene ambulocetids inhabited bays and estuaries of tethys ocean in northern pakistan fossils of ambulocetids are always found in near shore shallow marine deposits associated with abundant marine plant fossils and littoral molluscs although they are found only in marine deposits their oxygen isotope values indicate that they consumed water with a range of degrees of salinity some specimens showing no evidence of sea water consumption and others none of fresh water consumption at time when their teeth were fossilized it is clear that ambulocetids tolerated a wide range of salt concentrations their diet probably included land animals that approached water for drinking or freshwater aquatic organisms that lived in river hence ambulocetids represent transition phase of cetacean ancestors between freshwater and marine habitat tiktaalik thumb left tiktaalik roseae had spiracles air holes above eyes thumb 250px life restoration of tiktaalik roseae tiktaalik is a genus of extinct lobe finned fish from late devonian period with many features akin to those of tetrapods four legged animals it is one of several lines of ancient to develop adaptations to oxygen poor shallow water habitats of its time adaptations that led to evolution of tetrapods well preserved fossils were found in 2004 on ellesmere island in nunavut canada tiktaalik lived approximately 375 million years ago paleontologists suggest that it is representative of transition between non tetrapod vertebrates such as known from fossils 380 million years old and early tetrapods such as and known from fossils about 365 million years old its mixture of primitive fish and derived tetrapod characteristics led one of its discoverers neil shubin to characterize tiktaalik as a unlike many previous more fish like transitional fossils fins of tiktaalik have basic wrist bones and simple rays reminiscent of fingers they may have been weight bearing like all modern tetrapods it had rib bones a mobile neck with a separate pectoral girdle and lungs though it had gills scales and fins of a fish tetrapod footprints found in poland and reported in nature in january 2010 were securely dated at 10 million years older than oldest known of which tiktaalik is an example implying that animals like tiktaalik possessing features that evolved around 400 million years ago were late surviving relics rather than direct transitional forms and they highlight just how little we know of earliest history of land vertebrates amphistium thumb left modern flatfish are asymmetrical with both eyes on same side of head thumb fossil of amphistium with one eye at top center of head flatfish are an order of ray finned fish most obvious characteristic of modern flatfish is their asymmetry with both eyes on same side of head in adult fish in some families eyes are always on right side of body dextral or right eyed flatfish and in others they are always on left sinistral or left eyed flatfish primitive spiny include equal numbers of right and left eyed individuals and are generally less asymmetrical than other families other distinguishing features of order are presence of protrusible eyes another adaptation to living on seabed benthos and extension of dorsal fin onto head amphistium is a 50 million year old fossil fish identified as an early relative of flatfish and as a transitional fossil in amphistium transition from typical symmetric head of a vertebrate is incomplete with one eye placed near top center of head paleontologists concluded that change happened gradually in a way consistent with evolution via natural selection not suddenly as researchers once had little choice but to believe amphistium is among many fossil fish species known from monte lagerstatte of lutetian italy is a related and very similar fossil from slightly earlier strata of france runcaria thumb 80px devonian fossil plant runcaria resembles a seed but lacks a solid seed coat and means to guide pollen a middle devonian precursor to seed plants has been identified from belgium predating earliest seed plants by about 20 million years runcaria small and radially symmetrical is an megasporangium surrounded by a megasporangium bears an unopened distal extension protruding above multilobed integument it is suspected that extension was involved in pollination runcaria sheds new light on sequence of character acquisition leading to seed having all qualities of seed plants except for a solid seed coat and a system to guide pollen to seed fossil record not every transitional form appears in fossil record because fossil record is not complete organisms are only rarely preserved as fossils in best of circumstances and only a fraction of such fossils have been discovered paleontologist donald prothero noted that this is illustrated by fact that number of species known through fossil record was less than 5 of number of known living species suggesting that number of species known through fossils must be far less than 1 of all species that have ever lived because of specialized and rare circumstances required for a biological structure to fossilize logic dictates that known fossils represent only a small percentage of all life forms that ever existed and that each discovery represents only a snapshot of evolution transition itself can only be illustrated and corroborated by transitional fossils which never demonstrate an exact half way point between clearly divergent forms fossil record is very uneven and with few exceptions is heavily slanted toward organisms with hard parts leaving most groups of soft bodied organisms with little to no fossil record groups considered to have a good fossil record including a number of transitional fossils between traditional groups are vertebrates echinoderms brachiopods and some groups of arthropods history post darwin thumb upright a historic 1904 reconstruction of archaeopteryx thumb upright reconstruction of rhynia idea that animal and plant species were not constant but changed over time was suggested as far back as 18th century darwin s on origin of species published in 1859 gave it a firm scientific basis a weakness of darwin s work however was lack of palaeontological evidence as pointed out by darwin himself while it is easy to imagine natural selection producing variation seen within genera and families transmutation between higher categories was harder to imagine dramatic find of london specimen of archaeopteryx in 1861 only two years after publication of darwin s work offered for first time a link between class of highly derived birds and that of more primitive reptiles in a letter to darwin palaeontologist hugh falconer wrote had quarries been commissioned by august command to turn out a strange being a la darwin it could not have executed behest more handsomely than in archaeopteryx thus transitional fossils like archaeopteryx came to be seen as not only corroborating darwin s theory but as icons of evolution in their own right for example swedish encyclopedic dictionary nordisk familjebok of 1904 showed an inaccurate archaeopteryx reconstruction see illustration of fossil ett af de som one of most significant paleontological discoveries ever made rise of plants transitional fossils are not only those of animals with increasing mapping of divisions of plants at beginning of 20th century search began for ancestor of vascular plants in 1917 robert kidston and william henry lang found remains of an extremely primitive plant in rhynie chert in aberdeenshire scotland and named it rhynia rhynia plant was small and stick like with simple branching stems without leaves each tipped by a sporangium simple form echoes that of sporophyte of mosses and it has been shown that rhynia had an alternation of generations with a corresponding gametophyte in form of crowded tufts of diminutive stems only a few millimetres in height rhynia thus falls midway between mosses and early vascular plants like ferns and clubmosses from a carpet of moss like gametophytes larger rhynia sporophytes grew much like simple clubmosses spreading by means of horizontal growing stems growing rhizoids that anchored plant to substrate unusual mix of moss like and vascular traits and extreme structural simplicity of plant had huge implications for botanical understanding misunderstandings missing links thumb right human pedigree back to amoeba shown as a reinterpreted chain of being with living and fossil animals from g avery s critique of ernst haeckel 1873 thumb left java man or pithecanthropus erectus now homo erectus original missing link found in java in 1891 92 term missing link refers back to originally static pre evolutionary concept of great chain of being a deist idea that all existence is linked from lowest dirt through living kingdoms to angels and finally to god idea of all living things being linked through some sort of transmutation process predates darwin s theory of evolution jean baptiste lamarck envisioned that life is generated in form of simplest creatures constantly and then strive towards complexity and perfection i e humans through a series of lower forms in his view lower animals were simply newcomers on evolutionary scene after on origin of species idea of lower animals representing earlier stages in evolution lingered as demonstrated in ernst haeckel s figure of human pedigree while vertebrates were then seen as forming a sort of evolutionary sequence various classes were distinct undiscovered intermediate forms being called missing links term was first used in a scientific context by charles lyell in third edition 1851 of his book elements of geology in relation to missing parts of geological column but it was popularized in its present meaning by its appearance on page xi of his book geological evidences of antiquity of man of 1863 by that time it was generally thought that end of last glacial period marked first appearance of humanity but lyell drew on new findings in his antiquity of man to put origin of human beings much further back in deep geological past lyell wrote that it remained a profound mystery how huge gulf between man and beast could be bridged lyell s vivid writing fired public imagination inspiring jules verne s journey to center of earth 1864 and louis figuier s 1867 second edition of la terre avant le deluge earth before flood which included dramatic illustrations of savage men and women wearing animal skins and wielding stone axes in place of garden of eden shown in 1863 edition idea of a missing link between humans and so called lower animals remains lodged in public imagination search for a fossil showing transitional traits between apes and humans however was fruitless until young dutch geologist eugene dubois found a skullcap a molar and a femur on banks of solo river java in 1891 find combined a low ape like skull roof with a brain estimated at around 1000 cc midway between that of a chimpanzee and an adult human single molar was larger than any modern human tooth but femur was long and straight with a knee angle showing that java man had walked upright given name pithecanthropus erectus erect ape man it became first in what is now a long list of human evolution fossils at time it was hailed by many as missing link helping set term as primarily used for human fossils though it is sometimes used for other intermediates like dinosaur bird intermediary archaeopteryx thumb upright 1 7 sudden jumps with apparent gaps in fossil record have been used as evidence for punctuated equilibrium such jumps can be explained either by macromutation or simply by relatively rapid episodes of gradual evolution by natural selection since a period of say 10 000 years barely registers in fossil record missing link is still a popular term well recognized by public and often used in popular media it is however avoided in scientific press as it relates to concept of great chain of being and to notion of simple organisms being primitive versions of complex ones both of which have been discarded in biology in any case term itself is misleading as any known transitional fossil like java man is no longer missing while each find will give rise to new gaps in evolutionary story on each side discovery of more and more transitional fossils continues to add to our knowledge of evolutionary transitions punctuated equilibrium theory of punctuated equilibrium developed by stephen jay gould and niles eldredge and first presented in 1972 is often mistakenly drawn into discussion of transitional fossils this theory however pertains only to well documented transitions within taxa or between closely related taxa over a geologically short period of time these transitions usually traceable in same geological outcrop often show small jumps in morphology between extended periods of morphological stability to explain these jumps gould and eldredge envisaged comparatively long periods of genetic stability separated by periods of rapid evolution gould
