battle of khafji was first major ground engagement of persian gulf war it took place in and around saudi arabian city of khafji from 29 january to 1 february 1991 and marked culmination of coalition s air campaign over kuwait and iraq which had begun on 17 january 1991 iraqi leader saddam hussein who had already tried and failed to draw coalition troops into costly ground engagements by shelling saudi arabian positions and oil storage tanks and firing scud surface to surface missiles at israel ordered invasion of saudi arabia from southern kuwait 1st and 5th mechanized divisions and 3rd armored division were ordered to conduct a multi pronged invasion toward khafji engaging saudi arabian kuwaiti and u s forces along coastline with a supporting iraqi commando force ordered to infiltrate further south by sea and harass coalition s rear these three divisions which had been heavily damaged by coalition aircraft in preceding days attacked on 29 january most of their attacks were repulsed by u s marines as well as u s army rangers and coalition aircraft but one of iraqi columns occupied khafji on night of 29 30 january between 30 january and 1 february two saudi arabian national guard battalions and two kuwaiti tank companies attempted to retake control of city aided by coalition aircraft and u s artillery by 1 february city had been recaptured at cost of 43 coalition servicemen dead and 52 wounded iraqi army fatalities numbered between 60 and 300 while an estimated 400 were captured as prisoners of war although invasion of khafji was initially a propaganda victory for ba athist iraqi regime it was swiftly recaptured by saudi arabian ground forces battle serves as a modern demonstration that air power in a supporting role to ground forces can be of great assistance in halting and defeating a major ground operation background on 2 august 1990 iraqi army invaded and occupied neighboring state of kuwait lewis p 481 invasion which followed inconclusive iran iraq war and three decades of political conflict with kuwait offered saddam hussein opportunity to distract political dissent at home and add kuwait s oil resources to iraq s own a boon in a time of declining petroleum prices halliday p 226 at time iraq s own reserves were second only to saudi arabia s in response united nations began to pass a series of resolutions demanding withdrawal of iraqi forces from kuwait perrett p 199 afraid that saudi arabia would be invaded next saudi arabian government requested immediate military aid perrett pp 199 200 as a result united states began marshalling forces from a variety of nations styled coalition on arabian peninsula halliday p 223 initially saddam hussein attempted to deter coalition military action by threatening kuwait s and iraq s petroleum production and export in december 1990 iraq experimented with use of explosives to destroy in area of ahmadi loading complex developing their capability to destroy kuwait s petroleum infrastructure on a large scale on 16 january iraqi artillery destroyed an oil storage tank in khafji saudi arabia and on 19 january pumps at ahmadi loading complex were opened pouring crude oil into persian gulf oil flowed into sea at a rate of 200 000 barrels a day becoming one of worst ecological disasters to that date freedman karsh p 29 despite these iraqi threats coalition launched a 38 day aerial campaign on 17 january 1991 flying an estimated 2 000 sorties a day freedman karsh pp 24 25 coalition aircraft rapidly crippled iraqi air defense systems and effectively destroyed iraqi air force biddle pp 144 145 whose daily sortie rate plummeted from a prewar level of an estimated 200 per day to almost none by 17 january freedman karsh p 27 on third day of campaign many iraqi pilots fled across iranian border in their aircraft rather than be destroyed freedman karsh pp 27 28 air campaign also targeted command and control sites bridges railroads and petroleum storage facilities lewis pp 493 495 saddam hussein who is believed to have said air force has never decided a war nevertheless worried that air campaign would erode iraq s national morale iraqi leader also believed that united states would not be willing to lose many troops in action and therefore sought to draw coalition ground troops into a decisive battle freedman karsh p 28 in an attempt to provoke a ground battle he directed iraqi forces to launch scud missiles against israel while continuing to threaten destruction of oilfields in kuwait freedman karsh pp 29 30 these efforts were unsuccessful in provoking a large ground battle freedman karsh p 30 so saddam hussein decided to launch a limited offensive into saudi arabia with aim of inflicting heavy losses on coalition armies titus p 4 as air campaign continued coalition s expectations of an iraqi offensive decreased as a result united states redeployed xviii airborne corps and vii corps 480 kilometers 300 mi to west coalition s leadership believed that should an iraqi force go on offensive it would be launched from al wafra oil fields in southern kuwait titus p 5 order of battle thumb coalition and iraqi units deployed in kuwaiti theater of operations as of 24 28 february 1991 iraqi army had between 350 000 and 500 000 soldiers in theater freedman karsh p 13 post war estimates put iraqi personnel at around 350 000 while prior to war coalition estimated a strength of around 540 000 soldiers organized into 51 divisions including eight republican guard divisions press p 13 republican guard units normally received newest equipment for example most of estimated 1 000 t 72 tanks in iraqi army on eve of war were in republican guard divisions zaloga 1993 p 38 iraqi army in kuwaiti theater of operations kto also included nine heavy divisions composed mostly of professional soldiers but with weapons of a generally lesser grade than those issued to republican guard press pp 13 14 most non republican guard armored units had older tank designs mainly t 55 or its chinese equivalents type 59 and type 69 zaloga 2004 p 42 remaining 34 divisions were composed of poorly trained conscripts these divisions were deployed to channel coalition s forces through a number of break points along front allowing iraqi army s heavy divisions and republican guard units to isolate them and counterattack press p 14 however iraqis left their western flank open failing to account for tactics made possible by global positioning system and other new technologies press pp 14 15 in saudi arabia coalition originally deployed over 200 000 soldiers 750 aircraft and 1 200 tanks williams pp 5 6 this quickly grew to 3 600 tanks and over 600 000 personnel perrett p 200 of whom over 500 000 were from united states cnn gulf war facts iraqi forces earmarked for offensive into saudi arabia was iraqi third corps williams p 3 1st mechanized division from fourth corps and a number of commando units mahnken watts p 155 third corps commanded by major general salah aboud mahmoud who would also command overall offensive had 3rd armored division and 5th mechanized division as well as a number of infantry divisions fourth corps commander was major general zaki 3rd armored division had a number of t 72 tanks only non republican guard force to have them while other armored battalions had t 62s and t 55s a few of which had an iraqi applique armor similar to soviet bulging armor also known as brow laminate armor or bdd during battle of khafji these upgraded t 55s survived impacts from milan anti tank missiles zaloga 2004 p 36 these divisions also had armored personnel vehicles such as bmp 1 scout vehicles such as brdm 2 and several types of artillery also deployed along this portion of front though not chosen to participate in invasion were five infantry divisions that were under orders to remain in their defensive positions along border westermeyer p 5 thumb an iraqi modification of t 55 tank codename enigma used during battle u s marine corps reconnaissance estimated that iraqi army had amassed around 60 000 troops across border near kuwaiti town of wafra in as many as 5 or 6 divisions williams p 13 infantry divisions normally consisted of three brigades with an attached commando unit although some infantry divisions could have up to eight brigades however most infantry divisions along border were understrength primarily due to desertion rottman p 51 armored and mechanized divisions normally made use of three brigades with each brigade having up to four combat battalions depending on division type these were generally a three to one mix with either three mechanized battalions and one armored battalion or vice versa rottman pp 51 52 given size of forces deployed across border it is thought that iraqi army planned to continue offensive after successful capture of khafji in order to seize valuable oil fields at dammam attack would consist of a four prong offensive 1st mechanized division would pass through 7th and 14th infantry divisions to protect flank of 3rd armored division which would provide a blocking force west of khafji while 5th mechanized division took town 1st mechanized and 3rd armored divisions would then retire to kuwait while 5th mechanized division would wait until coalition launched a counteroffensive principal objectives were to inflict heavy casualties on attacking coalition soldiers and take prisoners of war who saddam hussein theorized would be an excellent bargaining tool with coalition westermeyer pp 5 6 as units moved to saudi arabian border many were attacked by coalition aircraft around al wafrah forest about 1 000 iraqi armored fighting vehicles were attacked by harrier aircraft with cluster bombs williams pp 14 15 another iraqi convoy of armored vehicles was hit by a 10s which destroyed first and last vehicles before systematically attacking stranded remainders williams p 15 such air raids prevented majority of

u s marines at observation post who had noticed large groups of armored vehicles through their night vision devices attempted to talk to battalion headquarters but received no response contact was not

before calling in air support air support arrived by 21 30 and took form of several f 15e f 16c four a 10 tank killers and three ac 130 gunships which intervened in a heavy firefight between iraqi and coalition ground forces at op 4 reconnaissance platoon stationed at op 4 were first to come under attack their withdrawal from engagement was facilitated by another company providing cover fire attempt by soldiers stationed at op 4 to fend off or delay iraqi advance cost them several casualties and in face of a heavy iraqi response they were forced to retire south by order of its commanding officer westermeyer p 16 to cover withdrawal company s platoon of lav 25s and lav ats anti tank variants moved to engage iraqi force after receiving permission one of anti tank vehicles opened fire at what it believed was an iraqi tank instead missile destroyed a friendly lav at a few hundred meters in front of it despite this loss platoon continued forward and soon opened fire on iraqi tanks with lav 25s autocannons fire could not penetrate tanks armor but did damage their optics and prevented tanks from fighting back effectively westermeyer pp 16 18 soon thereafter a number of a 10 ground attack aircraft arrived but found it difficult to pinpoint enemy targets and began dropping flares to illuminate zone one of these flares landed on a friendly vehicle and although vehicle radioed in

saudi arabian national guard brigades also conducted similar screening operations due to order to not engage road to khafji was left open westermeyer p 22 at one point iraqi t 55s of another column rolled up to saudi arabian border signaling that they intended to surrender as they were approached by saudi arabian troops they reversed their turrets and opened fire this prompted air support from a nearby ac 130 destroying 13 vehicles williams pp 38 39 nevertheless iraqi advance towards khafji continued on this sector despite repeated attacks from an ac 130 attempts by saudi arabian commanders to call in additional air strikes on advancing iraqi column failed when requested heavy air support never arrived westermeyer pp 22 23 khafji was occupied by approximately 00 30 on 30 january williams

persuade iraqis to call off a search of area williams p 41 throughout night coalition air support composed of helicopters and fixed wing aircraft continued to engage iraqi tanks and artillery westermeyer p 23 initial response 30 january distressed by occupation of khafji saudi arabian commander general khaled bin sultan appealed to u s general norman schwarzkopf for an immediate air campaign against iraqi forces in and around city however this was turned down because buildings would make it difficult for aircraft to spot targets without getting too close it was instead decided that city would be retaken by arab ground forces williams p 43 task fell to 2nd saudi arabian national guard brigade s 7th battalion composed of saudi arabian infantry with v 150 armored cars and two

preceded by a 15 minute preparatory fire from u s marine artillery however iraqi fire did manage to destroy one saudi arabian v 150 westermeyer p 28 meanwhile 2nd saudi arabian national guard brigade s 5th battalion moved north of khafji to block iraqi reinforcements attempting to reach city this unit was further bolstered by 8th ministry of defense and aviation brigade and heavily aided by coalition air support although fear of friendly fire forced 8th ministry of defense and aviation brigade to pull back following morning coalition aircraft successfully hindered iraqi attempts to move more soldiers down to khafji and caused large numbers of iraqi troops to surrender to saudi arabian forces that night two u s army heavy equipment transporters entered city of khafji apparently lost and were fired upon by iraqi troops although one truck managed to turn around and escape two drivers of second truck were wounded and captured this led to a rescue mission organized by 3rd battalion

capture of khafji was a major propaganda victory for iraq on 30 january iraqi radio claimed that they had expelled americans from arab territory williams p 19 for many in arab world battle of khafji was seen as an iraqi victory and hussein made every possible effort to turn battle into a political victory williams p 56 on other side confidence within united states armed forces in abilities of saudi arabian and kuwaiti armies increased as battle progressed after khafji coalition s leadership began to sense that iraqi army was a hollow force and it provided them with an impression of degree
