michigan became a state first land transportation corridors were indian trails french indian trail ran through southeastern michigan between toledo monroe and detroit saginaw trail ran north from detroit to saginaw area where it connected with original mackinaw trail that ran roughly parallel to and west of modern i 75 another path cheboygan trail ran parallel to modern freeway to east between west branch area and cheboygan in up an extension of mackinac trail connected st ignace and sault ste marie in 19th century michigan legislature chartered private companies to build and operate plank roads or turnpikes in state many of which replaced original indian trails these roads were originally made of oak planks but later legislation permitted gravel as well by first decade of 20th century only 23 of 202 chartered turnpikes were still in operation many companies that received a charter never built their specified roadways remaining plank roads were turned over to state or purchased by railway companies in early part of century state trunkline highway system was formed on may 13 1913 and several sections of system were designated along course of then future i 75 division 1 connected ohio state line northeasterly to detroit and division 2 connected detroit with mackinaw city a branch of division 7 ran north from st ignace to sault ste marie system was signposted in 1919 and those highways were marked on maps for first time first m 10 was designated along highways from ohio through detroit to standish northeast of standish m 10 ran along lake huron shoreline m 76 connected standish with grayling where first m 14 ran northward to cheboygan from there m 10 connected to mackinaw city in up m 12 connected st ignace with sault ste marie along a route to east of old mackinac trail when united states numbered highway system was formed on november 11 1926 most of these highways were redesignated as part of national system from state line northward m 10 was included as a part of us 24 and us 25 at detroit m 10 was used as a part of us 10 north of grayling m 14 was redesignated as a part of us 27 m 12 was used for us 2 michigan state highway department mshd rerouted us 2 in 1933 between rogers park and sault ste marie new routing followed mackinac trail instead of turning east to cedarville and north to sault ste marie former routing was given m 121 designation turnpikes and freeways by 1945 a divided highway designated alternate us 24 us 24a was opened from state line north to erie after world war ii mshd planned to convert several highways in state to freeways in planning maps from 1947 modern i 75 corridor was included in system that later became interstate highway system it was also included in general location of national system of interstate

thumb left upright 1955 map of proposed michigan turnpike alt black and white map michigan turnpike authority mta an agency which was created in 1951 proposed construction of a toll freeway to run north south in state original termini for turnpike were bridgeport and rockwood state highway commissioner at time charles ziegler distrusted a separate agency dealing with statewide road building at time and he worked to stall progress on any proposed turnpikes ziegler who had a seat on mta board publicly sparred with authority chairman george higgins even announcing that mshd would build a parallel freeway that would reduce tolls on turnpike 40 to 50 percent according to consultants trucking interests in state also opposed projects preferring a moderate gas tax increase over any tolls detroit denied mta permission to route a turnpike through city over issues related to river rouge rouge park and access across right of way after a lawsuit by city of dearborn legislation creating authority was upheld by michigan supreme court in 1955 and authority was allowed to sell bonds for its bridgeport rockwood and detroit chicago toll roads original planning maps plotted first turnpike to west of detroit running near us 24 telegraph road this route was later proposed for i 75 itself i 275 would have been freeway to loop into downtown detroit proposed length was increased by december 1955 extended michigan turnpike would have run from a connection across ohio state line to toledo north through detroit and saginaw and eventually to southern end of mackinac bridge by following april any extensions were cancelled leaving turnpike to its original termini east west companion road was also cancelled at that time mta proposed a state constitutional amendment in january 1956 that would allow michigan legislature to issue state guaranteed bonds for part of mta s construction expenses according to wall street journal authority struggled for survival in face of opposition from mshd just two months later department s actions impaired authority s appropriations from state legislature and its ability to sell necessary bonds to pay for construction when federal government approved federal aid highway act of 1956 ziegler and mshd announced plans for a full freeway to run north through lower peninsula and continue across to upper peninsula this announcement undermined efforts to build michigan turnpike by august 1956 mta voted to reduce its operations to a skeleton staff but moved forward in may 1957 on a bond sale to finance construction of roadway financiers stated such a sale was only feasible if turnpike was to be safe from competition michigan townships association called for abolition of mta in 1958 legislature killed a bill to do so in june 1959 but it later voted to repeal act that created authority in 1962 interstate highway era first sections of freeway for i 75 were opened in 1957 beginning with southern section near ohio state line opened in october 1957
