robert osbourne episode s storyline including helen s death was meant to be in first series finale however by then second episode was not yet written and series producer kudos were due to deliver story to bbc in one month as a result episode was brought forward to second slot since first episode began spooks with a bang series creator and writer david wolstencroft was under pressure to top efforts of first episode with second but not by much during writing stage he introduced a story arc involving danny hunter and his obsession with money and spending apparently mirroring writer arc was created for temptations that officers may have in original screenplay danny was to spend on his mother wolstencroft included some suggestions from his friends and girlfriend an early scene was to take place in a shower room but was rewritten when producers thought it would be too racy for a 9 00 p m audience in another instance a long sequence would take place at sea concerning smugglers dropping off illegal immigrants into water scenes were cut before filming due to time constraints also before deciding on waste disposal osbourne was originally going to head a security company funeral scene towards end of episode was inspired by godfather ii in end script was rewritten four times before bbc took final version of episode kevin mcnally was cast as antagonist robert osbourne mcnally was chosen because producers thought he would be perfect to play part as is case with debra stephenson who portrayed his wife child actor daniel chenery who played part of their son sammy was chosen due to his likeness of a younger version of mcnally also simon crawford collins s wife made a cameo appearance as a bt operator filming filming took place over a 13 to 14 days period in december 2001 it was not filmed on order of script scenes set around osbourne residence for instance were all filmed at once during two to three days though during episodes scenes took place in separate parts of episode parts of introduction scenes where danny s team break into osbourne s house was actually filmed on grid set parts of sequence were originally filmed without sound sound would later be added during post production footage of drowned immigrants found at shore were shot by second unit headed by producer simon crawford collins on a pebbled courtyard in kensington to double as a beach some of exterior scenes at night were filmed with street wet down so that lights could kick off ground also in episode editing suite where series was edited was used as a set shopping centre in shepherd s bush london was used in one scene as an airport as well as shopping centre itself in another community college was filmed at a rugby club safe house tom and helen were appointed to was filmed in two separate locations one of those locations was used before in mary kane interrogation scene in pilot episode thou shalt not kill in one scene where tom was driving to operation car was in fact towed an error was made in episode where car looked taller than other cars on road during shoot helen flynn death scene wolstencroft wrote death scene with intention of giving audience impression that no one in series is safe according to producer jane featherstone idea to kill off a main character involved a female getting her head set on fire later in series but she decided let s move most dramatic thing you ve got to episode two and kill off only actress audience recognise faulkner was considered only recognisable cast member when series was introduced and then you ve got them hooked matthew macfadyen stated that shooting of death scene although not emotionally draining was rather tough and gruelling to perform part where osbourne forces flynn s arm into fryer was done with a rubber arm made to double faulkner s arm furthermore oil was in fact cold tea with food colour director bharat nalluri wanted as little of torture to be seen as possible because he wanted sequence to be more psychological to make it easier to frighten audience since they know physicality of being burnt whereas if helen was shot not as many would producer stephen garrett wanted to show a more realistic sense of violence rather than a fantastical cartoon violence in which blows to head with iron bars leave small bruises rather than crushed skulls gunshot wounds leave neat abrasions in conveniently fleshy parts of anatomy rather than eviscerating their victims and fights that would mike tyson are walked away from with barely a mark broadcast reception and controversy episode was first broadcast on 20 may 2002 during 9 to 10 pm time slot it achieved overnight viewing figures of 7 8 million with a 35 per cent audience share ratings were down over one million from pilot episode previous week

controversy following demise of helen flynn after her hand and head were forced into a deep fryer death scenes attracted over 250 complaints 154 of them to television watchdog broadcasting standards commission highest number of complaints for a television programme in 2002 in wake of complaints bbc insiders had admitted that scenes clearly disturbed some of viewers but also defended their decision to show scene as it would show audience kind of threat which might be faced by agents engaged in fight against terrorism broadcasting standards commission stated that despite shocking content in context was acceptable and important for later narrative however watchdog still criticised bbc for failing to warn viewers of violence to come garrett refuted this stating not only was there a clear warning before programme began but for anyone who missed that subject matter of episode a conspiracy to stir up inter racial violence perpetrated by a man who clearly beat his wife was hardly stuff of which chirpy little bucolic fantasies are made wolstencroft stated that after watching episode with his friends they both commended and criticised his work i got some angry phone calls from my friends next day saying how could you but well done but how could you but she was so nice but how could you but well done oyelowo also responded to controversy believing that it came from a result of faulkner s male fans comedian charlie brooker however commended scene as well as series in general stating in his guardian column moment her head was forced into deep fat fryer viewers reared on formulaic it ll be alright in end blandness of cookie cutter populist dramas like casualty and merseybeat sat up and blinked in disbelief here was a major bbc drama series that actually had nerve to
