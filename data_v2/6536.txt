home 1989 team removed item storage boxes present in earlier games and introduced a new item dropping feature development slowed when team encountered memory storage problems and so production was moved to newly announced gamecube game had to be rebuilt with only concept and story carried over resident evil zero received generally positive reviews critics praised graphics and audio for building

taking aim at an enemy during opening train scenario while original resident evil 1996 was still in development idea for a prequel came up shortly after 64dd peripheral for nintendo 64 was announced in 1995 64dd s low sales four years later eventually made capcom decide to develop resident evil zero as a cartridge based nintendo 64 release capcom started development on nintendo 64 version shortly before summer of 1998 one of many resident evil games being developed at time one of these was resident evil code veronica 2000 which was taking full advantage of capacities of gd rom format nintendo 64 cartridge could only store of data 1 10 that of a traditional cd rom for these reasons team approached resident evil zero with different ideas for gameplay and visual design that would function better with less storage space after script had been completed in early 1999 production of a resident evil game for nintendo 64 was revealed to public by yoshiki okamoto president of capcom s screenplay company flagship resident evil zero was designed to be more difficult than its predecessors removing item boxes to make game more like sweet home 1989 real time partner zapping system was designed to take advantage of console s unique features and strengths namely lack of load times which are necessary for optical disc based gameplay as with playstation in an effort to make 1 on 1 zombie fights more intense capcom experimented with giving zombies different reactions when they were shot and allowing player to counter attack when bitten team also toyed with faster zombies a precursor to resident evil s crimson head enemies prototype also supported local co operative play resident evil zero was officially announced at 20 percent completion in january 2000 after which it was presented with a playable demo at tokyo game show game was expected to release in july 2000 and reportedly had an atmosphere close to first resident evil focusing more on suspense than more action oriented gameplay of resident evil 2 1998 however development began to slow down when it became apparent that data for resident evil zero would not fit on a single cartridge production shifted to newly announced gamecube with concept and story carried over but all of data recreated platform change was confirmed in september 2000 game s final version was developed primarily by capcom production studio 3 with additional support provided by tose as a result of transition to gamecube it was delayed so that environments could be upgraded visually more cgi videos were created as a result of increased memory capacities and voice acting was re recorded iconic sounds of leeches were actually from recordings of cooking hamburgers for gun models modelling team was provided realistic looking guns to base their designs from their designs were so close to source material that models at first featured replica markings and gas refill inlets no one on team noticed until half way through development scenario writer noboru sugimura was called back to make some changes to story in prototype s story either rebecca or billy could die with other character surviving and completing game this idea was scrapped as rebecca dying would ruin canon of resident evil timeline billy was also originally designed in prototype as a more ambiguous character possibly becoming friend or foe as story progressed this idea was scrapped character designs were also adjusted rebecca for example lost her beret and shoulder pads while billy received a new hairstyle gamecube s use of optical discs reintroduced load times so programmers had to use sophisticated programming to make partner zapping system work capcom announced its intention to release a game demo in japan around august 2002 evil zero was first released for nintendo gamecube on november 10 2002 in north america and then later released on november 21 2002 in japan and march 7 2003 in europe in december 2008 game was ported to wii along with resident evil 2002 port resident evil archives resident evil zero is near identical but features a control system that supports wii remote and gamecube controller for many years fate of original nintendo 64 prototype remained unclear all that remained was low quality video captured from tokyo game show in 2000 and magazine scans in 2015 capcom showed off prototype while marketing remaster and demonstrated new high quality footage of it prototype remains unreleased to public remaster on may 26 2015 capcom announced that a remastered version of game was in development resident evil zero hd remaster success of high definition remaster of resident evil inspired producer tsukasa takenaka to provide same treatment to that game s prequel takenaka recognized that many resident evil fans preferred old style of gameplay pre resident evil 4 and so he reasoned that hd remasters were to provide that same gameplay experience on modern hardware remaster was produced by tsukasa takenaka and team was made up of many members from original team including director koji oda takenaka was glad oda was on board as this ensured oda s original vision of game would not be tarnished resident evil zero hd remaster was released on january 19 2016 a retail compilation called resident evil origins collection that includes resident evil hd remaster and resident evil zero hd remaster was released on january 22 2016 game was released for nintendo switch on may 21 2019 along with resident evil and resident evil 4 for remaster capcom used original 2002 models and textures from their archives to takenaka s surprise models and textures were actually designed in a very high quality and then for original release this meant that some assets had to be redone as items that were intentionally blurry or illegible in original were now much more clear and did not make sense in context such as posters or signs in environment models and textures were re touched and then backgrounds were re captured some backgrounds in original also featured video effects such as fire in remaster these videos were transitioned into 3d effects additional modes were added as well including an easy mode and wesker mode in wesker mode player controls albert wesker instead of billy and can move quickly and use special attacks other improvements include an upgrade to 5 1 surround sound video options for both original 4 3 ratio or a new 16 9 option as well as more control styles including a modern non tank like control scheme overall takenaka felt that putting together remaster for resident evil zero was more difficult than that of resident evil largely due to companion function evil zero received generally favorable reviews after its initial gamecube release in 2002 graphics and atmosphere were universally praised being described as wonderfully spooky and moody with an astonishing level of detail scott steinberg of gamespy noted how animated backgrounds such as flickering lights and dripping water brought environments to life giancarlo varanini of gamespot shared these sentiments and complimented capcom on how they were able to blend game s models with pre rendered backgrounds to create highly detailed visuals sound design was also complimented with matt casamassina of ign noting that capcom uses silence at times too to scare which is brilliant varanini described soundtrack as one that will keep you in constant fear louis bedigian of gamezone praised sound effect work such as thunder gunshots and footsteps for building a scary environment controls were universally panned as archaic and series was criticized for not evolving control scheme to something more similar to devil may cry 2001 or eternal darkness 2002 critics had mixed reactions to gameplay changes from previous series entries regarding new item system a critic from game revolution noted that it prevents need to return to item boxes to empty inventory however he also noted a drawback in that it introduces more backtracking to pick up an item that was dropped contrary to this mark macdonald of 1up com praised it for eliminating backtracking that slowed down previous series entries varanini from gamespot gave credit to capcom for attempting a new item system but it is ultimately not too useful since it is easiest to drop all items in a save location anyway casamassina of ign called system perfect and much better than item boxes in previous games regarding partner system varanini said that it works well although he found puzzles too simple and companion s ai was lacking at times bedigian of gamezone praised companion system for adding a new dimension to resident evil series and it left him excited for future games steinberg of gamespy liked puzzles which required both characters working together but he was not keen to fight alongside them feeling like he was babysitting other character due to weak ai re releases of resident evil zero have received considerably less praise than original receiving mixed or average reviews wii release was criticized for being a near identical port of gamecube version and for not fully using wii remote s motion control capabilities instead relying largely on classic controller and remote nunchuk combo for high definition remaster critics were impressed by improved visuals but ultimately felt game inherited problems of original peter brown of gamespot highlighted wesker mode as a fun addition and noted game still bears hallmarks that made original resident evil enjoyable resident evil zero sold 1 25 million copies on gamecube and high definition remaster has sold 1 3 million units as of december 2016 game was novelized into book resident evil zero hour by s d perry and published by pocket books
