wookey hole caves are a series of limestone caverns a show cave and tourist attraction in village of wookey hole on southern edge of mendip hills near wells in somerset england river axe flows through cave it is a site of special scientific interest sssi for both biological and geological reasons wookey hole cave is a solutional cave one that is formed by a process of weathering in which natural acid in groundwater dissolves rocks some water originates as rain that flows into streams on impervious rocks on plateau before sinking at limestone boundary into cave systems such as swildon s hole eastwater cavern and st cuthbert s swallet rest is rain that percolates directly through limestone temperature in caves is a constant caves have been used by humans for around 45 000 years demonstrated by discovery of tools from palaeolithic period along with fossilised animal remains evidence of stone and iron age occupation continued into roman britain a corn grinding mill operated on resurgent waters of river axe as early as domesday survey of 1086 waters of river are used in a handmade paper mill oldest extant in britain which began operations circa 1610 low constant temperature of caves means that they can be used for maturing cheddar cheese caves are site of first cave dives in britain which were undertaken by jack sheppard and graham balcombe since 1930s divers have explored extensive network of chambers developing breathing apparatus and novel techniques in process full extent of cave system is still unknown with approximately including 25 chambers having been explored part of cave system opened as a show cave in 1927 following exploratory work by herbert e balch as a tourist attraction it has been owned by madame tussauds and most recently circus owner gerry cottle cave is noted for witch of wookey hole a roughly human shaped stalagmite that legend says is a witch turned to stone by a monk from glastonbury it has also been used as a location for film and television productions description show cave consists of a dry gallery connecting three large chambers first of which contains witch of wookey formation there are various high level passages leading off from these chambers with two small exits above tourist entrance river axe is formed by water entering cave systems and flows through third and first chambers from which it flows to resurgence through two sumps and long where it leaves cave and enters open air river is maintained at an artificially high level and falls a couple of metres when sluice is lowered to allow access to fourth and fifth chambers two small air spaces normally however these are only accessible by cave diving beyond fifth chamber a roomy submerged route may be followed for a further passing under three large rifts with air spaces to surface in ninth chamber a roomy chamber over long and same high high level passages here lead to a former resurgence now blocked some above current resurgence an artificial tunnel leading off from third chamber allows show cave visitors to cross seventh and eighth chambers on bridges and skirt around ninth chamber on a walkway before exiting near resurgence a second excavated tunnel from ninth chamber allows visitors to visit 20th chamber from ninth chamber a dive of about passes almost immediately from dolomitic conglomerate into limestone and descends steadily for to a depth of under a couple of high rifts with which are enclosed air spaces between water and roof before reaching air space in 19th chamber 20th chamber is at top of a large boulder slope long wide and high from here a roomy passage some long ascends towards a now blocked fossil resurgence in ebbor gorge total length of passages in this area is about a passage near end is being cleared in an attempt to provide an easier connection with 24th chamber which is only an estimated away continuation is found in 19th chamber where of passage descending to a depth of surfaces in 22nd chamber of dry passages at various levels with a static pool way on is within this pool at a depth of where of passage ascends to surface in 23rd chamber of large passage followed by four short sumps that arrive in 24th chamber this is of what is described in guide book as magnificent river passage high and wide which finishes at a cascade falling from a long lake there are also more than of high level passages above river way on continues underwater for some reaching a depth of before surfacing in 25th chamber called lake of gloom because of its thick mud deposits sump at end of this has been dived for to a maximum depth of before gravel chokes prevented further progress end is located about northeast of entrance hydrology and geology wookey hole is on southern escarpment of mendip hills and is resurgence which drains southern flanks of north hill and pen hill it is second largest resurgence on mendip with an estimated catchment area of and an average discharge of per second some of water is in origin i e drained off non limestone rocks collecting as streams on surface before sinking at or near lower limestone shale black rock limestone boundary often through such as plantation swallet near st cuthbert s lead works between hunter s lodge inn and priddy pools it then passes through major cave systems such as swildon s hole eastwater cavern and st cuthbert s swallet around priddy but 95 is water that has percolated directly into limestone southern slopes of mendip hills largely follow flanks of an anticline a fold in rock that is convex upwards and has its oldest beds at its core on mendips crest of anticline is truncated by erosion forming a plateau rock strata here dip 10 15 degrees to southwest outer slopes are mainly of carboniferous limestone with devonian age old red sandstone exposed as an at centre wookey hole is a solutional cave mainly formed in limestone by chemical weathering whereby naturally acidic groundwater dissolves carbonate rocks but it is unique in that first part of cave is formed in triassic dolomitic conglomerate a well cemented fossil limestone scree representing infill of a triassic valley cave was formed under phreatic conditions i e below local water table but lowering base levels to which subterranean drainage was flowing resulted in some passages being abandoned by river and there is evidence of a number of abandoned resurgences in particular passages in 20th chamber are interpreted as a former spring waters of which once surfaced in ebbor gorge it is uncertain whether that was original rising or whether it formed when main rising at wookey was blocked current resurgence is located close to base of dolomitic conglomerate at head of a short gorge formed by headward erosion with subsequent cavern collapse morphology of passages is determined by rock strata in which they are formed streamway in outer part of cave system that is formed within dolomitic conglomerate is characterised by shallow loops linking low bedding chambers or tall narrow passages known as rifts developed by phreatic solutional enlargement of fractured rifts streamway in inner part of system formed within limestone is characterised by deep phreatic loops reaching depths as much as with water flowing down dip along bedding planes and rising up enlarged joints in far reaches of cave passages descend to below sea level history thumb cheddar cheeses in wookey hole caves suggests that name wookey is derived from celtic welsh for cave ogo or ogof which gave early names for this cave of hole is anglo saxon for cave which is itself of latin norman derivation therefore name wookey hole cave basically means cave cave cave eilert ekwall gives an alternative derivation of wookey from old english meaning a noose or snare for animals by 18th century caves were commonly known as okey hole it was known as such when it was first described in print in 1681 by geologist john beaumont fossils of a range of animals have been found including pleistocene lion felis leo cave hyena crocuta crocuta spelaea and badger meles meles wookey hole was occupied by humans in iron age possibly around 250 300 bc while nearby hyena cave was occupied by stone age hunters badger hole and rhinoceros hole are two dry caves on slopes above wookey ravine near wookey hole resurgence and contain in situ cave sediments laid down during ice age just outside cave foundations of a 1st century hut have been identified these had been built on during roman era up to end of 4th century in 1544 products of roman lead working in area were discovered lead mines across mendips have produced contamination of water emerging from caverns at wookey hole lead in water is believed to have affected quality of paper produced designation of water catchment area for wookey hole covering a large area of mendip hills as far away as priddy pools as a site of special scientific interest sssi during 1970s and 1980s was controversial because of conflicts of interest between land owners recreational and cave scientists initially proposals were put forward by council of southern caving clubs which is part of british caving association was that sssi designation which would restrict what farmers and other landowners were allowed to do would cover entire catchment area this was opposed as being too restrictive and difficult to enforce it was argued that agricultural uses of fields which were not directly in contact with cave entrances would have little detrimental effect on caves themselves there was also debate about which caves and cave features should be considered important final settlement resulted in a smaller area being designated and many agricultural practices being removed from list of proscribed potentially damaging operations entrance weir and sluice gate servicing paper mill was built about 1852 tunnel excavated from third chamber to ninth chamber and then out to daylight was dug in 1974 1975 by ex coal miners from radstock area show cave was further extended in 2015 by excavating a tunnel from ninth chamber to 20th chamber constant temperature of in caves is used by ford farm of dorset to mature cheddar cheese in cheese tunnel an excavated side tunnel between ninth chamber and exit to show cave cave archaeology archaeological investigations were undertaken from 1859 to 1874 by william boyd dawkins who moved to somerset to study classics with vicar of wookey on hearing of discovery of bones by local workmen he led excavations in area of hyena den his work led to discovery of first evidence for use by paleolithic humans in caves of mendip hills middle paleolithic tools have been found in association with butchered bones with a radiocarbon age of around 41 000 years herbert e balch continued work from 1904 to 1914 when he led excavations of entrance passage 1904 1915 witch s kitchen first chamber and hell s ladder 1926 1927 and badger hole 1938 1954 where roman coins from 3rd century were discovered along with aurignacian flint implements rhinoceros hole was scheduled as an ancient monument in 1992 1911 work found of stratification mostly dating from iron age and sealed into place by romano british artefacts finds included a silver coin of marcia 124 bc pottery weapons and tools bronze ornaments and roman coins from vespasian to valentinian ii 1st to 4th centuries work was continued first by e j mason from 1946 to 1949 and then by g r morgan in 1972 later work led by edgar kingsley explored human occupation of rhinoceros hole and showed that fourth chamber of great cave was a romano british cemetery during excavations in 1954 1957 at hole ground just outside entrance to cave foundations of a 1st century hut and iron age pottery were seen these were covered by foundations of roman buildings dating from 1st to late 4th century exploration thumb left upright an underground lake in first chamber cave as far as third chamber and side galleries has been known since at least iron age period prior to construction of a dam at resurgence to feed water to paper mill downstream two more chambers fourth and fifth were accessible further upstream way lies underwater diving was first tried by cave diving group under leadership of graham balcombe in 1935 with equipment on loan from siebe gorman he and penelope mossy powell penetrated into cave reaching seventh chamber using standard diving dress events marked first successful cave dives in britain diving at wookey resumed in early june 1946 when balcombe used his homemade respirator and waterproof suit to explore region between resurgence and first chamber as well as underground course of river between third and first chambers during these dives romano british remains were found and archaeological work dominated early dives in cave large ninth chamber was first entered on 24 april 1948 by balcombe and don coase using this as an advance dive base 10th and then 11th chambers were discovered way on however was too deep for divers breathing pure oxygen from a closed circuit rebreather cave claimed its first life on 9 april 1949 when gordon marriott lost his life returning from ninth chamber another fatality was to occur in 1981 when keith potter was drowned on a routine dive further upstream further progress required apparatus which could overcome depth limitation of breathing pure oxygen in 1955 using an aqualung and swimming with fins bob davies reached bottom of 11th chamber at depth in clear water and discovered 12th and 13th chambers he got separated from his guideline and other two divers in 11th chamber ending up spending three hours trapped in 13th chamber and had much trouble getting back to safety opinion hardened against use of short duration aqualung in favour of longer duration closed circuit equipment likewise traditional approach of walking along bottom was preferred over swimming employing semi closed circuit nitrogen oxygen rebreathers between 1957 and 1960 john buxton and oliver wells went on to reach elbow of sump upstream from ninth chamber at a depth of this was at a point known as slot way on being too deep for gas mixture they were breathing thumb cave diving equipment in museum at wookey hole caves a six year hiatus ensued while open circuit air diving became established along with free swimming and use of neoprene wetsuits new generation of cave diver was now more mobile above and under water and able to dive deeper using this approach dave savage was able to reach air surface in 18th chamber chambers did not have to have air spaces to be so named they were limits of each exploration in may 1966 a brief lull in exploration occurred while mess of guidelines laid from ninth chamber was sorted out before john parker progressed first to large dry inlet passage of 20th chamber and thence followed river axe upstream on a dive covering at a maximum depth of to 22nd chamber where way on appeared to be lost meanwhile climbing operations in ninth chamber found an abandoned outlet passage which terminated very close to surface as well as a dry overland route downstream through higher levels of eighth seventh and sixth chambers as far as fifth chamber these discoveries were used to enable show cave to be extended into ninth chamber and cave divers to start directly from here bypassing dive from third chamber onwards way on from 22nd chamber was at last found by colin edmond and martyn farr in february 1976 and was explored until line ran out a few days later geoff and oliver statham somewhat controversially reached 23rd chamber after laying just a further of line a further three short dives and they surfaced in 24th chamber to be confronted by what statham described as a magnificent sight whole of river axe pouring down a passage high by wide terminating in a blue lake after this lake was dived by farr a few days later for at a maximum depth of to emerge in 25th chamber a desolate muddy place named lake of gloom 25th chamber represents furthest upstream air surface in wookey hole cave from here river axe rises up from a deep sump where progressive depth records for cave diving in british isles have been set firstly by farr in 1977 then rob parker in 1985 and finally by john and rick stanton in 2004 pair returned again in 2005 to explore sump to a depth of setting a new british isles depth record for cave diving this record was broken in 2008 by polish explorer artur kozlowski then later again by michal marek on dives in in ireland during 1996 1997 water samples were collected at various points throughout caves and showed different chemical compositions results showed that location of unknown junction from where water flows to static sump in 22nd chamber by a different route from majority of river axe is upstream of sump in 25th witch of wookey hole thumb upright left skeleton in wells and mendip museum labelled as witch of wookey hole there are old legends of a witch of wookey hole which are still preserved in name of a stalagmite in first chamber of caves story has several different versions with same basic features a man from glastonbury is engaged to a young woman from wookey a witch living in wookey hole caves curses romance so that it fails man now a monk seeks revenge on this witch who having been jilted herself frequently spoils budding relationships monk stalks witch into cave and she hides in a dark corner near one of underground rivers monk blesses water and splashes some of it at dark parts of cave where witch was hiding blessed water immediately petrifies witch and she remains in cave to this day a 1000 year old skeleton of a woman was discovered in caves by balch in 1912 and has also traditionally been linked to legendary witch although analysis indicated that they are remains of a male aged between 25 35 remains have been part of collection of wells and mendip museum which was founded by balch since they were excavated though in 2004 owner of caves said that he wanted them to be returned to wookey hole it was partly legend of witch that prompted tv s most haunted team to visit wookey hole caves and mill to explore location in depth searching for evidence of paranormal activity show which aired on 10 march 2009 was last episode transmitted in series 11 of show s run on satellite and cable tv channel living in 2009 a new actor to play witch was chosen by wookey hole ltd amid much media interest carole bohanan in role of carla calamity was selected from over 3 000 applicants tourism thumb paper mill dates from around 1860 cave was first opened to public by owner captain g w hodgkinson in 1927 following preparatory work by balch three years later john cowper powys wrote of caves in novel a glastonbury romance hodgkinson took offence at portrayal of his fictional equivalent initiating a costly libel suit current paper mill building whose water wheel is powered by a small canal from river dates from around 1860 and is a grade ii listed building commercial production of handmade paper ceased in february 2008 after owner gerry cottle concluded there was no longer a market for product and therefore sold most of historic machinery visitors to site are still able to watch a short video of paper being made from cotton other attractions include dinosaur valley a small museum about cave and cave diving a theatre with circus shows a house of mirrors and penny arcades in 1956 olive hodgkinson a cave guide whose husband s family owned caves for over 500 years was a contestant on what s my line in late 1950s caves were photographed by stanley long of to be sold as both souvenirs and as mail order cave and mill were joined after purchase by madame tussauds in 1973 and operated together as a tourist attraction until there was a management team buyout in 1989 a collection of fairground art of wookey hole was sold in 1997 at christie s present owner is former circus proprietor gerry cottle who has introduced a circus school cave was used for filming of episodes of bbc tv series doctor who serial revenge of cybermen 1975 starring tom baker this has since been referenced in comedy of league of gentlemen cave was also used in filming of british series blake s 7 1978 and robin of sherwood 1983 caves were used again for doctor who in end of time 2009 including a scene with doctor sharing thoughts and visions with ood on 1 august 2006 cnn reported that barney a doberman pinscher employed as a security dog at wookey hole had destroyed parts of a valuable collection of teddy bears including one which had belonged to elvis presley which was estimated to be worth ps40 000 us 75 000 insurance company insuring exhibition of stuffed animals had insisted on having guard dog protection incident was in fact one of a number of publicity stunts which included a cave guide being locked in caves overnight and disappearance of a visiting dalek
