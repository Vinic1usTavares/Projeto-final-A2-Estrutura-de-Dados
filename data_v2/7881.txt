y gododdin is a medieval welsh poem consisting of a series of elegies to men of brittonic kingdom of gododdin and its allies who according to conventional interpretation died fighting angles of deira and bernicia at a place named catraeth in about ad 600 it is traditionally ascribed to bard aneirin and survives only in one manuscript book of aneirin book of aneirin manuscript is from later 13th century but y gododdin has been dated to between 7th and early 11th centuries text is partly written in middle welsh orthography and partly in old welsh early date would place its oral composition soon after battle presumably in hen ogledd old north as such it would have been written in cumbric dialect of common brittonic elliott 2005 p 583 jackson 1969 work is titled gododdin oldest scottish poem others consider it work of a poet from wales in 9th 10th or 11th century even a 9th century date would make it one of oldest surviving welsh works of poetry gododdin known in roman times as votadini held territories in what is now southeast scotland and northumberland part of hen ogledd poem tells how a force of 300 or 363 picked warriors were assembled some from as far afield as pictland and gwynedd after a year of feasting at din eidyn now edinburgh they attacked catraeth which is usually identified with catterick north yorkshire after several days of fighting against overwhelming odds nearly all warriors are killed poem is similar in ethos to heroic poetry with emphasis on heroes fighting primarily for glory but is not a narrative manuscript contains several stanzas which have no connection with gododdin and are considered to be interpolations one stanza in particular has received attention because it mentions king arthur in passing which if not an interpolation would be earliest known reference to that character book of aneirin manuscript only one early manuscript of y gododdin is known book of aneirin thought to date from second half of 13th century currently accepted view is that this manuscript contains work of two scribes usually known as a and b scribe a wrote down 88 stanzas of poem manuscript separates stanzas by use of large capitals but does not separate text into lines arrangement used by most editors follows that used by ifor williams in his 1938 edition then left a blank page before writing down four related poems known as gorchanau o hehir and sweetser considered that a third scribe whom they called c wrote text of gorchanau this view is disputed by huws who considers that these were work of scribe a see huws pp 34 48 this scribe wrote material down in middle welsh orthography scribe b added material later and apparently had access to an earlier manuscript since material added by this scribe is in old welsh orthography scribe b wrote 35 stanzas some of which are variants of stanzas also given by scribe a while others are not given by a last stanza is incomplete and three folios are missing from end of manuscript so some material may have been lost jarman 1998 p xiv differences exist within material added by scribe b first 23 stanzas of b material show signs of partial modernisation of orthography while remainder shows much more retention of old welsh features jarman explains this by suggesting that scribe b started by partially modernising orthography as he copied stanzas but after a while tired of this and copied remaining stanzas as they were in older manuscript isaac suggested that scribe b was using two sources called b1 and b2 koch 1997 p lxvi if this is correct material in books of aneirin is from three sources poem thumb 240px right edinburgh castle viewed from princes street around 600 ad this may have been site of hall of mynyddog mwynfawr where warriors feasted before setting forth to battle stanzas that make up hehir considers that y gododdin is better understood as a collection of poems on related topics see o hehir p 66 are a series of elegies for warriors who fell in battle against vastly superior numbers some of verses refer to entire host and others eulogize individual heroes they tell how ruler of gododdin mynyddog mwynfawr gathered warriors from several brythonic kingdoms and provided them with a year s feasting and drinking mead in his halls at din eidyn before launching a campaign in which almost all of them were killed fighting against overwhelming odds one stanza mentions 100 000 of enemy another mentions a ratio of 180 for each one of warriors of gododdin poetry is based on a fixed number of syllables though some irregularity occurs which may be due to modernisation of language during oral transmission it uses rhyme both end rhyme and internal and some parts use alliteration a number of stanzas may open with same words for example gwyr a gan wawr men went to catraeth at dawn collection appears to have been compiled from two different versions according to some verses there were 300 men of gododdin and only one cynon ap clydno survived others have 363 warriors and three survivors in addition to poet who as a bard almost certainly would not have been counted as one of warriors names of about 80 warriors are given in poem names are listed in jarman 1998 pp xxx xxxi book of aneirin begins with introduction yw e aneirin ae cant this is gododdin aneirin sang it first stanza appears to be a reciter s prologue composed after death of aneirin second stanza praises an individual hero other stanzas praise entire host for example number 13 mead is mentioned in many stanzas sometimes with suggestion that it is linked to their deaths this led some 19th century editors to assume that warriors went into battle drunk this idea goes back at least to turner in 1803 however williams explained that mead here stood for everything warriors received from their lord in return they were expected to pay their mead by being loyal to their lord unto death a similar concept is found in anglo saxon poetry williams 1938 pp xlviii heroes commemorated in poem are mounted warriors there are many references to horses in poem there are references to spears swords and shields and to use of armour from latin williams 1938 pp lxii lxiii there are several references which indicate that they were christians for example penance and altar while enemy are described as heathens several of these features can be seen in stanza 33 however d simon evans has suggested that most if not all of references which point to christianity may be later additions evans 1977 p 44 many personal names are given but only two are recorded in other sources one of warriors was cynon ap clydno whom williams identifies with cynon ap clydno who is mentioned in old pedigrees williams p 175 other personal name recorded in other sources is arthur if mention of arthur formed part of original poem this could be earliest reference to arthur as a paragon of bravery jarman in his 1988 edition lists stanza as a possible interpolation koch in his 1997 study considers stanza as probably archaic before 638 within stanza reference to arthur is proved by rhyme see koch 1997 pp 147 8 in stanza 99 poet praises one of warriors many of warriors were not from lands of gododdin among places mentioned are thought to be area around river ayr and area around leeds still called elmet others came from further afield for example one came from beyond a reference to mountains between stirling thought to have been manaw gododdin territory and dumbarton chief fort of brythonic kingdom of strathclyde this warrior must have come from pictland others came from gwynedd in north wales jackson 1969 pp 5 7 interpolations three of stanzas included in manuscript have no connection with subject matter of remainder except that they are also associated with southern scotland or northern england rather than wales one of these is a stanza which celebrates victory of britons of kingdom of strathclyde under eugein i here described as grandson of over domnall brecc dyfnwal in welsh king of dal riata at battle of strathcarron in 642 another stanza appears to be part of separate cycle of poems associated with llywarch hen third interpolation is a poem entitled dinogad s smock a cradle song addressed to a baby named dinogad describing how his father goes hunting and fishing jarman 1998 pp lxi lxiii interpolations are thought to have been added to poem after it had been written down these stanzas first being written down where there was a space in manuscript then being incorporated in poem by a later copier who failed to realise that they did not belong strathcarron stanza for example is first stanza in b text of book of aneirin and jackson suggested that it had probably been inserted on a blank space at top of first page of original manuscript jackson 1969 p 48 according to koch s reconstruction this stanza was deliberately added to text in strathclyde analysis and interpretation date date of y gododdin has been subject of debate among scholars since early 19th century turner 1803 pp iii iv if poem was composed soon after battle it must predate 638 when fall of din eidyn was recorded in reign of oswy king of bernicia an event which is thought to have meant collapse of kingdom of gododdin jackson 1969 p 10 if it is a later composition latest date which could be ascribed to it is determined by orthography of second part of scribe b s text this is usually considered to be that of 9th or 10th centuries although some scholars consider that it could be from 11th century evans 1982 p 17 most of debate about date of poem has employed linguistic arguments mostly concerning rhyme since more is known about early welsh phonology than other aspects of language like syntax it is believed that around time of battle british language was transitioning into its daughter languages primitive form of welsh in wales of cornish and breton in southwestern britain and brittany and cumbric in northern britain davies 2005 p 232 kenneth jackson concludes that majority of changes that transformed british into primitive welsh belong to period from middle of 5th to end of 6th century jackson 1953 pp 3 11 690 this involved syncope and loss of final syllables if poem dates to this time it would have been written in an early form of cumbric usual name for brythonic speech of hen ogledd jackson suggested name primitive cumbric for dialect spoken at time jackson 1969 pp 86 90 sweetser gives example of name found in gododdin in british this would have been middle unstressed o and final unstressed os have been lost sweetser 1988 p 140 ifor williams whose 1938 text laid foundations for modern scholarly study of poetry considered that part of it could be regarded as being of likely late 6th century origin this would have been orally transmitted for a period before being written down williams 1938 pp xc xciii dillon cast doubt on date of composition arguing that it is unlikely that by end of 6th century primitive welsh would have developed into a language not notably earlier than that of ninth century he suggests that poetry may have been composed in 9th century on traditional themes and attributed to aneirin dillon 1973 pp 267 8 jackson however considers that there is no real substance in these arguments and points out that poetry would have been transmitted orally for a long period before being written down and would have been modernised by reciters and that there is in any case nothing in language used which would rule out a date around 600 jackson 1969 pp 88 91 koch suggests a rather earlier date about 570 and also suggests that poem may have existed in written form by 7th century much earlier than usually thought koch reviewing arguments about date of poetry in 1997 states koch himself believes that a considerable part of poem can be dated to 6th century greene in 1971 considered that language of poem was 9th century rather than 6th century greene 1971 pp 1 11 and isaac writing in 1999 stated that linguistic evidence did not necessitate dating poem as a whole before 9th or 10th century isaac 1999 pp 55 78 other approach to dating poetry has been to look at it from a historical point of view charles edwards writing in 1978 concluded that dumville commenting on these attempts to establish historicity of poem in 1988 said case for authenticity whatever exactly we mean by that is not proven but that does not mean that it cannot be dumville 1998 p 8 likewise patrick sims williams concluded in 2016 that evaluating supposed proofs that poems in books of aneirin and taliesin cannot go back to sixth century we have found them either to be incorrect or to apply to only a very few lines or stanzas that may be explained as additions it seems impossible to prove however that any poem must go back to sixth century linguistically and cannot be a century or more later patrick sims williams dating poems of aneirin and taliesin zeitschrift fur celtische philologie 63 2016 163 234 p 217 doi 10 1515 2016 0008 september 2016 fact that great majority of warriors mentioned in poem are not known from other sources has been put forward by several authors as an argument against idea that poem could be a later composition poems which are known to be later forgeries have clearly been written for a purpose for example to strengthen claims of a particular dynasty men commemorated in y gododdin do not appear in pedigrees of any welsh dynasty jarman 1998 p lxix breeze comments it is difficult to see why a later poet should take trouble to commemorate men who but for poem would be forgotten breeze 1997 p 14 background thumb left 240px gododdin and neighbouring kingdoms poem is set in area which is now southern scotland and north east england around year 600 this area included a number of brythonic kingdoms apart from gododdin kingdom of alt clut occupied strathclyde area and rheged covered parts of galloway lancashire and cumbria further south lay kingdom of elmet in leeds area these areas made up what was later known in welsh as yr hen ogledd old north gododdin known as votadini in romano british period occupied a territory from area around head of firth of forth as far south as river wear in modern terms their lands included much of and lothian and borders regions their capital at this period may have been called din eidyn now known as edinburgh by this time area that later became northumbria had been invaded and increasingly occupied by anglo saxon kingdoms of deira and bernicia jackson 1969 pp 5 9 in historia brittonum attributed to nennius there is a reference to several poets in this area during 6th century having mentioned ida of bernicia founder of northumbrian royal line who ruled between 547 and 559 historia goes on to say nothing has been preserved of work of and cian but poems attributed to taliesin were published by ifor williams in canu taliesin and were considered by him to be comparable in antiquity to gododdin this poetry praises urien of rheged and his son owain and refers to urien as lord of catraeth williams 1972 p 49 interpretation y gododdin is not a narrative poem but a series of elegies for heroes who died in a battle whose history would have been familiar to original listeners context of poem has to be worked out from text itself there have been various interpretations of events recorded in poem 19th century welsh scholar thomas stephens identified gododdin with votadini and catraeth as catterick in north yorkshire stephens 1876 p 3 he linked poem to battle of degsastan in c 603 between king aethelfrith of bernicia and gaels under aedan mac gabrain king of dal gwenogvryn evans in his 1922 edition and translation of book of aneirin claimed that poem referred to a battle around menai strait in 1098 emending text to fit theory williams 1972 pp 58 9 generally accepted interpretation for battle of catraeth is that put forward by ifor williams in his canu aneirin first published in 1938 williams interpreted mynydawc in text to refer to a person mynyddog mwynfawr in modern welsh mynyddog in his version was king of gododdin with his chief seat at din eidyn modern edinburgh around year 600 mynyddog gathered about 300 selected warriors some from as far afield as gwynedd he feasted them at din eidyn for a year then launched an attack on catraeth which williams agrees with stephens in identifying as catterick which was in anglo saxon hands they were opposed by a larger army from anglo saxon kingdoms of deira and bernicia williams pp xxiii xlviii battle at catraeth has been seen as an attempt to resist advance of angles who had probably by then occupied former votadini lands of bryneich in modern north eastern england and made it their kingdom of bernicia at some time after battle angles absorbed gododdin kingdom possibly after fall of their capital din eidyn in 638 and incorporated it into kingdom of northumbria this interpretation has been accepted by most modern scholars jackson accepts interpretation but suggests that a force of 300 men would be much too small to undertake task demanded of them he considers that 300 mounted warriors would have been accompanied by a larger number of foot soldiers not considered worthy of mention in poem jackson 1969 pp 13 18 jarman also follows williams interpretation jarman 1998 pp xxi xxiv jackson suggested that after fall of kingdom of gododdin in or about 638 poem was preserved in strathclyde which maintained its independence for several centuries he considers that it was first written down in strathclyde after a period of oral transmission and may have reached wales in manuscript form between end of 8th and end of 9th century jackson 1969 pp 63 7 there would be particular interest in matters relating to gododdin in gwynedd since founding myth of kingdom involved coming of from manaw gododdin alternative interpretation in 1997 john koch published a new study of y gododdin which involved an attempt to reconstruct original poetry written in what koch terms archaic neo brittonic this work also included a new and very different interpretation of background of poetry he draws attention to a poem in canu taliesin entitled gweith gwen ystrat battle of gwen ystrat there is also a reference to catraeth in slightly later poem cadwallon a panegyric addressed to cadwallon ap cadfan of gwynedd thought to have been composed in about 633 woolf has recently suggested that british king who led a coalition including penda of mercia to overthrow and kill edwin king of deira was from northern england rather than gwynedd however this would not affect koch s argument here two lines in this poem are translated by koch as fierce gwallawc wrought great and renowned mortality at catraeth he identifies gwallawc as who was one of kings who fought against bernicia in alliance with urien koch draws attention to mention of meibion sons of as an enemy in stanza 15 of gododdin and points out that according to old welsh genealogies urien and other brittonic kings were descendants of coil hen koch 1997 pp xxiii xxv he considers that in view of references in three poems there is a case for identifying attack on catraeth recorded in y gododdin with battle of gwen ystrat this would date poem to about 570 rather than c 600 favoured by williams and others he interprets gododdin as having fought brythons of rheged and alt clut over a power struggle in elmet with anglian allies on both sides rheged being in an alliance with deira he points out that according to historia it was rhun son of urien rheged who baptized princess eanflaed of deira her father edwin and 12 000 of his subjects in 626 7 koch 1997 p xxxiii urien rheged was thus real victor of battle mynyddog mwynfawr was not a person s name but a personal description meaning mountain feast or mountain chief wmffre 2002 agrees that mynyddog is not a personal name but suggests that it is a reference to christian god see wmffre pp 83 105 some aspects of koch s view of historical context have been criticised by both oliver padel and tim clarkson clarkson for example makes point that reference in gweith gwen ystrat is to men of catraeth it does not state that battle was fought at catraeth and also that according to bede it was paulinus not rhun who baptized deirans editions and translations first known translation of y gododdin was by evan evans ieuan fardd who printed ten stanzas with a latin translation in his book some specimens of poetry of antient welsh bards published in 1764 jarman 1998 p lxxxii full text was printed for first time by owen jones in in 1801 english translations of poem were published by william probert in 1820 and by john williams ab ithel in 1852

south glamorgan county council and national library of wales in 1989 john koch s new edition which aimed to recreate original text appeared in 1997 there have also been a number of translations which aim to present gododdin as literature rather than as a subject of scholarly study examples are translation by joseph p clancy in earliest welsh poetry 1970 and steve short s 1994 translation cultural influence there are a number of references to y gododdin in later medieval welsh poetry well known 12th century poem owain by owain cyfeiliog in which owain praises his own war band likens them to heroes of gododdin and uses y gododdin as a model a slightly later poet dafydd in a eulogy addressed to llywelyn great wishes to be inspired to sing as aneirin sang day he sang gododdin after this period this poetry seems to have been forgotten in wales for centuries until evan evans ieuan fardd discovered manuscript in late 18th century from early 19th century onwards there are many allusions in welsh poetry in english y gododdin was a major influence on long poem in parenthesis 1937 by david jones in which he reflects on carnage he witnessed in first world war jarman 1998 p lxxxvi jones put a quotation from gododdin at beginning of each of seven sections of in parenthesis another poet writing in english richard used y gododdin as basis of his difficult but much admired poem for
