operation dragoon initially operation anvil was code name for landing operation of allied invasion of provence southern france on 15august 1944 operation was initially planned to be executed in conjunction with operation overlord allied landing in normandy but lack of available resources led to a cancellation of second landing by july 1944 landing was reconsidered as clogged up ports in normandy did not have capacity to adequately supply allied forces concurrently french high command pushed for a revival of operation that would include large numbers of french troops as a result operation was finally approved in july to be executed in august goal of invasion was to secure vital ports on french mediterranean coast and increase pressure on german forces by opening another front after some preliminary commando operations us vi corps landed on beaches of cote d azur under shield of a large naval task force followed by several divisions of french army b they were opposed by scattered forces of german army group g which had been weakened by relocation of its divisions to other fronts and replacement of its soldiers with third rate ostlegionen outfitted with obsolete equipment hindered by total allied air superiority and a large scale uprising by french resistance weak german forces were swiftly defeated germans withdrew to north through rhone valley to establish a stable defense line at dijon allied mobile units were able to overtake germans and partially block their route at town of montelimar ensuing battle led to a stalemate with neither side able to achieve a decisive breakthrough until germans were finally able to complete their withdrawal and retreat from town while germans were retreating french managed to capture important ports of marseille and toulon putting them into operation soon after germans were not able to hold dijon and ordered a complete withdrawal from southern france army groupg retreated further north pursued by allied forces fighting ultimately came to a stop at vosges mountains where army groupg was finally able to establish a stable defense line after meeting with allied units from operation overlord allied forces were in need of reorganizing and facing stiffened german resistance offensive was halted on 14september operation dragoon was considered a success by allies it enabled them to liberate most of southern france in a time span of only four weeks while inflicting heavy casualties on german forces although a substantial part of best german units were able to escape captured french ports were put into operation allowing allies to solve their supply problems soon after background prelude during planning stages operation was known as anvil to complement operation sledgehammer at that time code name for invasion of normandy subsequently both plans were renamed sledgehammer became operation overlord and anvil becoming operation dragoon original idea of invading southern france had come in 1942 from general george marshall u s army chief of staff it was supported by joseph stalin at tehran conference in late 1943 in discussions with franklin d roosevelt stalin advocated for operation as an inherent part of overlord preferring to have allies in far west instead of at an alternative landing in balkans which he considered to be in his zone of influence marshall insisted that operation be included in strategic planning and roosevelt found cancelling operation to be unpalatable operation dragoon was controversial from time it was first proposed american military leadership and its british counterparts disagreed on operation winston churchill argued against it on grounds that it diverted military resources that were better deployed for allied operations in italy instead he favored an invasion of oil producing regions of balkans churchill reasoned that by attacking balkans allies could deny germany petroleum forestall advance of red army and achieve a superior negotiating position in postwar europe all at a stroke when first planned landings were to take place in normandy and anvil in south of france a dual landing was soon recognized as impossible to conduct with forces available expansion of overlord from a three to a five division front required many additional lsts which would have been needed for anvil another allied amphibious landing in italy at anzio had gone badly all of these resulted in postponing of anvil by allies after landing at normandy a revival of anvil became increasingly attractive to allied planners normandy ports had insufficient capacity to handle allied supply needs and french generals under charles de gaulle pressed for a direct attack on southern france with participation of french troops these factors led to a reconsideration of plan despite churchill s objections operation was authorized by allied combined chiefs of staff on 14july then renamed dragoon on 1august landing was scheduled for 15august churchill and his chiefs of staff had opposed dragoon in favour of reinforcing campaign in italy by capturing trieste landing on istria peninsula and moving through ljubljana gap into austria and hungary then on august 4 churchill proposed that dragoon less than two weeks away should be switched to coast of brittany eisenhower supported by roosevelt who with his 1944 election campaign four months away opposed diverting large forces to balkans stood firm on agreed plan despite long harangues from churchill on august 5 and 9 planning thumb 300px a map showing allied amphibious landings and advance in southern france as well as german defensive positions chief objectives of operation dragoon were important french ports of marseille and toulon considered essential to supply growing allied forces in france allied planners were cautious taking heed of lessons learned from anzio and normandy landings they chose a location with no high ground controlled by wehrmacht conditions that had led to heavy casualties after initial landings on omaha beach at normandy choice for disembarkation site was an area on var coast east of toulon a preliminary air campaign was planned to isolate battlefield and cut germans off from reinforcement by destroying several key bridges a large airborne landing was also planned in center of landing zone to quickly seize high ground overlooking beaches parallel to invasion several commando units were to take control of islands off coast allied plan consisted of a three division landing of us forces led by major general lucian truscott to secure a bridgehead on first day their flanks were to be protected by french american and canadian commando units within 24 hours 50 000 60 000 troops and 6 500 vehicles were to be disembarked airborne landings would concentrate in an area near draguignan and le muy with aim of taking these towns to prevent german counterattacks against beaches bulk of american force then had to advance quickly to north along rhone to take lyon and dijon and make contact with allied forces in northern france after a successful initial landing units of french were to land given task of taking french ports of toulon and marseille although germans expected another allied landing in mediterranean advancing red army and allied landings in normandy placed great strains on german resources so little was done to improve condition of army group g occupying southern france given advancing allied forces in northern france germans deemed a realistic defense in south impossible johannes blaskowitz s army groupg headquarters discussed a general withdrawal from southern france in july and august with german high command but 20 july plot led to an atmosphere in which any withdrawal was out of question blaskowitz was quite aware that with his scattered forces any serious allied landing attempt would be impossible to ward off he planned to withdraw in secret to include demolishing ports and to proceed in an orderly manner covered by 11th panzer division he intended to establish a new defense line at dijon in central france german intelligence was aware of impending allied landing and on 13august blaskowitz ordered 11th panzer division to move east of rhone where landing was expected opposing forces thumb upright german 88 mm gun on coast in southern france western naval task force was formed under command of vice admiral henry kent hewitt to carry u s 6th army group also known as southern group or dragoon force onto shore 6th army group was formed in corsica and activated on 1august to consolidate french and american forces slated to invade southern france admiral hewitt s naval support for operation included american battleships nevada texas and arkansas british battleship ramillies and french battleship with 20 cruisers for gunfire support and naval aircraft from 9 escort carriers assembled as task main ground force for operation was us seventh army commanded by alexander patch us army s vi corps commanded by major general lucian truscott would carry out initial landing and be followed by french army b under command of general jean de lattre de tassigny accompanying operation was a fully mobilized separate detachment called task force butler consisting of bulk of allied tanks tank destroyers and mechanized infantry french resistance played a major role in fighting as allies advanced into france resistance evolved from a guerilla fighting force to a army called french forces of interior ffi ffi would tie down german troops by sabotaging bridges and communication lines seizing important traffic hubs and directly attacking isolated german forces they were aided by allied special forces from office of strategic services oss who would supply allies with vital intelligence allied ground and naval forces were supported by a large aerial fleet of planes majority of them were stationed on corsica and sardinia tactical bombers and fighters had to support landings directly while strategic element had to bomb german targets deep into france strategic bombing started well before landing and targeted airports traffic hubs railroads coastal defenses and communication lines opposing allies was german army group g although nominally an army group army group g had at time of invasion only one army under its command 19th army led by friedrich wiese as southern france had never been important to german planning their forces there had been stripped of nearly all their valuable units and equipment over course of war due to allied threat in normandy army group g s units were continuously sent north until dragoon landings remaining 11 divisions were understrength and only one panzer division was left 11th in early august 11th panzer division had sent one of its two panzer battalions to normandy shortly before landing troops were positioned thinly along french coast with an average of per division generally troops of german divisions were only second and third rate this meant that over course of war divisions were thinned out and soldiers were replaced with wounded old veterans and volksdeutsche from poland and czechoslovakia numerous units were also replaced by ostlegionen and these units were volunteers from eastern europe mainly soviet union and had a generally low fighting morale equipment of those troops was in poor shape consisting of old weapons from various nations with french polish soviet italian and czech guns artillery and mortars four of german divisions were designated as static which meant that they were stripped of all of their mobile capabilities and unable to move from their positions only potent unit inside army group g was 11th panzer division which was commanded by wend von wietersheim german chain of command was overly complex with parallel chains for occupation forces land forces luftwaffe and kriegsmarine luftwaffe with 200 aircraft and kriegsmarine with 45 small ships played a negligible role in operation german defense was aided by extensive coastal artillery placements which had been constructed in years before landing after fall of france vichy french regime greatly improved coastal defenses to appease germans along coast about 75 coastal guns of heavy and medium caliber were placed toulon was protected by a complex of heavy gun artillery batteries in mounted turrets after their military take over in november 1942 germans improved coastal defense further by repairing damaged and outdated turrets as well as moving in additional guns this included guns taken from dismantled french battleship provence operation preliminary operations thumb upright 1 4 u s paratroopers of 517th parachute regimental combat team prepare for landings to ensure success of dragoon and support initial landings preliminary commando operations had to be carried out first target was hyeres islands specifically port cros and levant guns of german garrisons on both islands could reach proposed allied landing area and sea lanes that troops would follow first special service force a joint u s canadian special forces unit trained in amphibious assault and mountaineering and consisting of three regiments received order to take islands as part of operation sitka landings on port cros and levant started simultaneously on 14august on levant 2nd and 3rd regiments of first special service force faced sporadic resistance that became more intense when german garrison forces came together in area of port men of first special service force gained upper hand and discovered that coastal defense battery allied naval forces were worried about was actually several well camouflaged dummy weapons on port cros 1st regiment drove german garrison to western side of island to an old fort fighting continued through 16august when darkness fell german guns on french mainland at cap benat shelled port cros hms ramillies took aim at fort where germans were barricaded german garrison surrendered on morning of 17august with both islands in allied hands men of first special service force transferred to mainland where they were attached to first airborne task force meanwhile at cap negre to west of main invasion a large group of french commandos destroyed german artillery emplacements as part of operation romeo their main effort was supported by diversionary flank landings by other commando teams while main mission succeeded 67 french commandos were taken prisoner after they ran into a minefield in addition to commando operations another operation was carried out named operation span this was a deception plan aimed to confuse german defenders with fake landings and paratroopers to disperse them from actual landing zones main invasion force landings thumb operation dragoon landings preceding bombing missions together with resistance sabotage acts hit germans heavily interrupting railroads damaging bridges and disrupting communication network landing started on morning of 15august ships of western naval task force approached under cover of darkness and were in position at dawn first of 1 300 allied bombers from italy sardinia and corsica began aerial bombardment shortly before 06 00 bombing was nearly continuous until 07 30 when battleships and cruisers launched spotting aircraft and began firing on specific targets detected by aerial surveillance naval gunfire ceased as landing craft headed ashore at 08 00 relatively steep beach gradients with small tidal range discouraged axis placement of underwater obstacles but landing beaches had been defensively mined lcis leading first wave of landing craft fired rockets to explode land mines on beaches to be used by following troops main landing force consisted of three divisions of vi corps 3rd infantry division landed on left at alpha beach sur mer 45th infantry division landed in centre at delta beach le muy saint tropez and 36th infantry division landed on right at camel beach saint raphael landings were overwhelmingly successful on delta and alpha beaches german resistance was low surrendered quickly and biggest threats to allies were mines a single german gun and a mortar position were silenced by destroyer fire allied units in this sector were able to secure a bridgehead and quickly linked up with paratroopers capturing saint tropez and lemuy most serious fighting was on camel beach near town of saint raphael this beach was defended by several well emplaced coastal guns as well as flak batteries through heavy german fire allies attempted to land at shore however at sector red of camel beach landing zone allies were not able to succeed a bombing run of b 24 bombers was called in against a german strongpoint here even with assistance of naval fire allies were not able to bring landing ships close to shore they decided to avoid camel red and land only at sectors of camel blue and camel green which was successful allied casualties at landings were very light with only and 385 wounded 40 of those casualties were caused by a rocket boosted henschel hs 293 guided gliding bomb launched from a do 217 bomber aircraft by a rare appearance of bomber wing kg 100 which sank tank landing ship in conjunction with sea landing airborne and glider landings mission albatross followed by mission dove mission bluebird and mission canary around area of le muy were carried out they were as successful as beach landings with only 104 dead 24 of which were caused by glider accidents and 18 by parachute accidents german counterattacks french sabotage by ffi together with allied bombing severed german communication lines causing initial confusion among troops german field commanders were not able to communicate with army groupg s headquarters despite hampered communications german commanders acted independently to put measures in effect to counter allied invasion directly facing brunt of allied landings was german lxii corps at draguignan commanded by ferdinand neuling allied paratroopers interrupted his communication lines and trapped his headquarters in city he therefore ordered nearby 148th infantry division to counterattack against beaches at lemuy just before allied paratroopers cut him off completely wiese as commander of 19th army was also unable to contact blaskowitz s army groupg headquarters but implemented a plan to push allied forces in raphael region back into sea unilaterally with almost no mobile reserves to react against beach landings he ordered commander of 189th infantry division richard von schwerin to establish an ad hoc battle group kampfgruppe from all nearby units to counterattack allied bridgeheads in this area while vonschwerin assembled all men he could find 148th infantry division near draguignan encountered heavy resistance from ffi which had been reinforced by british paratroopers upsetting plan for a swift counterattack toward beaches while germans were unable to mount a counterattack against allied beachheads on 15august by morning of 16august vonschwerin had finally assembled a force about size of four infantry battalions with this force he launched a two pronged assault towards lemuy and allied bridgehead as well as toward draguignan to relieve headquarters there by that time allies had already landed a significant number of troops vehicles and tanks allied mobile forces of 45thdivision went out against german forces themselves division surrounded town of recently reoccupied by vonschwerin s troops and attempted to isolate german forces there after heavy fighting throughout day vonschwerin ordered his troops to retreat under cover of night at same time heavy fighting occurred at saint raphael mobile units of 148th infantry division finally had arrived there and encountered u s 3rd division which was trying to take saint raphael this attack however was fruitless by 17august german counter attacks had been largely defeated saint raphael was secured together with a large bridgehead along coastline and mobile forces had linked up with airborne troops in lemuy french troops had been pouring ashore since 16august passing to left of american troops with objective of toulon and marseille by night of 16 17 august army group g headquarters realized that it could not drive allies back into sea simultaneously in northern france encirclement of falaise pocket threatened loss of large numbers of german forces given precarious situation adolf hitler moved away from his no step backwards agenda and agreed to an okw plan for complete withdrawal of army and b okw plan was for all german forces except stationary fortress troops in southern france to move north to link up with army to form a new defensive line from sens through dijon to swiss frontier two german divisions 148th and 157th were to retreat into french italian alps allies were privy to german plan through ultra interception german navy s response was minimal kriegsmarine had some 25 surface ships mostly torpedoboats and smaller though main anti invasion force 10th torpedoboat flotilla based at genoa had just four torpedoboats fit for service during dragoon and this force took no action against invasion fleet o hara p248 there were two actions against allied naval forces taken by other units on 15 august off port cros us destroyer encountered two german warships and in a short action sank both o hara p248 p96 on 17 august off la ciotat a force of two german warships encountered a force of pt boats and gunboats staging a diversionary attack their destroyer escort engaged both vessels and after an hour long gun battle both german vessels were sunk o hara 249 kriegsmarine also had a u boat force based at toulon operating in western mediterranean by summer of 1944 this had been reduced to eight u boats and in air raids prior to dragoon five were destroyed blair p88 on night of 17 august one boat u 407 attempted to sortie she ran aground leaving harbour and was scuttled by her crew other two u boats took no action and were scuttled to avoid capture before fall of toulon roskill p101 german withdrawal germans started withdrawal while motorized allied forces broke out from their bridgeheads and pursued german units from behind rapid allied advance posed a major threat for germans who could not retreat fast enough germans tried to establish a defense line at rhone to shield withdrawal of several valuable units there us 45th and 3rd divisions were pressing to north west with uncontested speed undermining wiese s plan for a new defense line and were taken by two american divisions on 19august which also were about to envelop toulon as well as marseille from north cutting off german units there in northeast german problems loomed as large taskforce allied mechanized component of pushing north of draguignan on 18august neuling s surrounded lxii corps headquarters attempted an unsuccessful breakout and was finally captured with rest of city after some fighting german troops in this area were exhausted and demoralized from fighting against ffi so taskforce butler was also able to advance at high speed digne was liberated on 18august at grenoble 157th reserve infantry division faced allied advance and its commander decided to retreat on 21august toward alps this decision would prove to be fatal for germans as it left a large gap in eastern flank of retreating army groupg blaskowitz now decided to sacrifice 242nd infantry division in toulon as well as 244th infantry division in marseille to buy time for rest of army groupg to retreat through rhone valley while 11th panzer division and 198th infantry division would shield retreat in several defense lines liberation of marseille and toulon thumb jean de lattre de tassigny walking through liberated city of marseille meanwhile disembarked french units started to head for marseille and toulon initial plan was to capture ports in succession but unexpected allied advance allowed french commander de lattre de tassigny to attack both ports almost simultaneously he split his forces into two units with joseph de de monsabert given task to take toulon from east while edgard de larminat drove north to encircle city at flanks germans had a significant force stationed in both cities but they lacked time to prepare for a determined defense after heavy fighting around hyeres which temporarily stopped advance french forces approached toulon on 19august at same time monsabert swung around city enveloped it and cut off highway between toulon and marseille on 21august french pressed into toulon and heavy fighting ensued heavy german resistance led to an argument between larminat and detassigny after which detassigny took over direct command of operation dismissing larminat by 26august remaining german units had surrendered battle for toulon cost french 2 700 casualties but they captured all remaining german forces which lost their entire garrison of 18 000 men at same time monsabert s attempt to liberate marseille commenced at first a german force at was defeated before french troops attacked city directly unlike toulon german commander at marseille did not evacuate civilian population which became increasingly hostile resulting fighting with ffi troops further weakened german units which were exhausted from partisan fighting wehrmacht was not able to defend on a broad front and soon crumbled into numerous isolated strongpoints on 27august most of city was liberated with only a few small strongpoints remaining and on 28august german troops issued official surrender battle caused 1 825 french casualties but 11 000 german troops were captured in both harbours german engineers had demolished port facilities to deny their use to allies battle at montelimar thumb 200px upright allied advance until mid september while marseille and toulon were liberated german retreat continued 11th panzer division started several feint attacks toward aix en provence to discourage any further allied advance by doing so lxxxvcorps as well as field corps were able to successfully retreat from allied advance at rhone allies were unsure of german intentions and truscott decided to try to trap germans with a right flank movement whilst pursuing them with his three divisions from vicorps however uncertainty at allied headquarters led to indecisiveness and allies missed several opportunities to cut off retreating lxxxvcorps through decryption of german radio communications allied headquarters became aware of german withdrawal plan they recognized open german flank to east of rhone at grenoble due to retreat of 157th infantry division towards alps to seize this opportunity taskforce butler was ordered to advance in this direction paralleling german evacuation effort and ultimately cutting them off further north while doing so it fought some scattered german resistance and finally after turning left found itself near montelimar a small city on east bank of rhone river this town lay directly on german escape route following taskforce butler was 36th infantry division together they were asked on to block german force at montelimar and continue northward advance to grenoble while vicorps was pursuing germans from behind however after this speedy advance forward allied forces suffered now from a serious lack of fuel and supplies which made this task difficult on 21 august taskforce butler occupied hills north of town of montelimar according to revised orders from truscott as he considered it too weak to block entire german force marching north from this position taskforce butler fired on evacuating german troops while waiting for further reinforcements troops from ffi supported americans harassing german troops through entire battle sudden appearance of this new threat shocked wiese and german command as a first countermeasure wietersheim s 11thpanzer division was called in first of its units to arrive together with several ad hoc luftwaffe battle groups were asked to deal with this new threat this hastily assembled force mounted an attack against puy same day and germans were able to isolate taskforce butler from supplies this success was however short lived and germans were pushed back soon after next day first units of 36th division arrived reinforcing taskforce butler however allied troops were still short of supplies and lacked enough men to directly attack german escape route during next few days more allied men and supplies trickled in at same time us 45thdivision took over positions at grenoble leaving 36thdivision free to fully commit its forces at montelimar taskforce butler was officially dissolved on 23august and john e dahlquist commander of now fully arrived 36thinfantry division assumed direct control of its units for rest of day only small skirmishes occurred between german and allied forces meanwhile germans also struggled to bring 11thpanzer division through chaos of evacuation into position in town by a substantial number of 11thpanzer division had finally reached battle area with his newly reorganised units dahlquist attempted a direct attack against montelimar which failed against newly arrived german tank units subsequent german counter attack gained some ground against hills occupied by allies its aim was to push americans from hills north of montelimar and to force american artillery to move back out of range after fighting germans captured a copy of dahlquist s operational plans giving them a better picture of allied forces as a result wiese planned a major attack for 25august by 11thpanzer division and 198th infantry division together with some ad hoc luftwaffe battlegroups this attack was however also a big failure allies struck back and retook hills north of montelimar and were able to establish a temporary roadblock on german escape route again this allied success also did not last long as another attack led by wietersheim reopened passage at midnight after repeated german counterattacks prevented any lasting roadblock truscott finally allowed reinforcements from 45thdivision to support dahlquist at montelimar as he felt successful operations further south at french ports allowed him to refocus to north at same time germans also reinforced their fighting force over next few days a stalemate emerged with allies unable to block retreat route and germans unable to clear area of allied forces both sides became increasingly frustrated during fighting with attack counterattack and spoiling attacks which made launching a decisive offensive hard for 36thdivision whilst 36thdivision had surrounded 19tharmy they themselves were almost surrounded too during chaotic fighting with only a thin supply route to east open resulting in their having to fight to front and rear as 36thdivision was seemingly making no progress an angry truscott arrived at dahlquist s headquarters on 26august to relieve him of command however on seeing heavy terrain and shattered forces he refrained and left headquarters again finally during 26 28august majority of german forces were able to escape leaving behind 4 000 burnt out vehicles and 1 500 dead horses on 29august allies captured montelimar and final german troops trying to break out surrendered germans suffered 2 100 battle casualties plus 8 000 pows while americans had 1 575 casualties total pow losses of 19tharmy now amounted to 57 000 final german retreat vi corps together with units from french at its flank pursued and tried to cut off german forces on their way toward town of dijon while germans planned to prevent another montelimar with a defensive shield by 11thpanzer division allied 45th and as well as 11thpanzer division were racing north to fulfill their objectives in meantime germans tried to continue with evacuation through lyon behind their flight germans destroyed bridges hoping this would slow down allied advance however 45thdivision was able to bypass german forces taking town of on 1september this again posed a threat to german evacuation after some initial skirmishes 11thpanzer division launched a heavy attack into city causing 215 american casualties and destroying a number of tanks and vehicles at same time main german units retreated through lyon on 2september 36thinfantry division arrived at lyon to find maquis fighting with much of factory areas on fire next day lyon was liberated and 2 000 germans were captured but rest had already continued their retreat north lyon celebrated for two days with americans allies made a last ditch attempt to cut off germans with an offensive towards bourg en bresse by 45thdivision and 117thcavalry squadron from original taskforce butler however 45thdivision was not able to overcome german defenses near town 117thcavalry squadron had more success bypassing bourg en bresse and taking montreval and marboz north of bourg en bresse instead by 3september montreval was secure but squadron soon found itself trapped by units from 11thpanzer division which surrounded town as a result squadron was almost annihilated and german escape route was again open american units then retired to marboz over next two weeks more skirmishes occurred and allies were not able to cut off a major portion of german forces but germans were also not able to maintain any stable defense line as planned on 10september forward units of vi corps were able to establish contact with units from patton s third army truscott hoped to be able to push through belfort gap but on 14september he received orders from allied high command to halt offensive army groupg was finally able to establish a stable defense line at vosges mountains thwarting further allied advances this combined with allied need to reorganise their command structure as forces from northern and southern france linked up forced allies to stop their pursuit of germans ending offensive here during their fighting retreat up rhone germans also withdrew their remaining forces from their garrisons in southwestern france these divisions raced north along atlantic coast and then swung towards east at loire to link up with rest of army groupg at burgundy while they did not have to fight western allies as much as germans had done at rhone they still had to advance through french partisan dominated terrain about 88 000 men moved north leaving 20 000 in southwestern france behind during retreat about 19 000 men were captured by allies and 60 000 men reached army groupg s line where they were integrated into defense of vosges mountains war crimes french resistance against nazi german occupation and vichy french puppet government increased drastically in weeks leading up to dragoon landings to fight uprising german units committed numerous atrocities and war crimes against french fighters as well as civilians in retaliatory acts on 9june after an attack on german garrison at tulle 2nd ss panzer division hanged about 99 civilians while moving towards northern france during tulle massacre next day that division murdered 642 civilians in oradour sur glane during oradour sur glane massacre and then proceeded to plunder and burn town german units also worked together with french collaborators to subdue partisans for example against partisan base at massif but with little lasting result atrocities continued during german retreat from southern france as german soldiers plundered and burned down towns french civilians were brought before military courts and sentenced to death because of alleged partisan activities these atrocities did not help to subdue french uprising instead german reprisals had opposite effect and encouraged french population to engage in partisan fighting aftermath thumb upright monument to landings of allied troops under general patch on beach of france operation dragoon was considered a success by allied forces it enabled them to liberate most of southern france in only four weeks while inflicting heavy casualties on german forces however allies failed to cut off most valuable units of retreating army group g which retreated over a distance of in good order into vosges mountains on german border with capability of continuing fight main reason for failure to capture or destroy army groupg was allied shortage of fuel which began soon after landing allies had not anticipated speed of their own advance so could not adequately provide supplies and logistics to leading allied units a significant benefit of operation dragoon was use of port facilities in southern france especially large ports at marseille and toulon after operation cobra and operation dragoon allied advance slowed almost to a halt in september due to a critical lack of supplies ports were quickly brought back into service together with railroad system in southern france thereafter large quantities of supplies could be moved north to ease supply situation in october 524 894 tons of supplies were unloaded which was more than one third of allied cargo shipped to western front operation dragoon also had political implications two days after landing germans proceeded to dismantle french state members of sicherheitsdienst stormed french government institutions and moved french officials including philippe petain to belfort in eastern france later they were moved to sigmaringen in germany where they acted as a government in exile with collapse of vichy regime troops of provisional government of french republic re established control of french political institutions antony beevor comments landings in south of france prompted a rapid german withdrawal and thus reduced damage and suffering done to france despite these successes criticism of dragoon was made by some allied generals and contemporary commentators such as bernard montgomery arthur r wilson and chester wilmot in aftermath mostly because of its geostrategic implications dragoon was argued to have diverted highly experienced men and much needed materiel away from continuing fighting at western front that could have been used instead to bolster italian front or to hasten advance towards rhine by overlord forces resulting loss of momentum gave stalin on eastern front a free hand to pursue his offensive efforts with more determination allowing him to win race towards berlin and occupy balkans dragoon therefore had consequences reaching into
