devil of christmas is a christmas special of british dark comedy anthology television programme inside no 9 and first episode of third series it was first aired on 27 december 2016 on bbc two episode was directed by graeme harper and written by reece shearsmith and steve pemberton stylistically it took heavy inspiration from classic 1970s anthology programmes such as beasts thriller tales of unexpected and armchair thriller and was filmed using authentic equipment pemberton intended episode to be a recreation of this kind of classic programming with critics characterising it as a homage pastiche or loving parody devil of christmas which is set in december 1977 begins with an english family played by pemberton rula lenska jessica raine and george bedford arriving at an austrian alpine chalet where their guide played by shearsmith tells them story of krampus it shortly becomes apparent however that viewers are watching a film and a director voiced by derek jacobi provides commentary on events critical reception of devil of christmas was very strong with praise directed at writing acting and production as a recreation of 1970s anthology programmes it was considered a success ending critics noted was extremely dark though many offered considerable praise for final twist a minority criticised it as gratuitously unpleasant production thumb 175px left jessica raine pictured 2015 starred in episode as kathy second series of inside no 9 aired from 26 march to 29 april 2015 in may shearsmith said that he and pemberton had talked about doing a third series and were hopeful that they would be able to but that bbc had not yet requested one a third series was confirmed by bbc in october 2015 further information including hints at settings and confirmed performers was released in january 2016 when series began filming devil of christmas first episode of this third series was released as a christmas special in december 2016 with remainder of series following in 2017 episode can be understood as a part of tradition of christmas ghost stories which includes works of charles dickens and bbc s a ghost story for christmas series inspiration for use of krampus myth came from pemberton s reading while stylistic influence according to pemberton came from old 70s style episodes of beasts thriller and tales of unexpected shearsmith named thriller and armchair theatre as key inspirations his intention with episode was to go whole hog and make a programme that was as near to one of those original episodes as it s possible to get writing and acting thus differed from those of a typical 2010s television programme with a script heavily utilising hyperbole and actors hamming for pemberton 1970s style of episode was a literal representation of what metaphorically speaking inside no 9 had been doing since first series episode was variously described as a recreation or re enactment of this source material or else as a homage a pastiche a loving but merciless parody or spoof of it pemberton denied that episode was a parody claiming that it was just an affectionate and hopefully authentic re creation in addition to those influences mentioned by writers commentators identified acorn antiques psycho tales from crypt dead of night whistle and i ll come to you and garth s as potential influences devil of christmas was filmed in style of a 70s portmanteau horror episode this entailed use of non standard methods and technologies for shearsmith way to make episode successful as a recreation was to use as much equipment as possible from period whole filming process took only two days with cast taking minimal breaks between shoots for actors it was thus more like appearing in a play than a typical 21st century television filming experience episode was filmed on a set constructed at studio d in bbc elstree centre run by bbc studioworks and authentic 1970s costumes and props were rented for filming studio was retrofitted with cameras and lighting equipment that would have been used on a 1970s set including three ikegami hk 323 cameras and a single ikegami camera all provided by a company called golden age recreations filming of episode thus differed from series s usual single camera setup approach adam tandy inside no 9 producer said that studio d has heritage and familiar atmosphere that i remember from when i worked at elstree in 1980s however a lot of modernisation has taken place since then and this has allowed us to monitor our 4 3 625 line pal pictures in bbc studioworks state of art hd production gallery for shearsmith result was that it looks shit but it s brilliant episode was directed by graeme harper a veteran television director known for his work on doctor who and crew included members experienced with equipment returning from retirement as each episode of inside no 9 features new characters writers were able to attract actors who might have been unwilling to commit to an entire series devil of

interviewer terminates police interrogation reception thumb right derek jacobi pictured 2006 provided voice of dennis fulcher but does not appear on camera his commentary provided much of episode s humour for most part critics responded extremely positively to devil of christmas it was awarded five out of five stars by adam white of telegraph four out of five stars by james jackson of times and selected as pick of day by gerard gilbert of i it was praised as a fitting start to series and as an entertaining christmas special in its own right critics described it as sublime and a treat it came highly recommended from comedy critic bruce dessau and writer matt baylis summarised it as clever wickedly good ian hyland writing for mirror in 2017 called it most memorable television over christmas period for him episode was almost as strong as 12 days of christine in his view best episode of inside no 9 other critics did not place it as highly in comparison frances taylor writing for radiotimes com listed devil of christmas as seventh best of first 13 episodes both comedic and horrific elements of episode were praised for white episode was a demented finely honed comedy though for sally newall of independent comedic elements were less prominent she described it as a deliciously dark masterclass in twisted unsettling stuff that league of gentlemen and psychoville creators do so well but claimed that a growing sense of doom was more prevalent than belly laughs dessau too commented on lack of humour while chris bennion writing for saturday review of times described it as laugh out loud hilarious while nonetheless stuff of nightmares for white much of episode s strongest humour came from dennis fulcher s voice over jackson called this a pitch perfect parody of a dvd commentary critics praised cast for their hamming and effective delivery of what bennion called stilted stagy dialogue toby writing for telegraph saturday review called acting stellar attention to detail by cast and crew was widely praised dated styling was for jackson spot on louisa mellor of entertainment website den of geek explained that from aspect ratio to music title font sets lighting camera moves hair make up and costume everything was recognisable from sort of 1970s television plays that when you think about it may have provided inspiration for inside no 9 as a whole for her retro send up provided enough entertainment on its own these days you have to be very good to make tv that bad white similarly argued that it s a gargantuan incredibly precise task to make such gloriously terrible tv a skill reserved for only greatest of comics even despite flaws of film within episode rebecca nicholson of theguardian com found it relatively gripping sarah hughes writing in i compared devil of christmas to an episode of tales of unexpected it was she argued both an immaculately conceived homage to roald dahl s original anthology series and a worthy contender for its crown commentators noted that ending was genuinely unsettling and dark rachel writing for theguardian com described episode as moving from a twee period piece to what has to be most depraved half hour of television ever to grace festive schedules for many critics final twist was praiseworthy it was characterised variously as episode s secret weapon very fitting suitably macabre and fantastically nasty for hughes it was a lovely sting in tale and one of which dahl would almost certainly have approved two reviews in times however one unsigned and one by matt rudd were more critical unsigned review advised viewers to switch off before end as fabulous styling gives way to a gratuitously nasty conclusion a bad misjudgment from such a talented writing team for rudd shocking ending served no purpose critical of shocking for sake of shocking he argued that episode s half hour of self satisfied 1970s pastiche followed by a frenzied knife attack is very unpleasant indeed in i an unsigned review of bill second episode of third series suggested that viewers may have been put off programme by rather nasty final couple of minutes of devil of christmas though jackson considered ending overwrought he felt that it pulled rug turning on a sixpence screams of kathy turned truly horrifying suddenly real and disturbing mellor considered ending a terrific twist as long as you didn t look at it too closely arguing that interviewer s patience and crew s collusion were unlikely however she suggested there is little to be gained by criticising these aspects of episode for baylis ending was unexpected revealing darkness of shabby human kind in closing seconds of episode he said we suddenly saw it all without seeing anything references further reading external links devil of christmas at bbc programmes devil
