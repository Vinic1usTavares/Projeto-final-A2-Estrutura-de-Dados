creature does something player does not want it can be discouraged with a slap if creature does something player approves of it can be stroked creature remembers response to various actions and gradually changes its behaviour accordingly prima guide pp 101 111 with time and repetition it can perform complex functions that allow it to serve as player s avatar three types of leashes are used

wolves sport glowing eyes and large fangs and claws good ones turn a shade of purple and glow gently prima guide p 102 lionhead studios used michael bratman s belief desire intention model to simulate creatures learning and decision making processes a creature forms an intention by combining desires opinions and beliefs beliefs are attributed to lists that store data about various world objects desires are goals creature wants to fulfill expressed as simplified opinions describe ways of satisfying a desire using decision trees for each desire creature selects belief with best opinion thus forming an intention or goal plot player begins on an island as a new god created from a family s prayers after saving their drowning son god follows grateful family to their village a large creature

weaker when final piece of creed is obtained player destroys nemesis and is left as only god in world prima guide pp 113 195 clue book pp 2 8 development and release thumb upright black white drew elements from peter molyneux s previous projects populous and dungeon keeper history black white took over three years to develop beginning on 14 february 1998 and was released on 30 march 2001 peter molyneux funded project himself and devoted his entire focus to its development final hours pp 2 7 molyneux stated that he tried to correct mistakes he made with game design of dungeon keeper goal was to develop a unique game where players felt they inhabited a world where they could do anything molyneux had liked idea of controlling people as a god since his previous venture populous he was interested in concept of good and evil and thought that this could be used to influence game s atmosphere development was slow starting with only six people as molyneux wanted to assemble right team discussions about concepts including a mafia style game began at his house in 1997 making of black white pp 8 9 and in february 1998 team moved into lionhead s offices expanded nine person team exchanged further suggestions for game and its content such as lip synchronised characters although this was thought impossible as more people joined molyneux wanted lionhead s friendly atmosphere to remain and their policy of only recruiting people who could fit in with existing members meant that team had developed their own way of working according to molyneux team members questioned and competed with each other resulting in a better quality of work he said that team did work of a group twice their number group that finally numbered twenty five programmers with a budget of approximately ps4 million molyneux stated that king kong was an inspiration for game soon afterwards watching outer limits episode he noticed that episode featured bug like creatures worshipping a scientist and who moved around him in reverence whenever he was nearby molyneux thought that being admired with that level of devotion made one a god making of black white p 4 in 1998 black white was shown at e3 trade show in atlanta georgia and incorporated elements of populous and dungeon keeper molyneux estimated game would be nearly finished in 1999 and scheduled it for a late september 2000 release artificial intelligence was one of key areas still being worked on game crashed multiple times molyneux fixed bugs using microsoft developer studio before restarting final hours pp 8 9 he expected 3d engine used would be an improvement when compared to his previous games he instructed programmers to make it most beautiful engine ever conceived by anybody ever final hours pp 11 as of december 1998 no animators had been hired and art team were developing their own skills in that area by this time engine was being developed by three people alex evans jean claude and scawen roberts who had joined from a courier company called coincidentally black and white cottier developed landscape system and found a method of generating textures enabling reflection of various types of terrain roberts created creatures and animation eric bailey later took over creature making of black white p 39 evans described developing engine as a daunting task composer russell shaw came up with idea of world changing appearance according to player s alignment he suggested that player s territory loses colour if he plays evil and for it to be gaily coloured if good artist mark healey wanted cursor to be a magician s hand entire game including tools and libraries was written from scratch a trial and error approach was taken team learned by trying something and changing what did not work they avoided using control panels icons and buttons for casting miracles preferring a gesture system molyneux commented that he would have been very disappointed if system was dumped but in end they got feature working beautifully integrating storyline was found to draw player through game in an unexpected manner which led to development of characters like sable creature trainer and advisers a great deal of effort was devoted to getting features such as weather import working game was originally to feature battling wizards who would have had creatures originally named titans to raise and be powered by belief a key idea was ability to turn living beings into titans healey s early visualisation featured horned reaper from dungeon keeper representing titans team wanted player to see world from same perspective as possessing a creature in dungeon keeper it was originally intended for player to be able to take control of creatures in first person molyneux wanted limitless flexibility and ability to zoom out to see world from sky it was decided to make player a god when it was realised that humans could not wield powers that were being implemented spells that were to be cast became miracles and wizards supporters became worshippers mechanic of turning living beings into titans was dropped because of problems with balance with certain titans having advantages over others making of black white pp 9 16 after name titans was dropped others were considered including demes and none had unanimous support so they ended up being called creatures making of black white p 68 elements of wizard theme such as temples resembling a wizard s tower remain in final game temples were originally named citadels and some sported a medieval fairy tale look making of black white p 59 in january 1999 richard evans was working out how game judges morality of player s behaviour mark webley who had programmed creature s artificial intelligence on a testbed version had become project manager ensuring routines were listed on task schedules he stated that this was a hundred times more difficult than similar tasks at bullfrog productions by march team had expanded to 17 people including five artists five game programmers two engine programmers and a sound programmer lionhead wanted a maximum of 25 people so as not to break team spirit atmosphere black white was shown at e3 1999 where it was judged most original game final hours p 15 at this time lionhead were considering 15 cover designs provided by electronic arts at e3 2000 molyneux gave a precise release date 23 september 2000 game was supposed to reach alpha stage by 18 june but by summer it became clear that development was behind schedule and release date was pushed back to 10 november in september it was pushed back again into 2001 angering fans who were eagerly awaiting its release molyneux apologised for delay final hours pp 16 19 by september 2000 every lionhead member had their faces digitised for use on villagers villagers were auctioned online at with all proceeds going to national society for prevention of cruelty to children team were surprised when first one sold for ps450 and fourth one for over ps1000 by october lionhead were operating around clock to reach alpha shin kanaoya of ea square came to discuss japanese localisation which was considered difficult due to requirement of use of two byte characters to display japanese writing system particularly 20 000 kanji characters which would have posed ram management issues lionhead were considering using japanese fonts included with windows in september there were dozens of fansites about black white by november there were around 150 molyneux later said that black white was amongst first video games to have fansites and that lionhead were accused of over promising when sites described features game did not have when shown molyneux said that might have been insanely ambitious with regard to standards they set themselves for graphics because system requirements were high and much of custom software needed to be written one such program was a terrain editing tool named leadhead making of black white p 50 he stated that they went from bizarre ideas to best game i have ever seen villagers artificial intelligence had to be restricted by giving some control to village centre as there was no limit on number of villagers molyneux said of creature s artificial intelligence part of game itself learns from everything you do and tailors itself to you and described creature as an astonishing piece of work he also commented that last months of development were hardest any of us has ever had to work and that without right team this game never would have happened models for trees bushes and other landscape features were created in 3d studio max and initial graphics development was done in 2d using adobe photoshop later development was done using other custom software making of black white pp 50 53 clan multiplayer where multiple players play as one god was developed in a rush its interface had to be developed in two weeks black whites online community was handled by two servers in london where clan creatures were stored to minimise possibility of cheating making of black white p 89 alpha was reached in december 2000 multiplayer mode nearly had to be dropped for this to happen but problems were fixed just in time electronic arts became involved in production testers were employed they found three thousand bugs were checked and a marketing campaign was launched fearing bugs could kill game lists were sent to every member of team who had a chart updated daily biggest problem was final set and fixing them created more bugs molyneux commented that it was as if game just didn t want to be finished and perfected and remarked that team felt like they had run a marathon after fixing bugs end product was so large that they almost felt lost within code which consisted of over a million lines and took over an hour to compile music dialogue and sound effects were compressed to fit on one cd as they took five times as much space as game people not involved with game s development began playing it and were extremely impressed making of black white pp 79 91 release date was then set at 23 february 2001 electronic arts complained that age at which villagers were reproducing was below age of consent for some countries so this had to be changed final hours pp 20 23 lionhead announced that game went gold became ready to be released on 16 march 2001 molyneux credited fans for making hardest times worthwhile because players encountered technical issues rumours that electronic arts had shipped beta versions circulated lionhead denied them molyneux said black white was most important and difficult game he had made in june a patch that fixed bugs was released japanese version was released on 24 may 2001 and re released as black white special edition under ea best selections branding on 18 march 2004 another patch was released which would allow hand to be controlled by an essential reality p5 glove a virtual reality glove story and characters work on story began in october 1999 and took longer than expected team estimated two months but soon realised they lacked necessary skills to meet this deadline bullfrog s james leach who had previously worked on titles such as dungeon keeper and theme hospital was recruited and wrote many challenges all dialogue and enabled team to make advisers characters rather than just sources of information idea to make advisers characters came from alex evans who wanted them to interact with their lips synchronised a system was developed that moved their mouths into common phoneme shapes used as a basis to turn them into graphic equalisers that move into shapes according to sounds being played this facilitated localisation as game was to be translated into fifteen languages both advisers were voiced by marc silk cutting recording time by roughly half making of black white pp 74 76 88 initial designs were produced by artist christian bravery but these were considered too similar to classic devils and angels healey redesigned angel to be more like a fairy he was accused of putting his girlfriend into game something which he agreed with on reflection he admitted that it looked rather a lot like her making of black white p 73 he then designed an old man resembling a cross between a hippy a yogi and a kindly old man making of black white p 74 advisers animations and emotions were triggered by keywords in script document a microsoft excel file consisting of several thousand lines much of script was for advisers as they were to comment on everything happening as well as other things players may want to do making of black white p 75 challenges and quests were developed to keep players occupied while playing through story told leach about ways of good and evil and system s reflection of player s behaviour and provided him with a digital copy of bible with instructions to study concepts due to their connection with gods and men making of black white pp 65 66 leach decided to supplement idea of evil with mischief as he thought being completely evil by annoying or killing followers was senseless molyneux wanted a conflict between good and evil and for enemy gods to have opposite alignment to player as a method of introducing player to miracles and combat a god whose alignment is same as player s was added making of black white pp 66 67 leach molyneux and webley were considering final story when jamie durrant an artist became involved in scripting language a level designer ken malcolm was also hired and their skills were considered invaluable malcolm said that challenges were imagined as films with multiple endings because story elements were different to games based on levels according to him team had to forget rules and focus on what players would do making of black white p 67 world domination was story s goal creed was a way of achieving that goal without having to convert every tribe intent was for creeds to be hosted inside creatures obtainable only after creature was dead winning game would require three creeds of same alignment and their placement in volcano on fifth land explosion would shatter world and world would be player s as story evolved it was decided that game should not force player through it as it would restrict his freedom team also wanted players to explore world solution to this problem came in form of gold story scrolls making of black white p 71 other gods actions and dialogue were written to be neutral as they could be either good or evil some were influenced by player s alignment but some lines were spoken regardless of player s alignment due to lack of space concept of good and evil also affected gods names bias towards a particular alignment was avoided because they could be either khazar and lethys were suitably old and legendary name nemesis was to be replaced with a huge powerful name but was liked by most of team making of black white pp 68 69 programmer oliver purkiss was hired to program villagers he and molyneux worked tirelessly to give villagers autonomy and individuality without using too much processor power purkiss said that they did not want players to believe that villagers were worthless afterwards it was decided that villagers should have different belief levels so player would need to impress more sceptical ones making of black white p 70 richard evans worked on villagers reactivity making of black white p 72 script editor started out simple enabling programmers to perform camera angles and move villagers and first script was created when cottier added a widescreen function molyneux wanted an epic tale so tools such as cinematography and ability to analyse creature and player s alignment and abilities were needed jason hutchens an expert in languages was hired and helped create a more natural language compiler making of black white p 83 a system to generalise each approach to challenges was also needed script editor and language were simple enough for non programmers to use and was also capable of writing complex scripts making of black white pp 84 85 sound and music shaw was head of music and sound he handled voice recording all sound effects and composed music he also played instruments and sang first land s missionaries song featured voices of shaw and webley it was originally shaw s intention for there to be no dialogue making of black white p 77 game had over 5000 sound effects by january 2000 shaw s lack of experience in playing ethnic instruments was a problem but hannigan an expert on subject was enlisted to help hannigan further enlisted a musical ensemble who covered instruments for every tribe making of black white p 78 s speech was performed at electronic arts s sound studio in chertsey over three and a half days sessions were directed by leach and lines were recorded onto hard disk by electronic arts engineer bill lusty recordings were then burnt to cd which were sent to shaw who then cut up each line and assigned them to those in game afterwards hugo myatt and shelley blond were recorded at lionhead making of black white p 79 creature decision to base creatures on real animals was made early on to offer players variety a mixture of benign and aggressive creatures was deemed necessary making of black white p 29 team decided to implement anthropomorphised bipedal animals because their humanoid form evoked empathy and credibility in their potential sentience due to technical restraints bipedal creatures also provided greater flexibility for animation and game dynamics making of black white p 31 lion was constructed for prototype 3d studio max was used to build wire mesh frame and then adobe photoshop was used to skin creature skeleton was added which was used by an animator to perform movements making of black white p 32 good creatures appearances were most problematic and transformation between alignments was also thought to be a huge challenge each form was built from seven meshes and three texture sets this enabled subtle variation making of black white p 33 eyes were originally painted as a texture but this was deemed unsatisfactory later eyes were built using separate geometry that moves independently and were added using game s creature editor making of black white p 35 to implement transformation of creature based on its alignment alex evans developed an exporter program to export 3d studio max s models and animations and roberts created one to import them and apply them to lion each version of creature was then loaded and interpolation code was written as well as a blended animation between two similar ones making of black white p 36 system has a two way blend one for alignment and other for how fat creature is as there was not going to be many creatures on one map team were able to use cpu resources to run many animations simultaneously on a single creature making of black white p 38 planned level of artificial intelligence for creature was thought to be risky molyneux commented that they wanted to advance technology to its extreme and artificial intelligence specialist richard evans built technology which according to molyneux appeared to live and learn like say a clever puppy molyneux desired creature to pass turing test which had not yet been achieved other versions an online version black white gathering was in development and would have enabled creatures to interact those of other players in a cut down game environment over internet lionhead planned to release black white gathering two months before main game s release as a free download and it was to offer a choice of creatures it would have linked with chat programs such as aol instant messenger and icq and convert text to a speech bubble from creature it was intended for players to be able to upload main game s creature into black white gathering and its experiences to be saved into main game another online program black white worlds was in development this would have taken place in worlds of main game molyneux explained that there was to be a server whose worlds would have been set up with a match making system and players would have been able to do battle like last man standing there was also a plan to produce black white universe in which players would have had a persistent online world a playstation version was in development and scheduled for release in summer 2001 and a dreamcast version in late 2001 both were cancelled playstation 2 and xbox versions were due for release in 2002 versions for game boy color and game boy advance were proposed but never materialised a company called m4 was to have co developed them alongside lionhead but electronic arts were not interested in game boy versions molyneux stated that dreamcast version was cancelled because it was taking time to convert game for platform and development had not progressed far enough for it to be worth continuing as interest in platform was declining reception critics initially lauded black white with universal acclaim according to video game review aggregator metacritic graphics gameplay and artificial intelligence in particular were well received black white sold two and a
