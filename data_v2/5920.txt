kingdom of nri was a medieval polity located in what is now nigeria kingdom existed as a sphere of religious and political influence over a third of igboland and was administered by a priest king called an eze nri eze nri managed trade and diplomacy on behalf of nri people a subgroup of igbo speaking people and possessed divine authority in religious matters kingdom was a haven for all those who had been rejected in their communities and also a place where slaves were set free from their bondage nri expanded through converts gaining neighboring communities allegiance not by force nri s royal founder eri is said to be a sky being that came down to earth and then established civilization one of better known remnants of nri civilization is manifested in igbo ukwu artifacts nri s culture permanently influenced northern and western igbo especially through religion and taboos kingdom appears to have passed its peak in 18th century encroached upon by rise of benin and igala kingdom and later atlantic slave trade but it appears to have maintained its authority well into 16th century and remnants of eze hierarchy persisted until establishment of colonial nigeria in 1911 and represents one of traditional states within modern nigeria history nri kingdom is a kingdom within igbo area of nigeria nri and aguleri where igbo creation myth originates are in territory of umu eri clan who trace their lineages back to patriarchal king figure eri isichei page 246 247 eri s origin is unclear though he has been described as a sky being sent by chukwu god uzukwu page 93 he is credited with first giving societal order to people of anambra nri history may be divided into six main periods pre eri period eri period migration and unification heyday of nri influence decline and collapse and socio culture revival 1974 present onwuejeogwu 1981 page 22 foundation 300px thumb eastern hemisphere at end of 9th century ce showing nri and other civilizations author onwuejeogwu suggested that nri influence in igboland may go back as far as 9th century hrbek page 254 and royal burials have been unearthed dating to at least 10th century according to other authors eri god like founder of nri is believed to have settled region around 1500s lovejoy page 62 first eze nri king of nri ifikuanim follows directly after him according to 1981 oral tradition suggests an accession of eri in 1043 chambers 2005 laces ifikuanim s reign at around 1225 ce chambers page 33 in 1911 names of 19 eze nri were recorded but list is not easily converted into chronological terms because of long between installations tradition held that at least seven years would pass upon death of eze nri before a successor could be determined interregnum served as a period of divination of signs from deceased eze nri who would communicate his choice of successor from beyond grave in seven or more years ensuing upon his death regardless of actual date this period marks beginning of nri kingship as a centralized institution zenith and fall expansion of kingdom of nri was achieved by sending mburichi or converts to other settlements allegiance to eze nri was obtained not by military force but through ritual oath religious authority was vested in local king and ties were maintained by traveling mburichi by late 16th century nri influence extended well beyond nuclear northern igbo region to igbo settlements on west bank of niger and communities affected by benin empire there is strong evidence to indicate igbo influence well beyond igbo region to benin and southern igala areas like before arrival of nri at its height kingdom of nri had influence in over roughly a fourth of igboland and beyond nri s influence in much of northwestern and western igboland lasted from reigns of fourth eze nri to that of ninth after that patterns of conflict emerged that existed from tenth to fourteenth reigns which probably reflected monetary importance of slave trade outside world influence was not going to be halted by native religious doctrine in face of slave trade s economic opportunities nri influence declined after start of 18th century lovejoy page 63 still it survived in a much reduced and weakened form until 1911 in 1911 british troops forced reigning eze nri to renounce ritual power of religion known as ikenga ending kingdom of nri as a political power government thumb a tender palm frond was a symbol of nri nearly all communities in igboland were organized according to a title system igbo west of niger river and on its east bank developed kingship governing states such as onitsha and their title obi ogot page 229 apparently from benin empire s oba this is debatable however because word obi in most igbo dialects literally means heart and may be a metaphorical reference to kingship rather than a loanword from yoruba or edo igbo of nri on other hand developed a state system sustained by ritual power kingdom of nri was a religio polity a sort of theocratic state that developed in central heartland of igbo region nri had a taboo symbolic code with six types these included human such as twins animal object temporal behavioral speech and place taboos rules regarding these taboos were used to educate and govern nri s subjects this meant that while certain igbo may have lived under different formal administration all followers of igbo religion had to abide by rules of faith and obey its representative on earth page 130 an important symbol among nri religion was omu a tender palm frond used to and restrain it was used as protection for traveling delegations or safeguarding certain objects a person or object carrying an omu twig was considered protected influence of these symbols and institutions extended well beyond nri and this unique igbo socio political system proved capable of controlling areas wider than villages or towns for many centuries people within nri related areas were committed to peace this religious pacifism was rooted in a belief that violence was an abomination which polluted earth instead eze nri could declare a form of excommunication from odinani nri against those who violated specific taboos members of ikenga could isolate entire communities via this form of ritual siege eze nri thumb eze nri sounding his bell eze nri was title of ruler of nri with ritual and mystic but not military power he was a ritual figure rather than a king in traditional sense eze nri was chosen after an interregnum period while electors waited for supernatural powers to manifest in new eze nri he was installed after a symbolic journey to aguleri on anambra river authorities must be notified prior to commencement of this journey to obtain eze royal scepter there process of paying of homage to all necessary shrines deities in

nri before going back to nri on seventh day to undergo a symbolic burial and exhumation then finally be anointed with white clay a symbol of purity upon his death he was buried seated in a wood lined chamber eze nri was in all aspects a divine ruler ikenga while eze nri lived relatively secluded from his followers he employed a group of officials called ndi nri chambers page 31 these were ritual specialists easily identifiable by facial scarifications or ichi who traveled with ritual staffs of peace in order to purify earth from human crimes ndi nri exercised authority over wide areas of igboland and had power to install next eze nri areas under nri influence called odinani nri were open to ndi nri traveling within them to perform rituals and ensure bountiful harvest or restore harmony in local affairs local men within odinani nri could represent eze nri and share his moral authority by purchasing a series of ranked titles called ozo and men with these titles were known as mburichi and became an extension of nri s religio political system they controlled means for agriculture and determined guilt or innocence in disputes both ndi nri priests and mburichi nobility belonged to ikenga right hand ikenga god was one dedicated to achievement and power both of which were associated with right hand economy nri maintained its vast authority well into 16th century griswold page xv peace mandated by nri religion and enforced by presence of mburichi allowed trade to flourish items such as horses which did not survive in tsetse fly infested nri and seashells which would have to be transported a long ways due to nri s distance from coast have been found depicted in nri s bronze a nri dignitary was unearthed with ivory also indicating a wealth in trade existed among nri another source of income would have been income brought back by traveling mburichi unlike in many african economies of period nri did not practice slave ownership or trade certain parts of nri domain did not recognize slavery and served as a sanctuary after selection of tenth eze nri any slave who stepped foot on nri soil was considered free nri had a network of internal and external trade which its economy was partly based on other aspects of nri s economy were hunting and agriculture page 5 eri sky being was first to count days by their names eke oye afor and which were names of their four governing spirits eri revealed opportunity of time to igbo who would use days for exchanging goods and knowledge uzukwu 107 culture art thumbnail 9th century bronze vessel in form of a snail shell excavated in igbo ukwu in nigerian national museum lagos igbo ukwu a part of kingdom about south of nri itself practiced bronze casting techniques using elephant head motifs bronzes of igbo ukwu are often compared to those of ife and benin but they come from a different tradition and are associated with eze nri by descendants of eri in fact earliest body of nigerian bronzes has been unearthed in igbo territory to east of niger river at a site dated to 9th century making it older than ife hrbek page 252 it appears that nri had an artistic as well as religious influence on lower niger sculptures found there are bronze like those at igbo ukwu great sculptures of benin empire by contrast were almost always brass with over time increasingly greater percentages of zinc added bronzes of igbo ukwu pay special attention to detail depicting birds snails chameleons and other natural aspects of world such as a hatching bird other pieces include gourds and vessels which were often given handles pieces are so fine that small insects were included on surfaces of some while others have what looks like bronze wires decorated around them none of these extra details were made separately bronzes were all one piece igbo ukwu gave evidence of an early bronze casting tradition in nri page 119 120 religion religious beliefs were central to kingdom of nri isichei page 85 nri oral tradition states that a bounty of yams and could be given to eze nri while blessings were given in return it was believed that nri s influence and bountiful amount of food was a reward for ruler s blessings above all nri was a holy land for those igbo who followed its edicts it served as a place where sins and taboos could be absolved just by entering it even igbo living far from center of power would send abnormal children to nri for ritual cleansing rather than having them killed as was sometimes case for dwarfs or children who cut their top teeth before their lower teeth lovejoy page 70 nri people believed that sun was dwelling place of anyanwu light and agbala fertility agbala was collective spirit of all holy beings human and nonhuman agbala was perfect agent of chukwu or creator god and chose its human and nonhuman agents only by their merit it knew no politics it transcended religion culture and gender and worked with humble and truthful they believed anyanwu light to be symbol of human perfection that all must seek and agbala was entrusted to lead man there uzukwu page 31 tradition nri tradition was based on concept of peace truth and harmony onwuejeogwu 1981 page 11 it spread this ideology through ritualistic ozo traders who maintained nri influence by traveling and spreading nri practices such as ikenga to other communities these men were identified through ritual facial scarifications they had undergone nri believed in cleansing and purifying earth a supernatural force to nri called ana and of human abominations and crimes year counting ceremony igu aro festival counting of year 1912 page 71 was a royal festival eze nri used to maintain his influence over communities under his authority each of these communities sent representatives to pay tribute during ceremony to show their loyalty at end eze nri would give representatives a yam medicine and a blessing of fertility for their communities onwuejeogwu 1975 page 44 festival was seen as a day of peace and certain activities were prohibited such as planting of crops before day of ceremony splitting of wood and unnecessary noise igu aro was a regular event that gave an opportunity for eze to speak directly to all communities under him nri scarification thumb an igbo man with facial marks of nobility known as 1921 page 184 ritual scarification in nri was known as ichi of which there are two styles nri style and agbaja style in nri style carved line ran from center of forehead down to chin a second line ran across face from right cheek to left this was repeated to obtain a pattern meant to imitate rays of sun in agbaja style circles and semicircular patterns are added to initial incisions to represent moon these scarifications were given to representatives of eze nri mburichi scarification s were nri s way of honoring sun that they worshiped and was a form of ritual purification page 413 414 scarification had its origins in nri mythology nri son of eri who established town of nri was said to have pleaded to chukwu great god because of hunger chukwu then ordered him to cut off his first son s and daughter s heads and plant them creating a blood bond between igbo and earth deity ana before doing so nri was ordered to mark ichi onto their two foreheads coco yam a crop managed by females sprang from his daughter s head and yam igbo peoples staple crop sprung from his son s head chukwu had taught nri plant domestication from this eze nri s first son and daughter were required to undergo scarification s seven days after birth with eze nri s daughter being only female to receive ichi isichei page 247 nri son of eri also gained knowledge of yam medicine ji people from other igbo communities made pilgrimages to nri in order to receive this knowledge received
