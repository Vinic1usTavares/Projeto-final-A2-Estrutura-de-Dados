cincinnati musical center half dollar or cincinnati music center half dollar is a commemorative 50 cent piece struck by united states bureau of mint in 1936 produced with stated purpose of commemorating fiftieth anniversary of cincinnati ohio as a center of music it was conceived by thomas g melish a coin enthusiast who controlled group which was allowed to buy entire issue from government and who resold pieces at high prices congress approved legislation for coin on march 31 1936 authorizing 15 000 pieces to be struck at three mints then in operation melish had hired sculptor constance ortmayer to design coin but commission of fine arts refused to recommend designs members objected to depiction of stephen foster on obverse finding no connection between foster who died in 1864 and supposed anniversary nevertheless designs were approved by bureau of mint and 5 000 sets from three mints were issued and sold to melish s group only authorized purchaser melish likely held back much of issue for later resale and with few pieces available prices for set spiked rising to over five times issue price value dropped somewhat when boom in commemorative coins burst in late 1936 but quickly recovered and coins are valuable today melish has been assailed by numismatic writers for greed inception sparked by low mintage issues which appreciated in value market for united states commemorative coins spiked in 1936 until 1954 entire mintage of such issues was sold by government at face value to a group authorized by congress who then tried to sell coins at a profit to public new pieces then came on to secondary market and in early 1936 all earlier commemoratives sold at a premium to their issue prices apparent easy profits to be made by purchasing and holding commemoratives attracted many to coin collecting hobby where they sought to purchase new issues among pieces which had recently been struck and had appreciated in value was 1935 old spanish trail half dollar this piece had been issued at behest of l w a texas entrepreneur and coin dealer who put aside a fifth of 10 000 mintage for himself and sold them well into 1940s by which time he had served as president of american numismatic association ana congress authorized an explosion of commemorative coins in 1936 no fewer than fifteen were issued for first time at request of groups authorized to purchase them several coins minted in prior years were produced again dated 1936 senior among them oregon trail memorial half dollar first struck in 1926 thumb upright left thomas g melish thomas g melish a coin collector and entrepreneur from cincinnati came up with an idea for a commemorative coin that he would control and from which he could profit melish was a prominent businessman who had inherited wire company he formed cincinnati musical center commemorative coin association and secured introduction of h r on january 31 1936 this bill would have provided for 10 000 coins from philadelphia mint 2 000 coins from denver and 3 000 from san francisco mint such a low mintage would have made denver coin a significant rarity increasing melish s profit on february 17 house committee on coinage weights and measures recommended that it be amended to provide for a total of 15 000 coins without dictating at what mint or mints they should be struck that committee in its report accompanying bill noted that piece was in commemoration of fiftieth golden anniversary of cincinnati ohio as a center of music and its contribution of annual may festival to art of music for past 50 years melish through political influence was able to retain provision that they should be struck at mints allowing coinage at all three mints this marked last time that a coinage bill would pass congress in 1930s with that phrasing later issues were limited to a single mint bill passed congress and was signed by president franklin roosevelt on march 31 1936 pieces were to honor 50th anniversary of cincinnati ohio as a center of music and its contribution to art of music for past 50 years anthony swiatek and walter breen in their volume on commemorative coins concluded that pressure from above named association on congress induced passage of act preparation and controversy melish engaged constance ortmayer to design coin ortmayer later remembered i was recommended by them someone came through cincinnati they were just looking for somebody so they recommended me ortmayer apparently prepared a design before bill passed congress for melish wrote to assistant director of mint mary margaret o reilly on april 4 1936 that original lacked distinction and artistic merit and that ortmayer would redesign coin he wrote again on may 7 asking if ortmayer s new design was satisfactory models were submitted to commission of fine arts charged since 1921 with advising on coin design though government was not bound to follow its recommendations on may 13 chairman charles moore wrote to mint director nellie tayloe ross withholding approval upright thumb theodore thomas moore recited stated purpose of coin to commemorate 50th anniversary of cincinnati as a center of music then noted that obverse depicted stephen foster composer and songwriter who died in 1864 whereas cincinnati was not notable as a center of music until at least 1873 commission is at a loss to connect a fiftieth anniversary in 1936 with a movement that began in 1873 foster did live in cincinnati moore admitted but only for a brief period while working as a bookkeeper and his main contributions to american music came later when he lived in pittsburgh and in new york city further coin was to commemorate cincinnati s contributions to art of music and foster was an american troubadour but to music as an art he made no contribution moore felt that if anyone should be depicted it should be theodore thomas who conducted cincinnati may festival from its beginning in 1873 and in 1878 became director of cincinnati college of music he stated that theodore thomas was artistically founder of cincinnati as a musical center his portrait should appear on any coin commemorative of cincinnati as a center of music on may 16 cincinnati enquirer reported that thomas would appear on coin not foster paper also reported controversy before commission of fine arts that melish had travelled to washington previous day and had announced he had no objection to change also on may 16 melish telephoned lee lawrie sculptor member of commission melish s notes indicate that moore s objection was on behalf of alice roosevelt longworth and longworth family who had employed thomas to lead may festival and who wanted thomas on coin although as per melish lawrie put it thomas looks like a walrus and would be a very hard head to make melish was defiant stating that he also knew alice longworth well and foster remained on coin ortmayer remembered that boss of bureau of mint presumably ross objected to reverse design not liking position of goddess legs swiatek in his later volume averred that melish s association put pressure on department of treasury to approve ortmayer s design philadelphia mint received models from ortmayer on may 23 its superintendent edwin sent o reilly a memorandum from chief engraver john r sinnock stating that sculptor s models were in too high relief and suggesting that ortmayer come to mint to discuss matter a letter from o reilly to melish on june 18 reports that after some modification sinnock wrote that coin was at very limit of high relief that mint could coin and that dies for cincinnati piece were expected to be tested by coining trial strikes in early july design thumb upright cornelius vermeule compared cincinnati coin

numismatist noted in october 1936 issue that coin had been awaited with anticipation by hobbyists because of an announcement that it would bear likeness of foster but when it finally appeared many expressions of approval of designs were heard and a few criticisms foster deserved a better bust than one artist has given us toy four string lyre goddess holds in her hand is not in keeping with times or occasion after all these years music deserved something better coin dealer b max mehl in his monograph on commemorative coins published in 1937 agreed with criticism of reverse apparently this lyre must have been bought at a 5c and 10c store as it seems to be only a toy art historian cornelius vermeule in his 1971 volume on american coins and medals numismatic art in america criticized ortmayer s design release distribution and collecting mintage of 15 000 was struck in july 1936 at philadelphia and denver mints 5 005 pieces were produced and 5 006 at san francisco with excess from even thousands held for inspection and testing at 1937 meeting of united states assay commission first 200 pieces from each mint were collected in sets of three with a notarized letter from melish testifying to what number coins they were several of these special sets were sent by melish to government officials upright left thumb letter from melish to a would be purchaser of half dollar melish had been fielding inquiries from collectors since roosevelt signed legislation but from mid may those who wrote received only postcards stating new issue was oversubscribed summer of 1936 was peak of commemorative coin boom and melish announced new pieces would be sold in sets of three by mint mark for 7 75 a high price at that time order blanks were sent to those who had written early and soon these blanks were selling for 10 yet few collectors were successful in having their orders filled with most having their payment returned as coins had supposedly sold out sets quickly jumped in price to 40 at this high level many coins proved available numismatist q david bowers stated that these were most likely surreptitiously sold by melish and other insiders melish also allowed of york county maine tercentenary half dollar to purchase at original issue price several sets members of public could order at most one set at that price in return he sought to purchase that and other commemorative coins in quantities beyond usual order limit nevertheless when oregon trail memorial association of long lived half dollar honoring trail tried to purchase a set melish replied that they were sold out

market and dealers who had purchased quantities found themselves unable to dispose of them at a profit by 1940 coin sets were selling for 15 per set they thereafter recovered and by early 1960s had

lists sets at between 875 and 2 700 depending on condition individual coins are cataloged at about a third of set prices thumb right cincinnati set in holder of issue circumstances of issuance were not clear at first mehl wrote that coin was to honor 50th anniversary of cincinnati musical center which was founded in 1886 and that either through good distribution or a great demand sets did not go around to all those who wanted them later numismatic writers have been harsh to melish swiatek deemed coin issued because of false claims on its behalf kevin flynn in his volume on commemoratives stated that cincinnati piece was made for pure profit and greed swiatek and breen in their 1988 book suggest that melish s group had only one idea in mind enriching themselves by publicizing and distributing a limited issue which could be priced into orbit by speculators with success of issue melish tried to get congress to authorize 1937 dated pieces he was not successful he had managed to get congress to allow another commemorative under his control 1936 cleveland centennial half dollar in 1942 when ana held its annual convention in cincinnati melish hosted a hospitality suite dubbed pirate s den it featured paintings he had commissioned depicting coin dealers and other numismatic personalities in piratical clothes according to bowers overlooked was fact that greatest pirate of all was surely melish himself who undoubtedly treated many of his guests with money taken from them a few years earlier in sale of cincinnati sets notes references bibliography category currencies
