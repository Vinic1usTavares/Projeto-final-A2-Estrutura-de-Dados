interstate 35e i 35e is an interstate highway in us state of minnesota passing through downtown saint paul it is one of two through routes for interstate 35 through twin cities of minneapolis and saint paul other being interstate 35w through minneapolis thus both ends of i 35e are shared with i 35w and i 35 this is one of two pairs of suffixed interstates that has not been eliminated i 35 also splits into i 35e and i 35w in dallas fort worth texas in minnesota i 35e continues exit numbers of i 35 while those of i 35w begin with 1 just north of split i 35e also carries legislative route of i 35 unsigned legislative route 390 through twin cities on other hand portion of i 35e through west seventh neighborhood of saint paul is a controversial four lane parkway that heavy trucks are prohibited from using interstate 35e in minnesota is in length route description southern terminus of i 35e is at exit 88a in burnsville where i 35 splits into i 35e and i 35w while i 35w heads north into minneapolis i 35e takes a northeasterly path into saint paul there is no access between i 35e and i 35w here but dakota county road 42 exit immediately to north connects two interstates in burnsville major interchanges south of saint paul include state highway 77 mn 77 signed as cedar avenue exit 92 at apple valley eagan and interstate 494 exit 99 in mendota heights between exits 94 and 97 highway deviates from its relatively straight path to avoid blackhawk lake as it crosses i 494 i 35e turns more to north crossing mn 62 exit 101 and mn 13 exit 102 in mendota heights before crossing mississippi river on lexington bridge into city of saint paul this portion of i 35e is four lanes wide two in each direction except between mn 77 and mn 62 where it carries six lanes lexington bridge carries six lanes four through lanes and exit and entrance lanes for mn 13 as well as a bicycle and pedestrian path bridge has an innovative automatic anti icing system that sprays potassium acetate onto bridge surface to prevent frost and ice formation in inclement weather thumb new lexington bridge completed in 2004 auxiliary lanes from mn 13 leave at first exit in saint paul a half interchange with shepard road exit 103a with ramps toward bridge shepard road is a four lane roadway with minimal intersections that follows mississippi river northeast into downtown saint paul immediately after shepard road is mn 5 west 7th street exit 103b which leads northeast to downtown through heart of west seventh neighborhood portion of i 35e between mn 5 and downtown is a mostly sunken four lane parkway with a speed limit of this portion is sometimes referred to as practice freeway by locals a ban on trucks over gross vehicle weight and median landscaping this parkway was built instead of a typical six lane freeway because of local opposition major interchanges on this section include ayd mill road exit 104b a sunken four lane road to northwest and kellogg boulevard exit which extends in both directions as part of a loop around downtown four lanes of i 35e pass through downtown saint paul in center of six lanes of i 94 us 52 with a short overlap occupying blocks between 11th and 12th streets despite this short overlap there is no weaving between two highways since an exit in each direction of i 35e exit from i 35e north to i 94 east us 52 south and exit from i 35e south to i 94 west us 52 north takes traffic that would move to right in overlap instead to right of entire roadway there are no interchanges on common segment and no direct access from i 35e northbound to i 94 west us 52 north or i 94 eastbound us 52 southbound to i 35e south kellogg boulevard provides an indirect connection ayd mill road further west nears i 94 us 52 but does not connect without several turns and traffic lights unlike west split of i 35e and i 94 us 52 all ramps are present at east split among other uses i 35e southbound to i 94 east us 52 north and i 94 westbound us 52 northbound to i 35e north ramps carry traffic following us highway 10 us 10 which overlaps i 35e north of downtown and truck traffic using nearby lafayette freeway us 52 to avoid parkway through west seventh neighborhood from downtown saint paul north to junction with i 694 west exit 113 in little canada where us 10 also leaves i 35e highway carries three lanes of traffic in each direction in addition to a single hov lane major interchanges here include cayuga street exit 108 and mn 36 exit 111 an overlap of about one mile 1 5 km exists between two interchanges with i 694 exits 113 and 114 heading northbound on i 35e four lanes split into three for i 35e northbound and two for i 694 westbound and then three lanes from i 694 eastbound enter on right these six lanes then split into three on left for i 35e northbound and three on right for i 694 eastbound after turn north a lane joins on right from i 694 westbound traffic configuration in other direction where i 35e southbound and i 694 westbound merge is similar but with only five total lanes instead of six where freeways overlap a four year construction project called unweave weave beginning in 2004 was completed in 2008 and eliminated weaving where previously three i 35e lanes were inside three i 694 lanes and left lane onramps existed i 35e is four lanes wide north of i 694 third lane added northbound from i 694 westbound ramp exits immediately onto county road e exit 115 in vadnais heights other than northern terminus of i 35e exit 127 in columbus near forest lake where it merges with i 35w to re form i 35 there are only four interchanges on i 35e north of i 694 between vadnais heights and columbus all for county roads history thumb 1955 plan for i 35e and other twin cities area interstates early plans for interstate highway system include a route along roughly same alignment as present i 35 through twin cities area but are not detailed enough to show exactly how cities would be served when preliminary urban routes were laid out in 1955 a split alignment was chosen to serve both cities equally south of twin cities i 35 followed corridor of old us 65 which had followed avenue between burnsville and downtown minneapolis i 35e was located parallel to mn 13 which cut northeast to saint paul from old us 65 south of minnesota river north of metropolitan area i 35 closely paralleled us 61 which passed through saint paul i 35w paralleled old us 8 from minneapolis northeast through new brighton and then to present day i 35e i 35w split at columbus near forest lake near where old us 8 had joined us 61 minnesota legislature defined i 35e as part of unmarked legislative route 390 which stretched south to iowa state line and north to city of duluth along i 35 i 35e was completed north of downtown saint paul in 1970 first section to open ran north from maryland avenue in saint paul to i 694 in little canada this was completed in early 1960s concurrently with i 694 west to old mn 49 rice street later that decade i 35e was extended south to downtown saint paul opening first to pennsylvania avenue and then to i 94 including i 35e i 94 concurrency and i 94 in both section i 94 west of i 35e pdf control section i 94 east of i 35e pdf in 1970 i 35e was extended north along i 35e i 694 concurrency in little canada vadnais heights and also extended northbound to its northern terminus at columbus near forest lake adjacent sections of i 35 i 35w and i 694 opened at about same time control section i 35w south of i 35e pdf control section i 35 north of i 35e pdf control section i 694 east of i 35e pdf control section 1982 pdf control section pdf control section pdf control section i 35e from south to north pdf southern half of i 35e in metro area took a lot longer to build its first section a short stretch from mn 110 north to state highway 5 including lexington bridge over mississippi river opened in mid 1960s control section 1980 i 35 south of i 35e pdf control section 1981 i 35w north of i 35e pdf even though connecting piece of i 35w and i 35 at southern terminus of i 35e in burnsville opened in mid 1960s it was not until mid 1980s that i 35e was completed south of mn 110 at mendota heights and southbound through eagan and apple valley where there had been a missing link of i 35e for 20 years construction was delayed by opposition from nearby residents in burnsville and from environmentalists over proposed alignment across blackhawk lake final plan involved a new alignment avoiding lake as well as a less complicated interchange at i 494 in mendota heights eliminating access to mn 55 that was part of earlier plans controversy through west seventh neighborhood of saint paul thumb st peter street bridge over i 94 overlap missing piece through west seventh neighborhood of saint paul from mn 5 west 7th street northeast to i 94 in downtown saint paul was held up by controversy construction began in 1964 and was planned for completion in 1970s as a typical six lane freeway but in late 1969 a group of neighbors in area had formed residents in protest 35e r i p 35e to oppose completion of i 35e group convinced city to drop its support and in august it filed a joint lawsuit against minnesota highway department mhd and u s department of transportation along with four neighborhood associations and eight citizens parties quickly reached an agreement favorable to plaintiffs to halt construction pending an environmental impact statement eis saint paul city council decided in late 1974 to support i 35e possibly due to influence of proponents r i p 35e proposed an alternative to original plan and convinced city council to go along with it plan included a four lane boulevard upgrade of pleasant avenue street chosen for i 35e alignment with another route such as shepard road or nearby lafayette freeway forming part of i 35e group opposed any direct connection of this parkway to i 94 near state capitol where i 35e and i 94 were to merge eis was completed in early 1975 identifying noise pollution air pollution vibrations and slope stability as main concerns in addition to nearby location of historic districts hospitals were worried about effects of vibrations on sensitive operations mhd solved this problem while report was being developed eis identified primary benefit of completing i 35e as connecting downtown saint paul to interstate highway system and determined that original pleasant avenue corridor was best choice but with minor changes such as lowering freeway below grand avenue and ramsey street a bill passed by minnesota legislature on may 31 1975 imposed a moratorium on building i 35e as well as other area freeways such as canceled i 335 project and mn 55 hiawatha avenue upgrade project this law defined several new legislative routes which may be added by order of commissioner of transportation to trunk highway system as opposed to other such routes which were added to that system by legislature legislative route no 380 beginning at a point on route no 390 i 35e at its intersection with shepard road in city of saint paul thence extending in a northeasterly direction generally following along course of shepard road to a point on route no 112 lafayette freeway thence extending in a northeasterly direction to a point on route no 392 i 94 easterly of downtown area of saint paul providing a connector route between route no 390 and routes no 112 and 392 legislative route no 381 beginning at a point on route no 112 lafayette freeway northerly of lafayette street bridge in city of saint paul thence extending in a northwesterly direction to a point on route no 390 i 35e southerly of maryland avenue in city of saint paul providing a connector route between route no 112 and route no 390 and legislative route no 382 beginning at a point on route no 390 i 35e at its junction with route no 111 mn 5 thence extending in a general northerly direction within corridor of right of way already acquired on effective date of this act for route no 390 to a point on short line road thence extending in a northeasterly direction within said corridor of right of way to intersection of pleasant avenue and kellogg boulevard in city of saint paul thumb right parkway at ramsey routes 380 and 381 provided for an alternate alignment of i 35e along shepard road and a northerly extension of lafayette freeway while legislative route 382 was a four lane parkway facility that mhd could build along original alignment of i 35e but without a connection to i 94 city announced its support of parkway in august 1976 an act passed on april 5 1978 added a condition to definition of legislative route 390 i 35e legislative route no 390 i 35e shall not include any portion of legislative route no 382 parkway as designated by section 161 117 or any portion of any route connecting route no 382 to route no 392 i 94 nor shall it include any portion of trunk highway marked number 3 from trunk highway marked number 110 in dakota county to east seventh street in city of saint paul at time old mn 3 was marked along nearby lafayette freeway now us 52 from late 1970s to 1994 it also allowed a connection from parkway to i 94 but this link could not be controlled access metropolitan council was to complete a draft eis for parkway and i 35e by september 1 1979 with cooperation of minnesota department of transportation mndot and saint paul there was widespread support for a parkway with landscaping and a truck restriction but non connection to i 94 jeopardized federal interstate funding since it could no longer be part of continuous i 35e two notable alternatives came out of draft eis a parkway with or without an i 94 connection parkway with a connection would provide same level of service as a typical freeway r i p 35e and other citizens groups continued to oppose a direct connection arguing that it would be no different from a typical freeway since drivers would be more likely to exceed speed limit if it was a continuous roadway to i 94 saint paul changed its mind again in september 1981 supporting a direct connection along with mndot and metropolitan council a bill passed in march 1982 removed stipulation that parkway shall not connect to i 94 and allowed route 390 i 35e to use route 382 parkway final eis was approved at about that time and several groups including r i p 35e filed suit in early 1983 suit alleged that eis focused almost exclusively on pleasant avenue alignment and that it did not consider effect of a direct connection on speed limit compliance faster traffic would mean more noise judge paul magnuson ruled in february 1984 that eis was valid stating that pleasant avenue alternative was only reasonable one that would meet goals this court order has been interpreted as a legal contract prohibiting state from raising speed limit or allowing trucks construction went forward and i 35e was opened from mn 5 north to saint clair avenue in 1984 using original bridges that had been built for three lanes in each direction further extensions including all new bridges were opened to grand avenue in 1986 to kellogg boulevard in november 1988 and to i 94 on october 15 1990 26 years after construction began 1990 opening ceremony of i 35e in downtown saint paul was attended by a group of highway experts from soviet union and both us and soviet national anthems were played later changes original plans for i 94 overlap in downtown saint paul did not include right side ramps that eliminate weaving ramp from i 35e northbound to i 94 eastbound was added when i 35e was finally completed in 1990 and a five year construction project that was completed in 1992 added ramp from i 35e southbound to i 94 westbound as well as a direct ramp from i 35e southbound to lafayette freeway us 52 to avoid weaving across i 94 east this project was done because old spaghetti junction at east split of i 35e and i 94 would not be able to handle extra load from completed i 35e parkway when first piece of parkway opened in 1984 unused provisions pending more study were added for a direct link to ayd mill road a sunken four lane road with minimal intersections that leads northwest from i 35e ramps were built and temporarily opened in 1992 for high occupancy vehicles due to closure of nearby lafayette bridge us 52 for reconstruction ramps were reopened on june 12 2002 as a test and remain open a controversial extension of ayd mill road to i 94 remains on table 1964 lexington bridge across mississippi river was replaced by a new bridge built from 2001 to 2004 due to deterioration of old structure including cracks in steel beams unweave weave a project to eliminate weaving at i 694 overlap was completed in 2008 1965 bridge just north of downtown saint paul carrying a daily traffic volume of 148 000 vehicles over cayuga street and bnsf railway line was rated by mndot as meeting minimum tolerable limits in 2006 its superstructure and substructure were described as poor with advanced section loss deterioration spalling or scour as fourth busiest bridge in state it was scrutinized following collapse of i 35w mississippi river bridge in nearby minneapolis on august 1 2007 bridge was replaced in a construction project that finished in late 2016 exit list exit numbers and
