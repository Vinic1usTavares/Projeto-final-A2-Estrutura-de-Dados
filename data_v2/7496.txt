inocybe maculata commonly known as frosty fibrecap is a species of mushroom in family first described by jean louis emile boudier in 1885 i maculata can be found throughout europe asia and north america it is a medium sized brown mushroom with a fibrous brown cap with white remnants of a universal veil in middle stem is cream or brown species is ectomycorrhizal and grows at base of various trees including beech inocybe maculata is poisonous containing muscarine possible symptoms after consumption of i maculata mushrooms are salivation lacrimation urination defecation gastrointestinal problems and vomiting with possibility of death due to respiratory failure taxonomy phylogeny and naming species was given its specific epithet maculata from latin for spotted by jean louis emile boudier in 1885 in an article in bulletin de la societe botanique de france within genus inocybe it has placed within subgenus and section rimosae however phylogenetic analysis has shown that section rimosae as formerly defined does not form a monophyletic group that is descended from a single exclusive ancestor and former rimosae species are better grouped into two clades maculata and rimosae other species joining i maculata in maculata clade include i cookei i i i and i erubescens inocybe maculata has no generally recognised synonyms inocybe maculata synonym list species fungorum accessed 22 september 2010 inocybe maculata mycobank accessed 22 september 2010 however there has been some debate about its status as a single species due to wide geographic and morphological variation of species some authors have proposed multiple species and varieties in response mycologist thom kuyper has listed over thirty specific names and varieties as synonyms of inocybe lacera which is still generally recognised it has also been suggested that inocybe lanatodisca is a synonym but where species occur together they can be distinguished from each other and so it is still recognised as distinct form i maculata f fulva was named and described in 1991 by marcel bon in france inocybe maculata is commonly known as frosty fibrecap description inocybe maculata has a conical or bell shaped cap which is up to in diameter as mushrooms age cap becomes flatter and broad umbo becomes prominent centre of cap has white remains of universal veil especially on younger mushrooms cap is covered in fibres which extend from centre of cap to margin which is usually split cap is typically a chestnut brown in colour though it is paler towards margin as well as chestnut camp has been described as buckthorn brown snuff brown tawny olive and saccardo s umber both cap colour and presences of veil remnants are known to be very variable in appearance inocybe maculata f fulva has a lighter cap colour typically more yellow to reddish brown and less or even no remnants of veil on cap gill attachment is adnate meaning that gills are attached to stem along their entire depth gills are crowded with white edges that are finely toothed younger mushrooms have gills that are greyish white that eventually mature to an olive brown colour stem is up to in length and generally cylindrical in shape though it is often thicker towards base while stem is initially solid it later becomes hollow there is often a small bulb at base of stem stem has cream colouration becoming gradually browner with age base sometimes white and powdery flesh is white microscopic features inocybe maculata has thin walled cheilocystidia which are clavate club shaped lack encrustation at apex and are colourless basidia are also clavate and can be two three or four spored and measure from 15 to 30 micrometres mm by 5 to 9 mm sterigmata narrow horns on end of basidia which hold spores are 4 to 5 mm long it lacks pleurocystidia species leaves a snuff brown spore print spores themselves are smooth and bean shaped they have a yellow brown to rusty brown colouration and measure from 9 to 11 mm by 4 5 to 5 5 mm hyphae can have clamp connections but can also lack them similar species inocybe maculata is similar to variable inocybe lacera split fibrecap but it can be differentiated by darker colouration of cap and white remains of veil in centre of cap species is also similar in appearance to inocybe lanatodisca but can be readily distinguished by odour i lanatodisca has a characteristic sweet green corn smell and colour of cap i lanatodisca has a fulvous cap it is closely related to inocybe fastigiata but can again be distinguished by colour i fastigiata has lighter coloured fibrils distribution and habitat inocybe maculata is an ectomycorrhizal species with a wide ecological range it can be found in all biomes from low lying deciduous woodland to arctic alpine areas it typically grows on ground in deciduous or mixed woodland favouring beech it grows best on chalky soil among leaf litter in north america it favours sandy soil clay or moss it is also encountered on as well as beech species has been recorded growing in association with hornbeam hazel oak and lime inocybe maculata f fulva favours birch spruce pine populus willow as well as dryas and polygonum in alpine regions mushrooms grow individually or in scattered groups though widespread in areas it is found it is not a common species it can be found from western europe to eastern asia and in north america from where it was first collected in 1960s inocybe maculata f fulva was first identified in france and has since been found elsewhere in europe edibility flesh has a mild taste and a strong pungent fruity smell mushroom is poisonous containing muscarine compounds consumption of mushroom could lead to a number of physiological effects including salivation lacrimation urination defecation gastrointestinal problems and vomiting this array of symptoms is also known by acronym sludge other potential effects include a drop in blood pressure sweating and death due to respiratory failure see also list of inocybe species
