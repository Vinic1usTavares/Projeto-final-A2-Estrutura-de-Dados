hurricane harvey was costliest tropical cyclone on record tied with hurricane katrina of 2005 inflicting roughly 125 billion in damage across houston metropolitan area and southeast texas it lasted from mid august until early september 2017 with many records for rainfall and landfall intensity set during that time eighth named storm third hurricane and first major hurricane of 2017 atlantic hurricane season harvey originated from a broad area of low pressure southwest of cape verde that was first monitored on august 13 tracking steadily westward disturbance developed strong convection a well defined circulation and sustained tropical storm force winds leading to classification of tropical storm harvey late on august 17 moderate easterly vertical wind shear kept harvey weak as it continued westwards into caribbean sea despite repeated predictions for gradual intensification by national hurricane center harvey eventually opened up into a tropical wave on august 19 remnants of harvey continued to move westwards and reached yucatan peninsula on august 22 and was forecast to regenerate into a tropical cyclone after exiting land on august 23 harvey moved into bay of campeche and quickly developed a well defined circulation becoming a tropical depression later that day and a tropical storm fifteen hours later curving northwestwards into a favorable environment with low wind shear and high sea surface temperatures harvey began to consolidate and developed an eye rapid intensification ensued as harvey approached coast of texas with harvey becoming a hurricane in afternoon of august 24 despite some dry air entrainment halting intensification process for rest of day harvey soon resumed strengthening and became season s first major hurricane in evening of august 25 continuing to deepen harvey attained peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph 215 km h category 4 status on saffir simpson scale and a minimum pressure of 937 mbar hpa 27 67 inhg as it made its first landfall near rockport texas at 03 00 utc on august 26 this made harvey first major hurricane to make landfall in united states since wilma in 2005 first major hurricane in texas since bret in 1999 and strongest in texas since carla in 1961 rapid weakening began as harvey made a second landfall just north of holiday beach three hours after its first degrading to a tropical storm that evening trapped between two ridges to its west and east harvey dramatically slowed as it moved inland but began drifting southeast back towards water on august 27 harvey reemerged over extreme western gulf of mexico as a weak tropical storm early on august 28 by this time almost of rain had fallen in greater houston area moving slowly east southeastwards harvey would bring an additional of rain to greater houston and parts of southwestern louisiana over next three days becoming wettest tropical cyclone on record in united states eventually a trough moving over ohio valley pulled harvey northwards and harvey made a third and final landfall just west of cameron louisiana on august 30 before weakening into a tropical depression continuing to push inland harvey gradually lost tropical characteristics and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on september 1 origins and track through caribbean thumb left tropical storm harvey over windward islands on august 18 on august 12 a tropical wave moved off west coast of africa accompanied by a large area of convection national hurricane center nhc began to track wave next morning just before convective mass dissipated tropical wave was expected to merge with a broad area of low pressure located southwest of cape verde and slowly consolidate with nhc giving a low chance of tropical cyclogenesis over next five days merger failed to complete however with two areas of disturbed weather remaining separate despite being contained by same area of low pressure two systems eventually split again on august 15 with original low pressure area continuing westwards towards caribbean sea while tropical wave moved farther north conditions in caribbean sea though were not forecast to be conducive for development convection around low began to increase that same day as a kelvin wave passed through area but remained disorganized amid strong upper level winds however nhc noted that low could experience a slight reprieve near lesser antilles on august 17 satellite imagery revealed that system had become much more organized with circulation becoming better defined assessing it as having a high chance of tropical cyclogenesis over next two days nhc began issuing advisories at 15 00 utc on potential tropical cyclone nine roughly east of barbados this allowed tropical cyclone warnings and watches to be issued for lesser antilles post analysis revealed that a tropical depression had already formed by 06 00 utc while located east of barbados thumb remnants of harvey in gulf of honduras on august 21 within shadow of a total solar eclipse an air force reserve hurricane hunter aircraft investigating disturbance from 18 00 21 00 utc on august 17 detected a well defined circulation center with strong convection sheared to west with system already producing maximum sustained winds near 40 mph 65 km h disturbance was immediately upgraded to a tropical storm and given name harvey with harvey moving due west at in an environment of moderate easterly vertical wind shear intensity forecast remained challenging statistical and hurricane models called for harvey to near or reach hurricane intensity while global models most notably ecmwf and gfs showed harvey degenerating to a tropical wave within next few days meanwhile on august 18 harvey s center passed over barbados at 10 00 utc and over saint vincent at 15 00 utc with winds of 45 mph 75 km h and a central pressure of 1 004 mbar hpa 29 65 inhg both islands received little impact as harvey s strongest winds were located well to north latter scenario eventually played out as harvey remained disorganized with low and mid level circulations becoming misaligned in fact a reconnaissance aircraft flying through harvey on next day was unable to find a closed mid level circulation although low level circulation remained intact by 12 00 utc on august 19 harvey had degraded to a tropical depression weakening circulation opened up into a wave six hours later despite subsiding vertical wind shear ahead harvey s quick motion and proximity to dry air were expected to hinder reintensification for time being however nhc noted possibility of harvey regenerating near yucatan peninsula or in bay of campeche regeneration and rapid intensification thumb left harvey shortly after regeneration in bay of campeche on august 23 on morning of august 20 nhc began to feature remnants of harvey on their tropical weather outlooks assessing it with a medium chance of redevelopment over next five days however this was increased to high just hours later after showers and thunderstorms associated with system increased in coverage system regained winds of tropical storm force later on august 20 yet a closed circulation still could not be found harvey s remnant trough continued to move steadily westwards to west northwestwards towards belize and yucatan peninsula through august 21 passing over latter on august 22 as low pressure area associated with ex harvey moved over land its circulation became better defined and nhc noted that tropical cyclone development was almost a certainty over next few days as system entered bay of campeche at this time nhc also mentioned possibility of hurricane force winds affecting coast of texas nhc s forecasts came to fruition at 12 00 utc on august 23 as harvey regenerated into a tropical depression 175 mi 280 km west of progreso mexico after presence of a closed circulation was finally confirmed thumb satellite animation of harvey as it rapidly intensified near texas coast on august 25 over next few hours harvey continued to consolidate with radius of maximum winds decreasing to 70 mi 110 km early on august 24 moving slowly northwestwards to north northwestwards in response to a weak ridge to northeast harvey intensified to a tropical storm at 04 00 utc by that time harvey was located 440 mi 705 km southeast of port o connor texas further strengthening was anticipated as wind shear over harvey decreased with weakening of an upper level low over northwestern gulf of mexico in fact nhc assessed that probability of rapid intensification sustained winds increasing by 35 mph 55 km h in 24 hours increased to 45 percent just five hours after harvey had been declared a tropical storm this forecast materialized shortly afterwards as harvey began rapidly strengthening with reconnaissance aircraft monitoring storm at around 14 00 utc reporting structure had markedly improved a eye had developed and central pressure had fallen to 982 mbar hpa 28 99 inhg this resulted in a substantial increase in intensity forecast with cyclone expected to be a powerful hurricane by time it reached texas coastline less than two hours later at 18 00 utc harvey was upgraded to a mid range category 1 hurricane on saffir simpson scale based on additional aircraft data afterwards intensification process stalled somewhat and eye lost some definition despite a steady decrease in central pressure this was attributed to likely dry air entrainment early on august 25 however strengthening resumed again with harvey attaining category 2 intensity at roughly 05 00 utc that day during this time satellite presentation improved significantly with appearance of an intermittent eye feature embedded in a central dense overcast cdo as well as improving outflow however shortly afterwards concentric eyewalls were reported within harvey signifying an eyewall replacement cycle which prevented sustained winds from increasing beyond 110 mph 175 km h for a while despite an unusually low pressure of 947 mbar hpa 27 97 inhg which is typical of a stronger storm despite this harvey managed to quickly strengthen into a major hurricane a storm with winds of 111 mph 179 km h or greater at 19 00 utc that day rapid strengthening eventually culminated with harvey reaching peak sustained winds of 130 mph 215 km h a category 4 hurricane on saffir simpson scale at 23 00 utc as a well defined eye formed within hurricane pressure bottomed out at 937 mbar hpa 27 67 inhg hours later at 03 00 utc on august 26 just as it was making landfall on san jose island texas landfalls and subsequent stalling thumb left harvey shortly after emerging into gulf of mexico on august 28 harvey officially made landfall at 03 00 utc on august 26 on northern end of san jose island 6 mi 9 km east of rockport texas at its peak strength this made harvey first storm to strike united states at category 3 intensity or higher since hurricane wilma in 2005 strongest in terms of wind speed to hit country since charley in 2004 and first hurricane to strike texas since ike in 2008 harvey also became first major hurricane in state since bret in 1999 as well as strongest in texas since carla in 1961 a storm surge of was recorded between port aransas and matagorda weakening began as eye of harvey moved further inland and harvey made a subsequent landfall on northeastern shore of copano bay at 06 00 utc with slightly lower winds of 125 mph 205 km h weakening process accelerated as it slowly progressed northwest with harvey falling to minimal hurricane strength by 15 00 utc as central inner core collapsed and eye disappeared from visible satellite imagery harvey s movement slowed to a crawl as cyclone became trapped between two ridges to its east and west which generated light steering currents that prevented any fast movement later that day harvey weakened to a tropical storm as central convection continued to warm as harvey barely moved and continued dropping rain catastrophic and record breaking flooding occurred in southeastern portion of lone star state during this time a total of 52 tornadoes were produced half of which occurred within or near greater houston strongest was rated ef2 on enhanced fujita scale which touched down near evangeline louisiana on evening of august 29 all of other tornadoes were ranked at ef0 or ef1 intensity by late on august 27 cyclone completed an anticyclonic loop and began a slow southeastward drift towards gulf of mexico at this time harvey was only a minimal tropical storm deep convection formed repeatedly in harvey s right semicircle as it had remained over water which likely helped system to sustain tropical storm force winds despite being centered over land still moving slowly harvey emerged back over water into matagorda bay late on august 28 once back over warm waters of gulf of mexico deep convection blossomed well to north of center of tropical storm which led to slight strengthening center of storm continued to drift to east southeast into early hours of august 29 but never strayed more than 70 mi 110 km away from texan coast convection blossomed again later that day with center jumping northwards into convection as harvey began moving to northeast consequently harvey s winds reached a third and final peak of 50 mph 85 km h at 18 00 utc as a ridge built over western atlantic harvey began to be steered north northeastwards back towards united states coast strong vertical wind shear weakened storm somewhat as it approached coast of louisiana though central pressure continued to fall to around 990 mbar hpa 29 23 inhg rainfall and flooding event thumb 300px rainfall accumulations from harvey in southeastern texas heaviest rains fell near beaumont and houston owing to harvey s slow motion near and over texas and louisiana from 26 30 august prolonged heavy rainfall and resulting widespread record breaking and catastrophic flooding was observed in many parts of two states especially within houston metropolitan area harvey s combination with a weak stationary front located over southern united states resulted in baroclinic enhancement of heavy rains in that region warm moist air wrapping round east side of harvey s circulation converged with cooler and drier air and rose in a process known as lifting creating prolonged heavy rains as a result nhc declared harvey most significant tropical cyclone rainfall event in united states history highest rainfall accumulations totaled over with a reading of at nederland texas and another of near groves texas this well surpassed previous records for tropical cyclone rainfall for both continental united states which was held by 1978 s tropical storm amelia as well as for entire united states which was held by 1950 s hurricane hiki rain rates of up to per hour contributed greatly to breaking daily and even monthly rainfall records in region weather station at houston s george bush intercontinental airport observed all time record daily rainfall accumulations on both august 26 and 27 measured at and respectively total of of rain in august mostly from harvey made that month wettest ever recorded in houston more than doubling previous record of besides houston nearly entirety of southeastern texas received at least of rain and an estimated 25 30 percent of harris county about of land was submerged louisiana was not spared by harvey s rains with peak accumulations at recorded west of vinton though radar data indicated that up to of rain likely fell elsewhere harvey also caused significant flooding in tennessee where about a foot of rain was recorded final landfall and dissipation center of harvey crossed coast near cameron louisiana at 08 00 utc on august 30 with winds of 45 mph 75 km h and a central pressure of 991 mbar hpa 29 26 inhg as storm moved farther inland weakening commenced once again and harvey weakened to a tropical depression at 00 00 utc on august 31 consequently nhc issued its last advisory on cyclone three hours later with further information to be handled by weather prediction center wpc while continuing to generate heavy rainfall harvey began to lose its tropical characteristics ultimately transitioning into an extratropical cyclone at 06 00 utc on september 1 over tennessee valley eventually what was left of harvey weakened to point where wpc terminated advisories on storm which it did at 15 00 utc next day remnants continued moving northeastwards while interacting with a developing low pressure area over mid atlantic dissipating shortly afterwards
