mary toft nee denyer c 1701 1763 also spelled tofts was an english woman from godalming surrey who in 1726 became subject of considerable controversy when she tricked doctors into believing that she had given birth to rabbits in 1726 toft became pregnant but following her reported fascination with sighting of a rabbit she miscarried her claim to have given birth to various animal parts prompted arrival of john howard a local surgeon who investigated matter he delivered several pieces of animal flesh and duly notified other prominent physicians which brought case to attention of nathaniel st andre surgeon to royal household of king george i st andre concluded that toft s case was genuine but king also sent surgeon cyriacus ahlers who remained skeptical by then quite famous toft was brought to london where she was studied in detail where under intense scrutiny and producing no more rabbits she confessed to hoax and was subsequently imprisoned as a fraud resultant public mockery created panic within medical profession and ruined careers of several prominent surgeons affair was satirised on many occasions not least by pictorial satirist and social critic william hogarth who was notably critical of medical profession s gullibility toft was eventually released without charge and returned home account story first came to public s attention in late october 1726 when reports began to reach london an account appeared in mist s weekly journal on 19 november 1726 poor woman mary toft was twenty four or twenty five years old she was baptised mary denyer on 21 february 1703 daughter of john and jane denyer in 1720 she married joshua toft a journeyman clothier and together couple had three children mary anne and james as an 18th century english peasant circumstances dictated that when in 1726 toft again became pregnant she continue working in fields she complained of painful complications early in pregnancy and in early august egested several pieces of flesh one as big as my arm this may have been result of an abnormality of developing placenta which would have caused embryo to stop developing and blood clots and flesh to be ejected toft went into labour on 27 september her neighbour was called and watched as she produced several animal parts this neighbour then showed pieces to her mother and to her mother in law ann toft who by chance was a midwife ann toft sent flesh to john howard a guildford based man midwife of thirty years experience initially howard dismissed notion that toft had given birth to animal parts but next day despite his reservations he went to see her ann toft showed him more pieces of previous night s exertions but on examining mary he found nothing when mary again went into labour appearing to give birth to several more animal parts howard returned to continue his investigations according to a contemporary account of 9 november over next few days he delivered three legs of a cat of a tabby colour and one leg of a rabbet guts were as a cat s and in them were three pieces of back bone of an eel cat s feet supposed were formed in her imagination from a cat she was fond of that slept on bed at night toft seemingly became ill once more and over next few days delivered more pieces of rabbit as story became more widely known on 4 november henry davenant a member of court of king george i went to see for himself what was happening he examined samples howard had collected and returned to london ostensibly a believer howard had toft moved to guildford where he offered to deliver rabbits in presence of anyone who doubted her story some of letters he wrote to davenant to notify him of any progress in case came to attention of nathaniel st andre since 1723 a swiss surgeon to royal household st andre would ultimately detail contents of one of these letters in his pamphlet a short narrative of an extraordinary delivery of rabbets 1727 investigation by middle of november british royal family were so interested in story that they sent st andre and samuel molyneux secretary to prince of wales to investigate apparently they were not disappointed arriving on 15 november they were taken by howard to see toft who within hours delivered a rabbit s torso st andre s account details his examination of rabbit to check if it had breathed air he placed a piece of its lung in water to see if it would float which it did st andre then performed a medical examination on toft and concluded that rabbits were bred in her fallopian tubes in doctors absence toft later that day reportedly delivered torso of another rabbit which two also examined they again returned that evening to find toft again displaying violent contractions a further medical examination followed and st andre delivered some rabbit skin followed a few minutes later by a rabbit s head both men inspected egested pieces of flesh noting that some resembled body parts of a cat fascinated king then sent surgeon cyriacus ahlers to guildford ahlers arrived on 20 november and found toft exhibiting no signs of pregnancy he may have already suspected affair was a hoax and observed that toft seemed to press her knees and thighs together as if to prevent something from dropping down he thought howard s behaviour just as suspicious as man midwife would not let him help deliver rabbits although ahlers was not a man midwife and in an earlier attempt had apparently put toft through considerable pain convinced affair was a hoax he lied telling those involved that he believed toft s story before making his excuses and returning to london taking specimens of rabbits with him upon closer study he reportedly found evidence of them having been cut with a man made instrument and noted pieces of straw and grain in their droppings on 21 november ahlers reported his findings to king and later to several persons of note and distinction howard wrote to ahlers next day asking for return of his specimens ahlers suspicions began to worry both howard and st andre and apparently king as two days later st andre and a colleague were ordered back to guildford upon their arrival they met howard who told st andre that toft had given birth to two more rabbits she delivered several portions of what was presumed to be a placenta but she was by then quite ill and suffering from a constant pain in right side of her abdomen in a pre emptive move against ahlers st andre collected affidavits from several witnesses which in effect cast doubt on ahlers honesty and on 26 november gave an anatomical demonstration before king to support toft s story according to his pamphlet neither st andre nor molyneux suspected any fraudulent activity st andre was ordered by king to travel back to guildford and to bring toft to london so that further investigations could be carried out he was accompanied by richard manningham a well known obstetrician who was knighted in 1721 and second son of thomas manningham bishop of chichester he examined toft and found right side of her abdomen slightly enlarged manningham also delivered what he thought was a hog s bladder although st andre and howard disagreed with his identification but became suspicious as it smelled of urine nevertheless those involved agreed to say nothing in public and on their return to london on 29 november lodged toft in lacey s bagnio in leicester fields

clothier at godlyman by whom she has had three children printed in early days of newspapers story became a national sensation although some publications were skeptical norwich gazette viewing affair simply as female gossip rabbit stew and hare disappeared from dinner table while as unlikely as story sounded many physicians felt compelled to see toft for themselves political writer john hervey later told his friend henry fox that under st andre s strict control toft was studied by a number of eminent physicians and surgeons including john maubray in female physician maubray had proposed women could give birth to a creature he named a sooterkin he was a proponent of maternal impression a widely held belief that conception and pregnancy could be influenced by what mother dreamt or saw and warned pregnant women that over familiarity with household pets could cause their children to resemble those pets he was reportedly happy to attend toft pleased that her case appeared to vindicate his theories but man midwife james douglas like manningham presumed that affair was a hoax and despite st andre s repeated invitations kept his distance douglas was one of country s most respected anatomists and a well known man midwife whereas st andre was often considered to be a member of court only because of his ability to speak king s native german st andre therefore desperately wanted two to attend toft after george i s accession to throne whigs had become dominant political faction and manningham and douglas s whig affiliations and medical knowledge might have elevated his status as both doctor and philosopher douglas thought that a woman giving birth to rabbits was as likely as a rabbit giving birth to a human child but despite his scepticism he went to see her when manningham informed him of suspected hog s bladder and after he examined toft he refused to engage st andre on matter under constant supervision toft went into labour several times to no avail confession hoax was uncovered on 4 december thomas onslow 2nd baron onslow had begun an investigation of his own and discovered that for past month toft s husband joshua had been buying young rabbits convinced he had enough evidence to proceed in a letter to physician sir hans sloane he wrote that affair had almost alarmed england and that he would soon publish his findings same day thomas howard a porter at bagnio confessed to justice of peace sir thomas clarges that he had been bribed by toft s sister in law margaret to sneak a rabbit into toft s chamber when arrested and questioned mary denied accusation while margaret under douglas s interrogation claimed that she had obtained rabbit for eating only manningham examined toft and thought something remained in cavity of her uterus and so he successfully persuaded clarges to allow her to remain at bagnio douglas who had by then visited toft questioned her on three or four occasions each time for several hours after several days of this manningham threatened to perform a painful operation on her and on 7 december in presence of manningham douglas john montagu and frederick calvert toft finally confessed following her miscarriage and while her cervix permitted access an accomplice had inserted into her womb claws and body of a cat and head of a rabbit they had also invented a story in which toft claimed that during her pregnancy and while working in a field she had been startled by a rabbit and had since become obsessed with rabbits for later animal parts had been inserted into her vagina pressured again by manningham and douglas it was latter who took her confession she made a further admission on 8 december and another on 9 december before being sent to tothill fields bridewell charged on a statute of edward iii as a vile cheat and imposter in her earlier unpublished confessions she blamed entire affair on a range of other participants from her mother in law to john howard she also claimed that a

confession proved awkward for st andre who on 3 december had published his forty page pamphlet a short narrative of an extraordinary delivery of rabbets on this document surgeon had staked his reputation and although it offers a more empirical account of toft case than earlier more fanciful publications about reproduction in general ultimately it was derided ahlers his scepticism justified published some observations concerning woman of godlyman in surrey which details his account of events and his suspicion of complicity of both st andre and howard st andre recanted his views on 9 december 1726 in 1729 following death of samuel molyneux from poisoning he married molyneux s widow elizabeth this did little to impress his peers molyneux s cousin accused him of poisoning a charge that st andre defended by suing for defamation but careers of st andre and his wife were permanently damaged elizabeth lost her attendance on queen caroline and st andre was publicly humiliated at court living on elizabeth s considerable wealth they retired to country where st andre died in 1776 aged 96 manningham desperate to exculpate himself published a diary of his observations of mary toft together with an account of her confession of fraud on 12 december in it he suggested that douglas had been fooled by toft and concerned with his image douglas replied by publishing his own account using pseudonym lover of truth and learning in 1727 douglas also published sooterkin dissected a letter to maubray douglas was scathingly critical of his sooterkin theory calling it a mere fiction of your maubray s brain damage done to medical profession was such that several doctors not connected with tale felt compelled to print statements that they had not believed toft s story on 7 january 1727 john howard and toft appeared before bench where howard was fined ps800 ps today he returned to surrey and continued his practice and died in 1755 crowds reportedly mobbed tothill fields bridewell for months hoping to catch a glimpse of now infamous toft by this time she had become quite ill and while incarcerated had her portrait drawn by john laguerre she was ultimately discharged on 8 april 1727 as it was unclear as to what charge should have been made against her toft family made no profit from affair and mary toft returned to surrey in february 1728 recorded as 1727 old

suggested story was a political portent of approaching death of prince s father on 7 january 1727 mist s weekly journal satirised matter making several allusions to political change and comparing affair to events of 1641 when parliament began its revolution against king charles i scandal provided writers of grub street with enough material to produce pamphlets squibs broadsides and ballads for

brief essay singularites de la nature to describe how protestant english were still influenced by an ignorant church toft did not escape ire of satirists who concentrated mainly on sexual innuendo some took advantage of a common 18th century word for a rabbit track prick and others were scatological in nature however much ado about nothing or a plain refutation of all that has been written or said concerning rabbit woman of godalming 1727 is one of more cutting satires on toft document supposes to be confession of merry tuft in her own stile and spelling poking fun at her illiteracy it makes a number of obscene suggestions hinting at her promiscuity i a as had grate parts and a large and of being in document also ridicules several of physicians involved in affair and reflects general view portrayed by satirists that toft was a weak woman and least complicit of offenders regardless of her guilt notion contrasts with that expressed of her before hoax was revealed and may indicate an overall strategy to disempower toft completely this is reflected in one of most notable satires of affair alexander pope and william pulteney s anonymous satirical ballad discovery or
