hurricane gert was a strong tropical cyclone that brought heavy surf and rip currents to east coast of united states in august 2017 gert originated from a tropical wave that moved off coast of africa on august 3 yet failed to organize significantly until august 12 when system coalesced into a tropical depression east of bahamas a few hours later depression became seventh tropical storm of annual hurricane season and was named gert for next day though further intensification was hindered by proximity of dry air once gert was able to overcome that on august 14 however gert resumed strengthening while moving northwards paralleling united states coastline gert reached its peak intensity on august 16 at category 2 status on saffir simpson scale as it accelerated northeastwards thereafter increasing vertical wind shear and decreasing sea surface temperatures caused gert to rapidly weaken and transition into an extratropical cyclone on august 17 well east of atlantic canada remnants of gert dissipated late on august 18 after they merged with another extratropical cyclone over open atlantic during its lifetime gert brought heavy swells rough surf and rip currents to east coast of united states and atlantic canada two fatalities occurred when two swimmers drowned amid heavy surf extratropical system that merged with remnants of gert went on to bring strong winds and rain to ireland and parts of united kingdom meteorological history on august 2 national hurricane center nhc began to track a tropical wave over western africa wave emerged over atlantic ocean on august 3 accompanied by a weak surface low pressure area while moving quickly westwards south of cape verde in a generally favorable environment characterized by high sea surface temperatures ssts and low vertical wind shear wave showed some signs of development and was given a high chance of consolidating into a tropical depression during next five days by nhc however by august 5 system s swift movement brought it into less favorable conditions causing most of wave s associated showers and thunderstorms to dissipate wave continued to track westwards over next few days eventually splitting into two systems northern one being precursor to gert and southern portion later spawning hurricane kenneth in eastern pacific afterwards precursor to gert moved west northwestwards passing north of puerto rico on august 11 as it did so convective bands associated with system began to curve and concentrate towards center of system evidencing increasing organization a surface low pressure area developed on august 12 and a tropical depression formed at 18 00 utc that same day 265 miles 425 km northeast of turks and caicos islands depression organized further to become a tropical storm at 00 00 utc on august 13 bearing maximum sustained winds of 40 mph 65 km h and received name gert although conditions generally favored further intensification with high ssts and low wind shear mid level dry air disrupted gert s central convection causing gert s intensity to hold steady for next 18 hours however by august 14 gert s circulation had mixed out dry air storm for further strengthening at that time gert was moving north northwestwards to northwards through a gap in subtropical ridge thumb right hurricane gert off united states east coast on august 15 from august 14 onwards gert strengthened markedly developing persistent deep convection and a central dense overcast at 06 00 utc on august 15 gert became second hurricane of 2017 atlantic hurricane season as sustained winds rose to 75 mph 120 km h while an approaching mid latitude trough began to accelerate gert towards northeast gert continued to intensify developing an eye just across at 18 00 utc on august 16 gert reached its peak intensity with winds of 110 mph 175 km h and a minimum central pressure of 962 mbar hpa 28 41 inhg ranked as category 2 on saffir simpson scale racing off to east northeast gert soon passed beyond northern wall of gulf stream marking a significant decrease in ssts compounded by increasing vertical wind shear and drier air gert began to weaken and its cloud pattern rapidly deteriorated system degraded to a tropical storm by 12 00 utc on august 17 six hours later gert transitioned into an extratropical cyclone 335 miles 535 km southeast of st john s newfoundland weakening cyclone continued northeast over open atlantic ocean before dissipating by 00 00 utc on august 19 remnant energy and moisture of system merged with another extratropical cyclone to northwest which later went on to affect ireland and united kingdom preparations and impact while gert did not approach any land areas during its lifetime as a tropical cyclone gert still generated heavy swells rough surf and rip currents along east coast of united states and atlantic canada at nantucket massachusetts several beaches were closed and lifeguards conducted more than 25 water rescues on august 16 alone despite this a 40 year old man drowned off beach around noon on august 16 attempts to revive him with cardiopulmonary resuscitation after he was pulled from water were not successful in outer banks off cape hatteras national seashore a 63 year old man drowned on august 14 after being caught in a rip current during an attempt to rescue another swimmer in distress other swimmer later returned safely to shore remnants of gert merged with another extratropical cyclone that produced strong winds and heavy rain in ireland and united kingdom ahead of storm met eireann issued yellow weather warnings for entirety of ireland expecting heavy showers and localized flooding as storm hit severe floods occurred in northern ireland with floodwaters reaching more than 100 people were rescued after being trapped in their cars or houses overnight see also other tropical cyclones named gert hurricane alex 2004 category 3 hurricane that took a similar path hurricane danielle 2010 also
