upright 1 5 thumb right largest battlecruiser ever built breyer p 168 in australia on 17 march 1924 battlecruiser or battle cruiser was a type of capital ship of first half of 20th century they were similar in displacement armament and cost to battleships but differed slightly in form and balance of attributes battlecruisers typically had slightly thinner armour and a lighter main gun battery than contemporary battleships installed on a longer hull with much higher engine power in order to attain greater speeds first battlecruisers were designed in united kingdom in first decade of century as a development of armoured cruiser at same time as dreadnought succeeded pre dreadnought battleship goal of design was to outrun any ship with similar armament and chase down any ship with lesser armament they were intended to hunt down slower older armoured cruisers and destroy them with heavy gunfire while avoiding combat with more powerful but slower battleships however as more and more battlecruisers were built they were increasingly used alongside better protected battleships battlecruisers served in navies of uk germany ottoman empire australia and japan during world war i most notably at battle of falkland islands and in several raids and skirmishes in north sea which culminated in a pitched fleet battle battle of jutland british battlecruisers in particular suffered heavy losses at jutland where poor fire safety and ammunition handling practices left them vulnerable to catastrophic magazine explosions following hits to their main turrets from large calibre shells this dismal showing led to a persistent general belief that battlecruisers were too thinly armoured to function successfully by end of war capital ship design had developed with battleships becoming faster and battlecruisers becoming more heavily armoured blurring distinction between a battlecruiser and a fast battleship washington naval treaty which limited capital ship construction from 1922 onwards treated battleships and battlecruisers identically and new generation of battlecruisers planned was scrapped under terms of treaty improvements in armor design and propulsion created 1930s fast battleship with speed of a battlecruiser and armor of a battleship making battlecruiser in traditional sense effectively an obsolete concept thus from 1930s on only royal navy continued to use battlecruiser as a classification for world war i era capital ships that remained in fleet while japan s battlecruisers remained in service they had been significantly reconstructed and were re rated as full fledged fast battleships battlecruisers were put into action again during world war ii and only one survived to end there was also renewed interest in large cruiser killer type warships but few were ever begun as construction of battleships and battlecruisers was curtailed in favor of more needed convoy escorts aircraft carriers and cargo ships in post cold war era soviet of large guided missile cruisers have also been termed battlecruisers background battlecruiser was developed by royal navy in first years of 20th century as an evolution of armoured cruiser sondhaus p 199 roberts p 13 first armoured cruisers had been built in 1870s as an attempt to give armour protection to ships fulfilling typical cruiser roles of patrol trade protection and power projection however results were rarely satisfactory as weight of armour required for any meaningful protection usually meant that ship became almost as slow as a battleship as a result navies preferred to build protected cruisers with an armoured deck protecting their engines or simply no armour at all in 1890s technology began to change this balance new krupp steel armour meant that it was now possible to give a cruiser side armour which would protect it against quick firing guns of enemy battleships and cruisers alike sumida p 19 in 1896 97 france and russia who were regarded as likely allies in event of war started to build large fast armoured cruisers taking advantage of this in event of a war between britain and france or russia or both these cruisers threatened to cause serious difficulties for british empire s worldwide trade breyer p 47 britain which had concluded in 1892 that it needed twice as many cruisers as any potential enemy to adequately protect its empire s sea lanes responded to perceived threat by laying down its own large armoured cruisers between 1899 and 1905 it completed or laid down seven classes of this type a total of 35 ships lambert 2002 pp 20 22 osborne pp 61 62 this building program in turn prompted french and russians to increase their own construction imperial german navy began to build large armoured cruisers for use on their overseas stations laying down eight between 1897 and 1906 gardiner gray p 142 osborne pp 62 74 cost of this cruiser arms race was significant in period 1889 1896 royal navy spent ps7 3 million on new large cruisers from 1897 to 1904 it spent ps26 9 million sumida p 351 table 9 figures are for first class cruisers and exclude armament many armoured cruisers of new kind were just as large and expensive as equivalent battleship thumb a minotaur class armoured cruiser increasing size and power of armoured cruiser led to suggestions in british naval circles that cruisers should displace battleships entirely battleship s main advantage was its 12 inch heavy guns and heavier armour designed to protect from shells of similar size however for a few years after 1900 it seemed that those advantages were of little practical value torpedo now had a range of 2 000 yards and it seemed unlikely that a battleship would engage within torpedo range however at ranges of more than 2 000 yards it became increasingly unlikely that heavy guns of a battleship would score any hits as heavy guns relied on primitive aiming techniques secondary batteries of 6 inch quick firing guns firing more plentiful shells were more likely to hit enemy sumida pp 42 44 as naval expert fred t jane wrote in june 1902 is there anything outside of 2 000 yards that big gun in its hundreds of tons of medieval castle can effect that its weight in 6 inch guns without castle could not effect equally well and inside 2 000 what in these days of gyros is there that torpedo cannot effect with far more certainty quoted in sumida p 44 in 1904 admiral john jacky fisher became first sea lord senior officer of royal navy he had for some time thought about development of a new fast armoured ship he was very fond of second class battleship a faster more lightly armoured battleship roberts p 15 mackay pp 212 13 as early as 1901 there is confusion in fisher s writing about whether he saw battleship or cruiser as model for future developments this did not stop him from commissioning designs from naval architect w h gard for an armoured cruiser with heaviest possible armament for use with fleet design gard submitted was for a ship between capable of armed with four 9 2 inch and twelve guns in twin gun turrets and protected with six inches of armour along her belt and 9 2 inch turrets on her 7 5 inch turrets 10 inches on her conning tower and up to on her decks however mainstream british naval thinking between 1902 and 1904 was clearly in favour of heavily armoured battleships rather than fast ships that fisher favoured breyer p 48 battle of tsushima proved conclusively effectiveness of heavy guns over intermediate ones and need for a uniform main caliber on a ship for fire control even before this royal navy had begun to consider a shift away from mixed calibre armament of 1890s pre dreadnought to an all big gun design and preliminary designs circulated for battleships with all 12 inch or all 10 inch guns and armoured cruisers with all 9 2 inch guns roberts pp 16 17 in late 1904 not long after royal navy had decided to use 12 inch guns for its next generation of battleships because of their superior performance at long range fisher began to argue that big gun cruisers could replace battleships altogether continuing improvement of torpedo meant that submarines and destroyers would be able to destroy battleships this in fisher s view heralded end of battleship or at least compromised validity of heavy armour protection nevertheless armoured cruisers would remain vital for commerce protection mackay pp 324 25 roberts pp 17 18 sumida p 52 fisher s views were very controversial within royal navy and even given his position as first sea lord he was not in a position to insist on his own approach thus he assembled a committee on designs consisting of a mixture of civilian and naval experts to determine approach to both battleship and armoured cruiser construction in future while stated purpose of committee was to investigate and report on future requirements of ships fisher and his associates had already made key decisions roberts p 19 terms of reference for committee were for a battleship capable of with 12 inch guns and no intermediate calibres capable of docking in existing drydocks breyer p 115 and a cruiser capable of also with 12 inch guns and no intermediate armament armoured like most recent armoured cruiser and also capable of using existing docks first battlecruisers under selborne plan of 1902 royal navy intended to start three new battleships and four armoured cruisers each year however in late 1904 it became clear that 1905 1906 programme would have to be considerably smaller because of lower than expected tax revenue and need to buy out two chilean battleships under construction in british yards lest they be purchased by russians for use against japanese britain s ally these economies meant that 1905 1906 programme consisted only of one battleship but three armoured cruisers battleship became revolutionary battleship and cruisers became three ships of fisher later claimed however that he had argued during committee for cancellation of remaining battleship sumida p 55 construction of new class was begun in 1906 and completed in 1908 delayed perhaps to allow their designers to learn from any problems with dreadnought roberts pp 24 25 ships fulfilled design requirement quite closely on a displacement similar to dreadnought invincibles were longer to accommodate additional boilers and more powerful turbines to propel them at moreover new ships could maintain this speed for days whereas pre dreadnought battleships could not generally do so for more than an hour burr pp 7 8 armed with eight 12 inch mk x guns compared to ten on dreadnought they had of armour protecting hull and gun turrets dreadnoughts armour by comparison was at its thickest breyer pp 114 17 class had a very marked increase in speed displacement and firepower compared to most recent armoured cruisers but no more armour while invincibles were to fill same role as armoured cruisers they succeeded they were expected to do so more effectively specifically their roles were heavy reconnaissance because of their power invincibles could sweep away screen of enemy cruisers to close with and observe an enemy battlefleet before using their superior speed to retire close support for battle fleet they could be stationed at ends of battle line to stop enemy cruisers harassing battleships and to harass enemy s battleships if they were busy fighting battleships also invincibles could operate as fast wing of battlefleet and try to outmanoeuvre enemy pursuit if an enemy fleet ran then invincibles would use their speed to pursue and their guns to damage or slow enemy ships commerce protection new ships would hunt down enemy cruisers and commerce raiders roberts p 18 thumb left britain s first battlecruiser confusion about how to refer to these new battleship size armoured cruisers set in almost immediately even in late 1905 before work was begun on invincibles a royal navy memorandum refers to large armoured ships meaning both battleships and large cruisers in october 1906 admiralty began to classify all post dreadnought battleships and armoured cruisers as capital ships while fisher used term dreadnought to refer either to his new battleships or battleships and armoured cruisers together mackay pp 325 26 at same time invincible class themselves were referred to as cruiser battleships dreadnought cruisers term battlecruiser was first used by fisher in 1908 finally on 24 november 1911 admiralty weekly order no 351 laid down that all cruisers of invincible and later types are for future to be described and classified as battle cruisers to distinguish them from armoured cruisers of earlier date admiralty weekly orders 351 description and classification of cruisers of invincible and later types adm 182 2 quoted at dreadnought project battle cruiser in royal navy along with questions over new ships nomenclature came uncertainty about their actual role due to their lack of protection if they were primarily to act as scouts for battle fleet and hunter killers of enemy cruisers and commerce raiders then seven inches of belt armour with which they had been equipped would be adequate if on other hand they were expected to reinforce a battle line of dreadnoughts with their own heavy guns they were too thin skinned to be safe from an enemy s heavy guns invincibles were essentially extremely large heavily armed fast armoured cruisers however viability of armoured cruiser was already in doubt a cruiser that could have worked with fleet might have been a more viable option for taking over that role gardiner gray p p 494 because of invincibles size and armament naval authorities considered them capital ships almost from their inception an assumption that might have been inevitable complicating matters further was that many naval authorities including lord fisher had made overoptimistic assessments from battle of tsushima in 1905 about armoured cruiser s ability to survive in a battle line against enemy capital ships due to their superior speed these assumptions had been made without taking into account russian baltic fleet s inefficiency and tactical ineptitude by time term battlecruiser had been given to invincibles idea of their parity with battleships had been fixed in many people s minds not everyone was so convinced brasseys naval annual for instance stated that with vessels as large and expensive as invincibles an admiral will be certain to put them in line of battle where their comparatively light protection will be a disadvantage and their high speed of no value as quoted in massie pp 494 95 those in favor of battlecruiser countered with two points first since all capital ships were vulnerable to new weapons such as torpedo armour had lost some of its validity and second because of its greater speed battlecruiser could control range at which it engaged an enemy friedman p 10 battlecruisers in dreadnought arms race between launching of invincibles to just after outbreak of first world war battlecruiser played a junior role in developing dreadnought arms race as it was never wholeheartedly adopted as key weapon in british imperial defence as fisher had presumably desired biggest factor for this lack of acceptance was marked change in britain s strategic circumstances between their conception and commissioning of first ships prospective enemy for britain had shifted from a franco russian alliance with many armoured cruisers to a resurgent and increasingly belligerent germany diplomatically britain had entered entente cordiale in 1904 and anglo russian entente neither france nor russia posed a particular naval threat russian navy had largely been sunk or captured in russo japanese war of 1904 1905 while french were in no hurry to adopt new dreadnought type design britain also boasted very cordial relations with two of significant new naval powers japan bolstered by anglo japanese alliance signed in 1902 and renewed in 1905 and us these changed strategic circumstances and great success of dreadnought ensured that she rather than invincible became new model capital ship nevertheless battlecruiser construction played a part in renewed naval arms race sparked by dreadnought sondhaus pp 199 202 thumb last battlecruiser built before world war i for their first few years of service invincibles entirely fulfilled fisher s vision of being able to sink any ship fast enough to catch them and run from any ship capable of sinking them an invincible would also in many circumstances be able to take on an enemy pre dreadnought battleship naval circles concurred that armoured cruiser in its current form had come to logical end of its development and invincibles were so far ahead of any enemy armoured cruiser in firepower and speed that it proved difficult to justify building more or bigger cruisers roberts p 25 mackay pp 324 25 this lead was extended by surprise both dreadnought and invincible produced by having been built in secret this prompted most other navies to delay their building programmes and radically revise their designs sondhaus pp 201 02 this was particularly true for cruisers because details of invincible class were kept secret for longer this meant that last german armoured cruiser was armed with only guns and was no match for new battlecruisers staff pp 3 4 royal navy s early superiority in capital ships led to rejection of a 1905 1906 design that would essentially have fused battlecruiser and battleship concepts into what would eventually become fast battleship x4 design combined full armour and armament of dreadnought with 25 knot speed of invincible additional cost could not be justified given existing british lead and new liberal government s need for economy slower and cheaper a relatively close copy of dreadnought was adopted instead roberts p 26 x4 concept would eventually be fulfilled in and later by other navies breyer pp 61 62 next british battlecruisers were three slightly improved invincibles built to fundamentally same specification partly due to political pressure to limit costs and partly due to secrecy surrounding german battlecruiser construction particularly about heavy armour of roberts pp 28 29 this class came to be widely seen as a 1999 p 57 and next generation of british battlecruisers were markedly more powerful by 1909 1910 a sense of national crisis about rivalry with germany outweighed cost cutting and a naval panic resulted in approval of a total of eight capital ships in 1909 1910 sondhaus p 203 fisher pressed for all eight to be battlecruisers roberts p 32 but was unable to have his way he had to settle for six battleships and two battlecruisers of lions carried eight 13 5 inch guns now standard caliber of british super dreadnought battleships speed increased to and armour protection while not as good as in german designs was better than in previous british battlecruisers with armour belt and barbettes two lions were followed by very similar roberts pp 31 33 thumb left sms seydlitz alt a large gray ship in port two funnels in center of ship emit clouds of smoke by 1911 germany had built battlecruisers of her own and superiority of british ships could no longer be assured moreover german navy did not share fisher s view of battlecruiser in contrast to british focus on increasing speed and firepower germany progressively improved armour and staying power of their ships to better british battlecruisers sondhaus pp 202 03 von der tann begun in 1908 and completed in 1910 carried eight 11 1 inch guns but with 11 1 inch 283 mm armour she was far better protected than invincibles two s were quite similar but carried ten 11 1 inch guns of an improved design breyer pp 269 72 designed in 1909 and finished in 1913 was a modified moltke speed increased by one knot to while her armour had a maximum thickness of 12 inches equivalent to s of a few years earlier seydlitz was germany s last battlecruiser completed before world war i breyer pp 267 272 next step in battlecruiser design came from japan imperial japanese navy had been planning ships from 1909 and was determined that since japanese economy could support relatively few ships each would be more powerful than its likely competitors initially class was planned with invincibles as benchmark on learning of british plans for lion and likelihood that new u s navy battleships would be armed with guns japanese decided to radically revise their plans and go one better a new plan was drawn up carrying eight 14 inch guns and capable of thus marginally having edge over lions in speed and firepower heavy guns were also better positioned being superfiring both fore and aft with no turret amidships armour scheme was also marginally improved over lions with nine inches of armour on turrets and on barbettes first ship in class was built in britain and a further three constructed in japan evans peattie pp 161 63 japanese also re classified their powerful armoured cruisers of tsukuba and ibuki classes carrying four 12 inch guns as battlecruisers nonetheless their armament was weaker and they were slower than any battlecruiser gardiner gray p 233 thumb kongo next british battlecruiser was intended initially as fourth ship in lion class but was substantially redesigned she retained eight 13 5 inch guns of her predecessors but they were positioned like those of kongo for better fields of fire she was faster making on sea trials and carried a heavier secondary armament tiger was also more heavily armoured on whole while maximum thickness of armour was same at nine inches height of main armour belt was increased roberts pp 37 38 not all desired improvements for this ship were approved however her designer sir eustace tennyson d eyncourt had wanted small bore water tube boilers and geared turbines to give her a speed of but he received no support from authorities and engine makers refused his request breyer p 136 1912 saw work begin on three more german battlecruisers of first german battlecruisers to mount 12 inch guns these ships like tiger and kongos had their guns arranged in superfiring turrets for greater efficiency their armour and speed was similar to previous seydlitz class breyer pp 277 78 in 1913 russian empire also began construction of four ship which were designed for service in baltic sea these ships were designed to carry twelve 14 inch guns with armour up to 12 inches thick and a speed of heavy armour and relatively slow speed of these ships made them more similar to german designs than to british ships construction of borodinos was halted by first world war and all were scrapped after end of russian civil war breyer p 399 world war i construction for most of combatants capital ship construction was very limited during war germany finished derfflinger class and began work on mackensens were a development of derfflinger class with 13 8 inch guns and a broadly similar armour scheme designed for breyer pp 283 84 in britain jackie fisher returned to office of first sea lord in october 1914 his enthusiasm for big fast ships was unabated and he set designers to producing a design for a battlecruiser with 15 inch guns because fisher expected next german battlecruiser to steam at 28 knots he required new british design to be capable of 32 knots he planned to reorder two s which had been approved but not yet laid down to a new design fisher finally received approval for this project on 28 december 1914 and they became with six 15 inch guns but only 6 inch armour they were a further step forward from tiger in firepower and speed but returned to level of protection of first british battlecruisers roberts pp 46 47 at same time fisher resorted to subterfuge to obtain another three fast lightly armoured ships that could use several spare gun turrets left over from battleship construction these ships were essentially light battlecruisers and fisher occasionally referred to them as such but officially they were classified as large light cruisers this unusual designation was required because construction of new capital ships had been placed on hold while there were no limits on light cruiser construction they became and her sisters and and there was a bizarre imbalance between their main guns of 15 inches or in furious and their armour which at thickness was on scale of a light cruiser design was generally regarded as a failure nicknamed in fleet outrageous uproarious and spurious though later conversion of ships to aircraft carriers was very successful roberts pp 50 52 fisher also speculated about a new mammoth but lightly built battlecruiser that would carry guns which he termed this never got beyond concept stage breyer p 172 it is often held that renown and courageous classes were designed for fisher s plan to land troops possibly russian on german baltic coast specifically they were designed with a reduced draught which might be important in shallow baltic this is not clear cut evidence that ships were designed for baltic it was considered that earlier ships had too much draught and not enough freeboard under operational conditions roberts argues that focus on baltic was probably unimportant at time ships were designed but was inflated later after disastrous dardanelles campaign roberts p 51 final british battlecruiser design of war was which was born from a requirement for an improved version of queen elizabeth battleship project began at end of 1915 after fisher s final departure from admiralty while initially envisaged as a battleship senior sea officers felt that britain had enough battleships but that new battlecruisers might be required to combat german ships being built british overestimated german progress on mackensen class as well as their likely capabilities a battlecruiser design with eight 15 inch guns 8 inches of armour and capable of 32 knots was decided on experience of battlecruisers at battle of jutland meant that design was radically revised and transformed again into a fast battleship with armour up to 12 inches thick but still capable of first ship in class was built according to this design to counter possible completion of any of mackensen class ship plans for her three sisters on which little work had been done were revised once more later in 1916 and in 1917 to improve protection roberts pp 55 61 admiral class would have been only british ships capable of taking on german mackensen class nevertheless german shipbuilding was drastically slowed by war and while two mackensens were launched none were ever completed roberts pp 60 61 germans also worked briefly on a further three ships of which were modified versions of mackensens with 15 inch guns groner pp 58 59 work on three additional admirals was suspended in march 1917 to enable more escorts and merchant ships to be built to deal with new threat from u boats to trade they were finally cancelled in february 1919 battlecruisers in action first combat involving battlecruisers during world war i was battle of heligoland bight in august 1914 a force of british light cruisers and destroyers entered heligoland bight part of north sea closest to hamburg to attack german destroyer patrols when they met opposition from light cruisers vice admiral david beatty took his squadron of five battlecruisers into bight and turned tide of battle ultimately sinking three german light cruisers and killing their commander rear admiral leberecht maass burr pp 21 22 german battlecruiser perhaps made most impact early in war stationed in mediterranean she and escorting light cruiser evaded british and french ships on outbreak of war and steamed to constantinople istanbul with two british battlecruisers in hot pursuit two german ships were handed over to ottoman navy and this was instrumental in bringing ottoman empire into war as one of central powers goeben herself renamed

bank in 1915 barbette of german flagship seydlitz was struck by a british 13 5 inch shell from hms lion shell did not penetrate barbette but it dislodged a piece of barbette armour that allowed flame from shell s detonation to enter barbette propellant charges being hoisted upwards were ignited and fireball flashed up into turret and down into magazine setting fire to charges removed from their brass cartridge cases gun crew tried to escape into next turret which allowed flash to spread into that turret as well killing crews of both turrets seydlitz was saved from near certain destruction only by emergency flooding of her after magazines which had been effected by wilhelm heidkamp this near disaster was due to way that ammunition handling was arranged and was common to both german and british battleships and battlecruisers but lighter protection on latter made them more vulnerable to turret or barbette being penetrated germans learned from investigating damaged seydlitz and instituted measures to ensure that ammunition handling minimised any possible exposure to flash staff pp 23 24 43 apart from cordite handling battle was mostly inconclusive though both british flagship lion and seydlitz were severely damaged lion lost speed causing her to fall behind rest of battleline and beatty was unable to effectively command his ships for remainder of engagement a british signalling error allowed german battlecruisers to withdraw as most of beatty s squadron mistakenly concentrated on crippled armoured cruiser blucher sinking her with great loss of life british

flagship lion herself was almost lost in a similar manner save for heroic actions of major francis harvey roberts p 116 better armoured german battlecruisers fared better in part due to poor performance of british fuzes british shells tended to explode or break up on impact with german armour halpern p 328 only german battlecruiser lost at jutland had only 128 killed staff pp 41 42 for

of ever more powerful battleships and battlecruisers new burst of shipbuilding that each nation s navy desired was politically controversial and potentially economically crippling this nascent arms

treaty of versailles germany was not allowed any modern capital ships at all chesneau p 218 through 1920s and 1930s only britain and japan retained battlecruisers often modified and rebuilt from their

displacement in theory she combined firepower and armour of a battleship with speed of a battlecruiser causing some to refer to her as a fast battleship however her protection was markedly less than

time to develop new heavy guns for their latest designs and to refine their battlecruiser designs in light of combat experience in europe imperial japanese navy began four s these vessels would have been of unprecedented size and power as fast and well armoured as hood whilst carrying a main battery of ten 16 inch guns most powerful armament ever proposed for a battlecruiser they were for all intents and purposes fast battleships only differences between them and s which were to precede them were less side armour and a increase in speed breyer p 353 united states navy which had worked on its battlecruiser designs since 1913 and watched latest developments in this class with great care responded with if completed as planned they would have been exceptionally fast and well armed with eight 16 inch guns but carried armour little better than invincibles this after an increase in protection following jutland breyer p 234 final stage in post war battlecruiser race came with british response to amagi and lexington types four g3 battlecruisers royal navy documents of period often described any battleship with a speed of over about as a battlecruiser regardless of amount of protective armour although g3 was considered by most to be a well balanced fast battleship gardiner gray pp 41 42 washington naval treaty meant that none of these designs came to fruition ships that had been started were either broken up on slipway or converted to aircraft carriers in japan amagi and were selected for conversion amagi was damaged beyond repair by 1923 great kanto earthquake and was broken up for scrap hull of one of proposed tosa class battleships was converted in her stead gardiner gray p 235 united states navy also converted two battlecruiser hulls into aircraft carriers

over course of 1930s including modern fire control systems increased numbers of anti aircraft guns and in march 1941 radar konstam pp 33 34 naval rearmament in late 1930s navies began to build capital ships again and during this period a number of large commerce raiders and small fast battleships were built that are sometimes referred to as battlecruisers germany and russia designed new battlecruisers during this period though only latter laid down two of 35 000 ton they were still on slipways when germans invaded in 1941 and construction was suspended both ships were scrapped after war mclaughlin 2004 pp 112 114 germans planned three battlecruisers of as part of expansion of kriegsmarine plan z with six 15 inch guns high speed excellent range but very thin armour they were intended as commerce raiders only one was ordered shortly before world war ii no work was ever done on it no names were assigned and they were known by their contract names o p and q new class was not universally welcomed in kriegsmarine their abnormally light protection gained it derogatory nickname ohne panzer without armour nonsense within certain circles of navy garzke dulin pp 353 54 363 groner p 68 world war ii royal navy deployed some of its battlecruisers during norwegian campaign in april 1940 and were engaged during action off lofoten by renown in very bad weather and disengaged after gneisenau was damaged one of renowns 15 inch shells passed through gneisenaus director control tower without exploding severing electrical and communication cables as it went and destroyed rangefinders for forward 150 mm 5 9 in turrets main battery fire control had to be shifted aft due to loss of electrical power another shell from renown knocked out gneisenaus aft turret garzke dulin pp 135 36 british ship was struck twice by german shells that failed to inflict any significant damage burt p 243 she was only pre war battlecruiser to survive war chesneau pp 9 173 in early years of war various german ships had a measure of success hunting merchant ships in atlantic allied battlecruisers such as renown repulse and fast battleships dunkerque and were employed on operations to hunt down commerce raiding german ships one stand up fight occurred when battleship and heavy cruiser sortied into north atlantic to attack british shipping and were intercepted by hood and battleship in may 1941 in battle of denmark strait elderly british battlecruiser was no match for modern german battleship within minutes bismarcks 15 inch shells caused a magazine explosion in hood reminiscent of battle of jutland only three men survived whitley 1998 p 127 first battlecruiser to see action in pacific war was repulse when she was sunk by japanese torpedo bombers north of singapore on 10 december 1941 whilst in company with prince of wales she was lightly damaged by a single bomb and near missed by two others in first japanese attack her speed and agility enabled her to avoid other attacks by level bombers and dodge 33 torpedoes last group of torpedo bombers attacked from multiple directions and repulse was struck by five torpedoes she quickly capsized with loss of 27 officers and 486 crewmen 42 officers and 754 enlisted men were rescued by escorting destroyers shores cull izawa pp 116 21 123 loss of repulse and prince of wales conclusively proved vulnerability of capital ships to aircraft without air cover of their own osborne pp 127 28 japanese kongo class battlecruisers were extensively used as carrier escorts for most of their wartime career due to their high speed their world war i era armament was weaker and their upgraded armour was still thin compared to contemporary battleships on 13 november 1942 during first naval battle of guadalcanal hiei stumbled across american cruisers and destroyers at point blank range ship was badly damaged in encounter and had to be towed by her sister ship kirishima both were spotted by american aircraft following morning and kirishima was forced to cast off her tow because of repeated aerial attacks hieis captain ordered her crew to abandon ship after further damage and scuttled hiei in early evening of 14 november on night of 14 15 november during second naval battle of guadalcanal kirishima returned to ironbottom sound but encountered american battleships and while failing to detect washington kirishima engaged south dakota with some effect washington opened fire a few minutes later at short range and badly damaged kirishima knocking out her aft turrets jamming her rudder and hitting ship below waterline flooding proved to be uncontrollable and kirishima capsized three and a half hours later returning to japan after battle of leyte gulf kongo was torpedoed and sunk by american submarine on 21 november 1944 haruna was moored at kure japan when naval base was attacked by american carrier aircraft on 24 and 28 july ship was only lightly damaged by a single bomb hit on 24 july but was hit a dozen more times on 28 july and sank at her pier she was refloated after war and scrapped in early 1946 large cruisers or cruiser killers thumb one of united states navy s two large cruisers a late renaissance in popularity of ships between battleships and cruisers in size occurred on eve of world war ii described by some as battlecruisers but never classified as capital ships they were variously described as super cruisers large cruisers or even unrestricted cruisers dutch american and japanese navies all planned these new classes specifically to counter heavy cruisers or their counterparts being built by their naval rivals chesneau p 388 garzke dulin p 86 friedman 1984 p 288 mclaughlin 2006 p 104 first such battlecruisers were dutch design 1047 designed to protect their colonies in east indies in face of japanese aggression never officially assigned names these ships were designed with german and italian assistance while they broadly resembled german scharnhorst class and had same main battery they would have been more lightly armoured and only protected against eight inch gunfire although design was mostly completed work on vessels never commenced as germans overran netherlands in may 1940 first ship would have been laid down in june of that year noot pp 243 249 268 only class of these late battlecruisers actually built were united states navy s large cruisers two of them were completed and a third was cancelled while under construction and three others to be named philippines puerto rico and samoa were cancelled before they were laid down they were classified as large cruisers instead of battlecruisers and their status as non capital ships evidenced by their being named for territories or protectorates battleships in contrast were named after states and cruisers after cities with a main armament of nine 12 inch guns in three triple turrets and a displacement of alaskas were twice size of s and had guns some 50 larger in diameter they lacked thick armoured belt and intricate torpedo defence system of true capital ships however unlike most battlecruisers they were considered a balanced design according to cruiser standards as their protection could withstand fire from their own caliber of gun albeit only in a very narrow range band they were designed to hunt down japanese heavy cruisers though by time they entered service most japanese cruisers had been sunk by american aircraft or submarines friedman 1984 pp 288 89 296 301 02 like contemporary fast battleships their speed ultimately made them more useful as carrier escorts and bombardment ships than as surface combatants they were developed to be whitley 1995 pp 278 79 japanese started designing class which was similar to alaska but with guns news of alaskas led them to upgrade design creating design b 65 armed with 356 mm guns b65s would have been best armed of new breed of battlecruisers but they still would have had only sufficient protection to keep out eight inch shells much like dutch japanese got as far as completing design for b65s but never laid them down by time designs were ready japanese navy recognized that they had little use for vessels and that their priority for construction should lie with aircraft carriers like alaskas japanese did not call these ships battlecruisers referring to them instead as super heavy cruisers jentschura jung mickel p 40 garzke dulin pp 86 87 cold war era designs thumb right 250px admiral lazarev formerly frunze second ship of her class in spite of fact that most navies abandoned battleship and battlecruiser concepts after world war ii joseph stalin s fondness for big gun armed warships caused soviet union to plan a large cruiser class in late 1940s in soviet navy they were termed heavy cruisers mclaughlin 2006 p 104 fruits of this program were project 82 stalingrad cruisers of standard load nine guns and a speed of three ships were laid down in 1951 1952 but they were cancelled in april 1953 after stalin s death only central armoured hull section of first ship stalingrad was launched in 1954 and then used as a target mclaughlin 2006 pp 116 121 22 soviet is sometimes referred to as a battlecruiser gardiner chumbley budzbon p 328 this description arises from their over displacement which is roughly equal to that of a first world war battleship and more than twice displacement of contemporary cruisers upon entry into service kirov was largest surface ship aside from aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships to be built since world war ii kirov class lacks armour that distinguishes battlecruisers from ordinary cruisers and they are classified as heavy nuclear powered missile cruisers by russia with their primary surface armament consisting of twenty p 700 granit surface to surface missiles four members of class were completed during 1980s and 1990s but due to budget constraints only is operational with russian navy though plans were announced in 2010 to return other three ships to service as of 2012 one ship was being refitted but other two ships are reportedly beyond economical repair saunders p 674 see also list of
