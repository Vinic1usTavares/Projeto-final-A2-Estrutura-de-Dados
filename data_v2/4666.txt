receiving their medals much of discussion after match centred around referee terje hauge s decision to send off lehmann football pundit mark lawrenson stated game changed when arsenal goalkeeper jens lehmann was sent off arsenal manager arsene wenger agreed when jens lehmann got sent off that left us with 70 minutes to play with ten against eleven against a team that retains ball very well he refused to openly criticise this decision although he did criticise decision to award barcelona s first goal as he felt that samuel eto o was offside wenger was also adamant that his young side would bounce back from defeat one person who did criticise referee was thierry henry stating i was kicked all over place i expected referee to do his job i don t think he did there was much discussion after match over whether henry would remain with arsenal or move to barcelona whom he had been linked with a move to over past months arsene wenger was asked post match if henry would leave to which arsenal manager replied i don t know i don t think so however on 19 may henry signed a new four year contract with arsenal ending speculation about a possible move to barcelona thierry henry paid tribute to larsson s contribution to barcelona s win after game saying people always talk about ronaldinho eto o giuly and everything but i didn t see them today i saw henrik larsson he came on he changed game that is what killed game sometimes you talk about ronaldinho and eto o and people like that you need to talk about proper footballer who made difference and that was henrik larsson tonight henry also remarked you have to remember that barcelona is a team it s not eto o it s not ronaldinho on wednesday man who made difference was henrik larsson you have to give him credit for that because when he came on he made some amazing runs around box and he showed he is a team player you saw two times he fed ball back to people and that s what i always talk about he is a team player he did that against us even though first goal was a close offside decision larsson s addition giving barcelona cutting edge required to overcome arsenal was noted by international press henrik larsson who provided two assists for goals was delighted with triumph and had no regrets over deciding to leave barcelona after match i want to play football i feel i haven t played as much as i would love to because of great players we have at barcelona fellow barcelona player giovanni van bronckhorst was emotional as he won against his former club it s special to win final and even more special to do it against your old team samuel eto o scorer of barcelona s first goal cited liverpool s comeback against milan as inspiration for barcelona s victory after having seen what liverpool did last year we told ourselves not to throw in towel we followed liverpool s example barcelona manager frank rijkaard praised role of goalkeeper victor valdes in their victory stating that he made a number of important saves to keep them in match valdes played a decisive role he saved us at crucial moments see also 2006 uefa cup final 2006 uefa super cup arsenal f c in european football fc barcelona in international football
