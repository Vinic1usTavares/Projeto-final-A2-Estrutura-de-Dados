in late 1937 royal yugoslav air force vvkj placed an order with hawker aircraft for twelve hawker hurricane mk i fighters first foreign purchase of aircraft royal yugoslav air force vvkj operated british hawker hurricane mk i from 1938 to 1941 between 1938 and 1940 vvkj obtained 24 hurricane mk is from early production batches marking first foreign sale of aircraft twenty additional aircraft were built by zmaj under licence in yugoslavia when country was drawn into world war ii by german led axis invasion of april 1941 a total of 41 hurricane mk i s were in service as fighters they achieved some successes against luftwaffe aircraft but all yugoslav hurricanes were destroyed or captured during 11 day invasion in mid 1944 yugoslav partisans formed two royal air force squadrons nos 351 and 352 which both operated hurricane fighter bombers no 351 squadron flew hurricane mk iics during training and was later equipped with hurricane mk ivs and no 352 briefly flew hurricane mk iics during training before re equipping with supermarine spitfire mk vs both squadrons operated as part of no 281 wing raf of balkan air force conducting ground attack missions in support of partisan operations until end of war hurricanes remained in service with post war yugoslav air force until early 1950s acquisition thumb 350px a three view drawing of hawker hurricane mk i in early 1938 royal yugoslav air force vvkj placed an order with hawker aircraft for twelve hawker hurricane mk i fighters first foreign purchase of aircraft british government was willing to supply excess hurricanes to nations that were likely to oppose german expansion because rate of production of aircraft slightly exceeded capability of raf to introduce it at time first of these aircraft destined for yugoslav service was no 205 formerly which was flown from united kingdom to belgrade via france and italy arriving on 15 december 1938 first batch of aircraft were fitted with a rolls royce merlin ii engine driving a two blade wooden propeller initial order was followed by a second order of twelve which were fitted with merlin iii engines driving a three blade variable pitch propeller and were delivered in february and march 1940 at same time yugoslav government applied to build more under licence once negotiations were successfully concluded production lines were established at rogozarski plant in belgrade and zmaj factory in nearby zemun two plants were expected to build forty and sixty of aircraft respectively at a rate of twelve per month of locally built aircraft only twenty were completed by zmaj rogozarski plant did not produce any a total of 44 aircraft were put into service with vvkj operational service royal yugoslav air force once in service hurricane mk is were used to equip 52nd fighter group of 2nd fighter regiment based at knic and 33rd and 34th fighter groups of 4th fighter regiment based at bosanski aleksandrovac hurricanes were also operated by independent fighter squadron of 81st bomber group and by air training school both based at mostar all of these aircraft were deployed in fighter interceptor role immediately prior to german led axis invasion of yugoslavia in april 1941 41 of original 44 hurricanes were serviceable they were allocated as follows allocation of hurricane mk i aircraft 6 april and 164th and 106th fighter squadron at 06 45 on 6 april 1941 luftwaffe launched operation retribution a series of concerted bombing attacks on belgrade that coincided with air and ground attacks throughout country several waves of german aircraft approached belgrade during day initially junkers ju 87 stuka dive bombers escorted by fighters about 08 00 hurricanes of 52nd fighter group engaged second wave as it departed after bombing city one of dive bombers was shot down by three pilots from 163rd squadron for remainder of first day of invasion hurricanes of vvkj saw little action despite constant patrolling between kraljevo and kragujevac few of aircraft had radio sets so fighters usually arrived too late to take part in fighting two 4th fighter regiment machines were tasked with escorting bristol blenheim mk i light bombers to attack targets in austria but they lost sight of bombers in cloud cover one of pilots then attempted to intercept some german messerschmitt bf 109 fighters following day 2nd fighter regiment continued to patrol over central serbia protecting factories at kraljevo and kragujevac from potential german air attacks that never occurred 4th fighter regiment was also active patrolling over bosnia and croatia but saw little action except for attempts to intercept german reconnaissance aircraft two of air training school hurricanes scrambled to intercept a small formation of junkers ju 88 bombers as they flew over mostar towards sarajevo they were both hit by return fire wounding one pilot and forcing him to crash land other pilot continued pursuing bombers when he was attacked by a group of german bf 109s he was severely wounded bailed out and eventually died from loss of blood another hurricane was also claimed by germans on 7 april on 8 april main vvkj effort was directed towards a german ground thrust through gorge in southern kosovo by this time vvkj had lost over 60 per cent of its aircraft 70 aircraft from remnants of various bomber and fighter units were assembled for attack hurricanes of 52nd fighter group made up last wave of attacks on of closely packed convoys flying beneath low cloud in very poor weather both squadrons strafed germans one hurricane was hit and crash landed by road its pilot evading capture in north of country patrolling hurricanes of 4th regiment clashed with german fighters on several occasions without result other 4th regiment hurricanes escorted another bomber mission against targets in southern austria remaining five hurricanes of 105th squadron relocated to veliki radinci where other surviving aircraft had also concentrated following day heavy snow fell in some areas of yugoslavia grounding 52nd fighter group hurricanes at knic in north a major air battle developed between rovine and bosanski aleksandrovac involving hurricanes of both 106th and 108th squadrons yugoslavs shot down one or two bf 109s but lost two hurricanes in process by 10 april vvkj was disintegrating quickly in face of successful german onslaught but hurricanes of 105th squadron were able to get airborne despite continuing poor weather patrolling for and engaging german aircraft without result at knic rumours of approach of german ground forces led 164th squadron to attempt to fly its hurricanes to a safer airfield five machines got into air but almost immediately two of them collided and another flew into a mountain wreathed in fog two surviving pilots returned safely to knic meanwhile hurricanes of 163rd squadron had been rendered unserviceable by their crews to prevent their capture and use by germans when it became clear that rumours of approaching german forces were unfounded desperate attempts were made to return aircraft to flying condition same day hurricanes of 4th regiment scored a victory over a bf 109 while chasing reconnaissance aircraft over bosnia thumb left yugoslav hurricanes shot down a messerschmitt bf 110 heavy fighter example pictured on 11 april on 11 april 4th regiment hurricanes successfully shot down a messerschmitt bf 110 heavy fighter over nova gradiska following day two or three of remaining 105th squadron hurricanes were burned by ground crews at veliki radinci while other machines from same squadron flew to bijeljina where other aircraft had concentrated this move had only just been completed when a large formation of german bf 110s swept over airfield and destroyed over two dozen aircraft including all but one of 105th squadron hurricanes at knic approaching german vehicles caused last two 163rd squadron hurricanes to scramble flying to zemun first pilot landed safely but was immediately captured by armed volksdeutsche other pilot seeing that zemun was not safe broke off and tried to fly to but ran out of fuel and was killed when he tried to crash land near valjevo even at this late stage 4th regiment still had five or six airworthy hurricanes they continued to chase reconnaissance aircraft throughout day shooting down one ju 88 near banja luka when german bombers again attacked airfields around mostar one remaining hurricane of air training school attacked a ju 88 but was hit by return fire forcing pilot to bail out following day saw 4th regiment hurricanes again patrolling over bosnia downing another bf 110 this time over banja luka one aircraft was destroyed on 13 april pilot being badly wounded on 14 april one hurricane was still serviceable at niksic in montenegro this aircraft clashed with italian fighters on 14 or 15 april and was hit 37 times despite this it was still airworthy on 16 april when its pilot attempted to fly it to greece but he was forced to return due to poor weather after which aircraft was abandoned at least two hurricanes were captured intact by invading forces but this marked end of hawker hurricane in vvkj service as all opposition to axis invaders ceased on 18 april following yugoslav supreme command s unconditional surrender previous day yugoslav partisans establishment raising of yugoslav partisan manned squadrons within royal air force raf was discussed between partisan leader josip broz tito and head of british mission to partisans brigadier fitzroy maclean on 12 march 1944 as a result of this discussion an agreement was concluded later that month for raf to train yugoslav personnel who would man two squadrons one of fighters and one of fighter bombers after completing training these two squadrons were to conduct operations exclusively over yugoslavia it was agreed that new squadrons would largely be staffed by former vvkj personnel who had fled country during invasion and had later agreed to join partisans first squadron was raised at an airfield near benghazi libya as no 352 yugoslav squadron raf members took their partisan oaths on 21 may 1944 until late june this squadron was equipped with harvard training aircraft and hurricane mk iics which were then replaced by supermarine spitfire mk vs which it operated until end of war hurricane mk iics were handed over to a second partisan manned squadron raised as no 351 yugoslav squadron raf which was also established as a fighter bomber unit in libya on 1 july 1944 during its work up training no 351 squadron was re equipped with hurricane mk ivs it completed training including ground attack practice runs by 23 september by 2 october squadron had been transferred to an airfield near cannae in italy to join no 281 wing raf of balkan air force a combined allied organisation move was accompanied by complaints from partisan supreme command that hurricane was inferior to spitfire now being flown by no 352 squadron and also hawker typhoon complaints were ignored by raf and squadron operated hurricane mk ivs until end of war as did no 6 squadron raf a british manned squadron that also flew missions over yugoslavia even though aircraft had been taken out of frontline service in european theatre in march 1944 no 351 squadron was cleared for combat operations on 13 october and from 18 october squadron generally had 4 8 aircraft based at an airfield on now allied held island of vis in adriatic october december 1944 no 351 squadron flew its first mission on 13 october 1944 it involved six aircraft attacking an axis supply convoy near village of on 20 october aircraft from squadron supported by spitfires from no 352 squadron conducted rocket and strafing attacks on enemy columns near metkovic that were withdrawing in face of advancing partisan 26th dalmatian division mission was a success but one aircraft was lost to ground fire left thumb a hurricane mk iv of no 351 squadron nine days later hurricanes escorted by a pair of spitfires from no 352 squadron flew a patrol over island of rab and adjacent areas of adriatic but were unable to positively identify any targets on 4 november aircraft from no 351 squadron again escorted by two spitfires were tasked with interdicting road communications between bihac and knin one aircraft developed engine trouble and had to return to base but rest continued with mission they ran into heavy anti aircraft fire near knin and one aircraft was shot down pilot bailing out and being captured by germans next mission on 9 november was hampered by extremely poor weather over target area near trebinje one aircraft flew into a mountain killing pilot and another suffered engine trouble and crash landed near trebinje pilot escaping unhurt on 3 december 1944 no 351 squadron carried out a successful rocket attack against axis coastal defences on island of losinj launching from vis this was followed by a period of scouting and reconnaissance over several yugoslav regions hitting targets of opportunity sometimes escorted and supported by spitfires of no 352 squadron no 351 squadron ranged widely interdicting rail and road routes in eastern and western bosnia and throughout dalmatia and attacking axis maritime traffic off adriatic coast and islands as year drew to a close operations became severely hampered by worsening weather january march 1945 in january and february 1945 much better co ordination was achieved between two raf squadrons and partisan ground and maritime forces this was done through deployment of aviation liaison sections with main partisan formations initially with 8th corps and then also 5th corps on 4 january four hurricanes flew from vis to attack an enemy convoy travelling between mostar and sarajevo convoy was located near jablanica and seven trucks were destroyed aircraft went on to attack railway station in jablanica damaging one locomotive and ten wagons one hurricane was damaged by anti aircraft fire during mission on 22 january hurricanes escorted by spitfires attacked a ship of off island of rab firing sixteen rockets due to minimal luftwaffe presence over much of yugoslavia in many cases spitfire escorts from no 352 squadron were not needed to protect against enemy aircraft so they also engaged ground and maritime targets alongside hurricanes of no 351 squadron in february both squadrons provided support for liberation of major towns including nevesinje and mostar and patrolled and attacked targets of opportunity across bosnia and dalmatia specifically they supported mostar operation of 8th corps work of 11th corps clearing enemy from islands in northern adriatic and also 5th corps operations despite presence of liaison sections with ground forces procedures were not yet streamlined and several friendly fire incidents occurred during mostar operation in support of 11th corps operations hurricanes attacked german headquarters defences and naval traffic on and around islands of pag and krk on 7 february hurricanes of no 351 squadron were supporting 4th and 11th corps and attacked a column of german trucks and wagons on road between gospic and bihac when two of aircraft collided causing minor damage both aircraft crash landed in friendly territory and were written off but pilots escaped unharmed during february no 351 squadron re deployed to zemunik on mainland near zadar thumb partisan ground crews preparing to load rp 3 rockets onto hurricanes of no 351 squadron raf at prkos airfield alt a black and white photograph of men pulling a trolley with aircraft dispersed in near background in early march formation of 4th army was accompanied by development of even closer coordination and liaison with two squadrons air marker panels began to be used to show forward line of friendly troops and to identify friendly vehicles and liaison teams were deployed with commanders of lower level formations to communicate directly with supporting aircraft operations continued across bosnia and dalmatia in march and were extended to include support to advances in lika region and during capture of sarajevo and bihac as axis forces withdrew west towards zagreb hurricanes of no 351 squadron continued to harry them ambushing convoys and rocketing artillery positions between 1 january and 31 march 1945 hurricanes of no 351 squadron not only flew from cannae and vis but also from airfields at zemunik and prkos on mainland in same period squadron lost four aircraft and suffered damage to fifteen others of lost aircraft two were destroyed as a result of a collision one was lost after engine failure and only one was lost to anti aircraft fire four aircraft were damaged by anti aircraft fire remainder being damaged by fragments from their own rockets april may 1945 from beginning of april 1945 combat operations of no 351 squadron were focussed on supporting offensives by 4th army in lika and gorski kotar regions along croatian coastline and in istria in particular there was hard fighting in islands of northern adriatic on 5 april one hurricane was lost near babin potok when it flew into a mountain while supporting 19th dalmatian division s attack on elements of 11th ustase division resulting in death of pilot during this period all operations of no 351 squadron were carried out from airfield at zemunik two aircraft were destroyed and eighteen damaged between 2 and 8 may which proved to be last week of war raf did not permit squadron to operate due to political considerations regarding future status of trieste during its existence no 351 squadron flew 227 combat missions 119 ground attack sorties 87 reconnaissance missions 19 maritime and two search and rescue missions of 23 pilots that passed through squadron four were killed and one captured squadron lost nine aircraft and 38 others suffered damage mainly from anti aircraft fire squadron was released from raf control on 16 may 1945 yugoslav air force after war balkan air force s 16 surviving hurricanes continued to be used by yugoslav air force air arm of tito s new communist government hurricanes flew with 1st fighter regiment in 1945 followed by reconnaissance aviation regiment in 1947 1948 and 103rd reconnaissance aviation regiment between 1948 and 1951 hurricanes remained in service with post war yugoslav air force until early 1950s surviving example a hawker hurricane mk iv that flew as part of no 351 squadron is on display at museum of aviation in belgrade this aircraft serial number was manufactured in 1943 and remained in operation until it was withdrawn from service on 18
