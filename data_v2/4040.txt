landsat 1 ls 1 originally named earth resources technology satellite with label 1 or a sometimes attached abbreviated erts erts 1 or erts a was first satellite of united states landsat program it was a modified version of nimbus 4 meteorological satellite and was launched on july 23 1972 by a delta 900 rocket from vandenberg air force base in california near polar orbiting spacecraft served as a stabilized earth oriented platform for obtaining information on agricultural and forestry resources geology and mineral resources hydrology and water resources geography cartography environmental pollution oceanography and marine resources and meteorological phenomena background multi agency earth resources satellites program was begun in 1966 by department of interior goal of program was to gather data from earth via remote sensing techniques following year a feasibility study was performed for earth resources technology satellite bureau of budget bob did not grant funding to build satellite but provided 2 million to continue feasibility studies landsat 1 was originally named earth resources technology satellite with label 1 or a sometimes attached also known as erts erts a and erts 1 it was renamed to landsat in 1975 it was first satellite launched with sole purpose of studying and monitoring planet satellite design development in 1968 and 1969 nasa conducted studies with multispectral scanners in that same time period hughes entered into a contract with nasa to complete multispectral scanner mss for landsat 1 in 1970 general electric was selected as prime contractor for landsat 1 landsat 1 was manufactured by ge s space division in valley forge pennsylvania operation spacecraft was tall with a diameter two solar panel arrays that were long each with single axis articulation generated power for spacecraft landsat 1 had a liftoff weight of main spacecraft propulsion was controlled with three hydrazine thrusters an attitude control system permitted spacecraft s orientation to be maintained within plus or minus 0 7 degrees in all three axes spacecraft communications included a command subsystem operating at 154 2 and 2106 4 mhz and a pcm narrow band telemetry subsystem operating at 2287 5 and 137 86 mhz for spacecraft housekeeping attitude and sensor performance data video data from three camera rbv system was transmitted in both real time and tape recorder modes at 2265 5 mhz while information from mss was constrained to a 20 mhz radio frequency bandwidth at 2229 5 mhz satellite also carried two wide band video tape recorders capable of storing up to 30 minutes of scanner or camera data giving spacecraft s sensors a near global coverage capability satellite was also equipped with a data collection system dcs to collect information from remote individually equipped ground stations and to relay data to central acquisition stations due to orbit of satellite data could be obtained at a minimum of every 12 hours no data processing or signal multiplexing occurred on satellite design of dcs came from nimbus 3 platform then known as interrogation recording and location system sensors landsat 1 had two sensors to achieve its primary objectives return beam vidicon rbv and multispectral scanner mss rbv was manufactured by radio corporation of america rca rbv obtained visible light and near infrared photographic images of earth at launch rbv was considered primary sensor mss was manufactured by hughes aircraft company sensor was considered an experimental sensor and was secondary sensor until scientists reviewed data that was beamed back to earth after data was reviewed mss was considered primary sensor mss was a four channel scanner that obtained radiometric images of earth mission launch landsat 1 was launched july 23 1972 on a delta 0900 out of vandenberg air force base in california spacecraft was placed in a sun synchronous orbit with an altitude between 907 and 915 km spacecraft was placed in an orbit with an inclination of 99 degrees which orbited earth every 103 minutes operations landsat 1 s tape recorders malfunctioned in january 1978 and satellite was taken out of service results from launch until 1974 landsat 1 transmitted over 100 000 images which covered more than 75 of earth s surface majority of these images were taken with multispectral scanner on 5 august 1972 return beam vidicon failed after taking only 1690 images in 1976 landsat 1 discovered a tiny uninhabited island 20 kilometers off eastern coast of canada this island was thereafter designated landsat island after satellite mss provided more than 300 000 images over lifespan of satellite nasa oversaw 300 researchers that evaluated data that landsat 1 transmitted back to earth references category landsat program category spacecraft launched in 1972 category spacecraft launched by delta rockets
