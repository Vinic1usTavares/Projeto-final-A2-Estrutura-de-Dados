hungarian theoretical biologist aristid lindenmayer 1925 1989 developed l system a formal grammar which can be used to model plant growth patterns in style of fractals grzegorz arto mathematical theory of l systems academic press new york 1980 l systems have an alphabet of symbols that can be combined using production rules to build larger strings of symbols and a mechanism for translating generated strings into geometric structures in 1975 after centuries of slow development of mathematics of patterns by gottfried leibniz georg cantor helge von koch waclaw sierpinski and others benoit

512 517 in plants shapes colours and patterns of insect pollinated flowers like lily have evolved to attract insects such as bees radial patterns of colours and stripes some visible only in ultraviolet light serve as nectar guides that can be seen at a distance types of pattern symmetry symmetry is pervasive in living things animals mainly have bilateral or mirror symmetry as do leaves of plants and some flowers such as orchids plants often have radial or rotational symmetry as do many flowers and some groups of animals such as sea anemones fivefold symmetry is found in echinoderms group that includes starfish sea urchins and sea lilies among non living things snowflakes have striking sixfold symmetry each flake s structure forms a record of varying conditions during its crystallization with nearly same pattern of growth on each of its six arms crystals in general have a variety of symmetries and crystal habits they can be cubic or octahedral but true crystals cannot have fivefold symmetry unlike quasicrystals rotational symmetry is found at different scales among non living things including crown shaped splash pattern formed when a drop falls into a pond and both spheroidal shape and rings of a planet like saturn symmetry has a variety of causes radial symmetry suits organisms like sea anemones whose adults do not move food and threats may arrive from any direction but animals that move in one direction necessarily have upper and lower sides head and tail ends and therefore a left and a right head becomes specialised with a mouth and sense organs cephalisation and body becomes bilaterally symmetric though internal organs need not be more puzzling is reason for fivefold symmetry of echinoderms early echinoderms were bilaterally symmetrical as their larvae still are sumrall and wray argue that loss of old symmetry had both developmental and ecological causes trees fractals branching pattern of trees was described in italian renaissance by leonardo da vinci he stated that all branches of a tree at every stage of its height when put together are equal in thickness to trunk below them a more general version states that when a parent branch splits into two or more child branches surface areas of child branches add up to that of parent branch an equivalent formulation is that if a parent branch splits into two child branches then cross sectional diameters of parent and two child branches form a right angled triangle one explanation is that this allows trees to better withstand high winds simulations of biomechanical models agree with rule fractals are infinitely self similar iterated mathematical constructs having fractal dimension infinite iteration is not possible in nature so all fractal patterns are only approximate for example leaves of ferns and apiaceae are only self similar pinnate to 2 3 or 4 levels fern like growth patterns occur in plants and in animals including bryozoa corals hydrozoa like air fern argentea and in non living things notably electrical discharges lindenmayer system fractals can model different patterns of tree growth by varying a small number of parameters including branching angle distance between nodes or branch points length and number of branches per branch point fractal like patterns occur widely in nature in phenomena as diverse as clouds river networks geologic fault lines mountains coastlines animal coloration snow flakes crystals blood vessel branching actin cytoskeleton and ocean waves spirals spirals are common in plants and in some animals notably molluscs for example in nautilus a cephalopod mollusc each chamber of its shell is an approximate copy of next one scaled by a constant factor and arranged in a logarithmic spiral maor eli e story of a number princeton university press 2009 page 135 given a modern understanding of fractals a growth spiral can be seen as a special case of self similarity plant spirals can be seen in phyllotaxis arrangement of leaves on a stem and in arrangement of other parts as in composite flower heads and seed heads like sunflower or fruit structures like pineapple and snake fruit as well as in pattern of scales in pine cones where multiple spirals run both clockwise and anticlockwise these arrangements have explanations at different levels mathematics physics chemistry biology each individually correct but all necessary together phyllotaxis spirals can be generated mathematically from fibonacci ratios fibonacci sequence runs 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 each subsequent number being sum of two preceding ones for example when leaves alternate up a stem one rotation of spiral touches two leaves so pattern or ratio is 1 2 in hazel ratio is 1 3 in apricot it is 2 5 in pear it is 3 8 in almond it is 5 13 in disc phyllotaxis as in sunflower and daisy florets are arranged in fermat s spiral with fibonacci numbering at least when flowerhead is mature so all elements are same size fibonacci ratios approximate golden angle 137 which governs curvature of fermat s spiral from point of view of physics spirals are lowest energy configurations which emerge spontaneously through self organizing processes in dynamic systems from point of view of chemistry a spiral can be generated by a reaction diffusion process involving both activation and inhibition phyllotaxis is controlled by proteins that manipulate concentration of plant hormone auxin which activates meristem growth alongside other mechanisms to control relative angle of buds around stem from a biological perspective arranging leaves as far apart as possible in any given space is favoured by natural selection as it maximises access to resources especially sunlight for photosynthesis chaos flow meanders in mathematics a dynamical system is chaotic if it is highly sensitive to initial conditions so called butterfly effect which requires mathematical properties of topological mixing and dense periodic orbits alongside fractals chaos theory ranks as an essentially universal influence on patterns in nature there is a relationship between chaos and fractals strange in chaotic systems have a fractal dimension ruelle david chance and chaos princeton university press 1991 some cellular automata simple sets of mathematical rules that generate patterns have chaotic behaviour notably stephen wolfram s rule 30 wolfram stephen a new kind of science wolfram media 2002 vortex streets are zigzagging patterns of whirling vortices created by unsteady separation of flow of a fluid most often air or water over obstructing objects von karman theodore aerodynamics mcgraw hill 1963 dover 1994 smooth laminar flow starts to break up when size of obstruction or velocity of flow become large enough compared to viscosity of fluid meanders are sinuous bends in rivers or other channels which form as a fluid most often water flows around bends as soon as path is slightly curved size and curvature of each loop increases as helical flow drags material like sand and gravel across river to inside of bend outside of loop is left clean and unprotected so erosion accelerates further increasing meandering in a powerful positive feedback loop waves dunes waves are disturbances that carry energy as they move mechanical waves propagate through a medium air or water making it oscillate as they pass by french a p vibrations and waves nelson thornes 1971 wind waves are sea surface waves that create characteristic chaotic pattern of any large body of water though their statistical behaviour can be predicted with wind wave models as waves in water or wind pass over sand they create patterns of ripples when winds blow over large bodies of sand they create dunes sometimes in extensive dune fields as in taklamakan desert dunes may form a range of patterns including crescents very long straight lines stars domes parabolas and longitudinal or seif sword shapes barchans or crescent dunes are produced by wind acting on desert sand two horns of crescent and slip face point downwind sand blows over upwind face which stands at about 15 degrees from horizontal and falls onto slip face where it accumulates up to angle of repose of sand which is about 35 degrees when slip face exceeds angle of repose sand avalanches which is a nonlinear behaviour addition of many small amounts of sand causes nothing much to happen but then addition of a further small amount suddenly causes a large amount to avalanche strahler a o w physical geography science and systems of human environment john wiley 4th edition 2008 page 442 apart from this nonlinearity barchans behave rather like solitary waves bubbles foam a soap bubble forms a sphere a surface with minimal area smallest possible surface area for volume enclosed two bubbles together form a more complex shape outer surfaces of both bubbles are spherical these surfaces are joined by a third spherical surface as smaller bubble bulges slightly into larger one a foam is a mass of bubbles foams of different materials occur in nature foams composed of soap films obey plateau s laws which require three soap films to meet at each edge at 120deg and four soap edges to meet at each vertex at tetrahedral angle of about 109 5deg plateau s laws further require films to be smooth and continuous and to have a constant average curvature at every point for example a film may remain nearly flat on average by being curved up in one direction say left to right while being curved downwards in another direction say front to back frederick j jr and jean e taylor geometry of soap films and soap bubbles scientific american vol 235 pp 82 93 july 1976 structures with minimal surfaces can be used as tents lord kelvin identified problem of most efficient way to pack cells of equal volume as a foam in 1887 his solution uses just one solid bitruncated cubic honeycomb with very slightly curved faces to meet plateau s laws no better solution was found until 1993 when denis weaire and robert phelan proposed weaire phelan structure beijing national aquatics center adapted structure for their outer wall in 2008 summer olympics at scale of living cells foam patterns are common radiolarians sponge spicules exoskeletons and calcite skeleton of a sea urchin rugosa all resemble mineral casts of plateau foam boundaries skeleton of radiolarian a beautiful marine form drawn by ernst haeckel looks as if it is a sphere composed wholly of hexagons but this is mathematically impossible euler characteristic states that for any convex polyhedron number of faces plus number of vertices corners equals number of edges plus two a result of this formula is that any closed polyhedron of hexagons has to include exactly 12 pentagons like a soccer ball buckminster fuller geodesic dome or fullerene molecule this can be visualised by noting that a mesh of hexagons is flat like a sheet of chicken wire but each pentagon that is added forces mesh to bend there are fewer corners so mesh is pulled in tessellations tessellations are patterns formed by repeating tiles all over a flat surface there are 17 wallpaper groups of tilings while common in art and design exactly repeating tilings are less easy to find in living things cells in paper nests of social wasps and wax cells in honeycomb built by honey bees are well known examples among animals bony fish reptiles or pangolin or fruits like salak are protected by overlapping scales or osteoderms these form more or less exactly repeating units though often scales in fact vary continuously in size among flowers snake s head fritillary fritillaria meleagris have a tessellated pattern on their petals structures of minerals provide good examples of regularly repeating three dimensional arrays despite hundreds of thousands of known minerals there are rather few possible types of arrangement of atoms in a crystal defined by crystal structure crystal system and point group for example there are exactly 14 bravais lattices for 7 lattice systems in three dimensional space hook j r hall h e solid state physics 2nd edition manchester physics series john wiley sons 2010 cracks cracks are linear openings that form in materials to relieve stress when an elastic material stretches or shrinks uniformly it eventually reaches its breaking strength and then fails suddenly in all directions creating cracks with 120 degree joints so three cracks meet at a node conversely when an inelastic material fails straight cracks form to relieve stress further stress in same direction would then simply open existing cracks stress at right angles can create new cracks at 90 degrees to old ones thus pattern of cracks indicates whether material is elastic or not in a tough fibrous material like oak tree bark cracks form to relieve stress as usual but they do not grow long as their growth is interrupted by bundles of strong elastic fibres since each species of tree has its own structure at levels of cell and of molecules each has its own pattern of splitting in its bark spots stripes leopards and ladybirds are spotted and zebras are striped these patterns have an evolutionary explanation they have functions which increase chances that offspring of patterned animal will survive to reproduce one function of animal patterns is camouflage for instance a leopard that is harder to see catches more prey another function is signalling for instance a ladybird is less likely to be attacked by predatory birds that hunt by sight if it has bold warning colours and is also bitter or poisonous or mimics other distasteful insects a young bird may see a warning patterned insect like a ladybird and try to eat it but it will only do this once very soon it will spit out bitter insect other ladybirds in area will remain undisturbed young leopards and ladybirds inheriting genes that somehow create survive but while these evolutionary and functional arguments explain why these animals need their patterns they do not explain how patterns are formed pattern formation alan turing and later mathematical biologist james murray described a mechanism that spontaneously creates spotted or striped patterns a reaction diffusion system cells of a young organism have genes that can be switched on by a chemical signal a morphogen resulting in growth of a certain type of structure say a darkly pigmented patch of skin if morphogen is present everywhere result is an even pigmentation as in a black leopard but if it is unevenly distributed spots or stripes can result turing suggested that there could be feedback control of production of morphogen itself this could cause continuous fluctuations in amount of morphogen as it diffused around body a second mechanism is needed to create standing wave patterns to result in spots or stripes an inhibitor chemical that switches off production of morphogen and that itself diffuses through body more quickly than morphogen resulting in an activator inhibitor scheme belousov zhabotinsky reaction is a non biological example of this kind of scheme a chemical oscillator later research has managed to create convincing models of patterns as diverse as zebra stripes giraffe blotches jaguar spots medium dark patches surrounded by dark broken rings and ladybird shell patterns different geometrical layouts of spots and stripes see illustrations richard prum s activation inhibition models developed from turing s work use six variables to account for observed range of nine basic within feather pigmentation patterns from simplest a central pigment patch via concentric patches bars chevrons eye spot pair of central spots rows of paired spots and an array of dots more elaborate models simulate complex feather patterns in guineafowl meleagris in which individual feathers feature transitions from bars at base to an array of dots at far distal end these require an oscillation created by two inhibiting signals with interactions in both space and time patterns can form for other reasons in vegetated landscape of tiger bush and fir waves tiger bush stripes occur on arid slopes where plant growth is limited by rainfall each roughly horizontal stripe of vegetation effectively collects rainwater from bare zone immediately above it fir waves occur in forests on mountain slopes after wind disturbance during regeneration when trees fall trees that they had sheltered become exposed and are in turn more likely to be damaged so gaps tend to expand downwind meanwhile on windward side young trees grow protected by wind shadow of remaining tall trees natural patterns are sometimes formed by animals as in mima mounds of northwestern united states and some other areas which appear to be created over many years by burrowing activities of pocket gophers while so called fairy circles of namibia appear to be created by interaction of competing groups of sand termites along with competition for water among desert plants in permafrost soils with an active upper layer subject to annual freeze and thaw patterned ground can form creating circles nets ice wedge polygons steps and stripes thermal contraction causes shrinkage cracks to form in a thaw water fills cracks expanding to form ice when next frozen and widening cracks into wedges these cracks may join up to form polygons and other shapes fissured pattern that develops on vertebrate brains are caused by a physical process of constrained expansion dependent on two geometric parameters relative tangential cortical expansion and relative thickness of cortex similar patterns of gyri peaks and sulci troughs have been demonstrated in models of brain starting from smooth layered gels with patterns caused by compressive mechanical forces resulting from expansion of outer layer representing cortex after addition of a solvent numerical models in computer simulations support natural and experimental observations that surface
