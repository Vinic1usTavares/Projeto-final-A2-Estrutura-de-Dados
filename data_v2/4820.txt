exeter was one of three british cruisers that fought german pocket battleship later that year in battle of river plate she was severely damaged during battle and she was in shipyard for over a year after her repairs were completed ship spent most of 1941 on convoy escort duties before she was transferred to far east after start of pacific war in december exeter was generally assigned to escorting convoys to and from singapore during malayan campaign and she continued on those duties in early february 1942 as japanese prepared to invade dutch east indies later that month she was assigned to striking force of joint american british dutch australian command abdacom and she took on a more active role in defence of dutch east indies culmination of this was her engagement in battle of java sea later in month as allies attempted to intercept several imperial japanese navy invasion convoys exeter was crippled early in battle and she did not play much of a role as she withdrew two days later she attempted to escape approaching japanese forces but she was intercepted and sunk by japanese ships at beginning of march in second battle of java sea most of her crewmen survived sinking and were rescued by japanese about a quarter of them died during japanese captivity her wreck was discovered in early 2007 and it was declared a war grave but by 2016 her remains had

arrived on 12 december and then admiral graf spee spotted exeter during following morning stephen pp 16 18 captain hans langsdorff decided to engage british and closed at full speed british doctrine on how to engage ships like admiral graf spee had been developed by harwood in 1936 and specified that british force act as two divisions following this procedure exeter operated as a division on her own while achilles and ajax formed other splitting fire of german ship they were only partially successful as german ship concentrated her main armament of six guns on exeter and her secondary armament of eight guns on light cruisers langsdorff opened fire on exeter at 06 18 with high explosive shells and she returned fire two minutes later at a range of german ship straddled british cruiser with her third salvo shrapnel from near misses killed crew of starboard torpedo tubes started fires amidships and damaged both supermarine walrus seaplanes after eight salvos from exeter admiral graf spee scored a direct hit on b turret that knocked it out of action and shrapnel from hit killed all of bridge personnel except three bell wounded in face transferred to aft conning position to continue battle his ship was hit twice more shortly afterwards but her powerplant was not damaged and she remained seaworthy although her aircraft had to be jettisoned stephen pp 18 19 at 06 30 langsdorff switched his fire to light cruisers but only inflicted shrapnel damage on them before some of exeters torpedoes forced him to turn away at 06 37 to evade them her second torpedo attack at 06 43 was also unsuccessful in meanwhile langsdorff had switched his main guns back to heavy cruiser and scored several more hits they knocked out a turret started a fire amidships that damaged ship s fire control and navigation circuits and caused a seven degree list with flooding after y turret had temporarily been disabled bell said i m going to ram it will be end of us but it will sink him too turret was repaired and she remained in action until flooding disabled machinery for y turret at 07 30 at 11 07 bell informed harwood that exeter had a single eight inch and a four
