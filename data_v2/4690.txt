robert frederick christy may 14 1916 october 3 2012 was a canadian american theoretical physicist and later astrophysicist who was one of last surviving people to have worked on manhattan project during world war ii he briefly served as acting president of california institute of technology caltech a graduate of university of british columbia ubc in 1930s where he studied physics he followed george volkoff who was a year ahead of him to university of california berkeley where he was accepted as a graduate student by robert oppenheimer leading theoretical physicist in united states at that time christy received his doctorate in 1941 and joined physics department of illinois institute of technology in 1942 he joined manhattan project at university of chicago where he was recruited by enrico fermi to join effort to build first nuclear reactor having been recommended as a theory resource by oppenheimer when oppenheimer formed manhattan project s los alamos laboratory in 1943 christy was one of early recruits to join theory group christy is generally credited with insight that a solid sub critical mass of plutonium could be explosively compressed into supercriticality a great simplification of earlier concepts of implosion requiring hollow shells for this insight solid core plutonium model is often referred to as christy pit after war christy briefly joined university of chicago physics department before being recruited to join caltech faculty in 1946 when oppenheimer decided it was not practical for him to resume his academic activities he stayed at caltech for his academic career serving as department chair provost and acting president in 1960 christy turned his attention to astrophysics creating some of first practical computation models of stellar operation for this work christy was awarded eddington medal of royal astronomical society in 1967 in 1980s and 1990s christy participated in national research council s committee on dosimetry an extended effort to better understand actual radiation exposure due to bombs dropped on japan and on basis of that learning better understand medical risks of radiation exposure early life robert frederick cohen was born in may 14 1916 in vancouver british columbia son of moise jacques cohen an electrical engineer and his wife hattie alberta nee mackay a school teacher he was named robert after his maternal great uncle robert wood and frederick after frederick alexander christy second husband of his maternal grandmother he had an older brother john who was born in 1913 moise changed family surname to christy by deed poll on august 31 1918 on november 4 moise was accidentally electrocuted at work hattie died after goitre surgery in 1926 christy and his brother were then cared for by robert wood their grandmother alberta mackay and their great aunt maud mackay christy was educated at magee high school and graduated in 1932 with highest examination score in province of british columbia he was awarded governor general s academic medal and importantly in view of his family s limited ability to pay free tuition to attend university of british columbia ubc at award dinner he met second place winner dagmar elizabeth von lieven whom he dated while at ubc he received his bachelor of arts ba degree in mathematics and physics with first class honors in 1935 and his master of arts ma degree in 1937 writing a thesis on electron attachment and negative ion formation in oxygen george volkoff a friend of christy who was a year ahead of him at ubc was accepted as a graduate student at university of california berkeley by robert oppenheimer who led most active school of theoretical physics in united states at that time this inspired christy to apply to university of california as well he was accepted and was awarded a fellowship for his first year at berkeley he shared an apartment with volkoff robert cornog ken mckenzie and mckenzie s wife lynn mckenzie for his thesis oppenheimer had him look at mesotrons subatomic particles called muons today that then recently been found in cosmic rays they were so called because they were larger than electrons but smaller than protons with help of shuichi kusaka he performed detailed calculations of particle s spin he published two papers on mesotrons with kusaka in physical review which formed basis of his 1941 doctor of philosophy phd thesis manhattan project thumb robert christy s wartime los alamos security badge christy could have graduated in 1940 but could not then be a teaching assistant and this would have left him jobless and without income in 1941 oppenheimer found him a post at physics department at illinois institute of technology iit in may 1941 he married dagmar von lieven they had two sons thomas edward ted born in 1944 and peter robert born in 1946 iit paid christy 200 per month to teach 27 hours per week for 11 months per annum to keep abreast of developments in physics he attended seminars at university of chicago this brought him to attention of eugene wigner who hired him for same money that iit was paying him as a full time research assistant commencing in january 1942 thumb right a model of a christy pit enrico fermi and his team from columbia university arrived at university of chicago in january 1942 as part of an effort to concentrate manhattan project s reactor work at new metallurgical laboratory fermi arranged with wigner for christy to join his group which was building a nuclear reactor which fermi called a pile in squash court under stagg field at university of chicago construction began on november 6 1942 and christy was present when chicago pile 1 went critical on december 2 in early 1943 christy joined oppenheimer s los alamos laboratory in new mexico where he became an american citizen in 1943 or 1944 hans bethe head of t theoretical division detailed his physicists to assist with projects at laboratory with his knowledge of reactors christy s assignment was to help donald w kerst s water boiler group water boiler was an aqueous homogeneous reactor intended as a laboratory instrument to test critical mass calculations and effect of various tamper materials it was first reactor to use enriched uranium as a fuel and first to use liquid fuel in form of soluble uranium sulfate dissolved in water christy estimated that it would require of pure uranium 235 a figure he subsequently revised to when reactor went critical on may 9 1944 with accuracy of christy s figures raised laboratory s confidence in t division s calculations discovery by emilio segre s group in april and may 1944 of high levels of plutonium 240 in reactor produced plutonium meant that an implosion type nuclear weapon was required but studies indicated that this would be extremely difficult to achieve by august 1944 calculations had been made of how an ideal spherical implosion would work problem was how to make it work in real world where jets and spalling were a problem christy worked in rudolf peierls s t 1 group which studied theory of implosion he suggested possibility of using a solid plutonium core that would form a critical mass when compressed this was an ultra conservative design that solved problem of jets by brute force it became known as christy pit or christy gadget gadget being laboratory euphemism for a bomb however solid pit was intrinsically less efficient than a hollow pit and it required a modulated neutron initiator to start chain reaction christy worked with klaus fuchs paul stein and hans bethe to develop a suitable initiator design which became known as an urchin gadget used in trinity nuclear test and fat man used in atomic bombing of nagasaki used christy pits later in life christy agreed to give a number of both oral history and video interviews in which he discussed his role in manhattan project and latter interests later life thumb left an artist s conception of project orion spacecraft after war ended christy accepted an assistant professorship at university of chicago at a salary of 5 000 per annum twice what he had been making before war he moved back to chicago in february 1946 but suitable housing was hard to find in immediate post war period and christy and his family shared a mansion with edward teller and his family before war oppenheimer had spent part of each year teaching at california institute of technology caltech christy was one of oppenheimer s berkeley students who made trip down to pasadena california each year to continue studying with oppenheimer after war oppenheimer decided that with his additional responsibilities he could no longer continue this arrangement head of w k kellogg radiation laboratory at caltech charles lauritsen therefore asked oppenheimer for name of a theoretical physicist that he would recommend as a replacement oppenheimer recommended christy willy fowler then approached christy with an offer of a full time position at caltech at 5 400 per annum and christy accepted he remained at caltech for rest of his academic career drawback to working at caltech was that neither lauritsen nor fowler was a theoretical physicist so a heavy workload fell on christy this was recognised by a pay raise to 10 000 per annum in 1954 christy joined oppenheimer lauritsen and robert bacher who joined faculty at caltech in 1949 in project vista a detailed 1951 study on how western europe could be defended against soviet union christy was distraught at outcome of 1954 oppenheimer security hearing when he encountered teller who had testified against oppenheimer at los alamos in 1954 christy publicly refused to shake teller s hand i viewed oppenheimer as a god he later recalled and i was sure that he was not a treasonable person asked about his relationship with teller in 2006 christy said in 1956 christy was one of a number of scientists from caltech who publicly called for a ban on atmospheric nuclear testing 1963 partial nuclear test ban treaty that christy advocated put an end to one of his most unusual projects he worked with freeman dyson on project orion design of a spacecraft propelled by atomic bombs thumb right rs puppis a cepheid variable star christy explained why they during a sabbatical year at princeton university in 1960 christy began an investigation of cepheid variables and smaller rr lyrae variables classes of luminous variable stars at time it was a mystery as to why they varied he used knowledge of hydrodynamics of implosion gained at los alamos during war to explain this phenomenon this earned him royal astronomical society s eddington medal for contributions to theoretical astrophysics in 1967 christy was appointed vice president and provost of caltech in 1970 under christy and president harold brown caltech expanded its humanities and added economics to allow or perhaps to compel undergrads were required to take 25 of their units in humanities students to broaden their education he had david appointed as vice president for financial affairs and they steered caltech through financially stringent 1970s first women were admitted as undergraduates in fall 1970 when la belle who had been hired in 1969 but refused tenure in 1974 filed suit with equal employment opportunity commission christy pressed for case to be settled and la belle to be given tenure eeoc ruled against caltech in 1977 adding that she had been paid less than male colleagues la belle received tenure in 1979 in 1970 he became romantically involved with inge juliana sackman a fellow physicist 26 years his junior he divorced dagmar in early 1971 and married juliana on august 4 1973 they had two daughters illia juliana lilly christy born in 1974 and alexandra roberta alexa christy born in 1976 christy briefly became acting president of caltech in 1977 when brown left to become secretary of defense christy returned to teaching after marvin l goldberger became president in 1978 he became institute professor of theoretical physics in 1983 and institute professor emeritus in 1986 christy died on october 3 2012 he was survived by his wife juliana their two daughters illia and
