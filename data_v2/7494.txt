to be told band s guitarist kerry king has said that these new songs from christ illusion album aren t political at all jihad eyes of insane it s what s spewing out at us from tv musical structure eyes of insane is 3 minutes 23 seconds long a slow drum pattern played by dave lombardo opens track over which hanneman and king play angular and descending scales on guitar these guitar riffs evolve from verse to verse and have been described by allmusic as intensely harrowing song gradually builds over course of verses refrain and bridge before resolving with a towering chorus some reviewers paid particular attention to araya s vocal contribution zach of prefix magazine said song allows araya to show his vocal range deepening to build up tension and creating a wonderfully chilling a half minutes while ian robinson of musicomh felt track is a distinct but welcome change of pace dave lombardo s machine gun rhythms forming backbone for tom araya s impressively intact scream music video thumb right a screenshot from music time slayer decided a music video should be filmed touring commitments prevented their involvement in actual shoot instead others were contacted to produce film director tony petrossian presented slayer with first draft and group made a few suggestions for improvement never having met him king recalled petrossian had a treatment and we all dug treatment so we just turned him loose eyes of insane s war themed music video was filmed on august 13 2006 in los angeles area casting company tolley casparis casting sought a male caucasian between ages of 18 and 26

ago now he is scarred by seeing so much fighting strong eyebrows that do not overpower face scars or large veins actually a plus video was shot as a first person narrative about horrors leading up to final moments of a soldier at war and was described as a single long and tight close up of soldier s eye with images clearly reflected within his pupil and iris and perfectly choreographed with rhythm of music reflected are disconcerting images of para trooping into enemy territory gunfire helicopters and tanks explosions poignant flashbacks of his wife and child and home and images of his death two endings were shot one in which soldier is killed as result of sustained combat wounds and another in which soldier commits suicide by hanging latter one was used jeff hanneman confirmed that band loved eye concept and personally felt that video was pretty amazing when he first viewed it king admitted film is pretty cool i thought it was neat idea very different especially for us because we usually do performance based videos video was exclusively posted on mp3 com late in october 2006 in 2007 video earned a metal hammer golden gods awards nomination for best video but eventually lost to avenged sevenfold s seize day http www blabbermouth net news bullet for my valentine booed at metal hammer golden gods awards critical reception critics were generally positive when reviewing eyes of insane stylus magazine s cosmo lee described track as a dark exploration of a soldier s psyche and remarked that it s memorable and would be a good breather between usual barnburners peter atkinson of knac com felt that eyes of insane offers a post traumatic sequel to mandatory suicide again with a soundtrack that recalls original but boasting a couple truly mammoth hooks that do shake things up don kaye of blabbermouth made a comparison to a different slayer track than atkinson and commented that eyes of insane and catatonic both have that slow grinding feeling of doom that band has done so well before on classics like dead skin mask awards song was nominated for best metal performance at 49th annual grammy awards when asked for his thoughts on nomination king revealed that he did not even care and noted that slayer fans don t give a shit and that s most important thing to me interviewer expressed his surprise at nomination given slayer s inflammatory lyrics to which king replied

columbus ohio jeff hanneman and i put a lot into eyes of insane so we re thrilled that grammy voters took time to listen to it and then vote for it we re out here on road and we re all really really happy king disagreed deeming song one of poorest representations of us slayer on record christ illusion he further said that if given decision he would have chosen controversial track jihad to
