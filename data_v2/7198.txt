stadium in university park pennsylvania they were a member of big ten conference and its leaders division penn state was ineligible to play in a bowl game for 2013 season second season of a four year ban due to ncaa sanctions imposed in wake of penn state child sex abuse scandal before season penn state had an open competition to win starting quarterback position true freshman christian hackenberg won and started all 12 games for nittany lions hackenberg headlined their recruiting class which also featured tight end adam breneman john butler was named penn state s new defensive coordinator upon departure of ted roof most predicted penn state would have a similar season to that of 2012 team which won eight games and lost four but there was uncertainty as injuries could decimate team which was already thin at many positions including offensive line and linebacker while surprise performances from key players could lift them to success penn state opened season with two non conference wins but lost to ucf knights who ultimately went on to a bcs bowl fiesta in their third game entering conference play nittany lions were 3 1 and in their first conference game they lost to indiana before defeating michigan in a quadruple overtime thriller they alternated losses and wins for remainder of season losing to ohio state minnesota and nebraska and defeating illinois purdue and wisconsin despite team never being ranked several players earned national and conference recognition headlined by wide receiver allen robinson who was named big ten conference receiver of year and earned first team all conference and all american honors before subsequently announcing he would forgo his senior season and enter 2014 nfl draft senior john urschel an offensive guard won william v campbell trophy sometimes referred to as academic heisman hackenberg was named big ten freshman of year additionally backup quarterback tyler ferguson who lost preseason quarterback competition to hackenberg announced his intent to transfer soon after season two coaches ron vanderlinden and charlie fisher left penn state for undisclosed reasons though there was speculation that o brien forced them out a few weeks later o brien accepted head coaching position with houston texans leaving nittany lions after two seasons early in 2014 nittany lions hired james franklin to replace o brien as head coach for 2014 season recruiting despite ncaa sanctions including limited scholarships and a bowl ban penn state retained their top recruit quarterback christian hackenberg they finished with 24th ranked recruiting class according to espn who cited retention of top prospects hackenberg and tight end adam breneman as well as adding depth in secondary overall giving them a b rating linebacker recruit zayd never enrolled at penn state after several instances of legal trouble entering camp hackenberg and ferguson vied for starting quarterback position ultimately hackenberg won job and ferguson served as backup preseason buildup coming off an 8 4 season during which according to usa today s paul myerberg attrition robbed penn state of everything but kitchen sink or so we heard so it was quite surprising when sink a few walk ons a mathematician a local kid and a rookie coach went 8 2 after a sluggish start pushing back against storm clouds and bringing psu back from abyss of life post ncaa sanctions many college football analysts expected nittany lions to perform similarly in 2013 although almost all season outlooks noted that team could take a major step back from 2012 if they were hampered by injuries or could surprise everyone and win more games than they did in 2012 a solid backfield anchored by zach zwinak a trio of established tight ends plus a promising newcomer and a veteran offensive line highlighted projected success offensively while a new coordinator john butler a borderline all american linebacker glenn carson and lots of potential both on defensive line and in secondary latter of which was dramatically improved highlighted projected progress defensively also a quarterback competition between christian hackenberg and tyler ferguson brewed which provided intrigue entering season for penn state to achieve success they needed to avoid injuries that would hinder their already depleted depth due to ncaa sanctions sbnation com asserted if either hackenberg or ferguson gets hurt and other one stinks if either zach zwinak or bill belton who missed four games last year gets hurt if basically any linemen get hurt and linemen often get hurt this house of

which would have been their first since 2008 as this was penn state s first night game with a particularly young team keeping emotions in check was a key as was improving third down efficiency lions were 2 for 26 on season good for dead last in football bowl subdivision fbs ucf who was 2 0 coming into game went 10 4 in 2012 and was led by their running back latavius murray who graduated as such their top offensive player was quarterback blake bortles defensively they had only allowed one scoring play all season penn state students organized a whiteout in which entire student section dons white outside linebacker mike hull returned after missing prior game against eastern michigan ucf got ball to start game at their nine yard line after a penalty on kickoff return and their junior quarterback blake bortles orchestrated an efficient drive in which he converted two third downs and was 6 7 passing for 65 yards and a 4 yard touchdown pass to storm johnson penn state took over and got two first downs latter of which as a fourth down conversion before a 44 yard pass to allen robinson immediately followed by a 6 yard touchdown run by zach zwinak to tie game penn state moved ball

penn state s special teams responded with a 44 yard kickoff return by geno lewis but their offense went three and out and though they punted ball deep into ucf territory knights marched down field with a strong running game and scored another touchdown to go up 21 7 on penn state s ensuing drive sam ficken kicked a career long 47 yard field goal ucf got some decent yardage on their next drive

lost a fumble with 5 43 remaining in game ucf went three and out and on their punt snap went over punter s head and penn state got ball at ucf 25 penn state took advantage scoring on a 5 yard touchdown pass to allen robinson with 57 seconds left penn state needed to regain possession of ball after score and failed to do so so ultimately ucf held on to win by three penn state s defense had excelled in their first two games but regressed significantly against central florida particularly with poor tackling which some attributed to their practice strategy of thud tackling in which one does not actually take a player to ground instead making a thud to stop a player several media outlets speculated that lions used this due to their lack of scholarship players in wake of sanctions imposed due to penn state child sex abuse scandal defensive coordinator john butler renounced that assertion commenting he employed thud when he coached at south carolina penn state s linebackers were also criticized glenn carson and nyeem wartman received criticism for not being as strong as 2012 team s michael and gerald hodges in addition 2012 big ten freshman of year defensive end deion barnes barely wreaked any havoc and daquan jones whose strong play had previously compensated for barnes weak play was held to just five tackles offense however was considered a bright spot they gained 455 total yards though receiver allen robinson commented that a fast start would have helped them gain more early momentum we are in big ten playing against some great offenses and people are going to put

victory of season on field several keys for improvement were identified within media including finding a secondary receiver to allen robinson strengthening secondary and continuing improvement on third downs also penn state s tight end tandem which struggled during non conference play needed to improve particularly as penn state had a young quarterback in christian hackenberg who would face tougher defenses in conference play october 5 vs indiana in their second game away from beaver stadium of season nittany lions traveled to bloomington indiana for their game against indiana hoosiers their first conference opponent this was teams 17th meeting with penn state owning a 16 0 record coming into game indiana featured big ten s best passing offense in 2012 led by quarterback chase

developmental game for freshman quarterback christian hackenberg there was no conclusive advantage on special teams penn state got ball to start game and drove down field with relative ease facing

team ran one more drive before indiana attained first downs on three consecutive plays ultimately culminating their possession with a five yard touchdown pass from quarterback nate to isaiah roundtree making score 7 0 at end of first quarter penn state responded on their second drive of second quarter via a 46 yard pass from hackenberg to robinson to tie game later mitch ewald kicked a short field goal to re take lead penn state had a chance to tie game again when kicker sam ficken attempted a 42 yard field goal but indiana blocked kick and with their ensuing momentum drove down field at end of half ultimately ending with ewald hitting a field goal as time expired after halftime indiana ran a quick drive on which they punted before penn state ran a 13 play 80 yard drive that concluded with

hackenberg threw a fade pattern to robinson in corner of end zone which robinson corralled but he landed on his back out of bounds and came up either with wind knocked out or some sort of back injury

drive and tried to convert fourth down deep in their own territory but failed setting michigan up with excellent field position penn state s defense however responded with glenn carson sacking gardner to put michigan out of field goal range forcing a punt that michigan downed around five yard line on michigan s next drive their kicker brendan gibbons made a 47 yard field goal after penn state again punted michigan embarked on a drive that included a third and long conversion but ultimately ended when gardner threw an interception to penn state defensive end anthony zettel who started over deion

penalty to back up michigan to face a third and long on that play olaniyan recorded his third sack of day and michigan punted on penn state s ensuing drive they turned ball over again this time via a hackenberg interception michigan capitalized by kicking a field goal when penn state got ball back they ran a sustained balanced drive 4 run plays 5 pass plays 50 yards down field during which they went to bill belton in running game as zwinak had fumbled previously in half that culminated with sam ficken kicking a 45 yard field goal to go up by 4 points michigan promptly drove right back down

that ohio state had not yet lost under urban meyer and intangibles citing sold out crowd in prime time keys to game for penn state were to contain miller not get beaten over top in coverage and

game ferguson was no more effective as penn state ultimately punted ohio state scored once more in third quarter and they led 56 7 headed into fourth quarter after another touchdown for ohio state ferguson threw a touchdown pass to allen robinson in which robinson caught screen pass behind line of scrimmage runs around weaving thru traffic from one sideline to other and finishes in end zone for

victorious 24 17 in a victory that coach bill o brien refused to describe as either ugly or fortunate despite a variety of media sources doing so one article from lancaster newspapers described game by saying offensively penn state totaled 25 first downs two fewer than illinois but 490 total offensive yards exceeding illinois by 79 allen robinson caught 11 passes and was only penn state receiver with more than three catches shuffled offensive line on which donovan smith did not start yes allowed a sack and yes committed a few penalties but generally opened up gaping holes in run game gave

minnesota would win a relatively close game minnesota s offense was one of better rushing teams in conference 20th in nation but penn state s defense was also pretty good against run making it a good matchup freshman quarterback christian hackenberg in tandem with a running game that in theory was led by bill belton and supplemented by zach zwinak and receivers allen robinson had potential to

moments of third quarter penn state relied on zwinak who rushed several consecutive times to garner penn state breathing room there was no scoring in third quarter penn state failed to convert a third down they had still not converted any in game but minnesota committed a roughing kicker penalty giving penn state a second chance with which they converted their first third down of game but ultimately turned ball over on downs after a minnesota punt penn state for first drive of game relied on their passing game to drive down field but when faced with a fourth down and ten deep in minnesota territory failed to convert on minnesota s ensuing possession however they managed to run only 47 seconds off clock and went three and out hoping not to again blow an opportunity penn state moved promptly down field and got into red zone while there a pass to allen robinson resulted in a pass interference penalty called against minnesota giving penn state ball at two yard line from where

having lost 38 14 prior week against iowa and 56 0 week before that against ohio state and entering game with a 1 8 record lions would have to do so with even less depth than normal at his mid week press conference bill o brien announced at midweek press conference that ben kline would miss remainder of season with a shoulder injury for which he sustained surgery there was also some pregame concentration surrounding receiving corps allen robinson was listed on injury report with a shoulder injury and geno lewis who had proved to be a potential big play threat early in season when he caught a 54 yard touchdown pass against syracuse but had recently been relegated to special teams was also expected to receive increased playing time in penn state s second to last home game of season penn state received opening kickoff and on their first play from scrimmage featured six offensive linemen albeit unsuccessfully as bill belton rushed for a one yard loss before driving down field on a 13 play 75 yard drive that culminated with belton rushing for a five yard touchdown he carried load on drive rushing ball eight times for 36 yards penn state would never relinquish that lead purdue subsequently went three and out and penn state responded with another long drive 10 plays 66 yards that again culminated with a rushing touchdown this time from zach zwinak on a one yard run his tenth touchdown of season becoming 16th penn state player to eclipse 10 and first since 2008 when both evan royster and daryll clark did purdue s ensuing drive ended in second quarter when quarterback danny

yarder from sam ficken putting nittany lions ahead 31 21 boilermakers turned ball over again on their next drive and penn state capitalized when zwinak rushed for his third touchdown of game purdue turned ball over on downs their final drive of third quarter though hackenberg threw an interception giving purdue an opportunity early in fourth quarter again a fumble eliminated any chance of a scoring drive coming to fruition and penn state went up 45 21 when hackenberg rushed for a 4 yard touchdown to culminate an 11 play 74 yard drive that encapsulated over a third of fourth quarter and ended with 4 27 to play that would be final scoring drive of game which penn state won by aforementioned score 45 21 in a game in which penn state dominated line of scrimmage nittany lions rushed for 289 yards behind an offensive line that opened up significant holes allowing penn state to achieve their goal of rushing football despite not achieving offensive tackle garry gilliam s goal of 400 yards purdue s coach darrell hazell had opined earlier in week that penn state s offensive line was not as good as previous opponents wisconsin and iowa and penn state used it as motivation dominating line of scrimmage which numerous offensive lineman noted was fun starting center ty howle who noted it s fun knowing you can go out there and impose your will each play it s a lot of fun and all conference guard john urschel who agreed saying this was a real fun game for us with respect to coming off ball and just hitting guys offensive linemen really enjoyed it we were having a blast when

intercepted a pass garnering a comment from patriot news that he is top playmaker in secondary despite jubilation from victory including one penn state player who quipped that sixth win made penn

on senior day at penn state final home game of season 6 4 lions were set to host 7 3 nebraska cornhuskers however despite huskers having better record opening line gave penn state a two point advantage earlier in week it was announced that in addition to 14 seniors penn state would honor defensive tackle kyle baublitz offensive tackle garry gilliam and wide receiver alex kenney on field prior to game none of three planned to return for 2014 season despite each having an additional year of eligibility offensively for penn state biletnikoff award semifinalist wide receiver allen robinson entered game by far penn state s biggest threat in passing game with three times more receptions 81 entering game than penn state s second receiver brandon felder 27 perhaps biggest opportunity for penn state s offense to achieve success against nebraska s defense however was through running game either on coattails of bill belton or zach zwinak nebraska s run defense had frequently been gouged against big ten offenses similarly nebraska s offense would have an opportunity to continue to achieve success through its running game led by ameer abdullah who entered game averaging 6 5 yards per carry he had picked up slack in absence of their prior starter at quarterback taylor martinez sidelined due to injury penn state coach bill o brien predicted that whichever team committed fewer turnovers would win as both teams had previously experienced problems with turnovers both entering game with negative turnover margins both teams entered game with freshmen quarterbacks in christian hackenberg for penn state and tommy armstrong for nebraska but both teams primary playmakers came from outside quarterback position with robinson for penn state and abdullah for nebraska according to york daily record writer frank bodani penn state s offense was more consistent than nebraska s who committed too many turnovers giving penn state edge defensively penn state was hit or miss in their secondary as well as in stopping run so nebraska who was also inconsistent held a slight edge with their playmakers randy gregory and evans nebraska also held an edge on special teams due to consistency and depth but penn state had superior coaching as well as intangibles with a roaring crowd on senior day with two hit or miss squads most writers thought this would be a relatively close game though a plurality leaned towards nebraska edging out a victory however some thought that penn state s seniors would come out with a vengeance never having defeated nebraska since they joined big ten and resilient group would use that motivation to eke out a victory in their final game at beaver stadium shortly before game penn state announced tailback bill belton would not play due to illness leaving zach zwinak to carry load in running game in snow nebraska received opening kickoff and promptly went three and out forcing a punt which though penn state returner jesse della valle fumbled but lions recovered setting up penn state at their own 23 yard line but they too went three and out nebraska s second drive however got off to a much better start as ameer abdullah rushed for a 25 yard gain on drive s first play but ultimately penn state s defense held on a later third down and short play forcing another punt penn state s subsequent drive showed promise with zwinak rushing for a few first downs on one of which nebraska star defensive back evans was injured he returned a few drives later however they eventually punted and for second time alex butterworth pinned them inside 20 and nebraska failed to execute punting for third time on punt return della valle redeemed himself with a 25 yard return into nebraska territory penn state took advantage of field position and in waning seconds of first quarter hackenberg threw a two yard touchdown to adam breneman after zwinak rushed ball six times for a total of 27 yards sam ficken missed extra point his first extra point miss of season penn state led at end of first quarter 6 0 on nebraska s next drive they entered with senior ron kellogg iii at quarterback after armstrong s ineffectiveness kellogg iii came in firing on all cylinders completing his first three passes before abdullah ran for a first down and then kellogg iii completed another pass this time for a touchdown on a 27 yard pass to quincy nebraska made extra point taking a one point lead penn state s next drive stalled and again butterworth was able to pin nebraska inside 20 on ensuing punt nebraska subsequently went three and out setting penn state up with solid field position at their own 37 yard line they got one first down and were positioned for another but felder dropped a pass and penn state s ensuing punt was blocked after butterworth dropped low snap setting up nebraska in penn state territory nebraska recorded game s first third down conversion en route to getting ball in red zone on a snap to abdullah from wildcat formation he ran up middle but fumbled into end zone and della valle recovered in end zone setting penn state up with some momentum at their 20 yard line however they were unable to capitalize going three and out nebraska s ensuing drive stalled and they punted penn state came out trying to score before half and they did achieve a few first downs but ultimately punted and nebraska downed ball to go into half time leading by one coming out of half snow showers returned and penn state got ball to start half and they did convert a third down for first time of game however again their drive stalled and butterworth punted ball for sixth time nebraska faced a third and long on their next drive and on play c j olaniyan sacked quarterback and forced and recovered a fumble setting penn state up inside nebraska 10 yard line two plays later with snow increasing in intensity hackenberg ran a play action bootleg and rolled right running for a 7 yard touchdown putting penn state up 13 7 as this time ficken made extra point lead did not last long kenny bell returned ensuing kickoff for a 99 yard touchdown second consecutive week penn state surrendered a return touchdown back where they started at beginning of half in terms of scoring differential penn state got ball inside their own 20 after geno lewis fumbled kickoff return he recovered penn state achieved a first down on drive but a false start penalty set up a third and long situation from which they could not recover they punted nebraska also punted on their next drive and punt was downed at one yard line they did not remain in shadow of their own goal post for long as zwinak rushed for four yards and then on a play action pass hackenberg threw a 43 yard pass to allen robinson two plays later however evans intercepted hackenberg s pass giving nebraska good field position at their own 48 they capitalized kicking a field goal going up by four huskers led 17 13 at end of third quarter on first play of fourth quarter jesse james caught a pass in flat on a third and three and ran down sideline for a 46 yard touchdown putting penn state up 20 17 penn state quickly got ball back and looked to milk clock with zwinak running football however two incomplete passes decimated drive and they punted it back to nebraska after exchanging punts nebraska embarked on a drive that had a 62 yard run by abdullah called back due to a personal foul penalty called foul occurred deep into run so nebraska still got ball at penn state s 27 yard line subsequently they moved ball into red zone and got it down to one yard line before a false start backed them up to six yard line one play later they called timeout and on next play kellogg iii scrambled and got to one yard line before he and mike hull collided jarring ball loose but ruling was that nebraska maintained possession and smith made a 19 yard field goal to tie game at 20 when penn state received subsequent kickoff they ran ball several times and ultimately punted ball away with 1 40 remaining from their 38 yard line it was downed at five yard line setting up nebraska with two of their three timeouts and 1 31 remaining nebraska was backed up inside their one on third and long and threw a long pass that fell incomplete however jordan lucas was flagged for pass interference next series however was decimated by penalties and ultimately nebraska punted ball away and game went into overtime penn state s third ot game of season they won first two in overtime penn state got ball first and after failing to achieve a first down lined up to attempt a field goal but typically reliable ficken missed another kick and nebraska conservatively positioned themselves for a field goal try on their ensuing possession they lined up for a 37 yard field goal but committed a false start penalty backing them up five yards it did not matter however as smith hit a 42 yard field goal to win game 23 20 nebraska dominated penn state on special teams and ultimately that advantage led to their victory if it were not for sam ficken missing an extra point in first quarter nebraska would not have

week and had a punt blocked bill o brien commented we ll continue to work hard in special teams they re good kids working hard offensively penn state s was plagued by dropped passes that hindered christian hackenberg s overall performance while running game though led by zach zwinak who rushed for 149 yards was one dimensional as backup akeel lynch could muster only nine yards on five carries

bcs bowl opportunity in coach gary andersen s first season with badgers who entered game with a 9 2 record and were 24 point favorites to win game badgers entered game still employing their quintessential offensive philosophy even under their new coach a power running game behind a physical offensive line led by two of top rushers in country melvin gordon and james white both of whom were on preseason watchlist for doak walker award given to nation s best running back and former of whom was named one of ten semifinalists for award in mid november white a tough runner in middle of field had emerged in recent weeks whereas gordon a speedster led team in rushing and led country with an 8 2 yards per carry average wisconsin s offense also featured a strong passing game highlighted by quarterback joel stave and favorite target jared however one game preview asserted that penn state s defense matched up well against badgers offense defensively wisconsin entered game fifth best scoring defense in country allowing just 13 4 points per game stingy defense preview noted would likely prove problematic for penn state thumbnail right camp randall stadium venue at which penn state s final game of season was played penn state received opening kickoff and after achieving a first down christian hackenberg threw a 68 yard pass to fellow freshman adam breneman for a touchdown first offensive touchdown wisconsin had allowed in previous eight quarters wisconsin failed to respond going three and out and punting on their subsequent drive penn state though they began with poor field position converted a few third downs gained 52 yards on a bubble screen to allen robinson and ultimately was faced with a fourth down and inches in red zone but committed a false start penalty bringing on field goal unit field goal was blocked continuing penn state s special teams woes however their defense remained stout forcing another punt however on lions ensuing drive hackenberg threw his first incomplete pass of day forcing a punt in waning minutes of first quarter badgers embarked on a drive in which they scored several first downs from both running game and passing game at end of quarter they trailed 7 0 but were threatening and a few minutes later tied game via a 4 yard pass from joel stave to tight end brian wozniak later in quarter wisconsin converted a third down and 16 situation and ultimately scored a touchdown on a pass from stave to jeff duckworth on their next drive penn state was set up in red zone after a pass interference call in end zone that broadcaster ed cunningham criticized and a few plays later scored a touchdown via a 3 yard pass to geno lewis lewis was uncovered on goal line play and though wisconsin coach gary andersen ran down sideline signalling for a timeout it was not granted and play stood at half score was tied at 14 after wisconsin s opening drive stalled nittany lions embarked on a demoralizing drive that fostered widespread defensive confusion from wisconsin and ultimately ended when jesse james caught a 7 yard touchdown pass from hackenberg to put penn state on top 21 14 on ensuing wisconsin drive penn state freshman linebacker sacked stave and forced a fumble that defensive end c j olaniyan returned deep into wisconsin territory penn state earned points with ficken redeeming himself on a 28 yard field goal to put penn state up by 10 points on next two drives each team went three and out at end of third quarter wisconsin was near midfield during a drive in which they looked to pull within a field goal at end of quarter penn state led 24 14 on one of first plays of fourth quarter trevor williams intercepted stave s pass ending a scoring threat and furthering nittany lions momentum penn state started their drive at their own 28 yard line and had a third down and short but a false start backed them up to a third and long hackenberg was unfazed however as he threw a 59 yard touchdown pass to geno lewis putting penn state up by three possessions 31 14 down three scores wisconsin desperately needed a touchdown and tried to convert a fourth down and 23 but penn state recorded a sack and subsequently got ball with 9 49 to play they failed to execute and about a minute later punted ball away wisconsin drove down field and pulled within 10 31 21 on a wozniak reception his second touchdown catch of day penn state got ball off an onside kick with good field position and faced a third down and three but donovan smith committed his fourth false start of day and penn state had to throw ball and pass was incomplete penn state s subsequent punt was blocked on ensuing drive jack russell kicked a career long 48 yard field goal to pull wisconsin within seven points penn state started their drive after wisconsin kicked it deep inside their own 20 yard line penn state got some decent yardage on first down but committed another false start backing them up zwinak came through for lions however rushing on third and nine for 61 yards his longest run of season from there penn state s drive stalled and with 35 seconds left ficken attempted a 31 yard field goal but missed and wisconsin consequently needed to drive length of field to score a touchdown and they did get into penn state territory but ultimately with nine seconds left stave threw ball into end zone and penn state safety ryan keiser came away with interception for a touchback christian hackenberg took a knee to end game and nittany lions concluded their upset winning 31 24 20 year big ten conference veteran bill lemonnier was

to somewhere he would have an opportunity to start rather than be christian hackenberg s backup for remainder of his career later it was announced that though he originally intended to transfer to western kentucky wku at which bobby petrino was head coach when petrino accepted head coaching position at louisville ferguson changed his plans and transferred there in early december it was reported that quarterbacks coach charlie fisher and linebackers coach ron vanderlinden latter of whom was a holdover from joe paterno era departed with speculation that they were forced out by bill o brien departure of bill o brien thumbnail right o brien in april 2012 alt a man in a white shirt penn state coach bill o brien sits in front of a blue background with words penn state partly visible he is addressing media in front of a microphone emblazoned with penn state logo several weeks after departure of those assistants reports began to surface that o brien had interviewed for houston texans head coaching position to replace gary kubiak who was fired late in season subsequently two sides were reported to be negotiating a contract and on january 3 2014 texans held a press conference announcing o brien as their new head coach assistant head coach and wide receivers coach stan hixon safeties coach anthony midget defensive coordinator john butler running backs coach charles london and strength coach craig fitzgerald submitted resignations on january 6 and most were expected to follow o brien to nfl leaving only offensive line coach mac mcwhorter who was 63 years old and came out of retirement to coach at penn state defensive line coach larry johnson a long time member of staff and tight ends coach john strollo as assistant coaches on staff and thus making penn state more attractive of a coaching position to a new coach as he could bring in his own staff thumbnail defensive line coach and interim coach larry johnson was a candidate for head coaching position but ultimately was not hired early candidates for job included former rutgers and tampa bay buccaneers head coach greg schiano penn state alumni al golden who was coach of miami and mike munchak who was coach of tennessee titans prior to his dismissal and pennsylvania native james franklin vanderbilt s head coach as well as larry johnson penn state s defensive line coach in ensuing days espn reported that search committee led by athletic director david joyner targeted munchak franklin and golden as its top three candidates but that johnson remained in mix on sunday january 5 2014 golden took himself out of contention for position while munchak appeared to be an emerging strong candidate over next few days however franklin emerged as top candidate and on january 11 he was officially named and introduced as penn state s head coach upon his hiring questions began to surface about whether he would retain johnson or bring back vanderlinden latter of whom was maryland s head coach when franklin was on its staff in 2000 to staff unlike when o brien was hired and announced that he would retain pair at his introductory press conference franklin simply noted that he would meet with pair but commented that he is fiercely loyal to his assistants from vanderbilt and intended to bring many with him to penn state ultimately neither johnson nor vanderlinden were on franklin s staff for 2014 season with former accepting a position with rival ohio state intermittently penn state named johnson lone remaining holdover from joe paterno era interim head coach in an effort to stabilize program to prevent recruit defection as well as prevent current players namely quarterback hackenberg whose father commented that he was undecided on whether or not to return from transferring a few weeks later however it appeared hackenberg would return as ferguson followed through on his plans to transfer and franklin lauded hackenberg in his introductory press conference after announcement of o brien s departure star wide receiver allen robinson a junior declared that he would forgo his senior season and enter 2014 nfl draft according to projections from a cbssports com mock draft robinson
