thumb right 250px hoodeners in deal kent in 1909 hoodening also spelled hodening and oodening is a folk custom found in kent a county in south eastern england tradition entails use of a wooden hobby horse known as a hooden horse that is mounted on a pole and carried by an individual hidden under a sackcloth originally tradition was restricted to area of east kent although in twentieth century it spread into neighbouring west kent it represents a regional variation of a hooded animal tradition that appears in various forms throughout british isles as recorded from eighteenth to early twentieth centuries hoodening was a tradition performed at christmas time by groups of farm labourers they would form into teams to accompany hooden horse on its travels around local area and although makeup of such groups varied they typically included an individual to carry horse a leader a man in female clothing known as a mollie and several musicians team would then carry hooden horse to local houses and shops where they would expect payment for their appearance although this practice is extinct in present hooden horse is incorporated into various kentish mummers plays and morris dances that take place at different times of year origins of hoodening tradition and original derivation of term hooden remain subject to academic debate an early suggestion was that hooden was related to anglo saxon pre christian god woden and that tradition therefore originated with pre christian religious practices in early medieval kingdom of kent this idea has not found support from historians or folklorists studying tradition a more widely accepted explanation among scholars is that term hooden relates to hooded a reference to sackcloth worn by individual carrying horse absence of late medieval references to such practices and geographic dispersal of various british hooded animal traditions among them mari lwyd of south wales broad of cotswolds and old ball old tup and old horse of northern england have led to suggestions that they derive from regionalised popularisation of sixteenth and seventeenth century fashion for hobby horses among social elite earliest textual reference to hoodening tradition comes from first half of eighteenth century scattered references to it appeared over next century and a half many of which considered it to be a declining tradition that had died out in many parts of kent aware of this decline in early twentieth century folklorist and historian percy maylam documented what survived of tradition and traced its appearances in historical documents publishing his findings as hooden horse in 1909 although deemed extinct at time of first world war custom was revived in an altered form during mid twentieth century when use of hooden horse was incorporated into some modern kentish folk traditions description surviving sources testify to fact that while there was some variation in hoodening tradition as it was practiced by different individuals in different parts of east kent it was nevertheless on whole remarkably uniform hooden horse which was at centre of tradition was usually made out of a wooden horse s head affixed to a pole about four feet long with a hinged jaw that was moved by a string this horse was then carried aloft by an individual who was concealed beneath a dark cloth as part of hoodening custom a team of hoodeners consisting of between four and eight men would carry horse through streets this team included horse operator a groom driver or waggoner who carried a whip and led horse by a bridle a jockey who would attempt to mount horse a mollie who was a man dressed as a woman and one or two musicians all of men were farm labourers usually being those who worked with horses team performed custom at christmas time and usually on christmas eve team would arrive at people s houses where they would sing a song before being admitted entry once inside horse pranced and gnashed its jaw while jockey attempted to mount it and mollie swept floor with a broom while chasing any girls present sometimes they would sing further songs and carols upon being presented with payment team would leave to repeat process at another house regional distribution historians have catalogued 33 recorded instances of hoodening tradition extant in kent prior to twentieth century revival these are clustered in a crescent shape along eastern and northern coasts of county and all were found within area historically defined as east kent tradition being unknown in neighbouring west kent more specifically folklorist percy maylam noted that there were no records of tradition having been found west of godmersham this region was a well populated area during period in which hoodeners were active and maylam noted that all of areas in which tradition was found contained east kentish dialect folklorist e c cawte analysed historical distribution of hoodeners and found that it did not correspond with areas of early anglo saxon settlement in kent nor did it accord with county s coal mining areas he concluded that there is no apparent reason why custom did not spread further afield hoodening was part of a wider hooded animal tradition that cawte identified as existing in different forms in various parts of britain features common to these customs were use of a hobby horse performance at christmas time a song or spoken statement requesting payment and use of a team who included a man dressed in women s clothing in south wales mari lwyd tradition featured troupes of men with a hobby horse knocking at doors over christmas period in an area along border between derbyshire and yorkshire old tup tradition featured groups knocking on doors around christmas carrying a hobby horse that had a goat s head folklorist christina hole drew parallels between hoodening and christmas bull tradition recorded in dorset and gloucestershire in south west england there are two extant hobby horse traditions padstow obby oss festival and minehead hobby horse which take place not at christmas time but on may day although origins of these traditions are not known with any certainty lack of any late medieval references to such practices may suggest that they emerged from documented elite fashion for hobby horses in sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in this hooded animal traditions may be comparable to england s morris dance tradition which became a nation wide craze in sixteenth and seventeenth centuries before evolving into a set of sharply delineated regional traditions etymology and origins maylam noted that most nineteenth century sources describing tradition had spelled word as hoden but that he favoured hooden because it better reflected pronunciation of word with its long vowel he added that word hooden rhymes with wooden and not with sodden as some writers appear to think given this pronunciation cawte suggested that oodening was a better spelling for tradition s name maylam also noted that none of hoodeners with whom he communicated were aware of etymology of term and that similarly they were unaware of tradition s historical origins term hoodening is thus of unknown derivation one possible explanation for origin of hooden was that it had emerged as a mispronunciation of wooden referring to use of wooden horse maylam was critical of this idea expressing view that such a mispronunciation was unlikely to emerge from kentish dialect a second possibility is that name hooden was a reference to hooded nature of horse s bearer historian ronald hutton deemed this to be simplest derivation while folklorists cawte and charlotte sophia burne also considered it most likely explanation maylam was also critical of this suggesting that cloth under which carrier was concealed was too large to be considered a hood in his history of kent antiquarian alfred john dunkin suggested that hodening was a corruption of and that it was ultimately derived from gothic hopp meaning horse maylam opined that dunkin s argument could be ignored stating that it rested on erroneous assumption that hodening began with a short vowel maylam concluded that hoodening tradition was a mutilated survival of a form of morris dance noting that some medieval morris dancers had incorporated games devoted to english folk hero robin hood into their custom he suggested that hoodening might have originally been a reference to robin hood this idea was challenged by burne who noted that in his legends robin hood was always depicted as an archer rather than a horse rider thus questioning how he had come to be associated with hooden horse she further noted that medieval games devoted to robin hood all took place in may rather than at christmas as hoodening did cawte also criticised maylam s argument noting that there was no evidence of morris dancing in kent prior to twentieth century and that neither hoodening nor robin hood had a particularly close association with morris dance to start with possible early medieval origins thumb right folklorist geoff doel suggested a possible connection between hooden horse and white horse which appears as a symbol of kent on county flag pictured in 1807 an anonymous observer suggested that term hoden was linked to anglo saxon god woden and that tradition might be a relic of a festival to commemorate our saxon ancestors landing in thanet in 1891 it was suggested that custom had once been known as a reference to early medieval scandinavian god odin author of this idea further suggested that custom had begun either with ritual wearing of skins of horses sacrificed to odin or as an early christian mockery of such odinic practices maylam noted that he was initially attracted to idea that term hodening had derived from woden an old english name that he thought a more likely origin than old norse odin but that upon investigating this possibility found no sufficient evidence for it he added that it would seem unlikely that w would be lost from woden in kentish dialect citing example of a kentish village whose name is often interpreted as having derived from woden and which clearly retains its use of w he concluded that one feels that theory is based on inferences and analogies not strong enough for a foundation to carry building erected on them idea of linking tradition to woden was also dismissed as unlikely by both burne and cawte believing it likely that hoodening tradition substantially pre dates its earliest textual appearances folklorist geoff doel suggested possibility that it had originated as a midwinter rite to re energise vegetation as evidence for this claim doel noted that other english winter folk customs such as apple wassail have also been interpreted in this manner he also suggested that use of horse in tradition may have some connections to either use of white horse as symbol of kent and use of hengist and horsa meaning stallion and horse in old english as prominent characters in origin myths of early medieval kingdom of kent recorded appearances early textual references thumb earliest surviving descriptions of hoodening claim that hooden horse contained a horse s skull akin to this modern example of mari lwyd a welsh hobby horse oldest known textual reference to hoodening comes from alphabet of a manuscript authored by samuel pegge an antiquary who served as vicar of godmersham in kent from 1731 to 1751 after pegge died manuscript was obtained by palaeographer sir frederic madden and after his death it was purchased by english dialect society who published it in 1876 in this manuscript pegge noted simply that hoodening ing is a country masquerade at christmas times comparing it to mumming and of derbyshire earliest known textual description of tradition is provided by a letter that was published in a may 1807 edition of european magazine letter had been written by an anonymous individual who was describing an encounter with hoodeners on a visit to kentish coastal town of ramsgate in thanet i found they begin festivities of christmas by a curious procession a party of young people procure head of a dead horse which is affixed to a pole about four feet in length a string is affixed to lower jaw a horse cloth is also attached to whole under which one of parts gets and by frequently pulling string keeps up a loud snapping noise and is accompanied by rest of party grotesquely habited with hand bells they thus proceed from house to house ringing their bells and singing carols and songs they are commonly gratified with beer and cake or perhaps with money this is called provincially a hodening later commenting on this source maylam highlighted that its author did not appear to be from kent and that from their use of wording it appeared that they had been told about tradition by locals but had not actually witnessed it first hand as such maylam suggested that author may have been wrong in describing use of a horse s skull in ramsgate tradition given that both later sources and hoodeners of his own time all used a wooden model of a horse s head at same time maylam noted that use of a horse s skull was not impossible for such skulls had also been used in hobby horse traditions of other parts of britain anonymously authored account was repeated almost verbatim in a range of other publications in coming decades giving its description far wider exposure first printed reference to hooden horse having a wooden head appeared in mackenzie e c walcott s guide to coast of kent published in 1859 where he referred to a curious custom which used to prevail in ramsgate maylam later suggested that ramsgate hooden horse tradition died out between 1807 and 1838 for he had interviewed elderly town residents in early twentieth century and while several were aware that it had once taken place in town none could recall it happening in their own lifetime later nineteenth century many years after event kentish antiquarian j meadows cooper related that while sitting in a pub on outskirts of margate on boxing day 1855 he had encountered a party carrying a hooden horse that entered building another local resident mrs edward tomlin later related that as a child she had lived at a house named near margate and that she remembered hooden horse visiting them at christmas time during 1850s and up until 1865 maylam s researches also found recollections of a hooden horse that had appeared in herne and but which had been discontinued in 1860s another that was active from wingate farm house in during 1850s and one that had been active at but which had ceased by 1860s he found another based at lower that had been active from at least 1850s under leadership of henry brazier it was subsequently taken over by his son john until tradition ended locally in 1892 in a january 1868 edition of kentish gazette an anonymous author mentioned that hoodening had taken place in minster swale on christmas eve of 1867 author noted that tradition featured carol singing and ringing of handbells which were accompanied by appearance of a hooden horse they expressed surprise at this latter event because they had thought that horse was as extinct as megatherium thumb left 350px hoodeners from hale farm in st nicholas at wade kent as photographed in june 1905 in their 1888 dictionary of kentish dialect w d parish and w f shaw claimed that hodening was a term used in kent to refer to a custom involving singing of carols but that in past hoodening had been applied to a mumming or masquerade involving hooden horse they added that they had gained information on this older custom in 1876 from reverend h bennett smith of st nicholas at wade who had in turn learned from a retired farmer in his parish that farmer used to send annually round neighbourhood best horse under charge of wagoner and that afterwards instead a man used to represent horse being supplied with a tail and with a wooden figure of a horse s head and plenty of horse hair for a mane custom has long since ceased parish and shaw did not mention what time of year tradition took place or its geographical location they also made no reference to a sack concealing person carrying horse doel thought it likely that neither parish or shaw had ever seen a hooden horse and that instead their information was based on older written sources he also thought it noteworthy that they described tradition using past tense indicating that they considered it to be either dead or dying at time of writing maylam believed that information regarding decline of tradition was erroneous because hoodeners were still active in st nicholas at wade during early twentieth century and various locals living in area at time could recall it taking place in area back to 1840s in december 1889 a letter written by a resident of st lawrence named charles j h saunders appeared in bromley record saunders said he had conversed with many elderly residents of thanet on subject of hoodening and that they informed him that custom had been discontinued around fifty years previously after a woman in broadstairs was so scared by hooden horse that she died he added that a horse s skull was rarely used owing to difficulty procuring one and that wooden head was thus typically used as a replacement he said hoodening company typically consisted of a jockey who placed himself on back of individual carrying horse and that it was sport that bystanders attempted to throw him off resulting in violence horse and jockey were also accompanied by two singers two attendants and an individual dressed as an old woman carrying a broom when company knocked on people s doors it was old woman s job to sweep inhabitants feet away with her broom and to chase any girls until being paid off with money or refreshments he was of opinion that custom had been restricted to isle of thanet noting that locals informed him that it had been carried out in ramsgate st lawrence minster st nicholas acol monkton and birchington contradicting this were several letters published in church times in january 1891 which attested to continuing practice of hooden horse tradition at both deal and walmer percy maylam s investigations percy maylam was born into a farming family in 1865 at farm in and in 1890 became a solicitor of supreme court before working as a solicitor at canterbury as well as being a keen cricketer and coin collector maylam was an amateur historian and in 1892 joined kent archaeological society during 1880s maylam came upon hoodening tradition and began undertaking research into it searching for textual references to tradition in books periodicals and newspapers and interviewing those involved in three extant traditions at st nicholas at wade walmer and deal he expressed opinion that in these days kent possesses so few genuine popular customs of this kind that we cannot afford to be indifferent to those still in existence this is my excuse for my attempt to record custom as now existing before it is utterly lost to us thumb right 300px hoodeners from walmer court farm walmer in march 1907 period in which maylam conducted his research was one that was witnessing increased interest in recording of britain s rural folk culture in particular by members of professional classes of which maylam was a member in part due to fear that such traditions were rapidly dying out such folklore collecting was encouraged by folklore society with whom maylam was associated and also by widely read book golden bough a work of comparative folkloristics authored by anthropologist james frazer maylam published his research in 1909 as hooden horse in an edition limited to 303 copies book was reviewed in journal folklore by burne who described it as an admirable piece of work careful thorough unambitious and complete in itself cawte later described it as unusually good while fran and geoff doel regarded it as a very enlightened piece of edwardian folk research maylam concluded that at time there was only one hooden horse still in active use in thanet that stored at hale farm in st nicholas at wade which he noted was brought out each christmas to visit sarre birchington and st nicholas at wade itself members included a man in female garb known as mollie in their procession but added that this had not been done for some time and was thus reintroduced for maylam s benefit in his book maylam included a photograph of horse taken at sarre in 1905 on christmas eve 1906 maylam encountered a second hooden horse this time at walmer this horse came into local hotel tearoom at about 6 30pm accompanied by two musicians one playing tambourine and other concertina and a man named robert laming who led horse itself they were wearing ordinary clothes but informed maylam that they had once worn smock as part of tradition they had no mollie and members could not recall a mollie ever having been part of their custom hotel owner s daughter placed a gratuity in horse s mouth before troupe moved on to local shops where they were also given gratuities in a similar manner maylam talked to troupe about tradition and eventually organised photographing of walmer horse and those who accompanied it in march 1907 maylam also interviewed those involved in hoodening tradition at deal whom he encountered in summer of 1909 one elderly gentleman robert skardon related that his father had once led town s hoodening troupe in which he personally carried head his father drum his uncle john fiddle and old harry piccolo for many years they had included a man dressed in woman s clothing who was known as a daisy rather than a mollie but that this had been discontinued skardon had given up tradition many years previously and hooden horse itself had come into possession of elbridge bowles of great who continued to lead a hoodening troupe after christmas each year visiting deal as well as neighbouring villages of finglesham ripple eastry and maylam was also informed that at time of britain s involvement in second boer war horse had been decorated with military equipment fourth hooden horse that maylam encountered was owned by men who worked at george goodson s farm in fenland word near sandwich they informed him that it had been made by a farm hand in cleve monkton before being brought to word when one of cleve farm workers relocated there maylam believed that custom as a natural and spontaneous observance among people was clearly going to die out expressing his hope that hooden horses could be preserved in kentish museums and brought out for specially arranged public processions so as to maintain their place in kentish culture in later life maylam focused his attentions on exploring his family history privately publishing maylam family records in 1932 before dying in 1939 in century following his death maylam s book on hoodening became difficult to obtain and expensive to purchase and so to mark centenary of its first publication it was republished in 2009 by history press under altered title of kent hooden horse writing an introductory article for second publication doel a specialist in kentish folklore praised maylam s book as a classic study which was impressive for its separation of fact from speculation as to origins and significance of custom twentieth century revival writing in 1967 folklorist barnett field claimed that at some point after maylam s book was published hoodening had died out horses were hung up in stables and when tractors came were taken out and burnt on bonfire doel and doel later suggested that it was impact of first world war which effectively ended tradition field noted that first revival of custom after war took place at 1936 kent district folk dance festival at aylesford a new horse was specially created for this festival and was modelled on an older example that had been used at sarre hobby horse had not previously had any connection with morris dancing although was adopted as a totem animal for several morris sides after second world war this revival in usage of horse was heavily influenced by maylam s book aylesford horse was adopted by ravensbourne morris men a morris troupe based in west kentish village of in 1947 ravensbourne morris s hoodening tradition is earliest known variant of custom to exist in west kent although there are accounts of a hooden horse being located at school in west kentish town of beckenham during 1930s at 1945 celebration marking british victory in second world war a horse was brought out in acol this instance has been described as a kind of missing link between tradition and revival because horse had been used as part of historical hoodening tradition up until mid 1920s barnett field 1912 2000 as born at wych cross in ashdown forest and subsequently educated at tunbridge wells he trained as a banker before working as manager of hythe and folkestone branches of westminster bank until his retirement in 1979 field and his wife olive ridley had a keen interest in folk dances she established folkestone national folk dance group in 1950 and he founded east kent morris men in 1953 field constructed a hooden horse for group to use based in large part on deal horse photographed for maylam s book and unveiled it at folkestone celebrations for coronation of queen elizabeth ii in june 1953 after this it came to be used by both east kent morris men and folkestone district national dance group s handbell ringers who took it with them for performances in various parts of continental europe including austria netherlands yugoslavia sweden and czechoslovakia developing what came to be known as handbell hoodening handbell ringers also brought out horse to accompany them as they went around in public collecting money for charity at christmas time left thumb hooden horses at clock tower in broadstairs as part of broadstairs folk week 2017 from 1954 horse was also brought out for a whitsun celebration in which it was paraded from charing to village green at wye a special service was held in charing church in which morris men danced in chancel and through aisle while vicar put a bridle on horse itself horse was also brought out for a july 1956 ceremony in which swan inn a pub at wickhambreaux was officially renamed as hooden horse present were east kent morris men handbell ringers and ravensbourne morris men this venture led to groups establishing a new folk custom hop hoodening which was derived in part from an older hop picking ceremony found in weald area their new custom involved different groups joining together on a tour around villages of east kent beginning at canterbury cathedral and going through ramsgate cliftonville and herne bay before ending in a barn dance at wickhambreaux in october 1957 field was introduced to jack laming of walmer who as a boy had performed in a hoodening troupe earlier in century laming taught field more about historical hoodening tradition and together they unearthed an old hooden horse that was stored at walmer s farm this artefact was later placed on display at deal maritime and local history museum in june 1961 field and his wife established first folkestone international folklore festival as a biannual celebration of folk customs it continued for 28 years since end of second world war hooden horse s use has been revived in whitstable where it is often brought out for jack in green festival each may and is owned by a group called ancient order of hoodeners since 1981 tonbridge mummers and hoodeners have made use of a horse incorporating it into a play specially written for purpose by doel and nick miller an annual conference of hoodeners was also established initially meeting at marsh gate inn near herne bay it subsequently moved to simple simon s in canterbury a member of st nicholas at wade hoodeners ben jones established a website devoted to tradition at prompting of local residents in december 2014 a pub named hungry horse located on corner of haine road and nash road in broadstairs was renamed as hoodening horse after folk custom commenting on kentish revival of hoodening hutton suggested that its success was due largely to desire of many kentish folk to culturally
