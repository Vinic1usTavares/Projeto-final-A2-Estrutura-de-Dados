an underdog darling of indie game scene for four years prior to its release game s designer phil fish became renowned in a way unusual for game developers due to his prominence in indie game movie which released in 2012 while game was released to wide acclaim fish himself became known for his outspoken and acerbic public persona game that became fez began in a collaboration between montreal based phil fish and toronto based shawn mcgrath on mcgrath s idea for a puzzle game a four sided 3d space with each side in 2d similar to fish s 3d pixels voxels as incorporated into fez entirety of fez design lore and art descends from this game mechanic fish provided project s art and credited his influence to shigeru miyamoto and hayao miyazaki fish and mcgrath s partnership crumbled due to creative differences as fish wanted to create a platform game fish continued to work on game in his spare time and announced his search for a programmer on deviantart and first person to reply renaud bedard became lead programmer they were both same age and living in montreal though bedard had some hobbyist experience in 3d graphics and was studying computer science fez was his first professional game development project his first task was to write level editor and game engine fez was first announced in july 2007 on independent gaming source a trailer released in october 2007 convinced jason degroot to join development team as a producer degroot also known as 6955 first met fish at a 2006 e3 party and started work on game s soundtrack and sound effects soundtrack was ultimately composed by rich disasterpeace vreeland and sound effects by brandon game was nominated for two awards at 2008 independent games festival igf at game developers conference gdc excellence in visual art and design innovation award as fez was a side project fish was employed full time at artificial mind and movement in montreal where he worked on a tie in game for a film he was not permitted time off to attend event and thus decided to quit his job in january 2008 a moment he later marked as when i became indie game won excellence in visual art and created a surge of public interest in game concurrent to a similar swell of interest in indie game developers fish received a canadian government loan to open polytron corporation as a startup company and began full time work on fez in july 2009 polytron announced a release for xbox live arcade in early 2010 polytron and microsoft agreed to release fez as an xbox exclusive a deal fish later recalled as sensible fish designed game as a console game not a pc game and felt that way he intended game to be experienced with a controller on a couch was part of medium polytron ruled out a wiiware release due to problems fish had with their platform and developer options development continued with a more experimental ethos until company began to run out of capital canadian government loan that had funded polytron s prototyping phase was not renewed for their production phase they also lost funding from organization that preceded indie fund as polytron s producer left company fish borrowed money from friends and family for three months to keep company open in dire straits he considered canceling project in march 2011 nearby quebecois developer publisher trapdoor offered to help polytron having just signed a deal with electronic arts to publish their own game warp trapdoor assisted with polytron s finances and operations and offered to treat them as part of their company and let them keep their intellectual property rights in exchange for a portion of fez earnings fish felt that partnership rescued game fish is shown preparing for fez march 2011 pax east booth in 2012 documentary film indie game movie which chronicles stories of several indie developers at various stages of their games development cycles as a subplot film presents fish amidst a legal dispute with a former business partner that game s future partner believed to be jason degroot is portrayed negatively and does not participate onscreen film s end credits were later corrected to reflect that fish s business partner was not asked for input game informer called fish film s most memorable developer and rock paper shotgun wrote that fish is portrayed as melodramatic theatrical and neurotic in a way that exacerbates his outspoken public perception eurogamer said that part where fish resolves to kill himself if he does not release his game is film s most startling moment fez won audience choice award at september 2011 fantastic arcade best in show and best story world design at october 2011 indiecade and seumas mcnally grand prize at 2012 gdc independent games festival it was also a 2011 penny arcade expo pax 10 selection fez was displayed in its entirety in a secluded lounge room at october 2011 festival in nottingham england fish considered demo their most fruitful yet fish told a gamasutra reporter that he had received positive feedback from independent games festival chairman brandon boyer and braid designer jonathan blow near end of development fish felt burnt out and that his personal health had suffered final game included almost none of original work from first two years of development after several delays fez was submitted for certification in february 2012 release fez was released on april 13 2012 and sold 200 000 copies in its yearlong exclusivity to xbox live arcade platform several months later polytron became embroiled in a high profile dispute with microsoft over cost of patching game polytron had released a fix that resolved many of game s technical issues but introduced another that corrupted saved games for about one percent of users they withdrew patch but found microsoft s fee for subsequent patch releases unviable and chose to reinstate withdrawn patch as their most utilitarian option polytron drew ire for decision which raised awareness for business needs of indie developers in july 2013 a year later microsoft announced that they no longer charged for patches and fish tweeted that polytron s patch would take a couple of months speaking in retrospect of release fish fiercely criticized fez co publisher microsoft games studios for botching game s release fish cited a lack of promotion and publicity and poor advertising of game on microsoft s digital market in march 2013 fish announced a may 1 2013 release for game s pc port and opened preorders on gog com and steam game s os x and linux ports debuted in pay what you want humble indie bundle 9 on september

console support for cross buy where one digital purchase allows access across multiple consoles and cross save game save sharing between consoles as well as support for 3d televisions dualshock 4 controller s decorative and graphical upgrades due to full port into c programming language ports for ouya and ios were also announced fish announced eventual ports for pretty much every platform but nintendo 3ds bedard planned to leave polytron after finishing fez to experience work with a full development team but stayed to port windows release before joining toronto s capybara games he credited game s long development cycle to his own inexperience in game development compounded by team s small size and difficulty in setting reasonable milestones game s scope and fish s perfectionism fish had hoped that players would discuss fez nuances online after game s release players collaborated online for a week to solve final monolith puzzle by brute force ars technica described apparent end to game s harder puzzles as anticlimactic but fish told eurogamer in march 2013 that hidden in game secrets remain to be found more than three years after its digital launch fez received a physical release designed by fish and limited to a signed edition of 500 in december 2015 deluxe package included soundtrack and a stylized red notebook with gold foil inlay an ios port began development in april 2017 when a teaser trailer was released it was released in december 2017 design when bedard joined project game focused on 2d 3d mechanic and did not yet have open world ambitions he coded game in microsoft visual c express and xna game studio express his first task level editor fezzer was coded from scratch in xna and inspired by sketchup bedard also wrote game engine trixel technology which turns 2d tiles into sides of a 3d cube pixel engine tracks player character gomez in 3d space even though game behaves as a 2d platformer bedard also built game to resolve collisions when converting between 3d and 2d space fish created pixel art in photoshop for each tiled side of 3d trixel that bedard s custom software compiled into 3d game assets which fish would extrude as surfaces in fezzer to build levels fish found level design process overwhelming and bedard has said he was relieved that it was not his job fish compared his design process to playing with lego blocks and planned more involved levels in graph paper to first visualize 2d views before building levels in 3d software levels and puzzles were not preordained in a design document and many of drafts levels scrapped in 2008 resurfaced to be used later in production process so as to fit rotation mechanic levels were made tall instead of wide and first part of game was designed to acclimate player to 2d controls before introducing 3d element as they worked fish first proposed ideas that bedard would implement two would then discuss and fine tune addition they worked well together fish describes game s changes during development as organic they tested different kinds of levels and replicated types of in game exploration that team appreciated most it came to adopt metroidvania mechanics with secret passages warp gates and cheat codes fish cited myst as another touchstone and compared its open world nonlinear narrative and obtuse to fez own alphabet numeric system and an almost unfairly hard to get second set of collectibles fish originally fought against having an in game map because he wanted players to draft their own after attempting to do so himself he changed his mind fish later called in game map probably one of weakest aspects of game fish also fought against including navigational assistant dot but later felt that addition was successful and a positive contribution to game s mythology fez itself fish described as an ancient symbol of understanding third dimension fez had three different animators through its development paul robertson of scott pilgrim vs world game who did game s animals and some of gomez s animations adam saltsman of canabalt and graham lackey who did some character animations game s mechanics were inspired by nintendo entertainment system games fish played in his youth particularly super mario and legend of zelda fish cited fumito ueda s ico as game s third inspiration and he sought to emulate its feeling of nostalgic and isolated loneliness fish also sought to emulate ueda s design by subtraction philosophy where ico development team would periodically remove parts of game so as to leave only what was essential to their vision in this way ideas like player health and object weight puzzles were gradually struck from fez fish made a personal challenge of designing a game without relying on established mechanics as such fez was always a peaceful game and there was never an enemy coded into game so as to better emulate hayao miyazaki s signature open blue sky feel good atmosphere fish watched all of director s films one weekend
