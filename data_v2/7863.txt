called book a fascinating exercise in historiography highlighting authors analysis of how a number of hitler s leading generals were given an opportunity to write history of eastern front provid ing a sanitized version of events military historian jonathan house reviewed book for journal of military history describing it as a tour of cultural historiography and commending authors for hav ing performed a signal service by tracing origin and spread of this mythology house recommends that military historians not only study book but use it to teach students dangers of bias and propaganda in history a review published in journal history provided a critical assessment of book while it praises smelser and davies for setting out main myths concerning eastern front review argues that they did not provide convincing evidence to support their argument that most americans accept such an account it concludes that book therefore delivers a rather weak conclusion which dilutes impact of useful analysis earlier in book likewise american historian dennis showalter acknowledges that romanticised views described in book exist but argues that they remain limited in their impact on wider popular culture eastern front enthusiasts who buy a disproportionate number of books romanticizing eastern front are a minority within a minority and as a rule are at some pains to deny sympathy with third reich reviewer concludes that opening of russian archives since fall of soviet union has enabled balanced analysis at academic levels leading to a new interest in red army operations from popular history writers and world warii enthusiasts select bibliography 1975 sudeten problem 1933 1938 volkstumspolitik and formulation of nazi foreign policy middletown conn wesleyan university press 1988
