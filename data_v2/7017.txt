of charles foster kane campaign rally scene where burns speaks in front of a giant poster of himself is a reference to a scene from that film scene where burns trashes simpson family s dining room after dinner is similar to scene in which kane destroys his ex wife s room mary bailey shares her name with george bailey s wife in 1946 film it s a wonderful life burns hires an actor to portray nineteenth century scientist charles darwin to help in his claim that three eyed fish was result of evolution darwin was a naturalist who presented compelling evidence that all species of life have evolved over time from common ancestors through process he called natural selection clip of burns driving a military tank in his campaign montage is similar to a clip featured in michael dukakis s 1988 united states presidential campaign in which he can be seen driving a tank a re run of episode that aired on june 25 1992 included a new chalkboard gag in opening credits that featured bart writing it s potato not potatoe on chalkboard this is a reference to a spelling blunder by then vice president of united states dan quayle who corrected a student s correct spelling of potato to potatoe at an elementary school spelling bee in trenton new jersey on june 15 1992 themes and impact thumb naturalist charles darwin s theory of natural selection is mentioned in episode journalists have described two cars in every garage and three eyes on every fish as a satire on american politics joanne ostrow a reviewer for denver post said only a cartoon could get away with such pointed satire of american political campaigning and advertising that is featured in episode she compared it to counter cultural posture television shows such as second city television and saturday night live took in mid 1970s in those days this sort of alternative viewpoint was kept out of prime time in simpsons case it s still relegated to distant fourth network but at least time is prime jeremy kleinman of dvd talk wrote writers of simpsons have often come across as unabashedly liberal and this episode is no exception as political social commentary takes a step closer to foreground during this episode al jean current show runner of simpsons has himself admitted in an interview that show is of a liberal bent in dvd commentaries creator matt groening and majority of people who work on show state several times that they are very liberal but some such as john swartzwelder one of writers of this and many other simpsons episodes are libertarian show portrays government and large corporations as callous entities that take advantage of common worker thus writers often portray authority figures in an unflattering or negative light in simpsons politicians are corrupt ministers such as reverend lovejoy are indifferent to churchgoers and local police force is incompetent episode also features an environmentalism theme this theme is present in nuclear power plant s polluting lake springfield which causes fish in lake to mutate university of sciences in philadelphia physics and mathematics professor paul halpern discussed episode in his book what s science ever done for us what simpsons can teach us about physics robots life and universe he comments considering fact that charles darwin s theory of natural selection takes generations and that successful varieties must sustain a survival advantage over others only way mr burns can prove his assertion that fish is next step in evolution through natural selection is by tracking blinky over time to see if third eye allows mutant fish to find food more quickly or dodge predators mark meister and phyllis m japp discuss environmental theme of episode in their book studies in environmental rhetoric and popular culture authors think human pollution is characterized in episode as an improvement on nature and human progress is viewed as an integral part of human evolution they add these references articulate specific criticism of current environmental regulations specifically lax enforcement of regulations concerning dumping safe storage and disposal of nuclear waste furthermore this episode condemns manipulation of political and economic power to disguise ecological accountability and to shift blame for environmental problems authors also say episode comments on lack of adherence to safety standards for plant and criticizes apathetic acceptance of unforced environmental inspections in addition they comment that episode explicitly criticizes media spin doctors who distort impacts of ecological degradation caused by wealthy corporations such as nuclear power plant on february 13 1991 a local group in albany new york fought government s plan to create a nuclear waste dump in their neighborhood it was staged by citizens against radioactive dumping card at monthly meeting of low level radioactive waste siting commission in albany here four children dressed up as homer marge bart and lisa and presented a three eyed fabric fish which looked like blinky to commission in addition to that they performed a rap song which explained plot of episode since episode s initial airing blinky has been mentioned several times in news articles regarding nuclear waste and mutation a reporter for lincoln journal star compared blinky to a rainbow trout with two mouths caught in lincoln nebraska in 2005 fish was mentioned in a national review article discussing a legislation which would make it illegal to import possess or release alive into california any live transgenic fish sounds like someone watched one too many episodes of simpsons with blinky three eyed fish that swims by nuclear power plant matt smith of sf weekly compared blinky to a type of fish found in san francisco bay which according to a study by university of california davis had a shrunken brain and misshapen body that had been caused by dumping of toxic chemicals into bay in an article about now closed nuclear weapons production facility rocky flats plant brian park of rocky mountain collegian joked that after its closure years of cleanup ensued and now area is a wildlife refuge no word yet if blinky has been spotted barbara taormina of north shore sunday wrote in her article about new liquefied natural gas lng pipeline in massachusetts bay will blinky mutant three eyed fish from simpsons be showing up in massachusetts bay probably not but local environmentalists are worried that digging for new lng pipeline may stir up radioactive waste dumped decades ago in his article about nuclear power plant operator exelon thomas m anderson of kiplinger wrote thought of more nuclear power may conjure up images of three mile island accident or blinky but a growing number of policymakers and even environmentalists are coming to appreciate advantages of atomic energy episode was mentioned when a three eyed atlantic was caught in 2011 in cordoba argentina near a local nuclear power plant

won six more since then episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics since airing authors of book i can t believe it s a bigger and better updated unofficial simpsons guide warren martyn and adrian wood called episode a superb example of political satire demonstrating lengths people will go to to win votes marge of course sees straight through burns and uses blinky three eyed fish to demonstrate his lack of conviction phil rosenthal of los angeles daily news called episode a wonderful stab at american politics and media machine that drives it and added message is so subtle makers of simpsons might deny it is there at all for fear of turning off a portion of its audience truth is you may very well be so busy laughing and taking in fine details such as references to citizen kane to notice hal boedeker of miami herald said episode took some well aimed satirical jabs at american politics and publics short attention span episode has wit of best of all in family and benign mother marge becomes a force for good in edith bunker tradition virginia mann of record called episode terrific though she believed its social and political overtones were more likely to appeal to adults than children tom shales of washington post described episode as a bull s eye political satire doug pratt a dvd reviewer and rolling stone contributor thought episode s story was nicely composed so you don t have to recognize citizen kane references to appreciate effort but it adds to fun he also noted that it begins exploration of mr burns in earnest first of many characters who will receive elaborate coverage as series advances jeremy kleinman of dvd talk thought both lisa s tremendous intellect and marge s moral compass were probed in episode and he thought one clear highlight of episode was burns s attempts to explain away blinky s mutation by turning to an actor portraying charles darwin who proceeds to give a speech suggesting that blinky is merely advanced dvd movie guide s colin jacobson wrote episode took an unusual approach for an early show as it focused largely on a secondary character one could argue that season one s krusty gets busted did same but two cars in every garage and three eyes on every fish provided a heavier emphasis on burns than that prior program did krusty this helped make it a fairly good episode it fleshed out burns s character a little better and gave us a reasonably entertaining experience episode fell short of greatness but it worked nicely for most part ken tucker of entertainment weekly described episode as masterful
