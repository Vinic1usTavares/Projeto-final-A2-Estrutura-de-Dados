voyager 1 is a space probe launched by nasa on september 5 1977 part of voyager program to study outer solar system voyager 1 was launched 16 days after its twin voyager 2 having operated for as of spacecraft still communicates with deep space network to receive routine commands and to transmit data to earth at a distance of from earth as of november 4 2019 it is most distant man made object from earth probe s objectives included flybys of jupiter saturn and saturn s largest moon titan although spacecraft s course could have been altered to include a pluto encounter by forgoing titan flyby exploration of moon took priority because it was known to have a substantial atmosphere voyager 1 studied weather magnetic fields and rings of two planets and was first probe to provide detailed images of their moons after completing its primary mission with flyby of saturn on november 12 1980 voyager 1 became third of five artificial objects to achieve escape velocity required to leave solar system on august 25 2012 voyager 1 became first spacecraft to cross heliopause and enter interstellar medium in a further testament to robustness of voyager 1 voyager team completed a successful test of spacecraft s trajectory correction maneuver tcm thrusters in late 2017 first time these thrusters were fired since 1980 a project enabling mission to be extended by two to three years voyager 1s extended mission is expected to continue until about 2025 when its radioisotope thermoelectric generators will no longer supply enough electric power to operate its scientific instruments mission background history in 1960s a grand tour to study outer planets was proposed which prompted nasa to begin work on a mission in early 1970s information gathered by pioneer 10 spacecraft helped voyager s engineers design voyager to cope more effectively with intense radiation environment around jupiter however shortly before launch strips of kitchen grade aluminum foil were applied to certain cabling to further enhance radiation shielding initially voyager 1 was planned as mariner 11 of mariner program due to budget cuts mission was scaled back to be a flyby of jupiter and saturn and renamed mariner jupiter saturn probes as program progressed name was later changed to voyager since probe designs began to differ greatly from previous mariner missions spacecraft components thumb left upright diameter high gain dish antenna used on voyager craft 160px voyager 1 was constructed by jet propulsion laboratory it has 16 hydrazine thrusters three axis stabilization gyroscopes and referencing instruments to keep probe s radio antenna pointed toward earth collectively these instruments are part of attitude and articulation control subsystem aacs along with redundant units of most instruments and 8 backup thrusters spacecraft also included 11 scientific instruments to study celestial objects such as planets as it travels through space communication system radio communication system of voyager 1 was designed to be used up to and beyond limits of solar system communication system includes a diameter high gain cassegrain antenna to send and receive radio waves via three deep space network stations on earth craft normally transmits data to earth over deep space network channel 18 using a frequency of either 2 3 ghz or 8 4 ghz while signals from earth to voyager are transmitted at 2 1 ghz when voyager 1 is unable to communicate directly with earth its digital tape recorder dtr can record about 64 kilobytes of data for transmission at another time signals from voyager 1 take over 20 hours to reach earth power voyager 1 has three radioisotope thermoelectric generators rtgs mounted on a boom each mhw rtg contains 24 pressed plutonium 238 oxide spheres rtgs generated about 470 w of electric power at time of launch with remainder being dissipated as waste heat power output of rtgs declines over time due to 87 7 year half life of fuel and degradation of thermocouples but craft s rtgs will continue to support some of its operations until 2025 as of voyager 1 has of plutonium 238 that it had at launch by 2050 it will have 56 5 left computers unlike other onboard instruments operation of cameras for visible light is not autonomous but rather it is controlled by an imaging parameter table contained in one of on board digital computers flight data subsystem since 1990s most space probes have had completely autonomous cameras computer command subsystem ccs controls cameras ccs contains fixed computer programs such as command decoding fault detection and correction routines antenna pointing routines and spacecraft sequencing routines this computer is an improved version of one that was used in 1970s viking orbiters hardware in both custom built ccs subsystems in voyagers is identical there is only a minor software modification one of them that has a scientific subsystem that other lacks attitude and articulation

station aboard a titan iiie launch vehicle voyager 2 probe had been launched two weeks earlier on august 20 1977 despite being launched later voyager 1 reached both jupiter and saturn sooner following a shorter trajectory voyager 1 initial orbit had an aphelion of 8 9 au just a little short of saturn s orbit of 9 5 au voyager 2 s initial orbit had an aphelion of 6 2 au well short of saturn s orbit

through jupiter system flyby of jupiter voyager 1 began photographing jupiter in january 1979 its closest approach to jupiter was on march 5 1979 at a distance of about from planet s center because of greater photographic resolution allowed by a closer approach most observations of moons rings magnetic fields and radiation belt environment of jovian system were made during 48 hour period that bracketed closest approach voyager 1 finished photographing jovian system in april 1979 discovery of ongoing volcanic activity on moon io was probably greatest surprise it was first time active volcanoes had been seen on another body in solar system it appears that activity on io affects entire jovian system io appears to be primary source of matter that pervades jovian magnetosphere region of space that surrounds planet influenced by planet s strong magnetic field sulfur oxygen and sodium apparently erupted by io s volcanoes and sputtered off surface by impact of high energy particles were detected at outer edge of magnetosphere of jupiter two voyager space probes made a number of important discoveries about jupiter its satellites its radiation belts and its never before seen planetary rings flyby of saturn gravitational assist trajectories at jupiter were successfully carried out by both voyagers and two spacecraft went on to visit saturn and its system of moons and rings voyager 1 encountered saturn in november 1980 with closest approach on november 12 1980 when space probe came within of saturn s cloud tops space probe s cameras detected complex structures in rings of saturn and its remote sensing instruments studied atmospheres of saturn and its giant moon titan voyager 1 found that about seven percent of volume of saturn s upper atmosphere is helium compared with 11 percent of jupiter s atmosphere while almost all rest is hydrogen since saturn s internal helium abundance was expected to be same as jupiter s and sun s lower abundance of helium in upper atmosphere may imply that heavier helium may be slowly sinking through saturn s hydrogen that might explain excess heat that saturn radiates over energy it receives from sun winds blow at high speeds in saturn near equator voyagers measured winds about 500 m s 1 100 mph wind blows mostly in an easterly direction voyagers found aurora like ultraviolet emissions of hydrogen at mid latitudes in atmosphere and auroras at polar latitudes above 65 degrees high level auroral activity may lead to formation of complex hydrocarbon molecules that are carried toward equator mid latitude auroras which occur only in sunlit regions remain a puzzle since bombardment by electrons and ions known to cause auroras on earth occurs primarily at high latitudes both voyagers measured rotation of saturn length of a day at 10 hours 39 minutes 24 seconds voyager 1 s mission included a flyby of titan saturn s largest moon which had long been known to have an atmosphere images taken by pioneer 11 in 1979 had indicated atmosphere was substantial and complex further increasing interest titan flyby occurred as spacecraft entered system to avoid any possibility of damage closer to saturn compromising observations and approached to within passing behind titan as seen from earth and sun voyager s measurement of atmosphere s effect on sunlight and earth based measurement of its effect on probe s radio signal were used to determine atmosphere s composition density and pressure titan s mass was also measured by observing its effect on probe s trajectory thick haze prevented any visual observation of surface but measurement of atmosphere s composition temperature and pressure led to speculation that lakes of liquid hydrocarbons could exist on surface because observations of titan were considered vital trajectory chosen for voyager 1 was designed around optimum titan flyby which took it below south pole of saturn and out of plane of ecliptic ending its planetary science mission had voyager 1 failed or been unable to observe titan voyager 2 s trajectory would have been altered to incorporate titan flyby precluding any visit to uranus and neptune trajectory voyager 1 was launched into would not have allowed it to continue on to uranus and neptune but could have been altered to avoid a titan flyby and travel from saturn to pluto arriving in 1986 exit from heliosphere

would now be complex to get them working again earth side software and computers for reading images are also no longer available 200px thumb left pale blue dot image showing earth from 6 billion

and overtook pioneer 10 as most distant spacecraft from earth travelling at about it has fastest heliocentric recession speed of any spacecraft as voyager 1 headed for interstellar space its instruments continued to study solar system jet propulsion laboratory scientists used plasma wave experiments aboard voyager 1 and 2 to look for heliopause boundary at which solar wind transitions into interstellar medium probe was moving with a relative velocity to sun of about with velocity probe is currently maintaining voyager 1 is traveling about per year or about one light year per 18 000 years termination shock thumb 200px close flybys of gas giants gave gravity assists to both voyagers scientists at johns hopkins university applied physics laboratory believe that voyager 1 entered termination shock in february 2003 this marks point where solar wind slows to subsonic speeds some other scientists expressed doubt discussed in journal nature of november 6 2003 issue would not be resolved until other data became available since voyager 1 solar wind detector ceased functioning in 1990 this failure meant that termination shock detection would have to be inferred from data from other instruments on board in may 2005 a nasa press release said that consensus was that voyager 1 was then in heliosheath in a scientific session at american geophysical union meeting in new orleans on may 25 2005 dr ed stone presented evidence that craft crossed termination shock in late 2004 this event is estimated to have occurred on december 15 2004 at a distance of 94 au from sun heliosheath on march 31 2006 amateur radio operators from in germany tracked and received radio waves from voyager 1 using dish at bochum with a long integration technique retrieved data was checked and verified against data from deep space network station at madrid spain this seems to be first such amateur tracking of voyager 1 it was confirmed on december 13 2010 that voyager 1 had passed reach of radial outward flow of solar wind as measured by low energy charged particle device it is suspected that solar wind at this distance turns sideways because of interstellar wind pushing against heliosphere since june 2010 detection of solar wind had been consistently at zero providing conclusive evidence of event on this date spacecraft was approximately 116 au or 10 8 billion miles 17 3 billion kilometers from sun voyager 1 was commanded to change its orientation to measure sideways motion of solar wind at that location in space on march 2011 from launch a test roll done in february had confirmed spacecraft s ability to maneuver and reorient itself course of spacecraft was not changed it rotated 70 degrees counterclockwise with respect to earth to detect solar wind this was first time spacecraft had done any major maneuvering since family portrait photograph of planets was taken in 1990 after first roll spacecraft had no problem in reorienting itself with alpha centauri voyager 1 s guide star and it resumed sending transmissions back to earth voyager 1 was expected to enter interstellar space at any time voyager 2 was still detecting outward flow of solar wind at that point but it was estimated that in following months or years it would experience same conditions as voyager 1 spacecraft was reported at 12 44deg declination and 17 163 hours right ascension and at an ecliptic latitude of 34 9deg ecliptic latitude changes very slowly placing it in constellation ophiuchus as observed from earth on may 21 2011 on december 1 2011 it was announced that voyager 1 had detected first lyman alpha radiation originating from milky way galaxy lyman alpha radiation had previously been detected from other galaxies but because of interference from sun radiation from milky way was not detectable nasa announced on december 5 2011 that voyager 1 had entered a new region referred to as a cosmic purgatory within this stagnation region charged particles streaming from sun slow and turn inward and solar system s magnetic field is doubled in strength as interstellar space appears to be applying pressure energetic particles originating in solar system decline by nearly half while detection of high energy electrons from outside increases 100 fold inner edge of stagnation region is located approximately 113 au from sun heliopause nasa announced in june 2012 that probe was detecting changes in environment that were suspected to correlate with arrival at heliopause voyager 1 had reported a marked increase in its detection of charged particles from interstellar space which are normally deflected by solar winds within heliosphere from sun craft thus began to enter interstellar medium at edge of solar system voyager 1 became first spacecraft to cross heliopause in august 2012 then at a distance of 121 au from sun although this was not confirmed for another year as of september 2012 sunlight took 16 89 hours to get to voyager 1 which was at a distance of 121 au apparent magnitude of sun from spacecraft was 16 3 less than 30 times brightness of full moon spacecraft was traveling at relative to sun it would need about 17 565 years at this speed to travel a light year to compare proxima centauri closest star to sun is about 4 2 light years distant were spacecraft traveling in direction of that star 73 775 years would pass before voyager 1 reaches it voyager 1 is heading in direction of constellation ophiuchus in late 2012 researchers reported that particle data from spacecraft suggested that probe had passed through heliopause measurements from spacecraft revealed a steady rise since may in collisions with high energy particles above 70 mev which are thought to be cosmic rays emanating from supernova explosions far beyond solar system with a sharp increase in these collisions in late august at same time in late august there was a dramatic drop in collisions with low energy particles which are thought to originate from sun ed roelof space scientist at johns hopkins university and principal investigator for low energy charged particle instrument on spacecraft declared that most scientists involved with voyager 1 would agree that these two criteria have been sufficiently satisfied however last criterion for officially declaring that voyager 1 had crossed boundary expected change in magnetic field direction from that of sun to that of interstellar field beyond had not been observed field had changed direction by only 2 degrees which suggested to some that nature of edge of heliosphere had been misjudged on december 3 2012 voyager project scientist ed stone of california institute of technology said voyager has discovered a new region of heliosphere that we had not realized was there we re still inside apparently but magnetic field now is connected to outside so it s like a highway letting particles in and out magnetic field in this region was 10 times more intense than voyager 1 encountered before termination shock it was expected to be last barrier before spacecraft exited solar system completely and entered interstellar space in march 2013 it was announced that voyager 1 might have become first spacecraft to enter interstellar space having detected a marked change in plasma environment on august 25 2012 however until september 12 2013 it was still an open question as to whether new region was interstellar space or an unknown region of solar system at that time former alternative was officially confirmed in 2013 voyager 1 was exiting solar system at a speed of about 3 6 au per year while voyager 2 is going slower leaving solar system at 3 3 au per year each year voyager 1 increases its lead over voyager 2 voyager 1 reached a distance of 135 au from sun on may 18 2016 by september 5 2017 that had increased to about 139 64 au from sun or just over 19 light hours and at that time voyager 2 was 115 32 au from sun its progress can be monitored at nasa s website see external links 350px thumb voyager 1 and other probes that are in or on their way to interstellar space except new horizons interstellar medium left thumb voyager 1 transmitted audio signals generated by plasma waves from interstellar space on september 12 2013 nasa officially confirmed that voyager 1 had reached interstellar medium in august 2012 as previously observed with a generally accepted date of august 25 2012 approximately 10 days short of its launch 35 years prior date durable changes in density of energetic particles were first detected by this point most space scientists had abandoned hypothesis that a change in magnetic field direction must accompany crossing of heliopause a new model of heliopause predicted that no such change would be found a key finding that persuaded many scientists that heliopause had been crossed was an indirect measurement of an 80 fold increase in electron density based on frequency of plasma oscillations observed beginning on april 9 2013 triggered by a solar outburst that had occurred in march 2012 electron density is expected to be two orders of magnitude higher outside heliopause than within weaker sets of oscillations measured in october and november 2012 provided additional data an indirect measurement was required because voyager 1 s plasma spectrometer had stopped working in 1980 in september 2013 nasa released recordings of audio of these plasma waves first to be measured in interstellar space while voyager 1 is commonly spoken of as having left solar system simultaneously with having left heliosphere two are not same

fast facts voyager 2 new horizons thumb upright image of voyager 1 s radio signal on february 21 2013 voyager 1 is expected to reach theorized oort cloud in about 300 years and take about 30 000 years to pass through it though it is not heading towards any particular star in about 40 000 years it will pass within 1 6 light years of star gliese 445 which is at present in constellation that star is generally moving towards solar system at about nasa says that voyagers are destined perhaps eternally to wander milky way in 300 000 years it will pass within less than 1 light year of m3v star tyc 3135 52 1 provided voyager 1 does not collide with anything and is not retrieved new horizons space probe will never pass it despite being launched from earth at a faster speed than either voyager spacecraft voyager spacecraft benefited from multiple planetary flybys to increase their heliocentric velocities whereas new horizons received only a single such boost from its jupiter flyby as of 2018 new horizons is traveling at about 14 km s 3 km s slower than voyager 1 and is still slowing down in december 2017 it was announced that nasa had successfully fired up all four of voyager 1s trajectory correction maneuver tcm thrusters for first time since 1980 tcm thrusters will be used in place of a degraded set of jets which were used to help keep probe s antenna pointed towards earth
