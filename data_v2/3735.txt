overall and ranked 1 in its time period among men 18 34 episode was received generally well by critics abby west of entertainment weekly praised interactions between characters as some of highlights of episode stating jim is show s makes everyone else seem just a little better he s perfect straight man to showcase michael s insanity brian zoromski of ign stated that any episode that places michael and dwight outside of their normal office environment is set up for some very funny and usually awkward situations and convention is no exception some of episode s best uncomfortable moments centered on michael believing he s life of party and that he s jim s friend michael and dwight pretending to laugh along to an inside joke made by jim s new boss josh is a prime example michael s comment i love inside jokes love to be part of one someday creates kind of uncomfortable silence that office excels at erik adams of a v club awarded episode a b writing that along with gay witch hunt this episode is evident that jim s transfer to stamford disrupts some of show s best character pairings he argues that while this episode exists little more than a way for michael and jim to repair their friendship interaction between carell and krasinski at episode s conclusion is worthy of applause adams also suggests that episode s main theme is one of isolation pointing out that both dwight and michael feel alone and cut off from others even in midst of a massive convention and that pam feels marooned back in scranton these feelings feed into main themes of season three which according to adams are distance separation and reunion references external links convention at nbc com category 2006 american television episodes category television episodes set in philadelphia category office
