teng chun based on chinese mythology or martial arts and targeted at low class audiences generally ethnic chinese this situation was created by great depression which had led to dutch east indies government collecting higher taxes advertisers asking for more money and cinemas selling tickets at lower prices this ensured that there was a very low profit margin for local films during this period cinemas in country mainly showed hollywood productions thumb upright one of wong brothers 1947 albert balink a dutch journalist began work on what was to become pareh in 1934 unlike teng chun inexperienced balink chose to target his film at dutch audiences he brought in two of wong brothers chinese filmmakers who had been inactive since making theresia sister theresa in 1932 wongs donated their studio an old tapioca flour factory as well as filmmaking equipment meanwhile much of funding came from other backers according to indonesian film historian misbach yusa biran money came from cinema mogul while eye film institute records indicate that film was backed by centrale voor en van and meant to promote migration from java to sumatra balink and wongs spent most of two years compiling necessary funds with balink in charge of general operations as head of java pacific film a joint operation balink insisted on perfection and had a clear idea what kind of actor he wanted in film unlike earlier filmmakers in country balink invested time and money in searching for best locations and actors possible without considering whether a person was already a celebrity ultimately most of those cast for pareh had not acted before including stars mochtar and soekarsih role of mahmud was filled when balink was out with coffee with joshua and othniel wong and saw a young man tall

raden for film which he and his family had already abandoned according to indonesian anthropologist albertus budi susanto emphasis on mochtar s title was meant as a way to draw a higher class audience

ethnographic shots to better present local culture to international audiences franken took an interest in documentary and ethnographic aspects of film directing shots for these portions while wongs handled general shots according to biran this was reflected in camera angles used pareh which had been recorded on 35 mm film using single system devices was brought to netherlands for editing there original voices of cast were dubbed by actors in netherlands resulting in stilted language use and heavy dutch accents though initially filmmakers had planned on using gamelan music poor quality of recording equipment in indies led to soundtrack being redone using european style music in netherlands from start to finish production of pareh cost 75 000 gulden approximately us 51 000 20 times as much as a regular local production after editing there were 2 061 metres of film equivalent to 92 minutes of runtime release and reception pareh was screened in netherlands as pareh een van java also noted as het lied van de beginning on 20 november 1936 film was also shown in indies it was unable to recoup its costs and bankrupted producers film was critically acclaimed in netherlands partially owing to emphasis of franken s involvement although it was a commercial success amongst intelligentsia in indies pareh was a failure with lower class native audiences mochtar never viewed film in full historical reception of pareh has generally been positive writing in 1955 indonesian author and cultural critic armijn pane opined that pareh was technically unparalleled in contemporary indies cinema with careful continuity and dynamic cuts he was critical however of film s tendency to see indies native population through european eyes and depict them as primitive american film historian john lent

one of two most important cinematic works from dutch east indies during 1930s balink s later work terang boelan full moon 1937 was other heider john h mcglynn and salim said note that film was of acceptable technical quality but is best remembered for changing path of cinematic developments in country legacy release of pareh was followed by a shift in genres popularised by local cinema teng
