kain of forbes said of episode and series it isn t just a spin off of a popular tv show so far it s a terrific tv show on its own merits it covers familiar ground but it still manages to be its own unique snowflake hank stuever of washington post graded it a b and wrote series is right in line with tone and style of original now classic series and that it raises more questions in two hours than it will readily answer stephen marche of esquire wrote that first few episodes were better than breaking bad kirsten acuna of business insider declared initial episodes everything you could possibly want from a spinoff television series roth cornet of ign gave episode an 8 7 out of 10 saying can saul compete with walter white no but he doesn t have to better call saul poses one simple but fascinating question what happened to jimmy mcgill that forced him to transform himself into ruthless hardened yet entirely entertaining criminal lawyer saul goodman man that we came to know and love on breaking bad i for one look forward to watching that story unfold michael star of new york post gave episode a 3 out of 4 rating saying some critics addressed skepticism prior to viewing episode alessandra stanley of new york times said it s common to dread a spinoff some succeed but plenty disappoint there is absolutely no need to worry about this prequel to breaking bad canon better call saul traces in loving if corrosive detail how jimmy mcgill a debt ridden ambulance chasing loser changed his name to saul goodman and became a drug lord consigliere better call saul is better than good it s delightful in a brutal darkly comic way of course chris jancelewicz of huffpost gave episode a highly favorable review despite his initial skepticism saying it is so good right from get go that i almost feel ashamed for ever doubting creator writer vince gilligan his writers and lead actor bob odenkirk saul better call saul is a return to tried and true new mexico environment sweeping shots of wide sky desert mixed with strip mall extravagance lushness juxtaposed with dark comedy which as it was with breaking bad both jarring and hilarious at same time you ll find yourself laughing in spite of yourself robert bianco of usa today said face it when amc announced it had ordered a prequel to breaking bad odds are many of us saw it as a callow move by a network bereft of new ideas to milk an old one for all it was worth well we were right but what we failed to factor in were gifts star bob odenkirk and creators vince gilligan and peter gould would bring to better call saul and their ability to transform what looked to be a sow s ear into something pretty much approaching a silk purse he ultimately gave episode a 3 5 rating out of 4 one of few negative reviews came from tony wong of toronto star saying it is beautifully and lovingly shot it is funny and it is dark but it s a lot to ask bob odenkirk to carry show without help in her review of series premiere mary mcnamara of los angeles times summarized that beauty of saul was his unflappable nature no matter how dire or dreadful circumstances he was able to identify next logical step and take it jimmy mcgill doesn t know how to do that yet better call saul will show us how he learned ratings and accolades upon airing episode became highest rated series premiere for a scripted series in u s cable history up to
