their vision office is fully scripted but there s always a little room to play when it s warranted first cuts are around 45 minutes so you often have to cut episodes in half for air though grief

writing that opening sequence excellently set tone of episode he found a ton of great moments such as michael s totally awkward speeches on ed truck s death and his conversation with dwight over a robot statue zoromski saved most praise for pam and her pranks particularly her completely ridiculous bird funeral it was all so brilliantly over top it becomes clear that scranton office will continue to be enjoyable to watch as pam takes over mocking of office all on her own to a hilarious extreme aol tv s michael sciannamea also lauded pam and her pranks especially highlighting her actions during opening sequence and her song during bird funeral sciannamea assumed that she feels liberated from roy and jim to some extent and is allowing her personality and sense of humor to come out even more he concluded that it was another solid episode with steve carell at his best entertainment weeklys abby west expressed praise for an episode that restored balance and order to our favorite paper pushers while still nicely forwarding storylines of tv s plainest super non couple west was also pleased to have michael back to his usual insanity and wrote that pam was priceless
