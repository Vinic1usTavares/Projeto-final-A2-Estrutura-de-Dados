morchella rufobrunnea commonly known as blushing morel is a species of ascomycete fungus in family morchellaceae a choice edible species fungus was originally described as new to science in 1998 by mycologists gaston guzman and fidel tapia from collections made in veracruz mexico its distribution was later revealed to be far more widespread after several dna studies suggested that it is common in west coast of united states israel australia and cyprus m rufobrunnea grows in disturbed soil or in woodchips used in landscaping suggesting a saprophytic mode of nutrition reports from mediterranean under olive trees olea europaea however suggest fungus may also be able to form facultative tree associations young fruit bodies have conical grayish caps covered with pale ridges and dark pits mature specimens are yellowish to ochraceous buff surface of fruit body often bruises brownish orange to pinkish where it has been touched a characteristic for which fungus is named new latin rufobrunnea signifying rufus brown mature fruit bodies grow to a height of m rufobrunnea differs from other morchella species by its urban or suburban habitat preferences in color and form of fruit body lack of a sinus at attachment of cap with stipe length of pits on surface and bruising reaction a process to cultivate morels now known to be m rufobrunnea was described and patented in 1980s taxonomy first scientifically described specimens of morchella rufobrunnea were collected in june 1996 from ecological institute of xalapa and other regions in southern mexican municipality of xalapa veracruz which are characterized by a subtropical climate type locality is a forest containing oak sweetgum and alder at an altitude of in a 2008 study michael kuo determined that winter fruiting yellow morel erroneously referred to as morchella deliciosa found in landscaping sites in western united states was same species as m rufobrunnea according to kuo david arora depicts this species in his popular 1986 work mushrooms demystified describing it as a coastal californian form of morchella deliciosa growing in gardens and other suburban habitats kuo suggests that m rufobrunnea is correct name for m deliciosa used by western american authors other north american morels formerly classified as deliciosa have since been recategorized into two distinct species morchella diminutiva and m sceptriformis m virginiana molecular analysis of nucleic acid sequences from internal transcribed spacer and elongation factor ef 1a regions suggests that genus morchella can be divided into three lineages m rufobrunnea belongs to a lineage that is basal to esculenta clade yellow morels and elata clade black morels this phylogenetic placement implies that it has existed in its current form since cretaceous era roughly 145 to 66 million years ago and all known morel species evolved from a similar ancestor m rufobrunnea is genetically closer to yellow morels than black morels m anatolica described from turkey in 2012 is a closely related sister species specific epithet rufobrunnea derives from latin roots ruf reddish and brunne brown vernacular names used for fungus include western white morel blushing morel and accounting for existence of subtropical species in blushing clade red brown blushing morel description fruit bodies of m rufobrunnea can reach tall although most are typically found in a narrower range conical to roughly cylindrical hymenophore cap is typically high by wide its surface is covered with longitudinal anastomosed ridges and crosswise veins that form broad angular elongated pits young fruit bodies are typically dark grey with sharply contrasting beige or buff ridges while mature specimens fade to ochraceous buff cylindrical stipe is often strongly wrinkled enlarged at base and measures by thick it is typically covered with a dark brown to greyish pruinescence often fading at maturity a useful character to discriminate it from similar species such as m tridentina or m sceptriformis stipe and hymenophore often exhibit ochraceous orange or reddish stains although this feature is neither constant nor exclusive to m rufobrunnea and can be seen in a number of morchella species such as morchella tridentina morchella frustrata m esculenta m guatemalensis recently described m et al 2014 and most likely m anatolica in deposit spores are pale orange to yellowish orange ascospores are egg shaped measuring 20 24 by 14 16 um when mature but smaller 14 5 19 by 9 10 um in immature fruit bodies they are thin walled hyaline translucent and inamyloid cylindrical asci spore bearing cells are 300 360 by 16 20 um with walls up to 1 5 um thick paraphyses measure 90 184 by 10 18 5 um 6 9 um thick if immature they are hyaline have 1 2 3 septa in lower half and slightly enlarged tips flesh is made of thin walled hyaline hyphae measuring 3 9 um wide stipe is a textura globosa with scattered or locally polymorphic terminal elements measuring 15 70 x 12 16 mm morchella is an edible fungus it has been described variously as one of tastiest members of morel family and alternately as bland in comparison to other morel species individual specimens over have been reported similar species morchella tridentina morchella frustrata is also and very similar to m rufobrunnea it is found in mountainous forests and maquis and forms a marked sinus at attachment of cap with stem which is pure white at maturity it develops more or less parallel interconnecting ridges microscopically it often has moniliform paraphyses with septa extending in upper half and has more regularly cylindrical or clavate hairs on stem up to 100 mm long m guatemalensis found in central america has a color ranging from yellow to yellowish orange but never grey and it has a more distinct reddish to wine red bruising reaction microscopically it has smaller paraphyses measuring 56 103 by 6 5 13 um new guinean species m has smaller fruit bodies that are pale ochre to yellow without any grey its pits are less elongated than those of m rufobrunnea and it has wider paraphyses up to 30 um morchella americana m is widely distributed in north america north of mexico and has similar colours to mature fruit bodies of m rufobrunnea but lacks bruising reaction m diminutiva found in hardwood forests of eastern north america has a smaller fruit body than m rufobrunnea up to tall and up to wide at its widest point morchella sceptriformis morchella virginiana is found in riparian and upland ecosystems from virginia to northern mississippi usually in association with american tulip tree liriodendron tulipifera habitat and distribution a predominantly saprophytic species morchella rufobrunnea fruit bodies grow singly or in clusters in disturbed soil or woodchips used in landscaping large numbers can appear year after wood mulch has been spread on ground typical disturbed habitats include fire pits near compost piles logging roads and dirt basements fruiting usually occurs in spring although fruit bodies can be found in these habitats most of year in cyprus fungus is frequently reported from coastal urban and suburban areas under olive trees olea europaea morchella rufobrunnea ranges from mexico through california and oregon in united states it has also been introduced to central michigan from california it is one of seven morchella species that have been recorded in mexico in 2009 israeli researchers used molecular genetics to confirm identity of species in northern israel where it was found growing in gravelly disturbed soil near a newly paved path at edge of a grove this was first documented appearance of fungus outside american continent unlike north american populations that typically fruit for only a few weeks in spring israeli populations have a long season ecotype fruiting from early november to late may winter and spring this period corresponds to rainy season in israel october to may with low to moderate temperatures ranging from during day and at night cultivation thumb right a collection of mature specimens from san francisco us morchella rufobrunnea is morel that is cultivated commercially per us patents and this process was developed in 1982 by ronald ower with what he thought was morchella esculenta m rufobrunnea had not yet been described cultivation protocol consists of preparing a spawn culture that is mixed with nutrient poor soil this mixture is laid on nutrient rich soil and kept sufficiently moist until fruiting in nutrient poor substrate fungus forms sclerotia hardened masses of mycelia that serve as food reserves under appropriate environmental conditions these sclerotia grow into morels fruit bodies of morchella rufobrunnea have been cultivated under controlled conditions in laboratory scale experiments primordia which are tiny nodules from which fruit bodies develop appeared two to four weeks after first watering of pre grown sclerotia incubated at a temperature of and 90 humidity mature fruit bodies grew to long early stages of fruit body development can be divided into four discrete stages in first disk shaped knots measuring appear on surface of substrate as knot expands in size a primordial stipe emerges from its center stipe lengthens orients upward and two types of hyphal elements develop long straight and smooth basal hairy hyphae and short stipe hyphae some of which are inflated and project out of a cohesive layer of tightly packed hyphal elements in final stage which occurs when stipe is long immature caps appear that have ridges and pits with distinct filament like paraphyses extracellular mucilage that covers ridge layer imparts shape and rigidity to tissue and probably protects it against dehydration references
