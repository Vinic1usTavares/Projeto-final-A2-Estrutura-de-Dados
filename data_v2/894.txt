background milian s self titled debut album was released worldwide in october 2001 however its domestic release was postponed because of september 11 attacks which occurred just two weeks before its release date her label opted to release it later that year in fourth quarter but as milian explained new artists generally do not release their albums during that time as a result album was again delayed until first quarter of 2002 after international release of her debut album milian went back into recording studio singer felt that music trends had changed into rock music hardcore hip hop and tribute songs and her music did not fall into those categories milian decided to stop recording and toured overseas for a year and a half when she returned to us she decided not to release her previous album domestically and started working on a new album production and composition milian traveled world to record album working with popular producers of time album featured production from bloodshy avant darkchild cory rooney warryn campbell bryan michael cox and poli paul basing her lyrics on past personal experiences milian wrote seven songs on album milian later explained that she wrote what she thought other people would like rather than writing for herself and what she liked when promoting album milian said that she was excited about album because she had matured since her last album and it was nice for people to see this change discussing change of genre between her lead singles milian said that first single off my last album am to pm was more of a kiddie kind of thing very pop dip it low is more r b kind of a club party kind of vibe an issue milian had with album was that it did not flow various pop and urban influences in that album she found confused audience for her next studio album milian said that she wanted a more consistent feel for dip it low s music video milian danced in a bed of black paint milian explained that body art was common in 1960s they would dip in paint and they would roll around on a canvas and make art on canvas so i kind of dip in paint and do same thing song s lyrics are about putting an effort into relationship as a female if you wanna be a little more sexy you gotta dip it low several years after release of it s about time milian admitted that her new image for dip it low and whole album was mainly for shock value she had to make her way back into us market and by choosing a sexier image she made a name for herself dip it low was also meant to show that she was not same eighteen year old girl in am to pm video to create her new image milian also decided to change her appearance and lightened her hair taking inspiration from janet jackson who constantly changed her image milian thought to herself when did i like janet jackson most it was when she had her lightened hair style and sound of album was compared to that of beyonce paula abdul and jennifer lopez by several critics as well as britney spears aaliyah and ashanti after several comparisons to beyonce knowles in regards to appearance milian said i think she is a lovely artist very talented but only reason i changed my color hair is because i was getting bored of my same old look and i wanted to do something different elysa gardner of usa today found that with milian s slight sweet vocals and blithe breezy pop soul sensibility genre of album was more pop than r b andy kellman of allmusic described dip it low as a clever and ubiquitous slice of high class raunch and compared album s sound to both beyonce s dangerously in love and jennifer lopez s this is me then eric r danton of milwaukee journal sentinel said dip it low had plinking of an unusual far eastern sounding stringed instrument and whatever u want rolls on a bass and drum combo danton found rest of album to be simply bland padding with plodding canned beats and half hearted hooks critical reception album received mixed reviews among critics jim farber of entertainment weekly felt that songs from it s about time sound like they fell off a paula abdul album farber criticized lyricists for writing so many cliches and said that milian s voice suggests a slightly more forceful version of janet jackson s pant farber gave album a d sal cinquemani of slant magazine said that while it s about time was certainly not worst album of year it was pretty damn crappy reviewer enjoyed whatever u want i m sorry and get loose which he said contribute some guilty pleasure ear candy eric danton of milwaukee journal sentinel found album suffers from same problem afflicting most major label albums dumped on market by an industry desperate for quick cash it s about time features one hit single a couple of lesser tracks and a lot of filler danton felt that only hit from it s about time was dip it low while whatever u want and l o v e were album s lesser tracks danton praised milian s vocal talent but said that ultimately lackluster material rarely gives her a chance to shine andy kellman of allmusic praised club tracks feeling that they work best and easily outrank slower songs kellman called dip it low biggest highlight of album but said that despite album s handful of bright spots milian will need to be more convincing during ballads next time out in order to be considered a true force kelefa sanneh of new york times said that although dip it low was one of summer s most popular songs album included an even better song i need more sanneh explained that milian breathes a serpentine melody over a beat that consists of jagged snippets some guitar chugging a few handclaps a couple of strategically placed beeps and in chorus an unexpected nose diving bass line contrary to views of other critics barry walters of rolling stone said that although ballads were gooey love songs work better than dance tracks etta james of people believed that milian struggled to find her own musical identity on fun but formulaic cd james praised sexy booty bumper dip it low for its reggae ish bass groove a hypnotic middle eastern refrain and called fabolous rap perfectly chilled reviewer thought highway album s most erotically charged track sounded like a female answer to r kelly s ignition while james found album s most personal song oh daddy to be unsuccessful she said that at least it gives us a glimpse into real christina commercial reception it s
