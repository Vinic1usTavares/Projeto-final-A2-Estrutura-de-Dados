jessica whitney dubroff may 5 1988 april 11 1996 was a seven year old pilot trainee who died while attempting to become youngest person to fly a light aircraft across united states on day two of her quest cessna 177b cardinal single engine aircraft piloted by her flight instructor crashed during a rainstorm immediately after takeoff from cheyenne regional airport in cheyenne wyoming killing dubroff her 57 year old father and her flight instructor dubroff was born in falmouth massachusetts to lisa blair hathaway and lloyd dubroff and moved to san francisco bay area in california when she was four although billed by media as a pilot she was not legally able to be a pilot because of her age dubroff did not possess a medical certificate or a student pilot certificate since they require a minimum age of 16 or a pilot certificate that requires a minimum age of 17 according to u s federal aviation administration faa regulations at time of her trip there was no record keeping body that recognized any feats by underage pilots nevertheless local national and international news media picked up and publicized her story and closely followed her attempt until its tragic ending u s national transportation safety board ntsb investigated crash and concluded that fatality was caused by pilot s improper decision to take off in poor weather conditions his overloading aircraft and his failure to maintain airspeed three factors resulted in a stall and subsequent fatal crash in a residential neighborhood ntsb also determined that contributing to instructor s decision to take off was a desire to adhere to an overly ambitious itinerary in part because of media commitments sea to shining sea flight thumb right this short video shows 7 year old pilot participating in pre flight preparations for a single engine cessna 177b video also shows rain and cloud cover take off and post crash wreckage in a residential neighborhood thumb right cessna 177b cardinal similar to ill fated aircraft dubroff began taking flight lessons from flight instructor joe reid on her sixth birthday and became enthusiastic about flying her father suggested idea of a coast to coast flight which dubroff readily accepted and reid agreed to provide flight instruction and his aircraft for endeavor they decided to name their flight sea to shining sea lloyd ordered custom made caps and t shirts with that logo to distribute as souvenirs during their stops although she had received over 33 hours of flight training seven year old dubroff did not hold an faa medical certificate nor any pilot or student certificate in u s a person must be at least 16 years of age to be eligible for a student pilot certificate and 17 for a pilot certificate since dubroff was not certified to fly plane a rated pilot normally her flight instructor reid had to be at controls during all flight operations while coast to coast flight was promoted as a record attempt because of dubroff s young age there was no known body recognizing record flights by underage pilots at time of her flight guinness book of records had officially discontinued its youngest pilot categories seven years earlier because of risk of accidents thumb left dual yoke flight control arrangement similar to reid s aircraft in a single engine cessna flight would be made in reid s cessna 177b cardinal a four seat single engine propeller aircraft manufactured in 1975 registered which like most aircraft had dual flight controls in front dubroff would sit in front left seat reid in front right and lloyd in back it was agreed that reid would be paid for his services at normal flight instruction rates plus compensation for layover time reid reportedly told his wife that he considered flight a non event for aviation simply flying cross country with a 7 year old sitting next to you and parents paying for it nevertheless dubroff became an instant media celebrity abc news gave lloyd a video camera and blank cassettes to tape flight once journey began it was vigorously followed by supporters media outlets and others who monitored its progress reporting each time dubroff landed or took off dubroff slept during one of flight segments en route to cheyenne and was assisted by reid in one of landings due to high winds final flight segment after a long day of flying from their half moon bay california departure point dubroff her father and her flight instructor arrived in cheyenne evening before their ill fated flight they were welcomed in wyoming s capital city by mayor leo pando http com 20 years ago cheyenne plane crash kills 7 year old pilot jessica dubroff after some media interviews they got a ride to their hotel in car of a local radio station program director who recalled them discussing forecast weather conditions for next day thumb right composite radar image showing precipitation intensity around cheyenne airport at time of accident red is most intense as forecast weather on morning of scheduled flight consisted of an area of heavy precipitation over and to north and west of cheyenne with better conditions to east where flight was headed as group was about to board their aircraft program director who had taken them to their hotel previous evening interviewed dubroff by telephone when rain began to fall at airport and weather seemed to be deteriorating director invited her to stay in cheyenne but dubroff s father declined explaining that they wanted to beat storm that was approaching after a telephone discussion with a casper weather briefer reid decided to take off despite worsening conditions at airport and to try to escape poor weather by turning immediately eastward he decided to file a visual flight rules vfr flight plan and depart under vfr to be better able to cope with heavy weather in his immediate takeoff path and vicinity of airport as aircraft began taxiing to departure runway rain intensified and visibility at airport fell below three mile minimum required for vfr flight cheyenne s control tower advised cessna about reduced visibility and that field is ifr in general when an airport is officially ifr normally because of reduced visibility or low cloud ceiling only ifr or special vfr operations are allowed reid then requested and received from control tower a special vfr clearance to allow him to exit airport s control zone visually despite reduced visibility crash at 8 24 a m mdt reid s aircraft began its takeoff from runway 30 to northwest in rain strong gusty crosswinds and turbulence according to witnesses plane lifted off and climbed slowly with its nose high and its wings wobbling it began a gradual right turn and after reaching an altitude of a few hundred feet plane rolled out of its turn then descended rapidly crashing at a near vertical angle into court a street in a residential neighborhood dubroff her father and reid were killed instantly by blunt force trauma sustained from impact forces reid who was legally pilot in command for all of dubroff s flights was allegedly manipulating controls during this particular flight segment investigation thumb right planned sea to shining sea route map red shows legs flown blue circle marks accident site national transportation safety board investigated accident and published a detailed final report eleven months later on march 11 1997 from official point of view pilot in command was flight instructor reid who was only one on board rated to fly aircraft investigation focused on his decision making prior to takeoff and his actions once airborne several experienced pilots who were at airport at time of accident testified that they considered weather at that time unsuitable for flight as a thunderstorm seemed to be forming or moving over airfield in addition investigators determined that weight of aircraft during its takeoff roll exceeded its maximum allowable takeoff weight by 96 lbs which would have increased stall speed by about two percent since aircraft was flying in moderate to heavy rain ntsb calculated that water flowing on wings would have further increased stall speed by about 1 5 a higher stall speed reduces margin of safety at slower airspeeds such as during a climb like most flight instructors giving dual instruction reid was seated on right side while aircraft s primary flight instruments were mounted on left in front of dubroff in this case investigators speculated that because of heavy rain in his immediate climb path reid s forward visibility became greatly restricted to maintain control through climbing right turn he would have had to turn his head to left to see flight instruments most critically attitude and airspeed indicators and to right to see ground through side window such side to side head motion combined with worsening flight visibility during climb and reduced stall margin could have led to spatial disorientation and loss of control probable cause ntsb concluded that probable cause of accident was reid s improper decision to take off into deteriorating weather conditions including turbulence gusty winds and an advancing thunderstorm and associated precipitation when airplane was overweight and when density altitude was higher than he was accustomed to resulting in a stall caused by failure to maintain airspeed ntsb further determined that contributing to pilot in command s decision to take off was a desire to adhere to an overly ambitious itinerary in part because of media commitments aftermath child pilot safety act accident and its associated publicity led to federal legislation to prevent similar record attempts by underage pilots from taking place in future legislation passed house on september 11 1996 and senate on september 18 1996 on september 27 1996 differences between house and senate versions of bill were resolved on october 9 1996 president bill clinton signed federal aviation reauthorization act of 1996 including child pilot safety act into law statute prohibits anyone who does not hold at least a private pilot certificate and a current medical certificate from manipulating controls of an aircraft if that individual is attempting to set a record or engage in an aeronautical competition or aeronautical feat since a medical certificate and a private pilot s license have a minimum age requirement of 16 and 17 respectively new rule prohibits child pilots such as dubroff and vicki van meter from manipulating flight controls if they are pursuing a record and pilot in command s pilot certificate may be revoked for allowing such activity media responsibility thumb right ted koppel said media s ravenous attention contributed to tragedy after crash there were claims that media frenzy around bogus record attempt contributed to accident by helping promote flight and pressuring its schedule this was supported by ntsb which determined that pressure induced by intense media attention was a contributing factor in accident abc s ted koppel reflected on media s role in tragedy on nightline we need to begin by acknowledging our own contribution we feed one another those of you looking for publicity and those of us looking for stories koppel ended by asking whether we in media by our ravenous attention contribute to this phenomenon and answered we did time featured dubroff s portrait on its front cover in which she is seen wearing a gray cap with inscription women fly headline reads who killed jessica child pilot was also featured on cover of people civil litigation lloyd dubroff was lisa blair hathaway s common law husband when dubroff and her brother were born in 1990 he separated from hathaway and in 1991 he was 52 years old when he married 19 year old melinda anne hurst with whom he had a child following year

separate life insurance policies each for 750 000 two of policies named hathaway as beneficiary and two named melinda hurst so that each was to receive 1 5 million in event of his death ensuring adequate child support for his underage children living with two women his grown son and daughter both in their 30s from a previous marriage were not addressed by these policies after crash melinda hurst sued hathaway for hathaway s 1 5 million hurst s attorney roy litherland said in a san mateo county court that 1 5 million hathaway was designated was in excess of any reasonable level of child support in december 1996 lisa hathaway filed a counter suit against melinda hurst and lloyd dubroff s estate for 1 5 million exact amount of money lloyd dubroff intended saying lloyd dubroff gave his word he would care for and support her for rest and remainder of her natural life on december 18 1997 san mateo county superior court judge judith ruled that 3 million insurance benefits should be
