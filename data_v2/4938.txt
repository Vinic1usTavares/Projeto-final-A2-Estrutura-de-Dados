battle of pakchon 5 november 1950 also known as battle of took place ten days after start of chinese first phase offensive following entry of chinese people s volunteer army pva into korean war offensive reversed united nations command un advance towards yalu river which had occurred after their intervention in wake of north korean invasion of south korea at start of war battle was fought between british and australian forces from 27th british commonwealth brigade with american armour and artillery in support and pva 117th division of 39th army around village of pakchon on taeryong river after capturing chongju on 30 october british and australians had been ordered to pull back to pakchon in an attempt to consolidate western flank of us eighth army meanwhile immediately following their success at unsan against americans pva 117th division had attacked southward intending to cut off un forces as they withdrew in face of unexpected pva assault to halt pva advance 27th british commonwealth brigade was ordered to defend lower crossings of taeryong and chongchon rivers as part of a rearguard in conjunction with us 24th infantry division further upstream on right during night of 4 5 november pva and korean people s army kpa mounted a full scale assault on us 24th infantry division pushing back an american infantry regiment nearly pva kpa force subsequently turned west advancing between taeryong and chongchon rivers and threatening rear of 27th british commonwealth brigade by cutting pakchon sinanju road following day they attacked an american artillery battery which was guarding a vital concrete bridge near kujin british and australians then successfully counter attacked pva forces occupying a number of nearby ridgelines during day but were in turn counter attacked before being pushed off high ground during night in their first battle with pva 3rd battalion royal australian regiment 3 rar captured a well defended hill with only limited offensive support and held it in face of heavy counter attacks before confused command decisions resulted in a disorganised night withdrawal while still in contact withdrawal threatened to open 27th british commonwealth brigade s left flank and australians were ordered to immediately reposition on ridge yet ultimately it was too late to regain feature in darkness however following heavy fighting pressure on australians unexpectedly ceased after midnight and parties of pva were observed beginning to withdraw by early morning pva attack had been checked and 3 rar had redeployed to new positions in paddy fields around railway crossing north of maenjung dong fighting was costly for both sides although australians halted advancing pva 117th division and inflicted numerous casualties on them they also suffered heavy losses in aftermath inexperienced australian battalion commander lieutenant colonel floyd walsh was relieved of his position by british brigade commander having taken over just six days earlier following death of previous commanding officer lieutenant colonel charles green at chongju nonetheless 27th british commonwealth brigade succeeded in preventing a pva break through at pakchon keeping open vital withdrawal routes across river and securing un left flank suffering significant casualties pva offensive was halted next day due to logistic difficulties pva and kpa were temporarily forced to withdraw north while un successfully reinforced its positions holding on chongchon line yet by late november us eighth army was again forced to withdraw after pva began their second phase offensive starting a long retreat south un forces withdrew from north korea to 38th parallel where they sought to re establish defensive positions background military situation korean war began early in morning of 25 june 1950 following surprise invasion of republic of korea by its northern neighbour communist democratic people s republic of korea dprk numerically superior and better equipped kpa crossed 38th parallel and rapidly advanced south easily overcoming inferior republic of korea army rok in response united nations decided to intervene on behalf of south korea inviting member states to send forces to restore situation as a consequence american ground forces were hastily deployed in an attempt to prevent south koreans from collapsing however they too were under strength and poorly equipped and by early august had been forced back by kpa to an enclave around pusan known as pusan perimeter key us allies britain canada and australia also committed forces although these were initially limited to naval contingents and were largely viewed as token efforts in us under diplomatic pressure british agreed to deploy an infantry brigade in july and would later dispatch a second brigade as crisis worsened canadians also agreed to provide an infantry brigade although first battalion would not arrive until december 1950 a total of 21 un member states eventually contributed forces thumb left alt a map showing a peninsula with us forces moving from south to north map of un advance toward yalu river 1950 australia was one of first nations to commit

occupation force bcof formed basis of australian response with p 51 mustang fighter bombers from no 77 squadron raaf flying their first missions on 2 july while frigate and destroyer were also committed to naval operations during this time 3rd battalion royal australian regiment 3 rar which had been preparing to return to australia prior to outbreak of war remained in japan however on 26 july australian government announced that it would also commit under strength and poorly equipped infantry battalion to fighting following a period of preparation training and re equipment began immediately while hundreds of reinforcements were hastily recruited in australia as part of k force they soon began arriving to fill out battalion battalion s commanding officer lieutenant colonel floyd walsh was replaced by lieutenant colonel charles green an officer with extensive operational experience fighting japanese in new guinea during second world war green took over from walsh due to latter s perceived inexperience on 23 september 1950 3 rar embarked for korea concentrating at pusan on 28 september there it joined british 27th infantry brigade a garrison formation hurriedly committed from hong kong by british as situation deteriorated around pusan perimeter in late august to bolster us eighth army under lieutenant general walton walker commanded by brigadier basil coad brigade was renamed 27th british commonwealth brigade and consisted of 1st battalion argyll and sutherland highland regiment 1 ashr 1st battalion middlesex regiment 1 mr and 3 rar under strength two british battalions had each mustered just 600 men of all ranks while brigade was also short on transport and heavy equipment and had no integral artillery support for which it would rely entirely on americans until 16th field regiment royal new zealand artillery arrived in january 1951 as such with a strength of nearly 1 000 men addition of 3 rar gave brigade increased tactical weight as well as expediently allowing australians to work within a familiar organisational environment rather than being attached to a us formation by time 3 rar arrived in theatre kpa had been broken and were in rapid retreat with macarthur s forces conducting a successful amphibious assault at inchon and breakout from pusan perimeter on southern tip of korean peninsula a steady advance began driving north koreans northwards towards 38th parallel 27th british commonwealth brigade was attached to us 1st cavalry division under command of major general hobart r gay on 16 october brigade took over as vanguard of un advance into north korea although kpa had suffered heavily in preceding weeks they continued to resist strongly 27th british commonwealth brigade moved from kumchon with argylls capturing sariwon on 17 october killing 215 kpa and taking many prisoners for loss of one man killed and three wounded british and australians then passed to command of us 24th infantry division on 21 october under overall command of major general john h church while us 1st cavalry division remained in pyongyang to complete its capture brigade was ordered to seize chongju advance continued north with little respite and on 22 october australians fought their first major action at yongju killing 150 kpa and capturing 239 of brigade s 800 prisoners for loss of seven men wounded intending to defeat kpa and bring war to a close un forces pushed towards yalu river on chinese border brigade crossed chongchon river moving towards pakchon on 24 october macarthur had removed all restrictions on movement of his forces south of yalu river and prepared for final phase of advance defying a directive of us joint chiefs of staff and risking chinese intervention in support of north korea on 25 october 3 rar crossed taeryong river kpa attacked forward australian companies at kujin early following morning resulting in australian losses of eight killed and 22 wounded however kpa suffered heavy casualties including over 100 killed and 350 captured and australians succeeded in defending bridgehead after kpa withdrew intelligence indicated that british and australians were facing kpa 17th tank brigade which was preparing a last line of defence at chongju away with war considered all but over 27th british commonwealth brigade continued to pursue kpa towards chongju however advance increasingly encountered strong resistance as they approached manchurian border from 29 30 october 3 rar fought battle of chongju kpa casualties included 162 killed and 10 captured while australian losses were nine killed and 30 wounded including green who died of wounds on 1 november prelude opposing forces thumb 260px right alt a long orderly line of heavily laden soldiers marching in pairs

encountering only one strong kpa position which they quickly turned by noon on 1 november lead battalion had reached chonggodong just from yalu river where americans clashed with another kpa armoured force to north meanwhile us 5th and 9th infantry regiments of us 24th infantry division secured taechon and kusong before advancing to within of manchurian border however during last weeks of october chinese had moved 18 pva divisions across yalu river under overall command of marshal peng dehuai in order to reinforce remnants of kpa undetected by us and south korean intelligence pva 13th army group crossed border on 16 october and penetrated up to into north korea and were reinforced in early november by 12 divisions from pva 9th army group in total 30 divisions composed of 380 000 men pva ambushed macarthur s forces which were now widely dispersed decimating rok ii corps at onjong and encircling and overrunning us 8th cavalry regiment at unsan with us 24th infantry division ordered back to chongchon river as a result 27th british commonwealth brigade also began moving south ultimately chongju was furthest north that 27th british commonwealth brigade was to penetrate and on 1 november while still in divisional reserve brigade was ordered to pull back to pakchon in an attempt to consolidate western flank immediately following their success at unsan pva 117th division under overall command of zhang attacked southward intending to cut off retreating un forces and in so doing eliminate remnants of rok 1st infantry division and us 1st cavalry division by cutting road junction at pakchon meanwhile pva 38th and 40th armies approached along chongchon river from east 3 rar remained at chongju however due to a lack of transport while remainder of brigade moved south now most forward element on us eighth army s left flank battalion soon became isolated without communications or armour and artillery support finally on 2 november us army trucks became available and battalion completed its move south without incident harbouring in bed of taeryong river that evening meanwhile it was announced that green would be temporarily replaced by walsh who he had himself replaced in japan several months before walsh by then an observer at us eighth army headquarters was urgently posted back to 3 rar to resume command despite his lack of operational experience as an infantry commander taking over amid difficult circumstances following green s death and with little time to become acquainted with battalion walsh s inexperience soon told as local situation deteriorated in order to capture enemies at yongsan dong and yongbyong you must infiltrate boldly cutting yongsan dong pakchon and yongbyong anju roads prevent enemies from escaping and surround enemies peng dehuai s order to chinese 39th army walker elected to stand north of chongchon and taeryong rivers in response to pva offensive and following day coad received new orders to hold left forward section of bridgehead over chongchon to halt pva advance 27th british commonwealth brigade was ordered to defend lower crossings of taeryong and chongchon rivers as part of a rearguard in conjunction with us 24th infantry division further upstream on right brigade concentrated in pakchon area middlesex occupied town and high ground to north and east while 3 rar and argylls held positions covering western approaches to taeryong with latter designated as brigade reserve yet information available to british and australians suggested that pva would likely attack from an easterly direction and dispositions adopted by coad were later criticised for failing to take this into account 3 rar took up a defensive position west of village where it remained for next two days meanwhile b and c companies of argylls formed a bridgehead over taeryong around far side of partially destroyed bridge near kujin while a company occupied positions astride road to south to right us 24th infantry division covered crossing over chongchon at anju while rok ii corps held positions further east forced to defend on a wide frontage un positions were weakened by a gap between 27th british

bridgehead 3 6 november 1950 during night of 4 5 november 1950 pva and kpa mounted a full scale assault on us 24th infantry division before dawn 19 rct had become heavily engaged and was pushed back nearly pva force turned west to advance between taeryong and chongchon rivers threatening rear of 27th british commonwealth brigade by cutting pakchon sinanju road previous afternoon a patrol from middlesex had clashed with a large pva patrol to north east and suffered a number of casualties yet main pva attack did not come until early next morning meanwhile large numbers of refugees continued to move south causing british and australians further concern given possibility that they might be used by pva to cover infiltration of their positions at 08 00 on 5 november a group of around 200 pva attacked c battery us 61st field artillery battalion which was attached to 27th british commonwealth brigade american guns had been supporting brigade from a position beside road about south of pakchon and were protecting vital concrete bridge south of argyll s battalion headquarters at kujin pva established a number of roadblocks in area before proceeding to assault american gun line and nearby bridge attack cut road to anju which was 27th british commonwealth brigade s single means of resupply or withdrawal and exposed only available crossing over chongchon river coad considered that unless pva could be cleared from gun position and hills secured brigade was in danger of being surrounded and cut off and crossing at anju lost while us 19 rct would also be threatened under command of lieutenant colonel george neilson argylls were despatched to restore situation b and c companies would be drawn back from west bank of to reinforce a company and then attack south one after other supported by american tanks at same time a company under major alexander wilson was ordered to immediately attack north to clear road hasty control measures were put in place to avoid possibility of two forces accidentally engaging one another while air support was requested at 08 40 after commandeering two american trucks wilson s men stepped off with four us m4 sherman tanks in support meanwhile to north under command of captain howard m moore c battery us 61st field artillery formed its six 105 mm m2a1 howitzers into a semi circle and created a perimeter around them strongly defending their positions with automatic weapons from behind their gun shields assaulting from east pva attempted to infiltrate gun line using a number of creek beds and paddy bunds for concealment one of american howitzers was depressed and brought into action firing over open sights at point blank range bouncing shells off frozen paddy fields which then exploded among assaulting troops a second howitzer was turned around 45 minutes later augmenting fire of first americans expended 1 400 rounds at a range of between however weight of fire was insufficient to halt assaulting force supporting fire from a nearby battery was directed by a spotter aircraft overhead and this temporarily stemmed pva onslaught running low on small arms ammunition and having lost one howitzer destroyed as well as two men killed and seventeen wounded americans faced prospect of being overrun gunners killed a member of a pva demolition team just from bridge finally after crossing taeryong in single file under fire b and c companies of argylls began to systematically clear road supported by machine gun fire from middlesex while a company also continued to advance at 09 00 lead tanks and infantry of relief force arrived closely followed by remainder of a company argylls rapidly cleared gun position and pva withdrew north along railway to a nearby hill while american tanks continued to engage them over 70 pva dead were found in vicinity of gun line however from their new position pva continued to dominate road in order to open road argylls moved to clear pva off high ground located east of road hill about high offered clear fields of fire to west over paddy fields to taeryong river and dominated pakchon sinanju road running beside river supported by four sherman tanks machine guns and mortars a company captured hill at 10 00 wilson occupied summit with a reinforced platoon before withdrawing remainder of company to road where 3 inch mortar and vickers medium machine gun sections were established meanwhile b company under command of major alastair gordon ingram attacked second pva roadblock again supported by a number of american tanks back in action guns from c battery also fired in support of british infantry and after a vigorous engagement in which gordon ingram was wounded pva were compelled to withdraw leaving many of their dead on road a number were later found to have been carrying demolition charges presumably for use against bridge at anju with survivors of battle seen moving into hills neilson then ordered b and c companies to establish positions on eastern flank in order to protect road although pva had been cleared from gun line and hills around pakchon further attacks to south continued to threaten 27th british commonwealth brigade s position which remained perilous fighting continued and at 11 00 pva mounted a heavy counter attack on a company outpost wounding six men argylls were then forced to withdraw from high ground under cover of sustained fire from two vickers machine guns sited on road and became pinned down on reverse slope throughout morning a united states air force usaf lt 6g mosquito light observation aircraft had continued to monitor growing concentrations of pva in hills to rear of 27th british commonwealth brigade with reports indicating their strength at approximately one division determining that pva would move to cut road during night and believing it dangerous to remain any further forward than required coad requested approval for a limited withdrawal he decided to pull his forward units back across taeryong river before moving south towards chongchon river near anju brigade counter attacked pva forces occupying nearby ridgelines in order to clear route south plan envisioned argylls holding road open while 3 rar recaptured high ground previously held by a company 1 ashr middlesex would then pass through to clear and occupy hills east of dong while argylls as brigade rearguard would follow to occupy right of new defensive position brigade would then adopt a tight defensive perimeter on hills overlooking north bank so as to maintain bridgehead over river meanwhile still in position west of pakchon australians prepared to cross taeryong river to regain lost position to their south 3 rar faced a difficult approach after moving beyond river with battalion s route paralleling disputed ridge which overlooked it to east 3 rar assaults ridgeline 5 november 1950 australians crossed taeryong at 11 30 and began preparations to assault pva positions on ridgeline east of road to pakchon and north of maenjung dong in support were four p 51 mustang fighter bombers from no 77 squadron raaf which attacked pva with rockets and machine gun fire one of only a few occasions during war when australian aircraft operated in support of 3 rar there were three main crests on ridge running south east first being nearest road second just to its rear and third further back still with pva occupying first two although argylls had occupied ridgeline briefly during morning they had been pushed off by pva mortar fire fell on 3 rar while it was forming up however using road as a start line battalion attack began at 14 00 with a company on left flank and b company on right each with two platoons forward and one back in reserve each in extended line with bayonets fixed a company was commanded by captain bill chitts while b company was led by captain d arcy laughlin after major george thirlwell had broken his leg in a vehicle accident two days before mortar platoon was sited with battalion headquarters alongside road with two sections of vickers machine guns and two 17 pounder anti tank guns from anti tank platoon assault pioneer platoon provided local defence while mortars laid down a continuous barrage in an attempt to counter pva mortar fire in conjunction with machine guns and tanks which began to engage hilltop thumb left australian mortar crew in action at pakchon 5 november 1950 beginning their advance australians began to suffer casualties yet they were initially unable to confirm location of pva however as they commenced their ascent they were met by heavy small arms fire from higher ground to south and east after a long approach across of open paddy field a company relieved beleaguered argylls pva then forced two australian companies to fight hard in order to gain crest lacking artillery support australians instead relied on battalion s integral support weapons with 3 inch mortars and medium machine guns in support as well as four sherman tanks which provided fire support from a stand off position near road with a and b companies heavily engaged walsh moved d company under command of major walter brown to attack hill to south to reinforce right flank a company succeeded in establishing itself on first crest forcing pva from position while supporting fire from their bren light machine guns and vickers medium machine guns allowed b company to move up on their right and capture second crest finally at 16 00 after two hours of heavy fighting australians had achieved their objectives against a determined defence a and b company prepared for a counter attack by pva meanwhile c company under captain archer denness had remained in reserve on road with battalion headquarters and support company although orders for attack had been hurried and lacking in detail and strength of defenders unknown assaulting force had prevailed securing ridge with only limited offensive support during fighting one of b company platoon commanders lieutenant eric larsen who had only week before led crossing at kujin was killed one of section commanders corporal jeff jones immediately took command of 5 platoon assault moving from section to section across steep slope to direct their fire even while under heavy pva mortar and machine gun fire he was awarded us silver star for his actions successful assault opened road south enabling middlesex battalion brigade headquarters and a number of supporting units to withdraw down road through australians followed by argylls 3 rar remained behind as a rearguard while british battalions took up new positions covering chongchon river crossing at anju pva mortars and machine gun fire continued to fall on 3 rar and at 17 00 a round destroyed a company headquarters killing two men and wounding four others including chitts who was evacuated by stretcher coad ordered 3 rar to consolidate its positions and to secure railway bridge however with all his companies committed there were no troops available for latter task and walsh chose to ignore order meanwhile middlesex occupied a hill north east of maenjung dong which was found to be clear except for one minor feature occupied by pva while argylls moved south with a platoon of tanks and positioned themselves on a small group of hills east of maenjung dong from here brigade was able to dominate pakchon maenjung dong anju road meanwhile as light began to fade administrative elements of formation and us 61st field artillery battalion were moved south of chongchon river amid a bitter wind british and australians stood to from dusk until nightfall and after posting sentries remainder of brigade began their night routine walsh withdraws from high ground 5 6 november 1950 an hour after last light on 5 november pva attacked c company 3 rar forward australian company occupying positions astride pakchon road north of maenjung dong with mortars and machine guns meanwhile machine gun fire also fell on support company and battalion headquarters to south walsh decided to relocate his headquarters further to rear pva infantry launched a strong attack against c company assaulting them across paddy fields in darkness while simultaneously also falling upon a and b companies holding hills they had captured during afternoon in face of heavy pva counter attack walsh feared loss of his entire force and at 20 00 he ordered a general withdrawal pulling them back off ridgeline in order to concentrate battalion on road without informing coad ordered in dark and with one company still under attack a disorganised night withdrawal occurred decision proved to be a serious tactical error for as was to be demonstrated often in months that followed pva were skilled at moving across hills to outflank road bound un forces who often failed to hold ridges on either side of roads only to be confronted by strong concentrations in front and behind them as a result withdrawal threatened to open 27th british commonwealth brigade s left flank recognising danger this posed coad ordered walsh to immediately reposition his companies on ridge ultimately this proved unachievable a company now under lieutenant lawrence clark following chitts wounding that afternoon had only just succeeded in breaking contact from pva suffering a number killed and wounded during a confused withdrawal meanwhile b company had also been forced to fight its way down hill both companies were now well clear of their former positions and would have had a hard time fighting their way back ultimately it was too late for australians to regain feature in darkness and weight of pva attack continued to mount only d company on southern right flank which had been left unmolested was able to regain its previous position on hill 63 meanwhile positions previously occupied by a and b companies were occupied by pva in superior numbers and remainder of 3 rar concentrated at railway crossing instead at 22 00 coad arranged to shell and mortar relinquished ridge while a standing patrol from middlesex was posted on south western side of maenjung dong pass in anticipation of a renewed pva attack however following heavy fighting pressure on australians unexpectedly ceased after midnight and parties of pva were observed beginning to withdraw by 02 00 pva attack had been checked and 3 rar had redeployed to new positions in paddy fields around railway crossing north of maenjung dong however amid confusion exact dispositions of companies remained unclear for remainder of night australian losses were 12 killed and 64 wounded same number as those suffered during their entire advance into north korea a number of officers of battalion were later critical of decision to withdraw while still engaged believing that it had been both dangerous and unnecessary while lack of detailed planning reconnaissance and orders were also seen as a factor in disorganisation that ensued while a company had immediately withdrawn as ordered and had suffered a number of casualties in doing so both b and d companies which were commanded by experienced veterans of 2nd australian imperial force had delayed doing so until more favourable circumstances prevailed and fared better as a consequence yet following morning a patrol from d company cleared abandoned a and b company positions unopposed area was found littered with pva dead and equipment among casualties were both pva and kpa and it became clear that australians had been attacked by a mixed force estimated at around 1 500 men many of those killed were also found to have been carrying demolition charges thumb right ferguson shortly after taking command of 3 rar 7 november 1950 despite events of previous night australians still held road while d company continued to occupy former pva strongpoint on hill 63 even if it was isolated from rest of battalion yet b and c companies were now precariously positioned in paddy field to east and west of road respectively and come daylight were exposed to pva positions on high ground same day coad visited 3 rar dissatisfied with battalion s dispositions and having now lost confidence in its commander he relieved walsh of his position appointing second in command major bruce ferguson in his place walsh returned to his posting at us eighth army headquarters ferguson came forward to take command of battalion ordering 3 rar to dig in he despatched a number of clearing patrols while c company advanced unopposed to a hill overlooking road north east of d company reaching top australians observed pva withdrawing northwards up valley further east pva attacked us 19 rct however by afternoon of 6 november it became apparent that pva withdrawal around pakchon was part of a general disengagement aftermath casualties after 27th british commonwealth brigade s initial success they had in turn been counter attacked by pva before being pushed off high ground during night during action brigade lost 12 killed and 70 wounded majority of them among australians pva losses were not known with many of their dead removed from battlefield but according to commander wu of pva 39th army an infantry company from pva 350th regiment of 117th division was badly mauled by 27th british commonwealth brigade during engagement australian forces later estimated that pva had suffered 200 killed and another 200 wounded in their first battle with pva 3 rar had successfully captured a well defended hill with only limited offensive support and had held it face of heavy counter attacks before confused command decisions resulted in battalion conducting a disorganised night withdrawal while still in contact fighting was costly for both sides and although australians had halted advancing pva 117th division and inflicted numerous casualties on them they had also lost heavily nonetheless 27th british commonwealth brigade had succeeding in preventing a pva break through at pakchon keeping open vital withdrawal routes across river and securing un left flank suffering significant casualties pva offensive was finally halted next day due to logistic difficulties royal australian regiment and argyll and sutherland highlanders were later granted battle honour pakchon pva and kpa were temporarily forced to withdraw north while walker successfully reinforced un positions holding on chongchon line pva had failed to exploit their initial success and instead now seemed to adopt a deliberately cautious strategy subsequent operations on 7 november us 24th infantry division and 27th british commonwealth brigade followed up pva withdrawal with a limited probing advance that morning australian clearing patrols killed seven pva soldiers before 3 rar prepared to advance with remainder of brigade c company occupied hill 74 to north east without opposition only to discover a kpa company on reverse slope australians engaged kpa with machine gun fire inflicting heavy losses on defenders and capturing five before forcing them to withdraw towards tang dong harried by artillery and airstrikes remainder of battalion deployed on right while argylls occupied two hills further north brigade s advance had forestalled a planned kpa attack on night of 7 8 november while large numbers of pva dead from previous fighting were also discovered on 9 november advance wheeled to north west around pakchon with 3 rar moving forward another to east encountering little resistance and taking a number of prisoners in process from 11 november 27th british commonwealth brigade advanced slowly north on 16 november 3 rar occupied hill 117 on a bend in taeryong river north of pakchon over following weeks they remained in pakchon area conducting extensive patrolling up to company size and clashing with small groups of pva kpa as winter approached weather became bitterly cold amid snow and strong winds unprepared for extreme conditions australians increasingly suffered health problems particularly among older members of battalion lacking training and equipment for operations in ice and snow maintenance also proved burdensome before additional us cold weather clothing and equipment was issued

ferguson ultimately proved to be an able commander he remained with battalion after that time change of command was confirmed by commander in chief bcof lieutenant general sir horace robertson and ferguson was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 10 november he developed a good working relationship with coad who held him in high regard and went on to command 3 rar during its most demanding period in korea un resumed offensive on 24 november shortly before pva began their own second phase offensive pva 13th army group launched a series of surprise attacks on night of 25 november pushing us eighth army back to chongchon river pva inflicted heavy losses on rok and decimated us 2nd infantry division on right flank as us eighth army began a long retreat south at same time pva 9th army group ambushed us x corps near chosin reservoir as freezing winter weather set in although us eighth army succeeded in avoiding encirclement us x corps had to be evacuated by sea from hungnam during december 1950 macarthur s forces were expelled from north korea and withdrew to 38th parallel where they sought to once again establish defensive positions in reserve at start of renewed pva offensive 27th british commonwealth brigade was spared initial brunt yet offensive soon forced un forces into a disorganised withdrawal 3 rar withdrew in nine days arriving at uijeongbu north east of seoul on
