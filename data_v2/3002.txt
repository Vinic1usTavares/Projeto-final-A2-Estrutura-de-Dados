book adaption was drafted by neal barrett jr with art by denys cowan novel was published by warner aspect imprint of warner books and promoted by vachss with a book tour and as a guest at 1995 san diego comic con vachss used promotion of book to also raise awareness of child abuse and advocate a boycott of manufactured goods from thailand he declared that three years from now if there isn t a boycott of thailand then this book is a cosmic failure vachss supported don t buy thai which believed that if thailand sells its children for money then only thing that will stop them is loss of money style and themes publishers required that vachss follow certain rules including prohibiting batman character from killing cursing or having sex and keeping a clear distinction between fiction and reality for example while vachss wanted to write about thailand he created a fictional country named udon khai which had many similarities with thailand though udon khai is described as being dominated by a lone kingpin who controls country s one industry economy based on sex tourism while thailand s tourism economy which includes sex tourism is part of an economic development strategy enabled by international development agencies vachss deviated from batman canon by having wayne family butler alfred pennyworth reveal to bruce wayne that his mother martha was a sociologist who was secretly investigating a child pornography ring in vachss novel were not victims of a random crime instead martha was targeted for assassination one reviewer compared characterization of batman as same brooding handsome rich character that val kilmer played in batman forever but with gothic presence of older batman seen in 1940s movie serials more complex analysis compared story to an 18th century contes in which dark irrationality of greek gods has been flattened out into tidy didactic instruction vachss said writing is my way of preaching for me it s always always message plot is something i contrive to deliver message you ve got to have enough narrative force to get people to finish book but if you can give them an exciting story you can always make your points he stated that whole point of book is to raise awareness about kiddie sex tourism business in thailand though story uses more realism than escapism typically associated with superhero fiction vachss did end book with endorsements of two real non profit groups don t buy thai and end child prostitution in asian tourism writing is not subtle as vachss noted if you don t get angry you re not going to do anything understanding that likely readers were young males with short attention spans vachss tried to be dramatic by using what author adam begley calls a motivational hat trick sympathy for victims revenge and a family calling a major theme in book is characterization of child abuse story follows bruce wayne as he learns about different categories of child abuse from ignorant to incapable to those who do it for pleasure batman whose motivation is to prevent crimes like murder of his parents is contrasted against a social worker whose motivation is protecting children batman realizes that throughout his career he had been fighting criminals not crime vachss asserts that child protection and crime prevention are same thing he believes that child abuse is never just a random crime but is done with intent while vachss warns that those abused can become future abusers he also states that abuse can push two similarly maltreated children in opposite directions one incest victim becomes a promiscuous adult another never engages in sex again if you excuse a serial killer because he was tortured as a child you disrespect thousands of children who were treated worse and never imitated their oppressor reception book was described as a slim vivid novel with a very simple and fast paced plot line a review in washington times was positive with a plot that takes batman very seriously and makes him very human and a dismaying amount of information on sexual exploitation of children for profit this novel makes an impression likewise another reviewer found it an engaging and disturbing one night read that s all more astonishing because vachss manages to explore and make his points about a wholly depressing topic without driving your moods into sewer roger catlin in hartford courant said vachss bold simple prose is well suited to his story he s good at making batman s various devices batmobile computers flying gizmos come to life with his cool description a review in new york times noted that basic premise is a good idea but studded as it is with undigested chunks of scientific jargon sociology speak and polemical rhetoric batman ultimate evil misses out almost completely on pure pulp thrills that lie at heart of its title character s appeal in st petersburg times adam begley also noted use of what he called techno babble in washington post jack womack wrote that vachss describes batmobile lovingly yet as if a motor trend review had been translated into slovakian by someone more familiar with czech and concluded that novel was as satisfying aesthetically ethically morally as a pulse pounding yarn in which pulp fiction hero doc savage shantytowns of south america in a terribly successful search for doc mengele in kirkus reviews story was compared to a generic destroy all exploiters video game where batman disposes of each lower level pimp then moves up to next level sybil steinberg in publishers weekly noted that while no classic this is likely most stylish adaptation yet of a comic book figure its cold stiletto prose and white hot passions lifting it leagues above recent spider man and incredible hulk offerings it s also vachss
