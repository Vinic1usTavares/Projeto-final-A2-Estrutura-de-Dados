electrical elastance is inverse of capacitance si unit of elastance is inverse farad f 1 concept is not widely used by electrical and electronic engineers value of capacitors is invariably specified in units of capacitance rather than inverse capacitance however it is used in theoretical work in network analysis and has some niche applications at microwave frequencies term elastance was coined by oliver heaviside through analogy of a capacitor as a spring term is also used for analogous quantities in some other energy domains it maps to stiffness in mechanical domain and is inverse of compliance in fluid flow domain especially in physiology it is also name of generalised quantity in bond graph analysis and other schemes analysing systems across multiple domains usage definition of capacitance c is charge q stored per unit voltage v elastance s is reciprocal of capacitance thus camara p 16 11 expressing values of capacitors as elastance is not done much by practical electrical engineers although it is sometimes convenient for capacitors in series total elastance is simply sum of individual elastances in that case however it is used by network theorists in their analysis one advantage is that an increase in elastance increases impedance this is in same direction as other two basic passive elements resistance and inductance an example of use of elastance can be found in 1926 doctoral thesis of wilhelm cauer on his path to founding network synthesis he formed loop matrix a where l r s and z are network loop matrices of inductance resistance elastance and impedance respectively and s is complex frequency this expression would be significantly more complicated if cauer had tried to use a matrix of instead of elastances use of elastance here is merely for mathematical convenience in much same way as mathematicians use radians rather than more common units for angles cauer mathis pauli p 4the symbols in cauer s expression have been modified for consistency within this article and with modern practice elastance is also used in microwave engineering in this field diodes are used as a voltage variable capacitor in frequency multipliers parametric amplifiers and variable filters these diodes store a charge in their junction when reverse biased which is source of capacitor effect slope of voltage stored charge curve is called differential elastance in this field miles harrison lippens pp 29 30 units si unit of elastance is reciprocal farad f 1 term daraf is sometimes used for this unit but it is not approved by si and its use is discouraged term is formed by writing farad backwards in much same way as unit mho unit of conductance also not approved by si is formed by writing ohm backwards klein p 466 term daraf was coined by arthur e kennelly he used it from at least 1920 history terms elastance and elastivity were coined by oliver heaviside in 1886 howe p 60 heaviside coined a great many of terms used in circuit analysis today such as impedance inductance admittance and conductance heaviside s terminology followed model of resistance and resistivity with ending used for extensive properties and ending used for intensive properties extensive properties are used in circuit analysis they are values of components and intensive properties are used in field analysis heaviside s nomenclature was designed to highlight connection between corresponding quantities in field and circuit yavetz p 236 elastivity is intensive property of a material corresponding to bulk property of a component elastance it is reciprocal of permittivity as heaviside put it here is heaviside s term for capacitance he did not like any term that suggested that a capacitor was a container for holding charge he rejected terms capacity capacitance and capacious capacitive and their inverses incapacity and howe p 60 terms current in his time for a capacitor were condenser suggesting that electric fluid could be condensed out and p 268 after leyden jar an early form of capacitor also suggesting some sort of storage heaviside preferred analogy of a mechanical spring under compression hence his preference for terms that suggested a property of a spring yavetz pp 150 151 this preference was a result of heaviside following james clerk maxwell s view of electric current or at least heaviside s interpretation of it in this view electric current is a flow caused by electromotive force and is analogue of velocity caused by a mechanical force at capacitor this current causes a displacement whose rate of change is equal to current displacement is viewed as an electric strain like a mechanical strain in a compressed spring existence of a flow of physical charge is denied as is buildup of charge on capacitor plates this is replaced with concept of divergence of displacement field at plates which is numerically equal to charge collected on plates in charge flow view yavetz pp 150 151 for a period in nineteenth and early twentieth centuries some authors followed heaviside in use of elastance and elastivity see for instance peek p 215 writing in 1915 today reciprocal quantities capacitance and permittivity are almost universally preferred by electrical engineers however elastance does still see some usage by theoretical writers a further consideration in heaviside s choice of these terms was a wish to distinguish them from mechanical terms thus he chose elastivity rather than elasticity this avoids having to write electrical elasticity to disambiguate it from mechanical elasticity howe p 60 heaviside carefully chose his terms to be unique to electromagnetism most especially avoiding commonality with mechanics ironically many of his terms have subsequently been borrowed back into mechanics and other domains in order to name analogous properties for instance it is now necessary to distinguish electrical impedance from mechanical impedance in some contexts van der tweel verburg pp 16 20 elastance has also been borrowed back into mechanics for analogous quantity by some authors but often stiffness is preferred term instead however elastance is widely used for analogous property in domain of fluid dynamics especially in fields of and physiology see for instance enderle bronzino pp 197 201 especially equation 4 72 mechanical analogy mechanical electrical analogies are formed by comparing mathematical description of two systems quantities that appear in same place in equations of same form are called analogues there are two main reasons for forming such analogies first is to allow electrical phenomena to be explained in terms of more familiar mechanical systems for instance an electrical inductor capacitor resistor circuit has differential equations of same form as a mechanical mass spring damper system in such cases electrical domain is converted to mechanical domain second and more important reason is to allow a system containing both mechanical and electrical parts to be analysed as a unified whole this is of great benefit in fields of mechatronics and robotics in such cases mechanical domain is most often converted to electrical domain because network analysis in electrical domain is highly developed busch vishniac pp 17 18 maxwellian analogy in analogy developed by maxwell now known as impedance analogy voltage is made analogous to force voltage of a source of electric power is still called electromotive force for this reason current is analogous to velocity time derivative of distance displacement is equal to velocity and time derivative of momentum is equal to force quantities in other energy domains that are in this same differential relationship are called respectively generalised displacement generalised velocity generalised momentum and generalised force in electrical domain it can be seen that generalised displacement is charge explaining maxwellians use of term displacement gupta p 18 since elastance is ratio of voltage over charge then it follows that analogue of elastance in another energy domain is ratio of a generalised force over a generalised displacement thus an elastance can be defined in any energy domain elastance is used as name of generalised quantity in formal analysis of systems with multiple energy domains such as is done with bond graphs vieil p 47 definition of elastance in different energy for translational p rotational stiffness of stiffness stiffness p force mmf magnetic p chemical pp 120 121 other analogies maxwell s analogy is not only way that analogies can be constructed between mechanical and electrical systems there are any number of ways to do this one very common system is mobility analogy in this analogy force maps to current instead of voltage electrical impedance no longer maps to mechanical impedance and likewise electrical elastance no longer maps to mechanical elastance busch vishniac p 20 references bibliography blake f c on
