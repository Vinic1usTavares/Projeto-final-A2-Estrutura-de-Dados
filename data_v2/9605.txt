admitted binge drinking during his final years of life he was harvesting an unspecified wild herb from hills of neighborhood and using it as a sedative by then essayist ion vartic notes caragiale s obsession with death had developed into neurosis several contemporary accounts focus on mateiu s unusual preferences in clothing pointing to a studied extravagance first adopted during his stay in berlin and in support of which he was reportedly spending more than he could afford literary historian george calinescu recalled having seen a middle aged caragiale taking walks through downtown bucharest amused by writer s everyday clothes which he depicted as of an archaic fashion and slightly deteriorated compared him to a butler on sunday leave calinescu p 897 i vianu pp 61 102 calinescu also told that during winter caragiale would only touch metal with his hand while wearing suede gloves rosetti and poet both recorded being amused by aspects of caragiale s clothing such as his oversized boots and his using scissors to cut out worn out extremities of his trouser legs i vianu pp 60 61 in 1926 writer began wearing a ring bearing seal of mercury which vartic supposes evidenced his trust in god s powers caragiale s secrecy and eccentricity is credited with having marked his personal life and sexuality often with dramatic consequences in support of this ion vianu cites writer s alleged disdain for his mother referencing a claim made by socialite grigore grigri ghica latter familiar with miller verghy and her circle recounted that poverty stricken but proud caragiale had asked their common female friend to allow him use of a stable on her property explaining that he was going to have furniture moved in according to ghica owners were shocked to discover that stable had been used instead to accommodate maria constantinescu i vianu pp 12 62 63 94 ion vianu also notes that caragiale appears to have been in love for just one moment referring to his 1907 pursuit of an upper class french girl fernande de bondy who rejected his advances and complained to caragiale father i vianu pp 27 28 for a while in 1908 caragiale had a brief affair with a reportedly unattractive frenchwoman mariette lamboley who had been a roman catholic nun i vianu pp 28 29 in letters he sent to his close friend nicolae caragiale bragged about his sexual exploits with lamboley and of having exposed her to most terrifying which included allowing her to be raped by a stranger in gardens i vianu p 28 notes in his diaries show that he discreetly resented alexandru bogdan pitesti although ion vianu stresses such pronouncements appear to have become a staple of caragiale s private records only long after bogdan pitesti had died i vianu pp 38 41 46 91 92 aside from claiming to expose his patron s alleged financing by central powers before and during world war i caragiale discussed bogdan pitesti s homosexuality in disparaging terms calling him a of anti natural vice i vianu p 110 and even laying out a plan to rob his residence i vianu pp 55 59 91 92 94 95 109 110 100 101 106 violent solution to poverty ion vianu proposes may have reflected his appreciation for felicien champsaur s

partly building on similar comments made by literary historian matei calinescu that writer had a preference for homosociality or even homoeroticism both in line with his narcissism i vianu pp 65 78 94 100 caragiale s diary also dealt with bogdan pitesti s wife socialite domnica depicting her as an immoral woman cernat avangarda p 44 a person known by initials a k who was probably same as domnica is

a damaged woman posing nude on bogdan pitesti s command and claiming that sexually she has for long inspired me a strong repulsion i vianu p 39 he confessed being thankful that long record of sums he had borrowed from bogdan pitesti beginning 1916 had been destroyed probably by domnica at a time when his patron was on his deathbed i vianu p 41 mateiu caragiale s final erotic pursuit was high society lady and amateur singer eliza elise baicoianu he courted her for a few months in 1932 despite being married to marica sion his private notes show that he struggled with lust for baicoianu which he believed was impairing his judgment and declared himself outraged that object of his affection had a scandalous liaison with another man i vianu p 85 he ultimately decided not to persevere basing himself on principle that business is business i vianu p 86 in his final years caragiale was weighing in probability of his still fathering a male son and although he concluded that it was not likely laid out a family law for his potential descendants to abide by i vianu pp 92 93 work literary style writing shortly after caragiale died tudor vianu defined him as a figure possibly a delayed one from that aesthetic generation of around 1880 who professed a concept of supremacy of artistic values in life this allowed him to draw a parallel between mateiu caragiale and alexandru macedonski doyen of romanian symbolism with one essential difference provided by their level of involvement in cultural affairs unlike his half brother luca caragiale tended to stay away from literary movements of his age and placed his cultural references in relative past being inspired by romantic and symbolist authors such as edgar allan poe auguste villiers de l isle adam jules amedee barbey d aurevilly i vianu pp 19 29 t vianu pp 172 173 charles vianu pp 19 29 and jose maria de heredia noting manifest difference in style between realist ion luca and his two sons vianu pointed out that three shared as characteristic traits cultivation of developed forms view of art as a closed system resistant to anarchic forces of reality t vianu p 173 according to cioculescu mateiu s work would be minor unless placed alongside that of ion luca caragiale elsewhere cioculescu indicated that a letter written by mateiu caragiale in his early youth which featured his first pieces of social commentary imitated his father s calligraphy to point where george calinescu initially believed they were work of ion luca s cioculescu pp 342 344 368 literary critic paul cernat proposes that clashes between father and son evidenced mateiu s maternal attachment and a break with paternal authority and in particular his oedipus complex which he also sees manifested in personality of modern romanian writers such as avant garde founding figure urmuz and co founder of dadaism tristan tzara cernat avangarda p 18 discussing mateiu caragiale s originality calinescu saw in him a promoter maybe first of literary that greasy mix of obscene phrases lascivious impulses awareness of an adventurous and fuzzy genealogy everything purified and seen from above by a superior intelligence calinescu p 900 in relation to romanian literature he believed to have discovered a common trait of balkan writers of mostly wallachian origin citing mateiu caragiale in a group that also included caragiale father early 19th century and printer anton modern poets tudor arghezi ion minulescu and ion barbu and urmuz calinescu pp 814 895 cernat avangarda p 148 he went on to define this gathering as great grimacing sensitive ones buffoons with just too much plastic intelligence calinescu p 814 in parallel lovinescu saw caragiale as one in a group of modernist prose writers who sought to reshape genre through use of lyricism and were thus paradoxically outdated by 20th century standards lovinescu p 213 alongside caragiale lovinescu argues group includes felix dimitrie anghel tudor arghezi h botez botez emanoil bucuta ion n davidescu horia adrian maniu petru manoliu ion minulescu sanda movila dragos al t i valerian ion vinea and a few others lovinescu pp 213 226 delayed character of caragiale s contribution was also mentioned by literary historian ovid crohmalniceanu who identified its roots in art nouveau and through it subjects of byzantine art cernat avangarda p 53 among other traits which set caragiale apart from his fellow romanian writers was his highly creative vocabulary partly reliant on and words occurring rarely in modern romanian lexis including ones borrowed from turkish and greek

underlining differentiation between written and spoken words t vianu p 452 while ion vianu defined caragiale as an accurate artisan of language an extraordinary of romanian language which out of snobbery he sets aside for plebeian readers i vianu p 10 craii de curtea veche introduces a large array of words present in early 20th century slang and romanian profanity as well as rendering then common habit of borrowing whole sentences from french to express pp 899 900 lovinescu p 219 a trait notably present in mateiu s own day to day vocabulary s cioculescu pp 344 361 362 363 i vianu p 10

allusions to himself and occasionally narratives discreetly refer to one another vartic pp 130 131 133 i vianu pp 7 8 although his texts are characterized by precision in defining moment and location for plot general lines of narratives are often subject to a calculated fragmentation an innovative technique which vartic writes attests author s familiarity with antoine furetiere s vision vartic pp

them titled inspection is part of mitica cycle while other grand hotel victoria romana is one of earliest depictions of anxiety in literature of romania for matei calinescu pirgu and other protagonists stand as allegories for a set of essentially romanian traits that he argues were still observable in early 21st century i vianu p 6 in direct reference to craii george calinescu wrote reality is transfigured it becomes fantastical and a sort of edgar poe like unease main characters these good for nothings of old romanian capital this he argued validated placing caragiale s novel among surrealist writings and alongside works of eclectic authors such as barbu and ion vinea literary historian eugen simion notes that barbu believed himself thought caragiale s prose was equal in value to poetry of romania s national poet mihai eminescu and argues that this perspective was exaggerated writing in 2007 cernat also noted a similarity between vinea s 1930 collection of novellas paradise of sighs and caragiale s craii defining two books as poetic mannerist and fantastic and stressing that they both portray decadent characters cernat avangarda p 184 building on observations of his older colleague simion cernat commented that vinea mateiu caragiale n davidescu and adrian maniu all members of same post symbolist generation ultimately traced their inspiration to alexandru macedonski and his symbolist work thalassa le de feu he also proposed that less directly macedonski s themes and style also influenced similar prose works by arghezi and urmuz several critics and researchers have pointed out that in craii caragiale used characters and dialogues to illustrate his own worldview and historical points of reference s cioculescu pp 347 352 lovinescu p 219 nastasa p

light on ion luca unnamed leading writer of nation who prostitutes his trade s cioculescu pp 350 351 358 359 commenting on brief mention of one of pirgu s associates theosophist critic concluded that it most likely referred to novelist and traveler bucura s cioculescu p 351 cioculescu identifies several other characters including pirgu and two secondary characters journalist and homosexual diplomat were caragiale s companions latter two were based respectively on uhrinowsky and a member of an old family ion vianu who believes unnamed narrator is a projection of caragiale s ego

calinescu who referred to narrative as a pastiche and to berlin as portrayed in caragiale s story as a berlin sodom concluded that text allowed readers to form direct sensation of bucharest as a balkan sodom to be discerned from german landscape caragiale s sub pecetea tainei has been subject of debates in literary community one disagreement refers to its nature some see it as a standalone novella while others including alexandru george view it as an unfinished novel manolescu pp 8 10 in this context a singular position was held by ovid crohmalniceanu who believed that caragiale was building up to a sequel of his craii manolescu p 9 other point of contention involves its artistic value ovidiu cotrus saw story as proof that mateiu caragiale was running out of narrative resourcefulness manolescu p 7 and creating writing most detached from his work s obsessions vartic p 128 while serban cioculescu deplored caragiale s move to abandon work on soborul tatelor which he considered a more promising venture in order to implant a sort of romanian detective novel s cioculescu p 355 manolescu p 7 written as a frame story sub pecetea tainei comprises recollections of teodor rache ruse a retired police officer punctuated by willing omissions for which rows of ellipses are employed text is structured into accounts of three unsolved cases that of a missing person clerk gogu nicolau who may or may not have been murdered by his wife that of an epileptic minister whom ruse is supposed to guard and who after going missing and returning presents his resignation and dies leaving general public clueless as to his fate finally that of a viennese couple of con artists and presumed murderers one of whom may be a transvestite woman whose arrival in bucharest poses a threat on life of their female host lena manolescu pp 11 14 ruse s accounts which oblique references in text seem to place in 1930 form part of his conversations with unnamed narrator which are set in caru cu bere restaurant and in narrator s bucharest home this manolescu notes echoes scenes in craii a recurring element in plot is role played by secretive women who may be directly or indirectly responsible for deaths of male characters manolescu pp 10 11 commentators have since attempted to match several of protagonists with real people in caragiale s life such theories identify rache ruse himself with a policeman whom caragiale had befriended minister with leading conservative party member alexandru lahovary and female character with miller verghy vartic p 122 according to manolescu mateiu caragiale took direct inspiration from foreign works of detective fiction when outlining his story but also mocked their conventions by having ruse rely on literature and even cartomancy for his crime solving techniques manolescu p 14 vartic drew a parallel between caragiale s style and that of two 20th century foreign authors of crime fiction dashiell hammett and giorgio bassani vartic pp 122 123 general intent manolescu notes is not in realistically depicting police procedures but in showing human mystery thus ion vartic argues gogu nicolau may be caragiale s attempt to see himself from outside and his disappearance may be a clue that writer was planning to sever links with cultural milieu vartic pp 132 133 work s title and its generic meaning are found in ruse s final statement there are such things meant to always remain since forever under seal of secrecy manolescu pp 13 14 15 vartic p 120 poetry caragiale s symbolist poems including a series of sonnets also display his

calinescu pp 595 899 according to perpessicius caragiale had a certain outlook according to which past should not be sought in books but in surrounding landscape perpessicius pp ix x he illustrated this notion with a stanza from caragiale s clio calinescu noted that in several of his poems mateiu caragiale had infused his search for aristocratic he saw this present in poem lauda in praise of

caragiale matei calinescu recalled that during dark 1950 60 decade he clandestinely read craii and shared his thoughts on it with a group of friends noting that this was part of a secret life which contrasted with rigors one had to obey in public with relative liberalization during 1960s which followed rise of nicolae ceausescu as communist leader caragiale s work enjoyed a more favorable reception at that stage nationalism and national communism became standards of official discourse and intellectuals such as edgar papu were allowed to reinterpret romanian culture on basis of nationalist tenets papu s controversial theory known as claimed that romanians as a group were at source of any innovative movement in world culture papu thus believed that caragiale whom he described
