moments adding frustratingly dear agony never reaches greatness settling for an admirable competency that s still envy of many of their contemporaries hiatus and shallow bay 2010 2013 in march 2010

szeliga announced his departure citing creative differences return and dark before dawn 2014 2016 in august 2014 breaking benjamin announced via facebook that band reformed as a quintet with except

shaun foist drums originally from picture me broken burnley said of lineup everybody that s in band now is deliberately handpicked noting that keith wallen and aaron bruch are really really amazing singers that s kind of what band always needed on march 18 2015 a new single entitled failure as well as a new album dark before dawn were announced for release on march 23 and june 23 respectively thumb breaking benjamin performing at rock am ring in germany 2016 new lineup debuted with acoustic shows in late 2014 then went on a four venue winter tour in north eastern united states band

play further outside of united states in june 2016 at venues such as download festival in united kingdom rock am ring in germany and nova rock in austria burnley explained that writing for dark before dawn was intermittent and fragmentary taking place throughout hiatus though it was toward end of hiatus in 2013 when it became cohesive after growing frustrated with lack of answers regarding his health condition burnley decided to abandon searching for a diagnosis and focus on album recorded and produced at a personal studio of burnley s dark before dawn is first album with front man credited as producer singer stated that i would say that i did same amount of producing on this album as i ve done on other albums just never had my name on it adding you know i m not doing anything different here than i have done in past why shouldn t i be known to be doing it within an hour of pre order availability dark before dawn reached no 1 on rock albums chart on itunes and no 3 on overall album chart it sold 135 000 pure album units and 141 000 equivalent album units in its first week debuting at no 1 on billboard 200 making album group s heretofore most successful sales effort it achieved gold certification on august 18 2016 disc s lead single failure spent nine weeks at no 1 on mainstream rock songs chart as well billboard s jason lipshutz felt album s success was eyebrow raising noting that in addition to band s lineup change 135 000 in pure album sales is a hefty number in 2015 it s a bigger number than respective bows of recent madonna asap rocky and kelly clarkson albums joe program director of active rock station fm added that they ve always been a top level band for format but not quite on level of disturbed or shinedown or bands like that they always seem to put out hit records without getting kind of recognition that they deserved forbes hugh mcintyre writes that runner up tori kelly s 75 000 copies puts breaking benjamin s figures into perspective and that despite a pretty extensive lineup change it looks like fans were awaiting their return with open arms album was met with mostly positive critical reception many critics praising album for staying true to group s sound though others criticized it for sounding too similar to previous material dan marsicano from about entertainment stated burnley could have made his creation just another dose of glitzy overproduced crap that is heard on every rock radio station in world instead breaking benjamin hardly deviate from hooky jams that were present on dear agony conversely allmusic s james monger felt that it s hard to conceal fact that most of these songs are nearly interchangeable with band s older material revolver s jeremy felt that music s true force only becomes apparent through deeper and repeated listenings as songs on surface have a tendency to blend into one another ember 2017 2018 group s sixth studio album was first revealed to be completed in august 2017 band toured with avenged sevenfold and bullet for my valentine on their north american tour following with a u s mini tour with 10 years and then a tour with five finger death punch beginning in second quarter of 2018

happening in 2017 while burnley remained primary composer for album he stated that around half of it was written by rest of band burnley returned to producing for album along with rest of band a first for group rauch commented that album pushes boundaries with heavier material than band s done in past he said playing wise it s most difficult album and that they took advantage of three guitar player dynamic but that album nonetheless does not depart from breaking benjamin s established sound burnley explained that there was demand for heavier material from fans and that group was happy to reflect that he later explained that he believed fans gravitated to heavier side of band but that we also make sure to explore our melodic and softer side too saying that album seeks to give both sides to furthest degree burnley stated that he chose ember as album title as something that could be end of something or start of it but emphasized an intentional ambiguity to leave it open to interpretation official music videos were released for singles red cold river torn in two and tourniquet on january 18 april 12 and december 13 respectively with burnley explaining that they are part of a three part continuity music video for torn in two is a continuation of a narrative started by red cold river and features references to all of breaking benjamin s past music videos tourniquet concludes trilogy as a sequel to both previous videos dancer and actor derek hough who had previously covered ashes of eden in a choreographed music video has an appearance on album saying that opportunity was a dream come true burnley later explained that he reached out to hough after seeing his cover of ashes of eden and that song he is featured on is dark of you thumb breaking benjamin performing at louder than life in 2019 ember received mostly positive critical reception and was noted both for its familiarity and its heavier stylistic shift allmusic s neil yeung gave a generally favorable review but emphasized its familiarity saying as far as variety goes this is a fairly standard collection of tunes from a band that is mainly concerned with giving fans what they want and expect conversely loudwire s chad childers called ember a heavy record not just in terms of sound where you could argue that they ve never sounded heavier but also in terms of lyrical content saying group is proving that they re better and yes heavier than ever with plenty still left to say luke nuttall of soundboard gave album a mixed review saying even most dedicated diehard has to admit that this is far from groundbreaking or any sort of departure from their past material and such an unashamed recycling of work seldom leads to positive results but adding that ember manages to elevate above radio rock s most uninspired efforts but this is purely for those who ve been there all way through for everyone else it s there to embrace or avoid as per want aurora 2018 present in an interview in december 2018 burnley stated there will be an album of acoustic renditions of past songs in 2019 in july of 2019 burnley confirmed during a radio interview that new acoustic album will feature collaborations from red saint and lacey sturm band s 2019 north american headline tour with chevelle and three days grace went from july 21 to september 25 on october 28 2019 band officially announced album aurora via their official social media pages with a release date of january 24 2020 they also announced their 2020 co headlining north american tour with korn on december 6 2019 band released far away featuring scooter ward of cold first single from aurora characteristics musical style breaking benjamin s musical style is primarily classified as hard rock and alternative rock more specifically post grunge and alternative metal and has commonly been noted for its consistency corey apar felt that breaking benjamin are nothing if not consistent and alex young felt that breaking benjamin is one of few modern rock bands on radio that if you have heard any song in its catalog prior could be immediately recognized despite a complete lineup change prior to release of dark before dawn dan marsicano stated breaking benjamin hardly deviate from hooky jams that were present on dear agony they have had an established sound since their breakout we are not alone hard edged riffs with emotional upheaval and that isn t tampered with on dark before dawn their style is described by apar as mixing heavy hard rock dynamics with a moody demeanor that never slips into full on dejection spence d characterizes band as persisting in delivering crunching guitars topped off with somewhat generic angst ridden lyrics that waffle between being plaintive and aggressive with vocals that deliver just right amount of emotion fluctuating between contemplative subjectivity and growling anger young felt that breaking benjamin is indicative of early 00s modern rock while also now and then being more filter esque or technically proficient primarily on guitar during 2002 s saturate and from then on with bass and drums composition burnley is primary songwriter in band music industry attorney and author martin writes that it s unmistakably clear that burnley started group is creative force behind group and essentially dictates group s decisions bands such as nirvana live bush pearl jam stone temple pilots and beatles have been cited as influences burnley remarked in 2009 that while other band members did contribute it was always left up to me to put all pieces together and make it so that it s even anything at all however burnley expressed how he considered rauch to be his writing partner during dear agony and that he looked forward to writing with him in future after joining band in 2014 as part of new lineup rauch provided writing contributions on dark before dawn writing intro and outro tracks as well as riffs on two other tracks burnley revealed in 2015 that whole band would write songs for breaking benjamin in future and that it just so happens that when they came on board for this album i was already 95 percent done adding i m really looking forward to writing next one all together 2018 s ember represents band s first effort with full composition credit given to members other than burnley breaking benjamin s lyrical content evolved as a product of burnley s sobriety front man noting that lyricism in dear agony is more thought out rito of inquirer writes that burnley owes improved clarity and coherence in breaking benjamin s music to sobriety burnley has said that before sobriety anything that made sense thematically was a coincidence and that he would take shots if he were dissatisfied with a lyric breaking benjamin s lyrics have been noted for their vague angst heavy themes burnley saying that i try to keep my writing vague so people can draw their own conclusions live performance thumb rhythm guitarist and vocalist keith wallen performing in 2016 breaking benjamin s live sound has corresponded with lineup arrangements band originally lacked backing vocalists and tertiary instrumentation requiring them to rely on pre recorded tracks during live performances however band was noted for a change in such respects with second iteration of band assembled in 2014 bruch and wallen were selected in part for their ability as singers providing all backing vocals on both new studio recordings and during live shows burnley noted that it was important to add two new singers in order to replicate vocal techniques such as three part harmonies octave range and layered vocals rauch acting as a third guitarist provides band with more freedom while simultaneously thickening up their live sound as some songs feature three guitar parts layered guitars or are meant to feature burnley only performing vocals such as i will not bow and lights out foist utilizes roland v kit electronic drums during live performances and triggers certain sounds as heard in studio recordings such as piano notes in breakdown additionally rauch is equipped with a roland gr 55 guitar synthesizer allowing him to play orchestral strings and choir sound effects further eliminating any reliance on pre recorded tracks members current members benjamin burnley lead vocals rhythm guitar jasen rauch lead guitar strings programming keith wallen rhythm guitar backing vocals
