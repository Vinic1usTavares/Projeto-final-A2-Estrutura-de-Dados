lactarius vietus commonly known as grey milkcap is a species of fungus in family russulaceae first described by elias magnus fries it produces moderately sized and brittle mushrooms which grow on forest floor or on rotting wood flattened convex cap can vary in shape sometimes forming shape of a wide funnel it is typically grey but colour varies species has crowded light coloured gills which produce white milk spore print is typically whitish but also varies considerably mushrooms typically have a strong acrid taste and have been described as inedible but other authors have described them as consumable after boiling l vietus feeds by forming an ectomycorrhizal relationship with surrounding trees and it favours birch it grows in autumn months and is fairly common in europe north america and eastern asia taxonomy lactarius vietus was first described by elias magnus fries in 1821 as agaricus vietus in his systema mycologicum in his 1838 work epicrisis systematis mycologici fries reclassified species as a lactarius giving it its current name subsequent attempts to reclassify species have been unsuccessful in his 1871 work der fuhrer in die paul kummer reclassified species as a member of galorrheus and in otto kuntze s 1891 revisio generum plantarum species was placed in genus lactifluus both galorrheus vietus and lactifluus vietus are now considered obligate synonyms different names for same species based on one type of lactarius vietus specific epithet is from latin vietus meaning shrunken it is commonly known as grey milkcap description thumb left l vietus gills with milk lactarius vietus typically has a cap of across with a flattened convex shape at times cap becomes widely funnel shaped and sometimes features a broad or pointed umbo though centre of cap is typically depressed cap is coloured grey sometimes with violet flesh coloured pale yellowish brown or red tints though it is paler towards cap margin in young mushrooms very pale specimens have also been recorded in united states though they are not true albinos cap s margin is curved inwards in younger specimens and wavey cap surface is smooth and can be or sticky when wet stem measures by and is generally cylindrical in shape sometimes stem narrows downwards or is club shaped in colour stem whitish or greyish paler at top and is rather weak and easily broken flesh is a whitish buff colour and is often absent in stem leaving it hollow crowded gills are can be decurrent with gill running down stem or adnate with entire depth of gill connecting to stem and in colour are whitish to a dirty buff they are thin and flaccid and there are three to four tiers of lamellulae short gills that do not reach stem from cap margin gills produce white milk which dries a brownish or greenish grey after about 20 minutes mushroom flesh will slowly stain a greyish colour if a drop of feso4 solution is applied to it as a chemical colour test microscopic features spore print is typically a creamy white with a slight salmon tinge but it has been observed to vary from white to yellow depending on density meaning that it is not a useful means of identification individual spores are a buff white amyloid staining blue in melzer s reagent and hyaline in shape spores are elliptic with a moderately well developed network of ridges measuring between 8 and 9 5 by 6 5 to 7 5 micrometres mm pleurocystidia cystidia on face of gills are shaped like narrow spindles typically measuring between 40 and 75 mm long but sometimes reaching 86 mm in length by 6 and 11 mm wide at widest point cheilocystidia cystidia on edge of gills are leaf or spindle shaped measuring between 30 and 52 mm long by 4 to 7 mm wide basidia are four spored and club shaped measuring between 36 and 42 mm in length by 8 and 12 mm wide similar species lactarius is similar in appearance in colour it is a pale pink buff and its flesh turns a violet lilac colour when cut white milk has a mild taste lactarius mammosus a species described by fries but not often mentioned by mycological community for some time after his death is also similar moser examining identity of l mammosus concluded that it is certainly more closely related to l vietus than to l fuscus but differs in habit and colour spores are slightly longer and sculptures are less pronounced in l vietus edibility lactarius vietus milk has a very hot taste and mushroom lacks a distinctive smell although described by many mycologists as inedible david pegler claims that its acrid taste can be removed after boiling allowing it to be consumed though strong acrid taste is a defining feature of species it is weaker or even absent in some older mushrooms which is not unusual for lactarius species occasionally however mushrooms of species have been collected which have a mild taste this has also been observed in other species with typically acrid tastes distribution habitat and ecology lactarius vietus is fairly common and can be found growing in moist areas under trees in autumn often among sphagnum moss though it strongly favours beech it has also been found under oak it forms an ectomycorrhizal relationship with trees under which it grows it can also be found growing on rotting wood or other hard surfaces specimens have been observed on both conifer and hardwood logs these are typically smaller specimens and it is possible that they represent a dwarf variety despite growing on rotting wood species is not saprotrophic instead mycelia of species are linking with tree roots growing through or near wood this is a particularly useful adaptation when soil is either wet or nutrient poor mushrooms can sometimes grow in large numbers but they can also be found growing in tight clumps or solitarily when growing out of season species can be found in europe with collections in scandinavia british isles bulgaria germany and northern turkey in north america it has been recorded as common in canada and both northern and southern united states in northern asia it was found in regions near both oka river and central angara river in siberia and in eastern asia it has been collected in china see also list of lactarius
