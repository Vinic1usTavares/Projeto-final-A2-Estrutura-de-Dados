significance of feathers their evolution and their history both in nature and in use by humans feathers is divided into five parts in evolution hanson discusses scientific debate over how feathers evolved interviewing ornithologists richard prum and alan feduccia as well as paleontologist xing xu in fluff hanson discusses how feathers play a role in regulating a bird s body temperature and how feather insulation has also been utilized by humans flight discusses how flight might have evolved in birds interviewing prum feduccia xu and also ornithologist ken dial who described wing assisted incline running in fancy hanson discusses role of feathers in sexual selection as well as how humans have utilized feathers for fashion interviewing costume and fashion designers on las vegas strip and new york city function discusses how feathers have been adapted for other purposes such as waterproofing fly fishing and quill pens hanson decided he would write feathers after going on a run and noticing a feather dropped at his feet by a vulture coincidentally he had considered writing a story involving vulture feathers earlier that day book was published first in hardcover by basic books in 2011 then in paperback in 2012 critical reception to feathers has predominantly been positive with praise for hanson s enthusiasm and writing in 2012 feathers won pacific northwest booksellers association award and sb f prize in young adult science book category presented by american association for advancement of science and subaru in 2013 book was also awarded john burroughs medal background and publication thor hanson is a researcher with a variety of interests in addition to writing for general audiences his published research includes impact of forest fragmentation on bird nest predation impact of human warfare on conservation policy behavior of neotropical monkeys and birds and others hanson received a ph d from university of idaho in 2006 for his dissertation he studied impact of habitat fragmentation on ecology of a type of tropical tree hanson s interest in feathers began after observing vultures in kenya according to hanson when brainstorming ideas for a new book he considered a story which involved vultures and their feathers and later that day as he went on a run he noticed four turkey vultures keeping watch over a roadkill deer one of vultures began flapping and dropped a feather at hanson s feet moved by this coincidence hanson decided then to write a book about feathers hanson pp xv xvi basic books first published feathers in hardcover in

january february 2012 edition of audubon published by national audubon society feathers is hanson s second book after impenetrable forest my gorilla years in uganda 2008 content summary following a preface and introduction feathers is divided into five main parts evolution discusses evolutionary history of feathers fluff explains role of feathers in regulating body temperature flight discusses origin of avian flight as well as its impact on human aviation fancy discusses role of feathers in sexual selection and human fashion and function discusses continuing evolution of feathers in both nature and human usage hanson p 10 evolution thumb a replica of london specimen archaeopteryx specimen which hanson first discusses in feathers feathers begins with 1861 discovery of first archaeopteryx fossil specimen and resulting debate between english paleontologist richard owen an opponent to evolution by natural selection and thomas henry huxley an advocate for evolution hanson pp 17 22 hanson himself visits wyoming dinosaur center a small museum in wyoming which had acquired an archaeopteryx specimen hanson pp 23 25 hanson interviews richard prum coe professor of ornithology at yale university who proposed a developmental theory of feather evolution which focuses on how feathers grow and not worrying about what they re used for hanson pp 37 39 hanson also interviews alan feduccia a professor at university of north carolina who disagrees with scientific consensus that birds evolved from theropod dinosaurs hanson pp 40 41 later hanson interviews xing xu a chinese paleontologist who described fossil specimens that helped support prum s developmental theory such as and microraptor hanson pp 43 44 51 52 hanson also discusses development of feathers in thin billed prions as well as how feather growth is controlled by sonic hedgehog gene hanson pp 61 63 77 79 fluff in fluff hanson describes his experience at winter ecology a hands on exploration of cold weather ecosystems organized by bernd heinrich a biologist at university of vermont while staying in a log cabin in a remote location in western maine hanson observed how golden crowned kinglets and other birds were able to keep warm on nights when temperature was and discusses role of feathers in maintaining a comfortable body temperature for birds hanson pp 84 87 to understand how down feathers have been adapted for human purposes hanson interviews travis stier at pacific coast feather company which manufactures pillows and comforters made with feathers hanson pp 92 93 later hanson discusses various strategies that birds employ to keep cool in warmer climates and during periods of muscular activity such as flight and fast running as well as role of feathers in these strategies hanson pp 101 114 flight thumb left a peregrine falcon in flight in feathers hanson interviews owner of a peregrine falcon whose dive was measured at fastest flying animal on record scientists disagree on how feathered flight originally evolved and hanson describes various viewpoints on subject ground up view holds that flight originated from theropod dinosaurs running along ground whereas tree down view holds that flight originated from animals who lived in trees as a means to extend their hops from branch to branch hanson p 118 hanson discusses issue with feduccia who argues for tree down view noting that other vertebrates also developed flight from tree down hanson p 121 hanson also discusses with prum and xu who state that while origin of feathers might have been ground based theropods origin of flight could have been theropods who climbed trees especially considering four winged feathered theropods like microraptor hanson pp 124 25 hanson interviews ken dial an ornithologist who described wing assisted incline running wair a behavior exhibited by baby birds learning how to fly wair has been proposed as an alternative model for origin of avian flight as it addresses weaknesses in both ground up and tree down views hanson pp 125 27 later hanson interviews ken franklin who raised frightful a peregrine falcon whose dive was measured to be making her fastest flying animal on record franklin describes role of feathers in improving aerodynamics of a falcon s flight hanson pp 135 38 hanson concludes flight section with discussion of how feathered flight has influenced human aviation hanson pp 141 54 fancy thumb upright when discussing work of alfred russel wallace hanson describes brilliantly colored feathers of male greater bird of paradise photographed here in 2008

journal feathers received john burroughs medal in 2013 which is awarded annually by john burroughs association to author of a distinguished book of natural history reception academic frances c james in a review published in condor described book as scholarly and enjoyable commenting that hanson has worked hard to summarize science behind our current understanding of form and function of feathers their development and their evolution regarding hanson s description of origin of feathers and flight james commented that hanson could have taken an even more critical approach by stating that prum s developmental model has not really been tested confirmation of predictions of a theory is not a test unless predictions help discriminate among alternative hypotheses james eventually concluded i don t blame hanson for not having delved more deeply into this subject i just wish that ornithologists would evaluate alternative theories on full weight of their evidence and stop misquoting huxley pepper w trail wrote a review published in quarterly review of biology commenting hanson has a gift for narrative and is an engaging companion as he leads readers through sometimes complex material trail also commented there are however a few places where author s zest for telling a good story led him astray as an example trail observed that hanson uses eight pages to discuss trans saharan ostrich expedition but less than four on science of feather coloration a field burgeoning with new discoveries in a review published in wilson journal of ornithology kimberly s bostwick described hanson s writing as engaging writing that there is something for everyone to learn from professional ornithologists to non biologists bostwick warned scientific readers however that feathers uses poetic license to adapt some of historical accounts a little to make them flow as stories and that hanson uses a few analogies to explain some of more complex biological phenomenon that are not entirely accurate literary literary reception to feathers has been positive amanda katz in a review published by new york times wrote that because feathers is a work of synthesis bird enthusiasts will find book s content already familiar but noted that as synthesis goes it is gracious funny persuasive and wide ranging peter forbes in a review published by guardian stated that hanson s enthusiasm is infectious particularly for a topic forbes found alluring economist published a review which also described hanson as having infectious enthusiasm and stated mr hanson s unpretentious style makes what is essentially an excellent scientific work into an enjoyable read for ignorant and uninitiated irene in a review published by seattle times highlighted hanson s analogies calling them apt and helping to simplify complex concepts kirkus reviews described feathers as a delightful ramble through byways of evolution and wonderful world of birds scientific american published an online review of feathers in their blog tetrapod zoology by darren naish naish commented that prior to hanson s book it doesn t seem that any one book has ever been devoted to feathers and feathers alone feathers is thus a rather significant book and very nice it is too naish also stated that feathers is not provincial view of someone only interested in ecology or conservation biology on contrary this is a remarkably well rounded review of subject in a review published in news magazine maclean s brian bethune praised hanson s storytelling writing for all intriguing science what really livens up hanson s passionate discussion of his natural miracle are stories he tells laurence a marschall a physics professor at gettysburg college wrote in a review published in magazine natural history in sum feathers
