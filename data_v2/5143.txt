sieges of taunton were a series of three blockades during first english civil war town of taunton in somerset was considered to be of strategic importance because it controlled main road from bristol to devon and cornwall robert blake commanded town s parliamentarian defences during all three sieges from september 1644 to july 1645 first siege was laid by edmund wyndham on 23 september and was primarily composed of royalist troops from local somerset garrisons after initial assaults drove blake and his troops back into taunton castle blockade was conducted from away and concentrated more on starving garrison than continued attacks town was relieved by a force under james holborne on 14 december over next three months blake was able to establish a network of earthen defences in taunton including a basic perimeter and several forts royalists began second and bloodiest siege in late march 1645 initially under sir richard grenville a series of disputes between royalist commanders allowed taunton some respite at start of siege but in may attacks were fierce under command of sir ralph hopton after five days of intense fighting which had once again driven defending army back to a small central perimeter including castle royalists retreated in face of a parliamentarian relief army commanded by ralph weldon lord goring who had proposed second siege renewed blockade for a third time in mid may after engaging weldon s departing army and forcing it back into taunton goring s siege was lax and allowed provisions into town diminishing its effectiveness parliamentarian defence tied up goring and his 10 15 000 troops who would have otherwise been available to fight for king charles at naseby where historians believe they could have tipped battle in favour of royalists barratt 2004 p 115 memegalos 2007 p 269 instead after securing a parliamentarian victory at naseby thomas fairfax marched his army to relieve taunton on 9 july 1645 background loyalties in somerset were divided at start of first english civil war many of prominent landowners and those living in countryside favoured king charles i but most of towns including taunton were parliamentarian predominantly due to their puritan beliefs by august 1642 town was held by a small parliamentarian force toulmin savage 1822 p 410 in june following year sir ralph hopton led his royalist army consisting of eighteen regiments equally split between foot and cavalry out of cornwall and into somerset he forced surrender of taunton to king without engaging in battle and established a garrison in taunton castle in mid 1644 robert devereux 3rd earl of essex chief commander of parliamentary army decided to reclaim west country he moved through dorset retaking dorchester and weymouth and then left coast and headed towards chard at time taunton was held by a garrison of 800 men commanded by colonel john stawell but proximity of earl of essex s army led town to be abandoned leaving only 80 men to defend castle historian robert morris in sieges of taunton 1644 1645 suggests that stawell and his men retreated to bridgwater morris 1995 pp 4 5 but in history of rebellion 17th century historian edward hyde claims that troops were requisitioned by prince maurice during his retreat from lyme regis to plymouth hyde 1816 p 680 on 8 july 1644 earl of essex sent a parliamentarian force led by colonel sir robert pye with lieutenant colonel robert blake as his second in command to reclaim taunton ellison 1936 p 13 they took town without a fight and surrounded castle morris 1995 p 5 royalist forces under major william reeve that were garrisoned at taunton castle surrendered and retreated to bridgwater toulmin savage 1822 p 412 pye left taunton shortly after capture leaving blake

blake commanded parliamentarian defence of taunton during sieges alt painting of robert blake earl of essex s campaign failed suffering a total defeat at battle of lostwithiel in early september 1644 his remaining forces retreated back to dorset leaving only plymouth lyme regis and taunton under parliamentarian control in south west blake was aware of vulnerability of taunton which unlike many towns and cities of time did not have any town walls ellison 1936 p 11 on eastern side of town which was most vulnerable he dug trenches outside eastern gate and erected a barricade across street within it at least three earthen forts were also built in that end of town king charles i held council in chard and shortly after ordered a royalist force numbering 3 000 troops to set up first siege of taunton bush 1977 p 76 initially sir francis dodington was going to command attack but only available men were those in bridgwater under command of colonel edmund wyndham siege began on 23 september 1644 wickenden 1947 p 85 wyndham was assisted in attack by his brother francis wyndham who brought his garrison from dunster castle and edward rodney who commanded an infantry regiment morris 1995 p 6 royalist forces initially set themselves up around town where they were able to use their artillery to bombard castle from west and town from east in his record of siege morris claims that besieging forces were unable to establish a presence in town and set up a wide perimeter roughly away however almost all other sources agree that after initial skirmishes royalists broke through eastern defences and forced blake s troops back into castle itself 1981 p 123 during siege edmund wyndham and blake exchanged letters wyndham initially wrote to explain that he felt siege was a gentle method of attack rather than using fire and sword he offered generous terms for surrender and signed letter your well wishing neighbour and country man pair had served as members of parliament together for bridgwater in 1640 blake was unmoved and wrote back to unequivocally reject offer blake sent skirmishing parties out against attackers with some success toulmin savage 1822 p 413 though food and ammunition began to run out for defending troops to further this wyndham heavily rationed town s population to prevent them smuggling food to garrison a petition to parliament for help was answered when sir william waller who commanded parliamentarian army in wiltshire sent a force of 3 000 men under command of his deputy major general james holborne in support of town venning 2015 p 163 wyndham had initially planned to attack holborne s forces at chard but instead retreated back to his garrison at bridgwater on 14 december he recorded that during his retreat enemy sallied upon me but they were so hungry that they could not follow me day after arrival of holborne a supply caravan containing food 2 000 muskets and 40 barrels of gunpowder restocked town wickenden 1947 p 86 fearing further royalist assaults holborne provided 1 000 of his own men as reinforcements for town s defence second siege in early 1645 blake sent raiding parties out from taunton that according to hyde controlled a large area and disrupted activities throughout somerset hyde 1816 p 796 around that time lord goring lieutenant general of south eastern counties in royalist army requested troops from king so that he could mount a large scale southeastern campaign memegalos 2007 pp 222 225 his request was rejected and he was despatched to south west instead he duly changed his focus electing to target first weymouth and then taunton both parliamentarian strongholds in area he took weymouth but was unable to hold it in face of parliamentarian reinforcements in a letter he received from king shortly after that loss he was ordered to gather royalist forces of area together in order to clear those parts of rebels forces thumb left upright john berkeley 1st baron berkeley of stratton struggled to assert his authority over royalist troops alt painting of john berkeley king sent orders for sir richard grenville and john berkeley to support goring in attack on taunton goring arrived outside taunton on 11 march and a sizeable part of berkeley s garrison from exeter arrived soon after grenville did not leave his siege of plymouth and coupled with threat from a parliamentarian force formed by waller and oliver cromwell combining their armies in hampshire attack on taunton was postponed venning 2015 p 178 after further urging from king and prince of wales grenville did eventually travel up towards taunton and was ordered to follow goring to support king in north as grenville s force of 3 000 men was considered too small to assault taunton granville 1908 pp 117 119 he refused claiming that he had promised commissioners of devon and cornwall that he would not advance beyond taunton hyde 1816 pp 799 800 while also boasting that he could claim town in ten days he was delegated command of siege venning 2015 p 181 and arrived outside taunton on 2 april only a day after his arrival grenville was injured while attacking wellington house and as wound was serious he was carried to exeter blockade set by grenville was initially some distance from town and did not prevent blake from sending and receiving messages wickenden 1947 pp 86 87 besieging army was reinforced soon after with goring s infantry and artillery units hyde 1816 p 801 and so with a large force attackers closed in on town establishing entrenchments within musket shot of taunton s defences command of siege passed to berkeley though grenville s troops often failed to follow new commander s orders and some of them deserted memegalos 2007 p 243 despite grenville s retirement from battle due to injury he and berkeley clashed grenville complained to prince of wales that berkeley was conducting siege badly while berkeley claimed that grenville had given his men orders to desert memegalos 2007 p 247 these disagreements led hopton by now commander of royalist forces in west country to be given command of siege ellison 1936 p 14 purkiss 2006 p 438 as siege continued supplies once again began to run out for defending army and parliament identified relief of taunton as being a priority on 28 april they ordered thomas fairfax commander in chief of recently established new model army to relieve town ellison 1936 p 15 fairfax marched with whole of his army towards taunton royalists considered sending their own army to meet him before he could reach london but prince rupert convinced them instead to focus on conquering north of england hibbert 1993 p 201 in response to royalist movement north fairfax split his own army in two sending a force of between 6 000 and 7 000 on to taunton under colonel ralph weldon while fairfax led rest north aware that parliamentarians under fairfax were on their way hopton increased attacks on town on 6 may further attacks following day focused on east side of town first bombarding it with cannon shot and then storming earthen redoubt that blake had established after some early success in which they captured one of earthen forts attackers were forced back by a combination of musket shot stones and boiling water next day after yet more attacks made little impact hopton staged a battle on south side of town between two parties of his own army in an attempt to make blake believe parliamentarian army had arrived hopton hoped that blake would send out some of his own men to support relieving force but feint failed wickenden 1947 pp 87 88 that evening at around 7 pm royalist force which consisted of around 4 200 infantry and 2 000 cavalry launched an all out assault against town morris 1995 p 7 in heavy fighting attackers captured two of earthen forts on eastern side of town and broke through defences once inside blake s outer perimeter besieging army discovered that there were parliamentarian musketeers within every house which prevented them advancing any further though they did set fire to buildings hoping to force defenders to retreat tactic failed when wind blew flames back towards royalists halting their attack morris 1995 pp 7 8 attack was renewed around 11 am on 9 may and over next seven hours hopton s army advanced slowly through town his forces pushed parliamentarian troops back one building at a time until they were left with only a small area of land in middle of town within perimeter was castle an entrenchment in market square st mary magdalene church and an earthen defence known as maiden s fort morris 1995 p 8 by this time a combination of artillery and arson attacks had set most of east side of town on fire an attempt by three people two men and a woman to set fires inside remaining defences was quashed and culprits lynched further assaults were made on 10 may along with a demand for blake and his men to surrender to which blake responded that he had four pairs of boots left and would eat three of them before he yielded weldon s relieving force had met with small parties of royalist army around chard and and they sent an advance party ahead of them which reached orchard portman roughly south of taunton on 10 may fearing that they were facing entirety of fairfax s army hopton ordered his forces to abandon their attacks and retreat to bridgwater as they left they felled trees across roads to slow parliamentarian advance ellison 1936 p 16 weldon s army arrived in taunton on 11 may relieving and restocking town accounts of taunton s losses vary between 50 and 200 killed with 200 or more casualties on top of that while two thirds of houses in town had been razed having relieved taunton weldon and his army left following day and marched eastwards third siege thumb right upright george goring lord goring renewed royalist siege in 1645 alt painting of lord goring over course of siege lord goring had been with king in oxford and on 10 may he returned to bristol with a royal warrant pronouncing him commander of royalist army in west country replacing hopton goring began his operations by harrying weldon s army and forcing them to retreat back to taunton goring commanding about 10 000 men established a third siege of town in under a year he ignored orders from king for him to support royalist efforts in midlands claiming that taunton would be taken in a few days despite his promises he soon discovered that his army was too small to enact a rapid takeover of town and he established a loose blockade hyde who is frequently scathing of goring in his description of civil war recalls that goring was so far from making any advance upon taunton that he grew much more negligent in it than he had been suffered provisions in great quantities to be carried into town hyde 1816 p 834 as well as being lax in his siege goring was often drunk and reminiscent of earlier siege was deserted by many of his troops hibbert 1993 p 214 regional commander of parliamentarian forces colonel edward massey was ordered to relieve taunton in june but he could only raise 3 000 men far less than was needed to dispel goring s army morris 1995 p 11 new model army with fairfax at their head were busy in midlands defeating bulk of royalist army at battle of naseby described by modern sources as decisive clash of english civil war goring had been ordered by king to abandon his siege and join royalist forces at naseby and it has been suggested by modern historians that with his forces and his leadership royalists might have won battle immediately after securing that victory fairfax led his army down towards taunton once again hibbert 1993 p 220 aware of approaching army lord goring mounted a final assault on town hoping to catch blake unaware by sending his cavalry towards town on 9 july attack was neutralised by a section of fairfax s army in ilminster and goring withdrew from taunton to meet fairfax at battle of langport relieving third and final siege of taunton during english civil war aftermath in his history of taunton h j wickenden suggests that over half of town was burned or destroyed during three sieges wickenden 1947 p 92 while diane purkiss claims that it was as high as two thirds of town purkiss 2006 p 439 several compensation payouts were made to town and some of its residents funded by fines against those who had fought for royalists such as sir william portman who had been member of parliament for taunton at outbreak of war and was fined ps7 000 although parliamentarians destroyed many of castles that had featured in civil war taunton castle was considered a parliamentarian stronghold and remained intact in 1647 only two years after end of sieges castle was sold as part of estate of taunton manor wickenden 1947
