hurricane florence was a strong late season hurricane that remained out over open waters of central atlantic for nearly a week before being absorbed into a large extratropical cyclone with peak winds of 110 mph 175 km h and a minimum pressure of 972 mbar hpa 28 71 inhg florence was strongest storm of 1994 atlantic hurricane season florence developed out of an area of low pressure associated with a stalled frontal system located 1 150 mi 1 850 km east southeast of bermuda in late october system gradually became better organized and was classified a subtropical depression on november 2 storm intensified into a subtropical storm shortly thereafter before weakening into a tropical depression on next day after gaining tropical characteristics throughout most of day on november 3 storm was designated tropical depression eleven depression quickly strengthened into tropical storm florence sixth named storm of season storm briefly underwent rapid intensification strengthening into a hurricane before leveling out as a category 1 hurricane florence was subsequently upgraded to a category 2 hurricane on november 7 however a large extratropical cyclone located to north caused hurricane to rapidly accelerate with forward speeds reaching 58 mph 93 km h by next day florence lost its identity while still producing hurricane force winds as it was absorbed by extratropical cyclone meteorological history origins of florence can be traced back to an area of low pressure which developed in late october along a stationary front located 1 150 mi 1 850 km east southeast of bermuda low gradually detached from front and began developing convective banding features system was not fully tropical as strongest winds were recorded a couple hundred miles from center leading to system being classified a subtropical cyclone on morning of november 2 minor intensification followed shortly after and subtropical depression was upgraded to a subtropical storm this was based on ship reports of 40 mph 65 km h sustained winds associated with system by november 3 storm became slightly disorganized and was downgraded to a subtropical depression by afternoon subtropical system began to undergo a transition from a subtropical system to tropical system later that day storm was classified tropical depression eleven while located 875 mi 1 400 km east southeast of bermuda depression was moving towards northwest at 8 mph 13 km h and same general motion was expected as a large upper level low situated over system was forecast to move towards northeast leading to eleven moving around periphery of low depression was upgraded to tropical storm florence next morning however outflow from storm remained poor as upper level low was still interacting with center of florence and storm was still not completely tropical but there was slight improvement by afternoon of november 4 florence completed its transition into a tropical cyclone and deep convection developed causing storm to quickly intensity with winds increasing by 20 mph 30 km h in a 6 hour time period trend in intensification was forecast to continue and florence was forecast to become second hurricane of season within 12 hours late on november 4 florence was upgraded to a hurricane as a solid area of deep convection developed around center of circulation an eye feature also appeared on infrared satellite but was not associated with significant strengthening florence slowly intensified as eye persisted and structure slightly improved by morning of november 6 eye became less defined and cloud tops around it warmed storm also shifted its forward motion northward as trough located to southeast began to move towards east moving steering currents with it as low moved further to east steering currents in area of florence weakened leading to storm stalling late on november 6 right thumb eye of hurricane florence on november 7 as seen from space shuttle atlantis by morning of november 7 eye began to reappear and storm turned towards northwest and forward motion began to rapidly increase later that morning florence had developed a large 35 to 40 mi 55 to 65 km h wide eye and forward motion continued to increase intensification continued and by afternoon hours florence was upgraded to a category 2 hurricane with winds of 100 mph 155 km h a strong extratropical cyclone located to north of florence was causing storm to move towards northwest at a rapid pace of 30 mph 48 km h operationally florence was reported to have peaked at that intensity but post season analysis determined that storm reached its peak intensity just short of major hurricane a storm with winds of 111 mph 178 km h or higher status late on november 7 by morning of november 8 florence weakened slightly to category 1 status large system to north continued to cause florence to move at 58 mph 93 km h since storm was very close to a cold front florence was expected to rapidly transition into an extratropical cyclone later that morning florence was absorbed into extratropical cyclone while still maintaining hurricane force winds impact and naming as florence remained out over open waters of central atlantic no effects damages or fatalities were reported no tropical storm watches or warnings were issued and storm was never forecast to strike land see also other storms of same name
