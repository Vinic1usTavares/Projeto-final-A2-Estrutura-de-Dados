calabria battle was fought outside city of dyrrhachium present day durres in albania major byzantine stronghold in western balkans and ended in a norman victory following norman conquest of byzantine italy and saracen sicily byzantine emperor michael vii doukas r 1071 1078 betrothed his son to robert guiscard s daughter when michael was deposed robert took this as an excuse to invade byzantine empire in 1081 his army laid siege to dyrrhachium but his fleet was defeated by venetians on october 18 normans engaged a byzantine army under alexios i komnenos outside dyrrhachium battle began with byzantine right wing routing norman left wing which broke and fled varangian mercenaries joined in pursuit of fleeing normans but became separated from main force and were massacred norman knights in centre attacked byzantine centre and routed it causing bulk of byzantine army to rout after this victory normans took dyrrhachium in february 1082 and advanced inland capturing most of macedonia and thessaly robert was then forced to leave greece to deal with an attack on his ally pope by holy roman emperor henry iv r 1084 1105 robert left his son bohemond in charge of army in greece bohemond was initially successful defeating alexios in several battles but was defeated by alexios outside larissa in 1083 forced to retreat to italy bohemond lost all territory gained by normans in campaign byzantine recovery began komnenian restoration background normans first arrived in southern italy in 1015 from northern france and served local lombard lords as mercenaries against byzantine empire as they were paid with lands soon they were powerful enough to challenge papal authority in 1054 they defeated pope at battle of civitate forcing him to acknowledge their authority in 1059 pope made robert guiscard of hauteville family duke of apulia calabria and sicily however most of apulia and calabria were in byzantine hands and sicily was in saracen hands by 1071 robert together with his brother roger had taken over last byzantine stronghold in italy bari by next year they conquered all of sicily ending islamic emirate of sicily in 1073 byzantine emperor michael vii sent an envoy to robert offering hand of his son constantine to robert s daughter helena anna comnena alexiad 1 12 guiscard accepted offer and sent his daughter to constantinople however in 1078 michael was overthrown by nicephorus botaneiates an event that destroyed any chances helena had for throne anna comnena alexiad 1 12 this gave robert a motive to invade empire claiming his daughter had been mistreated however his intervention was delayed by a revolt in italy robert conscripted all men of a fighting age into army which he refitted meanwhile he sent an ambassador to byzantine court with orders to demand proper treatment for helena and to win over domestic of schools alexios anna comnena alexiad 1 15 results of these attempts remain unknown but ambassador fell under alexios s charm and as he was returning to italy he heard of alexios s successful coup against botaneiates by which he became alexios i komnenos when ambassador returned he urged robert to make peace claiming that alexios wanted nothing but friendship with normans robert had no intention of peace he sent his son bohemond with an advance force towards greece and bohemond landed at aulon with robert following shortly after anna comnena alexiad 1 15 prelude norman fleet of 150 ships including 60 horse transports set off towards byzantine empire at end of may 1081 army numbered 15 000 men including about 1 300 norman knights france p 128 fleet sailed to avalona in byzantine territory they were joined by several ships from ragusa a republic in balkans who were enemies of byzantines robert soon left avalona and sailed to island of corfu which surrendered because of a small garrison having won a bridgehead and a clear path for reinforcements from italy he advanced on city of dyrrhachium capital and chief port of illyria city was well defended on a long narrow peninsula running parallel to coast but separated by marshlands guiscard brought his army onto peninsula and pitched camp outside city walls however as robert s fleet sailed to dyrrhachium it was hit by a storm and lost several ships meanwhile when alexios heard that normans were preparing to invade byzantine territory he sent an ambassador to doge of venice domenico selvo requesting aid and offering trading rights in return doge alarmed by norman control of strait of otranto took command of venetian fleet and sailed at once surprising norman fleet under command of bohemond as night was falling normans counter attacked tenaciously but their inexperience in naval combat betrayed them experienced venetian navy attacked in a close formation known as sea harbour and together with their use of greek fire bombs norman line scattered and venetian fleet sailed into dyrrhachium s harbour siege of dyrrhachium 175px thumb left coin of robert guiscard robert was not discouraged by this naval defeat and began his siege of dyrrhachium in command of garrison at dyrrhachium was experienced general george palaiologos sent by alexios with orders to hold out at all costs while alexios himself mustered an army to relieve city meanwhile a byzantine fleet arrived and after joining with venetian fleet attacked norman fleet which was again routed garrison at dyrrhachium managed to hold out all summer despite robert s catapults ballistae and siege tower garrison made continuous sallies from city on one occasion palaiologos fought all day with an arrowhead in his skull another sally succeeded in destroying robert s siege tower robert s camp was struck by disease according to contemporary historian anna comnena up to 10 000 men died including 500 knights anna comnena alexiad 4 3 even so situation of dyrrhachium garrison grew desperate because of effects of norman siege weapons alexios learned of this while he was in salonica with his army so he advanced in full force against normans according to comnena alexios had about 20 000 men historian john haldon puts army s size between 18 000 and 20 000 men while john birkenmeier estimates it between 20 25 000 men it consisted of thracian and macedonian tagmata which numbered about 5 000 men elite excubitors and units which numbered around 1 000 men a force of manichaeans which comprised 2 800 men thessalian cavalry balkan conscripts armenian infantry and other light troops as well as native troops byzantines were joined by 2 000 turkish and 1 000 frankish mercenaries about 1 000 varangians and 7 000 turkish auxiliaries sent by seljuk sultanate of rum alexios also withdrew from heraclea pontica and remaining byzantine holdings in asia minor and by doing so he effectively left them to be overrun by turks battle initial moves right upright thumb a manuscript depicting alexios alexios advanced from salonica and pitched camp on river near dyrrhachium on october 15 anna comnena alexiad 4 5 he held a war council there and sought advice from his senior officers among them was george palaiologos who had managed to sneak out of city a majority of senior officers including palaiologos urged caution noting that time was with emperor alexios however favoured an immediate assault hoping to catch guiscard s army from rear while they were still besieging city alexios moved his army to hills opposite city planning to attack normans next day anna comnena alexiad 4 5 guiscard however had been informed of alexios arrival by his scouts and on night of october 17 he moved his army from peninsula to mainland upon learning of guiscard s move alexios revised his battle plan he split his army into three divisions with left wing under command of gregory pakourianos right wing under command of nikephoros melissenos and himself in command of centre guiscard formed his battle line opposite alexios s with right wing under command of count of left under bohemond and guiscard facing alexios in centre varangians had been ordered to march just in front of main line with a strong division of archers a little behind them archers had been commanded to move in front of varangians and fire a volley before retreating behind them archers continued this tactic until army neared contact as opposing armies closed in guiscard sent a detachment of cavalry positioned in centre to feint an attack on byzantine positions guiscard hoped feint would draw up varangians however this plan failed when cavalry was forced back by archers norman right wing suddenly charged forward to point where byzantine left and centre met directing its attack against varangian left flank varangians stood their ground while byzantine left including some of alexios elite troops attacked normans norman formation disintegrated and routed normans fled towards beach there according to comnena they were rallied by guiscard s wife described as like another pallas if not a second athena byzantine collapse left thumb varangian guard in meantime byzantine right and centre had been engaging in skirmishes with normans opposite them however with collapse of norman right knights were in danger of being outflanked at this point varangians mainly anglo saxons who had left england after norman conquest joined in pursuit of norman right with their massive battle axes varangians attacked norman knights who were driven away after their horses panicked varangians soon became separated from main force and exhausted so they were in no position to resist an assault guiscard sent a strong force of spearmen and crossbowmen against varangian flank and inflicted heavy casualties on them few remaining varangians fled into church of archangel michael normans immediately set church on fire and all varangians perished in blaze anna comnena alexiad 4 6 meanwhile george palaiologos sortied out of dyrrhachium but failed to save situation alexios s ally serbian king constantine bodin stayed aside with his army intending to await outcome of battle when byzantines were defeated and started to flee bodin retreated with his army turks who had been lent to him by seljuk sultan suleyman i followed constantine s example deprived of his left wing still in pursuit of norman right alexios was exposed in centre guiscard sent his heavy cavalry against byzantine centre they first routed byzantine skirmishers before breaking into small detachments and smashing into various points of byzantine line this charge broke byzantine lines and caused them to rout imperial camp which had been left unguarded fell to normans alexios and his guards resisted as long as they could before retreating as they retreated alexios was separated from his guard and was attacked by norman soldiers while escaping he was wounded in his forehead and lost a lot of blood but eventually made it back to ohrid where he regrouped his army aftermath battle was a heavy defeat for alexios historian jonathan harris states that defeat was every bit as severe as that at manzikert he lost about 5 000 of his men including most of varangians norman losses are unknown but john haldon claims they are substantial as both wings broke and fled historian robert holmes states new knightly tactic of charging with lance couched tucked firmly under arm to unite impact of man and horse proved a battle winner george palaiologos had not been able to re enter city after battle and left with main force defense of citadel was left to venetians while city itself was left to count of tent or byzantine provincial administrators mobilizing from arbanon i e ex arbanon komiskorte term komiskorte is short for tes meaning count of tent anna comnena alexiad 4 8 in february 1082 dyrrhachium fell after a venetian or citizen opened gates to normans anna comnena alexiad 5 1 norman army proceeded to take most of northern greece without facing much resistance while guiscard was in kastoria messengers arrived from italy bearing news that apulia calabria and campania were in revolt he also learned that holy roman emperor henry iv was at gates of rome and besieging pope gregory vii a norman ally alexios had negotiated with henry and given him 360 000 gold pieces in return for an alliance henry responded by invading italy and attacking pope guiscard rushed to italy leaving bohemond in command of army in greece anna comnena alexiad 5 3 alexios desperate for money ordered confiscation of all church s treasure with this money alexios mustered an army near thessalonica and went to fight bohemond however bohemond defeated alexios in two battles one near arta and other near ioannina this left bohemond in control of macedonia and nearly all of thessaly anna comnena alexiad 5 4 bohemond advanced with his army against city of larissa meanwhile alexios had mustered a new army and with 7 000 seljuk turks sent by sultan he advanced on normans at larissa and defeated them anna comnena alexiad 5 5 5 6 demoralised and unpaid norman army returned to coast and sailed back to italy anna comnena alexiad 5 7 meanwhile alexios granted venetians a commercial colony in constantinople as well as exemption from trading duties in return for their renewed aid they responded by recapturing dyrrhachium and corfu and returning them to byzantine empire these victories
