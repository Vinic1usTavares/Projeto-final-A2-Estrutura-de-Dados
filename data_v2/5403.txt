neferirkare kakai known in greek as nefercheres was an ancient egyptian pharaoh third king of fifth dynasty neferirkare eldest son of sahure with his consort meretnebty was known as ranefer a before he came to throne he acceded day after his father s death and reigned for eight to eleven years sometime in early to mid 25th century bce he was himself very likely succeeded by his eldest son born of his queen khentkaus ii prince ranefer b who would take throne as king neferefre neferirkare fathered another pharaoh nyuserre ini who took throne after neferefre s short reign and brief rule of poorly known shepseskare neferirkare was acknowledged by his contemporaries as a kind and benevolent ruler intervening in favour of his courtiers after a mishap his rule witnessed a growth in number of administration and priesthood officials who used their expanded wealth to build architecturally more sophisticated mastabas where they recorded their biographies for first time neferirkare was last pharaoh to significantly modify standard royal titulary separating nomen or birth name from prenomen or throne name from his reign onwards former was written in a cartouche preceded by son of ra epithet his rule witnessed continuing trade relations with nubia to south and possibly with byblos on levantine coast to north neferirkare started a pyramid for himself in royal necropolis of abusir called ba neferirkare meaning neferirkare is a ba it was initially planned to be a step pyramid a form which had not been employed since days of third dynasty circa 120 years earlier this plan was modified to transform monument into a true pyramid largest in abusir which was never completed owing to death of king in addition neferirkare built a temple to sun god ra called setibre that is site of heart of ra ancient sources state that it was largest one built during fifth dynasty but as of early 21st century it has not yet been located after his death neferirkare benefited from a funerary cult taking place in his mortuary temple which had been completed by his son nyuserre ini this cult seems to have disappeared at end of old kingdom period although it might have been revived during twelfth dynasty of middle kingdom albeit in a very limited form in all probability it was also around this time that story of papyrus westcar was first written a tale where userkaf sahure and neferirkare are said to be brothers sons of ra with a woman rededjet sources thumb upright alt three hieroglyphs in a cartouche neferirkare s nomen kakai on abydos king list contemporaneous sources neferirkare is well attested in sources contemporaneous with his reign beyond his pyramid complex he is mentioned in tomb of many of his contemporaries such as his vizier washptah courtier rawer and priest neferirkare also appears in nearly contemporaneous giza writing board a short list grouping six kings from different dynasties dating to later fifth or early sixth dynasty writing board was uncovered in tomb of a high official named who may have composed it for his use in afterlife historical sources neferirkare is attested in two ancient egyptian king lists both dating to new kingdom earliest of these is abydos king list written during reign of seti i fl 1290 1279 bce there neferirkare s nomen kakai occupies 28th entry in between those of sahure and neferefre during subsequent reign of ramesses ii fl 1279 1213 bce neferirkare s prenomen was recorded on 27th entry of saqqara tablet but this time as a successor of sahure and predecessor of shepseskare neferirkare was also given an entry in turin canon a document dating to reign of ramesses ii as well neferirkare s entry is commonly believed to be in third column 19th row unfortunately this line has been lost in a large lacuna affecting papyrus and neither his reign length nor his successor can be ascertained from surviving fragments egyptologist miroslav verner has furthermore proposed that turin canon makes a new dynasty start with this entry and thus that neferirkare would be its founder division of turin canon list of kings into dynasties is a currently debated topic egyptologist jaromir malek for example sees divisions between groups of kings occurring in canon as marking transfers of royal residence rather than rise and fall of royal dynasties as this term is currently understood that usage only began in egyptian context with 3rd century bce work of priest manetho similarly egyptologist stephan considers break in turin canon at end of eighth dynasty to represent relocation of royal residence from memphis to egyptologist john baines holds views that are closer to verner s believing that canon was divided into dynasties with totals for time elapsed given at end of each though only a few such divisions have survived similarly professor john van views breaks in canon as divisions between dynasties but in contrast states that criterion for these divisions remains unknown he speculates that pattern of dynasties may have been taken from nine divine kings of greater and lesser enneads egyptologist ian shaw believes that turin canon gives some credibility to manetho s division of dynasties but considers king lists to be a form of ancestor worship and not a historical record this whole problem could be mooted by another of verner s speculations where he proposes that neferirkare s entry may have been located on 20th line rather than 19th as is usually believed this would credit neferirkare with a seven year reign and would make sahure dynasty founder according to hypothesis that canon records such events archaeological evidence has established that transitions from userkaf to sahure and from sahure to neferirkare were father son transitions so that neither sahure nor neferirkare can be dynasty founders in modern sense of term neferirkare was mentioned in aegyptiaca a history of egypt written in 3rd century bce during reign of ptolemy ii 283 246 bce by manetho no copies of aegyptiaca have survived to this day and it is now known only through later writings by sextus julius africanus and eusebius byzantine scholar george syncellus reports that africanus relates that aegyptiaca mentioned succession sephres nefercheres sisires for early fifth dynasty sephres nefercheres and sisires are believed to be hellenized forms for sahure neferirkare and shepseskare respectively thus manetho s reconstruction of fifth dynasty is in agreement with saqqara tablet in africanus epitome of aegyptiaca nefercheres is reported to have reigned for 20 years family parents and siblings thumb upright 1 5 alt large papyrus full of cursive inscriptions in black and occasional red ink riddled with small holes westcar papyrus on display in museum dates to 17th dynasty but its story was probably first written during 12th dynasty until 2005 identity of neferirkare s parents was uncertain some egyptologists including nicolas grimal william c hayes hartwig altenmuller aidan dodson and dyan hilton viewed him as a son of userkaf and khentkaus i and a brother to his predecessor sahure main impetus behind this theory was papyrus westcar an ancient egyptian story narrating rise of fifth dynasty in it a magician prophesizes to that future demise of his lineage will be in form of three brothers first three kings of fifth dynasty born of god ra and a woman named rededjet egyptologists such as verner have sought to discern a historical truth in this account proposing that sahure and neferirkare were siblings born of queen khentkaus i in 2005 excavations of causeway leading up to sahure s pyramid yielded new relief fragments which showed indisputably that pharaoh sahure and his consort queen meretnebty were neferirkare s parents indeed these reliefs discovered by verner and tarek el awady depict sahure and meretnebty together with their two sons ranefer and netjerirenre while both sons are given title of king s eldest son possibly indicating that they were twins ranefer is shown closer to sahure and also given title of chief lector priest which may reflect that he was born first and thus given higher positions since ranefer is known to have been name of neferirkare before he took throne as indicated by reliefs from mortuary temple of sahure see below no doubt remains as to neferirkare s filiation nothing more is known about netjerirenre an observation which has led verner and el awady to speculate that he could have attempted to seize throne upon unexpected death of neferirkare s son and successor neferefre who died in his early twenties after two years on throne in this conjectural hypothesis he would be ephemeral shepseskare finally same relief as well as an additional one record a further four sons of sahure and identity of their mother s is unknown so they are at minimum half brothers to neferirkare 160px x130px x130px x130px x130px fragments of reliefs from mortuary temple of sahure showing neferirkare as a prince reliefs were altered during latter s reign with addition of royal titles and regalia consort and children as of early 21st century only known queen of neferirkare is khentkaus ii this is due to position of her pyramid next to that of neferirkare as was normal for consort of a king as well as her title of king s wife and several reliefs representing both of them together neferirkare could possibly have had at least one other spouse as suggested by presence of a small pyramid next to that of khentkaus but this remains conjectural thumb upright alt bust and head of a pharaoh holding a flail statue of neferefre neferirkare s eldest son discovered in his mortuary temple by paule posener krieger neferirkare and his consort khentkaus ii were in all likelihood parents of prince ranefer b future pharaoh neferefre this relationship is confirmed by a relief on a limestone slab discovered in a house in village near abusir depicting neferirkare and his wife khentkaus with king s eldest son ranefer a name identical with some variants of neferefre s own this indicates that just as for neferirkare ranefer was neferefre s name when he was still only a crown prince that is before his accession to throne neferirkare and khentkaus ii had at least one other child together future pharaoh nyuserre ini indeed neferirkare s consort khentkaus ii is known to have been nyuserre s mother since excavations of her mortuary temple yielded a fragmentary relief showing her facing nyuserre and his family remarkably on this relief both khentkaus and nyuserre appear on same scale an observation which may be connected with khentkaus enhanced status during nyuserre s reign as he sought to legitimise his rule following premature death of neferefre and possible challenge by shepseskare further evidence for filiation of nyuserre are location of his pyramid next to that of neferirkare as well as his reuse for his own valley temple of materials from s unfinished constructions yet another son of neferirkare and has been proposed probably younger than both neferefre and nyuserre a prince iry pat whose relationship is suggested by fact that his funerary cult was associated with that of his mother both having taken place in temple of khentkaus ii finally neferirkare and khentkaus ii may also be parents of queen khentkaus iii whose tomb was discovered in abusir in 2015 indeed based on location and general date for her tomb as well as her titles of king s wife and king s mother khentkaus iii was almost certainly neferefre s consort and mother of either menkauhor kaiu or shepseskare reign duration manetho s aegyptiaca assigns neferirkare a reign of 20 years but archaeological evidence now suggests that this is an overestimate first damaged palermo stone preserves year of 5th cattle count for neferirkare s time on throne cattle count was an important event aimed at evaluating amount of taxes to be levied on population by reign of neferirkare this involved counting cattle oxen and small livestock this event is believed to have been biennial during old kingdom period that is occurring once every two years meaning that neferirkare reigned at least ten years given shape of palermo stone this record must correspond to his final year or be close to it so that he ruled no more than eleven years this is further substantiated by two cursive inscriptions left by masons on stone blocks from pyramids of khentkaus ii and neferirkare both of which also date to neferirkare s fifth cattle count its highest known regnal year finally verner has pointed out that a 20 year long reign would be difficult to reconcile with unfinished state of his pyramid in abusir activities in egypt thumb upright alt tall vase covered in blue faience and gold motifs reconstruction of a ritual vase made of sycamore wood with faience and gold showing neferirkare s cartouche and found in his mortuary temple now in egyptian museum of berlin beyond his construction of a pyramid and sun temple little is known of neferirkare s activities during his time on throne some events dating to his first and final years of reign are recorded on surviving fragments of palermo stone a royal annal covering period from start of reign of menes of first dynasty until around time of neferirkare s rule according to palermo stone future pharaoh neferirkare then called prince ranefer ascended throne day after his father sahure s death which occurred on 28th day of ninth month annal then records that in his first year as king neferirkare granted land to agricultural estates serving cults of ennead souls of pe and nekhen and gods of to ra and hathor he dedicated an offering table provided with 210 daily offerings and ordered construction of two store rooms and employment of new dependents in host temple neferirkare also commanded fashioning and opening of mouth of an electrum statue of god ihy escorting it to mrt chapel of of shrine of hathor later in his reign in year of fifth cattle count neferirkare had a bronze statue of himself erected and set up four barques for ra and horus in and around his sun temple two of which were of copper souls of pe and nekhen and wadjet received electrum endowments while ptah was given lands fact that palermo stone terminates around neferirkare s rule led some scholars such as grimal to propose that they might have been compiled during his reign administration few specific administrative actions taken by neferirkare are known one decree of his inscribed on a limestone slab was excavated in 1903 in abydos and is now in boston museum of fine arts decree exempts personnel belonging to a temple of khenti amentiu from undertaking compulsory labour in perpetuity under penalty of forfeiture of all property and freedom and be forced to work fields or in a stone quarry this decree indirectly suggests that taxation and compulsory labour was imposed on everybody as a general rule more generally neferirkare s reign saw growth of egyptian administration and priesthood which amassed more power than in earlier reigns although king remained a living god in particular positions of viziers and overseer of expedition that is highest offices were opened to people from outside royal family in conjunction with this trend mastabas of high officials started to become more elaborate with for example chapels including multiple rooms and from mid to late fifth dynasty wide entrance porticoes with columns and family tomb complexes it is also at this time that these officials started to record autobiographies on walls of their tombs modification of royal titulary reign of neferirkare kakai saw last important modification to titulary of pharaohs he was earliest pharaoh to separate nswt bjtj king of upper and lower egypt and s3 r son of ra epithets of royal titulary he associated these two epithets with two different independent names prenomen and nomen respectively prenomen or throne name taken by new king as he ascended throne was written in a cartouche immediately after bee and sedge signs for nswt bjtj from neferirkare s time onwards nomen or birth name was also written in a cartouche systematically preceded by glyphs for son of ra an epithet which had seen little use in preceding times trade and military activities there is little evidence for military action during neferirkare s reign william c hayes proposed that a few fragmentary limestone statues of kneeling and bound prisoners of war discovered in his mortuary temple possibly attest to punitive raids in libya to west or sinai and canaan to east during his reign art historian william stevenson smith commented that such statues were customary elements of decoration of royal temples and mastabas suggesting that they may not be immediately related to actual military campaigns similar statues and small wooden figures of kneeling captives were discovered in mortuary complexes of neferefre djedkare isesi unas teti pepi i and pepi ii as well as in tomb of vizier senedjemib mehi trade relations with nubia are only ones attested to during neferirkare s reign archaeological evidence for this are seal impressions and ostracon bearing his name uncovered in fortress of buhen on second cataract of nile contacts with byblos on levantine coast might also have happened during neferirkare s rule as suggested by a single alabaster bowl inscribed with his name unearthed there personality thumb upright 77 alt relief on stone showing profile of a man wearing a linen robe and holding a staff relief showing ptahshepses found in his mastaba ptahshepses was given rare honour of kissing neferirkare s feet neferirkare s reign was unusual for significant number of surviving contemporary records which describe him as a kind and gentle ruler when rawer an elderly nobleman and royal courtier was accidentally touched by king s mace during a religious ceremony a dangerous situation which could have caused this official to be put immediately to death or banished from court since pharaoh was viewed as a living god in old kingdom mythology neferirkare quickly pardoned rawer and commanded that no harm should occur to latter for incident as rawer gratefully states in an inscription from his giza tomb similarly neferirkare gave priest of ptah ptahshepses unprecedented honour of kissing his feet rather than ground in front of him finally when vizier washptah suffered a stroke while attending court king quickly summoned palace s chief doctors to treat his dying vizier when washptah died neferirkare was reportedly inconsolable and retired to his personal quarters to mourn loss of his friend king then ordered purification of washptah s body in his presence and ordered an ebony coffin made for deceased vizier washptah was buried with special endowments and rituals courtesy of neferirkare records of king s actions are inscribed in washptah s tomb itself and emphasize neferirkare s humanity towards his subjects building activities pyramid complex pyramid thumb upright 1 5 alt large but ruined pyramid made of limestone and bricks in desert pyramid of neferirkare kakai pyramid of neferirkare kakai known to ancient egyptians as ba neferirkare and variously translated as neferirkare is a ba or neferirkare takes form is located in royal necropolis of abusir it is largest one built during fifth dynasty equalling roughly size of pyramid of menkaure pyramid construction comprised three stages first built were six steps of rubble their retaining walls made of locally quarried limestone indicating that monument was originally planned to be a step pyramid an unusual design for time which had not been used since third dynasty some 120 years earlier at this point pyramid had it been completed would have reached this plan was then altered by a second construction stage with addition of filling between steps meant to transform monument into a true pyramid at a later stage workers enlarged pyramid further adding a girdle of masonry and smooth casing stones of red granite this work was never finished even after works implemented by nyuserre with a square base of sides pyramid would have reached high had it been completed today it is in ruins owing to extensive stone robbing entrance to pyramid s substructures was located on its north side there a descending corridor with a gable roof made of limestone beams led into a burial chamber no pieces of sarcophagus of king were found there pyramid of neferirkare is surrounded by smaller pyramids and tombs which seem to form an architectural unit cemetery of his close family this ensemble was meant to be reached from nile via a causeway and a valley temple near river at death of neferirkare only foundations of both had been laid and nyuserre later diverted unfinished causeway to his own pyramid mortuary temple mortuary temple was far from finished at death of neferirkare but it was completed later by his sons neferefre and nyuserre ini using cheap mudbricks and wood rather than stone a significant cache of administrative papyri known as abusir papyri was uncovered there by illegal diggers in 1893 and subsequently by borchardt in 1903 further papyri were also uncovered in mid seventies during a university of prague egyptological institute excavation presence of this cache is due to peculiar historical circumstances of mid fifth dynasty as both neferirkare and his heir neferefre died before their pyramid complexes could be finished nyuserre altered their planned layout diverting causeway leading to neferirkare s pyramid to his own this meant that neferefre s and neferirkare s mortuary complexes became somewhat isolated on abusir plateau their priests therefore had to live next to temple premises in makeshift dwellings and they stored administrative records onsite in contrast records of other temples were kept in pyramid town close to sahure s or nyuserre s pyramid where current level of ground water means any papyrus has long since disappeared abusir papyri record some details pertaining to neferirkare s mortuary temple its central chapel housed a niche with five statues of king central one is described in papyri as being a representation of king as osiris while first and last ones depicted him as king of upper and lower egypt respectively temple also comprised store rooms for offerings where numerous stone vessels now broken had been deposited finally papyri indicate that of four boats included in mortuary complex two were buried to north and south of pyramid one of which was unearthed by verner during late period of ancient egypt 664 332 bce mortuary temple of neferirkare was used as a secondary cemetery a gravestone made of yellow calcite was discovered by borchardt bearing an aramaic inscription reading belonging to son of another inscription in aramaic found on a limestone block and dating to fifth century bce reads son of sewa sun temple neferirkare is known from ancient sources to have built a temple to sun god ra which is yet to be identified archaeologically it was called setibre meaning site of heart of ra and was according to contemporary sources largest one built during fifth dynasty it is possible that temple was only built out of mudbricks with a planned completion in stone which had not started when neferirkare died in this case it would rapidly have turned into ruins that would be very difficult to locate for archaeologists alternatively egyptologist rainer stadelmann has proposed that setibre as well as sun temples of sahure and userkaf were one and same known building that attributed to userkaf in abusir this hypothesis has been dispelled in late 2018 thanks to advanced analyses of verso of palermo stone by czech institute of archeology which enabled reading of inscriptions mentioning precisely architecture of temple as well as lists of donations it received of all sun temples built during fifth dynasty setibre is one most commonly cited in ancient sources due to this some details of its layout are known it had a large central obelisk an altar and store rooms a sealed barque room housing two boats and a hall of sed festival religious festivals did certainly take place in sun temples as is attested to by abusir papyri in case of setibre festival of night of ra is specifically said to have taken place there this was a festival concerned with ra s journey during night and connected with ideas of renewal and rebirth that were central to sun temples temple played an important role in distribution of food offerings which were brought everyday from there to mortuary temple of king this journey was made by boat indicating that setibre was not adjacent to neferirkare s pyramid this also underscores dependent position of king with respect to ra as offerings were made to sun god and then to deceased king sun temple of userkaf egyptologist werner kaiser proposed based on a study of evolution of hieroglyph determinative for sun temple that neferirkare completed sun temple of userkaf known in ancient egyptian as nekhenre sometime around fifth cattle count of his reign this opinion is shared by egyptologists and archaeologists ogden goelet mark lehner and herbert in this hypothesis neferirkare would have provided nekhenre with its monumental obelisk of limestone and red granite verner and egyptologist paule posener krieger have pointed out two difficulties with hypothesis firstly it would imply a long interlude between two phases of construction of userkaf s temple nearly 25 years between erection of temple and that of its obelisk secondly they observe that both pyramid and sun temple of neferirkare were unfinished at his death raising question as to why king would have devoted exceptional effort on a monument of userkaf when his own still required substantial works to be completed instead verner proposes that it was sahure who finished nekhenre
