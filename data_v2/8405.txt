cyclone mala was strongest tropical cyclone of 2006 north indian ocean cyclone season in mid april 2006 an area of disturbed weather formed over southern bay of bengal and nearby andaman sea over a period of several days system became increasingly organized and was classified as a depression on april 24 situated within a region of weak steering currents storm slowly intensified as it drifted in a general northward direction it attained gale force winds and was named mala next day conditions for strengthening improved markedly on april 27 and mala subsequently underwent rapid intensification which culminated in cyclone attaining its peak early on april 28 cyclone had estimated winds of 185 km h 115 mph joint typhoon warning center considered mala to have been slightly stronger classifying it as a category 4 equivalent cyclone steady weakening ensued thereafter and storm made landfall in myanmar s rakhine state on april 29 rapid dissipation took place once onshore and mala was last noted early next morning in contrast to mala s intensity damage was relatively minimal across myanmar due to adequate early warnings while timely and effective evacuations minimized loss of life along coast greatest damage resulted from a thunderstorm near yangon on april 28 that spawned a possible tornado in an industrial zone a total of 586 homes were damaged there just outside city in hinthada district a flash flood killed at least 18 people overall storm claimed 37 lives in country and left us 6 7 million in damage in wake of mala red cross distributed relief aid to affected residents while local officials set up shelters to house those left homeless government and social organizations donated 5 4 million kyat us 4 320 in cash to survivors in ayeyarwady region meteorological history in mid to late april 2006 a pulse in madden julian oscillation coupled with a kelvin wave which later contributed to formation of typhoon in western pacific enhanced convective activity over bay of bengal by april 22 a trough developed along an axis from southern bay of bengal eastward to andaman sea joint typhoon warning center jtwc began monitoring system for potential tropical cyclogenesis following day by 0600 utc on april 24 an area of low pressure formed southeast of andaman islands and india meteorological department imd began monitoring disturbance quickly organizing low developed into a tropical depression later on april 24 and jtwc began writing full advisories on cyclone without issuing a tropical cyclone formation alert organization slowed thereafter due to moderate wind shear but continued at a near climatological rate as upper level outflow allowed for continued convective development early on april 25 jtwc estimated system to have attained gale force winds imd followed suit later that day and subsequently assigned it name mala weak steering currents prompted slow and erratic movement with an overall northward trajectory thumb right cyclone mala on april 26 struggling to develop under strong wind shear forecasters at this time anticipated little intensification as system was expected to move into a region of higher shear however on april 27 system moved under a subtropical ridge and conditions quickly became favorable for intensification presence of ridge greatly enhanced outflow over cyclone and an eye developed by 1200 utc by this time both jtwc and imd estimated mala to have attained hurricane force winds with latter classifying it as a very severe cyclonic storm previously weak steering currents became more established as well with storm now tracking northeast toward myanmar through a weakness in a ridge over southeast asia situated in an area with sea surface temperatures of cyclone was able to undergo rapid intensification as wind shear abruptly diminished imd estimated mala to have reached its peak intensity at 0900 utc on april 28 with winds of 185 km h 115 mph and a barometric pressure of 954 mbar hpa 28 17 inhg using dvorak technique a method of determining a tropical cyclone s strength via satellite imagery agency gave mala a rating of t 5 5 which yields an intensity of 189 km h 117 mph jtwc estimated mala to have been a stronger system with peak winds of 220 km h 140 mph and a pressure of 922 mb hpa 27 23 inhg equivalent to a category 4 hurricane on saffir simpson hurricane wind scale their dvorak values peaked at t 6 5 or 235 km h 146 mph as powerful storm approached myanmar combined effects of increasing wind shear and land interaction soon took their toll on mala at 0700 utc on april 29 mala made landfall just south of in myanmar s rakhine state as a very severe cyclonic storm jtwc estimated winds at this time to have been 165 km h 105 mph rapid weakening ensued once cyclone moved onshore within 12 hours of landfall mala weakened to a deep depression and was last noted as a dissipating system earl on april 30 sea surface temperatures in wake of cyclone mala decreased up to 4 5 degc 7 9 degf due to upwelling from april 28 29 low level inflow associated affected much of northern bay of bengal and resulted in northwesterly winds as far away as hyderabad india these winds brought dry dust filled air over bay with mean particulate matter doubling over region preparations on april 26 local department of meteorology and hydrology in myanmar stated that ayeyarwady region and yangon regions were likely to be affected within two days and rakhine state within three days officials began broadcasting storm warning to public over radio following day evacuations of at risk coastal areas were conducted though specifics are unknown once storm moved inland residents across country were advised of likelihood of widespread heavy rain from remnant system despite never being forecast to strike bangladesh officials there warned residents that storm could strike nation and cause loss of life cautionary signals were raised at ports in chittagong cox s bazar and advising seafaring vessels to remain docked until storm s passage roughly 34 000 members of bangladesh red crescent society were placed on standby for possible relief efforts flash flood warnings were issued across northern thailand on april 29 under threat of heavy rains from mala s remnants impact thumb 300px cyclone mala making landfall in rakhine state on april 29 throughout almost entire existence of mala it produced rainfall in andaman and nicobar islands daily totals peaked on april 27 at in car nicobar after moving through myanmar mala brought heavy rains to northern thailand according to local meteorologists storm also accelerated onset of seasonal monsoon which would contribute to a wetter than average year for region myanmar though mala struck myanmar as a powerful cyclone early warnings and proper evacuations minimized loss of life along coastal areas additionally no major storm surge was reported limiting potential for major damage most significant effects were caused inland from torrential rains rather than at coast overall storm claimed 37 lives and left 1 24 billion kyat us 6 7 million in damage approximately 12 000 families were significantly affected by cyclone rakhine state suffered a direct hit from cyclone with gwa township reporting worst damage there 88 homes were destroyed and 1 246 more were damaged one person was killed and at least four others were injured in township ra ku toe village suffered significant losses as well with 132 homes destroyed and 531 more damaged a storm surge of struck region but did not impact populated areas across irrawaddy delta hurricane force winds caused extensive damage to housing and infrastructure island was first area struck by storm several homes were destroyed and many more lost their roof there thunderstorms from storm s outer bands on april 28 damaged 586 homes in hlaingthaya township residents described what appeared to be a tornado as cause of damage hlaingthaya industrial zone was hardest hit with five factories destroyed and dozens of homes having their roof torn off locals however claimed that damage was more severe than reported by government cars were reportedly tossed into air during storm two people were killed and fourteen others were injured in hlaingthaya winds also downed numerous power lines leaving many without electricity in labutta township near southern tip of delta 88 homes were destroyed in hinthada district torrential rains caused flash flooding that killed 18 people and left 14 others missing aftermath by may 1 local branch of red cross distributed essential supplies to residents in labutta township in coordination with disaster assistance response team areas in greatest need for aid were identified and requests for tarpaulin were made members of cabinet of burma donated 3 7 million kyat us 2 960 in cash and 140 bags of rice to victims in ayeyarwady region on may 3 another 1 7 million kyat us 1 360 was donated by social organizations to residents in rural areas outside yangon temporary shelters were set up across gwa township local donations provided residents in town with 200 000 kyat us 160 worth of blankets clothes and cash a local newspaper new light of myanmar claimed that government officials immediately provided assistance to affected residents across country red cross operations continued through november 30 by which time 3 485 families were provided with aid additionally though agency planned to assist 4 000 families with rebuilding their homes a lack of necessary funds prevented operation instead a cash donation was provided to 1 000 most affected families see also 2006 north indian ocean cyclone season cyclone nargis a storm of similar intensity two years later that devastated
