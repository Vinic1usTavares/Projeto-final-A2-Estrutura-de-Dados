stairway at level of plaza is a small rectangular platform a large amount of ceramic remains were found associated with this building these were pieces of large cylindrical incense burners of which more than twelve were used in temple one represented an elderly god emerging from jaws of a serpent another two show same deity in a standing position schele mathews 1999 p 303 they may represent one of deities of kaqchikel b toh or hun tihax incense burners were found exactly where kaqchikels had left them when they abandoned iximche some of these incense burners bore a suspended solar disc with modelled rays fragments of an early postclassic ware vessel were recovered scattered around three sides of temple that were probably remains of a relic from within temple itself there is no evidence of such early occupation at iximche and may have been plundered from zaculeu a city with a long occupational history that was conquered by k iche kaqchikel alliance a sacrificial flint knife was also recovered from structure 3 two low platforms stand in front of temple they were likely to have been used either as altars or as dance platforms schele mathews 1999 p 304 other 1 also known as temple 1 is a pyramid temple facing onto plaza b it is only temple at iximche to have been completely restored structure 4 is another pyramid temple base on west side of plaza c kelly 1996 p 195 it has a low platform at its southeastern corner where 48 severed heads were excavated immediately to west schele and mathews have speculated that these may be heads of k iche kings and itzayul together with other members of k iche court who were captured by kaqchikels and decapitated most of skulls were found with associated obsidian blades most of skulls had been individually buried in pits cut into floor of plaza although a few were grouped into small lots structure 5 was a pyramid temple guillemin 1967 p 32 excavation revealed at least two phases of construction and pyramidal platform had a single stair that divided into two as it approached summit shrine structure 6 is an unrestored temple pyramid platform to southwest of plaza c kelly 1996 pp 192 195 guillemin 1967 p 32 structure 7 at southwest side of plaza c is a ballcourt of similar dimensions to structure 8 kelly 1996 p 192 guillemin 1965 p 27 it was ballcourt of xahil clan and may have been older of two ballcourts schele mathews 1999 p 310 guillemin 1967 p 32 each end of ballcourt had a projecting stairway and there was an additional stairway to southeast a tennoned head sculpture recovered from plaza c may originally have been a ballcourt marker from this ballcourt thumb right structure 8 a sunken ballcourt on southwestern side of plaza 8 is located at southwestern side of plaza a it is a i shaped ball court with a playing area end zones are enclosed and accessed via stairways two lateral platforms enclosing playing area were extended by building onto outermost side in kaqchikel ballcourts were called hom and were seen as gateways to underworld structure 8 has been excavated and restored guillemin 1967 p 31 excavations uncovered two levels of plaster flooring indicating that ballcourt had been built during second of three main phases of construction at iximche dating it to about ad 1500 structure 9 sub had two pillars separating three doorways structure 10 had an internal patio with building surrounding it on three sides structure 13 lying between plazas a and b had an internal patio with structure enclosing it on three sides much like structure 10 structure 14 is a circular altar in plaza b measuring across guillemin 1965 p 32 it is very similar to those used for so called gladiatorial sacrifice by aztecs and it may have served this purpose this hypothesis is supported by presence of a noble burial interred with three companions structure 22 is a range structure on north side of plaza a kelly 1996 p 192 guillemin 1965 p 25 bases of pillars survive that once separated five doorways structure 22 is one of best preserved palace platforms at iximche and had benches set against inside of three of walls and hearths set into floor structure 24 two crude tennoned zoomorphic heads possibly jaguar heads were found near this structure but were probably ballcourt markers from one of two ballcourts it is likely that they served as a core onto which stucco modelling was applied structure 27 is located behind temple 2 schele mathews 1999 p 306 within it was found noble tomb e 27 a structure 38 is a long platform that completely enclosed north side of plaza c it supported three residential structures each of which had its own stairway domestic ceramics were found associated with these buildings an incense burner was also found with an effigy of tlaloc central mexican rain god human remains skeletal remains of more than 100 individuals have been excavated at iximche some of which were very well preserved whittington reed 1998 pp 73 74 unfortunately bones became mixed when near site after excavation and their original locations are no longer clear whittington reed 1998 p 74 thirty six skulls were analysed by archaeologists of these 25 show evidence of decapitation a sacrificial practice commonly represented in maya art from classic period whittington reed 1998 p 75 thirteen of these sacrifices were male seven were female and five were of indeterminate gender whittington reed 1998 p 76 most of sacrifices were of young adults ten were aged between 15 and 21 years old and eleven were aged little more than 21 years old based on skull development it is likely that these sacrificed individuals were not kaqchikels but were captives taken from enemy states less than 3 of analysed skulls showed evidence of iron deficiency anemia a very low percentage compared with remains recovered from copan and altar de sacrificios 64 and 88 respectively this low percentage indicates that these individuals were not exposed to particular dietary stress and were likely to belong to elite class whittington reed 1998 p 77 31 of skulls had evidence of infection about half of which were active infections at time of death although none were serious half of these infections left evidence in maxillary sinus this suggests a fairly high level of airborne pathogens in environment tooth enamel analysis was carried out on 19 individuals and revealed hypoplasia in teeth of 89 of these indicating a high level of poor health in first 7 years of childhood all excavated tombs were intrusive burials interred under residential platforms they were all found in a squatting position without any particular orientation many of remains were found accompanied by a broken obsidian blade some burials had other offerings for example that of a woman accompanied by domestic utensils some of which were blackened with soot two child burials each had a jade bead and burial of an elderly male was accompanied by pieces of burnt pine and evergreen oak burial e 27 a was a noble tomb in structure 27 in plaza a guillemin 1965 pp 21 22 32 schele mathews 1999 pp 306 307 remains of three sacrificed adults were piled together face down in a space guillemin 1965 p 32 schele mathews 1999 p 306 under these sacrifices were seated remains of another person this individual wore a gold headband with a jade and turquoise mosaic and a necklace with ten representations of jaguar heads together with forty small gold beads guillemin 1965 pp 32 33 schele mathews 1999 p 306 on each arm he wore a bracelet fashioned from occipital bone of a human skull and engraved with fine designs that included birds and stars hanging from a mexican style celestial band a finely crafted piece of jade was found near lower jaw and had probably been originally placed within mouth of deceased there was also a copper nose ornament in shape of moon and some jade beads one of which represented a deity similar to that represented on incense burners found at temple 3 remains dated from earlier phase of occupation of iximche and deceased had died in battle from a blow to head from a blunt instrument guillemin 1965 p 33 schele mathews 1999 p 306 burial has been tentatively identified as that of one of two sons of wuqu batz of xahil clan who died in kaqchikel wars of expansion guillemin 1965 pp 21 22 either chopena tz i kin uka or chopena see also chitinamit
