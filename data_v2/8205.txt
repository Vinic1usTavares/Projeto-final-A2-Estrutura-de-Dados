thumb upright 300px republican soldiers and assault guards fight in barcelona during uprising spanish coup of july 1936 was a nationalist and military uprising designed to overthrow spanish second republic but in actuality precipitated spanish civil war when nationalists fought with republicans for control of spain coup itself organized for 17 july 1936 would result in a split of spanish military and territorial control rather than a prompt transfer of power although drawn out resulting war would ultimately lead to one of its leaders francisco franco becoming ruler of spain rising was intended to be swift but government retained control of most of country including malaga jaen and almeria cadiz was taken for rebels and general queipo de llano managed to secure seville in madrid rebels were hemmed into montana barracks which fell with much bloodshed on 19 july cabinet headed by newly appointed prime minister jose giral ordered distribution of weapons to unions helping to

replaced as inspector general and made general of balearic islands emilio mola was moved from head of army of africa to be military commander of pamplona in navarre however this allowed mola to direct mainland uprising although relationship between him and carlist leaders was problematic general jose became figurehead of operation and helped to come to an agreement with carlists mola was chief planner and second in command preston 1983 pp 4 10 jose antonio primo de rivera was put in prison in mid march in order to restrict falange however government actions were not as thorough as they might have been warnings by director of security and other figures were not acted upon preston 2006 pp 94 95 on 12 june prime minister casares quiroga met general juan yague who was rightly accused of masterminding growing conspiracy in north africa but yague managed to convince casares of his loyalty to republic preston 2006 p 95 mola held a meeting between garrison commanders in north of spain on 15 june and local authorities on hearing of meeting surrounded it with civil guards however casares ordered their removal saying he trusted mola preston 2006 p 96 mola began serious planning in spring but general francisco franco hesitated until early july inspiring other plotters to refer to him as miss canary islands 1936 franco was a key player because of his prestige as a former director of military academy and as man who suppressed socialist uprising of 1934 he was well respected in spanish moroccan army spain s strongest military force he wrote a cryptic letter to casares on 23 june suggesting that military was disloyal but could be restrained if he were put in charge casares did nothing failing to arrest or buy off franco even if placing him in overall command was impossible franco was to be assigned control of morocco in new regime and largely sidelined preston 2006 p 97 on july 5 an aircraft was chartered to take franco from canary islands to morocco preston 2006 p 98

found calvo sotelo had protested against agricultural reforms expropriations and restrictions on authority of catholic church which he considered bolshevist and anarchist he instead advocated creation of a state thomas 1987 p 8 guards shot calvo sotelo without trial preston 2006 p 99 killing of sotelo a prominent member of parliament with involvement of police aroused suspicions and strong reactions among government s opponents on right thomas 2001 pp 196 198 309 thomas 2001 pp 196 198 309 condes was a close personal friend of castillo his squad had originally sought to arrest gil robles as a reprisal for castillo s murder but robles was not at home so they went to house of calvo sotelo thomas concluded that intention of condes was to arrest calvo sotelo and that cuenca acted on his own initiative although he acknowledges other sources that dispute this finding massive reprisals followed although conservative nationalist generals were already in advanced stages of a planned uprising event provided a catalyst and convenient public justification for their coup and in particular that spain would have to be saved from anarchy by military rather than democratic means socialists and communists led by prieto demanded that arms be distributed to people before military took over prime minister was hesitant franco s plane landed in gran canaria on july 14 but based in tenerife he would have been unable to make plane without death of general amado balmes military commander in gran canaria who was killed in a shooting accident on july 16 preston 2006 p 100 whether his death was an accident suicide or murder is unknown balmes reportedly shot himself in stomach by accident and died shortly after while there have been conspiracy theories that he was murdered had this been case he had enough time to denounce his murderers if they had existed while officer who certified it was an accident was not a conspirator and remained loyal to republic during civil war

coque 2018 p 98 conspiracy relied mostly on mid range staff and line officers they were expected to take control of garrisons and either overpower their seniors or persuade them to join in some districts like zaragoza or seville conspiracy network was well developed and mola was confident of success there in other districts like valencia or la coruna network was sketchy and plotters took into account a would be failure madrid 1 division district commander general virgilio cabanellas ferrer was loyal to government divisional chief of staff coronel luis perez penamaria was aware and supportive of plot though he did not act as its co ordinator plot was managed by other madrid based generals especially rafael villegas in plan featuring as head of rebellious madrid troops and joaquin fanjul was probably sounded on his access but he either declined or remained ambiguous on july 18 villegas cited some difficulties and remained passive it was fanjul who moved to montana barracks and assumed leading role cabanellas remained loyal and perez penamaria pretended to be so once troops of fanjul had been defeated 1 division was officially dissolved cabanellas and perez penamaria were detained perez penamaria was tried for negligence later tried also by nationalists villegas was also arrested soon to be executed by republican militia alvarez coque 2018 pp 169 186

commander general jose fernandez villa abrille and his chief of staff coronel juan cantero ortega were loyal to government conspiracy network was headed by staff officer comandante jose cuesta who built a firm and efficient structure some describe it as a parallel staff few days before coup villa abrille was invited to join he declined but nothing is known of him taking action against plotters according to plan of mola it was general queipo de llano who was to assume command of rebel seville troops on july 18 cuesta organised queipo de llano s takeover of garrison villa was incapacitated and detained later tried by nationalists and sentenced to prison at time of coup cantero was on leave in algeciras where he assumed a wait and see stand he returned to seville early august victorious nationalists released him from all functions alvarez coque 2018 pp 151 154 valencia 3 division neither district commander general fernando martinez nor his chief of staff adolfo machinandiarena were involved in plot local conspiracy junta missed officers on critical positions most important of these officers was comandante bartolome barba hernandez though he excelled in ensuring civilian rather than military support general manuel gonzalez carrasco initially marked to lead rebels was reassigned by mola to lead barcelona rising and reassigned back to valencia shortly before coup on july 18 a few conspirators tried to persuade martinez to join insurgency but commander remained ambiguous this was position also adopted by machinandiarena engulfed by doubts gonzalez carrasco remained rather passive many conspiring officers were ready to join coup given orders are issued by divisional command for some two weeks valencia garrison did not take a firm position eventually barba and gonzalez carrasco fled to nationalist zone martinez was reassigned to non combat positions while machinandiarena was detained and tried later also by nationalists alvarez coque 2018 pp 186 194 barcelona 4 division district commander general francisco llano de la encomienda was entirely loyal to republic his chief of staff manuel moxo was at least aware of plot though it is likely that he supported it key man of mola in barcelona was comandante francisco mut ramon high member of divisional staff supported by some local commanders initial plan of mola envisioned that command of rebellious barcelona troops would be assumed by general manuel gonzalez carrasco but shortly before coup he was reassigned to valencia and replaced by manuel goded latter arrived in barcelona when rebellion was already underway moxo immediately accepted his command llano de la encomienda was actively working to suppress coup within local military structures until he was detained by units loyal to goded though his captivity lasted only a few hours once military was overwhelmed by crowd goded and moxo were arrested and tried first executed by firing squad and later murdered by militia mut escaped and made it to nationalist zone alvarez coque 2018 pp 195 198 zaragoza 5 division both district commander general miguel cabanellas ferrer and his chief of staff federico montaner canet were active conspirators conspiracy network was firm and mola was confident that zaragoza troops would adhere to coup though conspiracy network was not extensive fact that both key military men were involved in plot led to almost all troops in district obeying orders from rebellious command a few loyalist officers were quickly overwhelmed by rebels despite his age it was cabanellas who led action and montaner supported him as chief of staff as planned cabanellas remained in command of zaragoza military district also after successful coup alvarez coque 2018 pp 154 155 burgos 6 division district commanded general domingo batet did not take part in conspiracy its key man was interim chief of staff teniente coronel jose aizpuru martin pinillos in early july 1936 he ceded function to coronel fernando moreno calderon a man not involved in plot yet aizpuru went on as chief plotter his network was so extensive that mola was confident 6 division would be firmly with rebels on july 19 they took over critical posts of command batet firmly refused to join and was detained later to be tried and executed moreno joined in last minute facing resolute action of junior officers as planned by mola command of burgos military district after fidel davila assumed successful coup alvarez coque 2018 pp 155 159 valladolid 7 division district commander general nicolas molero lobo was not involved in plot key person among conspirators was divisional chief of staff comandante anselmo lopez maristany however in june he was posted to madrid and he kept co ordinating plot in valladolid from capital his successor as chief of staff coronel juan quero orozco was not involved in plot and was not aware of it unfolding on evening of july 18 a group of senior officers from madrid including general saliquet coronel lopez maristany and comandante martin montalvo led takeover of military structures which involved a shootout with of general molero who was eventually detained later molero was tried by nationalists and sentenced to prison quero remained passive and eventually joined rebels in line with initial planning command of valladolid district was assumed by andres saliquet alvarez coque 2018 pp 159 163 la coruna 8 division district commander general enrique salcedo was not aware of conspiracy chief of staff teniente coronel luis tovar figueras maintained sporadic and loose contacts with ume but he neither took part in conspiracy nor took any action against it key man of plotters was comandante fermin gutierrez soto high member of divisional staff on july 18 and 19 conspiracy network remained relatively disorganized with no resolute action taken suspicious of his staff in early hours of july 20 salcedo ordered detention of both tovar and gutierrez it was rapid counter action of gutierrez and coronel martin alonso which produced detention of salcedo who was later tried and executed tovar adhered to coup given sketchy insurgency scheme in la coruna plan of mola did not envision any specific individual as local commander following coup this role was temporarily assumed by coronel enrique who before eventually accepting rebel command a few times had refused to take it alvarez coque 2018 pp 163 169 outcome despite ruthlessness and determination of supporters of coup rebels failed to take any major cities with critical exception of seville which provided a landing point for franco s african troops primarily conservative and catholic areas of old castile and leon fell quickly and in pamplona they celebrated uprising as if it were a festival government retained control of malaga jaen and almeria cadiz was taken for rebels with help of first troops from army of africa beevor 2006 pp 60 61 in madrid they were hemmed into montana barracks barracks fell next day with much bloodshed republican leader santiago casares quiroga was replaced by jose giral who ordered distribution of weapons among civilian population beevor 2006 p 62 this facilitated defeat of army insurrection in main industrial centres including madrid barcelona valencia and other main cities in mediterranean area beevor 2006 pp 58 70 but it allowed anarchists to arm themselves and take control of barcelona and large swathes of aragon and catalonia in barcelona official government lost control of security essential services and welfare beevor 2006 pp 106 107 however anarchists held back from demanding too much political power which could have had even more severe consequences general goded surrendered in barcelona and was later condemned to death despite broadcasting a message explaining his captivity over radio at request of authorities beevor 2006 p 69 meanwhile army of africa crossed gibraltar strait using junkers ju 52 transport planes provided by nazi germany without any loyalist air force interference owing to confusion and lack of decision of spanish republican side massive airlift of troops from spanish morocco was world s first long range combat airlift and it

movement allowed them to meet general mola s northern army and secure most of northern and northwestern spain as well as central and western andalusia republican government ended up with controlling almost all of eastern spanish coast and central area around madrid as well as asturias cantabria and part of basque country in north mola was keen to create a sense of fear within nationalist controlled areas there was a massive purge of freemasons and a large part of left including some moderate socialists preston 2006 p 103 result of coup was a polarization of spain following general mola s orders of instilling fear in potential pro republican ranks through systematic executions in captured cities an act of spontaneous revenge in form of random murders of perceived fascists conservatives and coup sympathizers by exalted mobs flared up in loyalist areas preston paul 2012 spanish holocaust harper press london nationalist area of control contained roughly 11 million of spain s population of 25 million westwell 2004 p 9 rebels also had secured support of around half of spain s territorial army some 60 000 men in republican units however as much as 90 of officers either rebelled defected or merely disappeared and their loyalty to republic was put in doubt therefore some would later turn up in nationalist ranks this considerably reduced units effectiveness as a new command structure had to be fashioned no such problem occurred in nationalist units howson 1998 p 28 army of africa however was entirely under nationalist control and numbered 30 000 men considered spain s top fighting force rebels were also joined by 30 000 members of spain s militarized police forces assault guards civil guards and carabineers westwell 2004 p 10 50 000 members of

or so were lost following early nationalist advances in war republicans controlled about a third of both heavy and light machine guns of 1 007 artillery pieces 387 were in republican hands howson 1998 p 20 spanish army had before coup just 18 tanks of sufficiently modern design and republicans retained 10 howson 1998 p 21 in terms of numbers nationalists had seized control of 17 warships leaving republicans with 27 however two most modern both cruisers of canarias class were in nationalist hands although not ready for service when war broke out ships compensated for lack in numbers spanish republican navy suffered from same problems as army many officers had defected or had been killed after trying to do so due to concerns of a republican officer that such a coup was imminent two thirds of air capability were retained by government however whole of air service was very outdated and vulnerable both during flight and to mechanical problems howson 1998 pp 21 22 references notes
