elected to stay in navy he participated in operation sandstone nuclear tests in pacific in april 1948 thumb left a p2v takes off from using jato on 21 april 1950 after world war ii us navy sought to acquire a nuclear strike capability and deputy chief of naval operations for air rear admiral arthur w radford wanted them to operate from aircraft carriers there were practical problems with this nuclear weapons at that time were bulky and required a large aircraft to carry them after operation crossroads radford asked hayward if navy had such an aircraft and hayward suggested modifying lockheed p2v neptune for carrier operations using jet assisted takeoff jato rocket boosters it was an interim solution as it a could not carry a fat man but only smaller little boy bomb it could only be operated by large midway class aircraft carriers which still had to be modified for task and initially had no tailhook so it was unable to land on a carrier and a mission would have to end with it either landing at a land base or ditching at sea on 28 april 1948 two p2vs were launched from a carrier for first time intention was that each of three midway class carriers would have a nuclear attack squadron first of these composite heavy attack squadron 5 vc 5 was formed at moffett field california on 9 september 1948 with commander frederick l dick ashworth who had been weaponeer on nagasaki raid as its acting commander however rear admiral deak parsons felt that ashworth did not have sufficient flight time for role so it was decided that hayward would command vc 5 he assumed command on 3 january 1949 with ashworth as his executive officer hayward intended that ashworth would take command of next squadron vc 6 when it was formed thumb right a nuclear capable aj savage launches from aircraft carrier in 1955 hayward was promoted to captain again on 19 february 1949 on 7 march he took off coral sea in atlantic in a p2v carrying a dummy little boy pumpkin bomb and flew across united states to make a simulated attack on salton sea test site near el centro california he then flew to patuxent river where he landed after a total of 23 hours flying hayward had fitted to a pair of p2vs and made practice landings on a carrier deck painted on ground at nas patuxent river maryland he made some touch and go passes at but a carrier landing was considered too dangerous for regular crews to attempt p2vs would be first augmented and then replaced by more capable north american aj savage as they became available these could take off and land on a carrier carrying a fat man on 21 august 1950 hayward was at controls of first carrier landing and takeoff of an aj 1 savage heavy attack bomber on coral sea with commander of naval air forces atlantic fleet vice admiral felix stump in back seat however by mid december vc 5 still only had six aj 1s from june 1951 to may 1953 hayward was head of military applications division of atomic energy commission where he conducted atomic weapons laboratory work at los alamos national laboratory he also worked on foundation of lawrence livermore national laboratory program in 1952 in close collaboration with edward teller culmination of this was working on ivy mike nuclear test point cruz in june 1953 hayward took command of escort carrier he confessed to crew that he did not know what he was doing and urged any crewman who felt he was doing something wrong to tell him so at once at end of korean war carrier was deployed at inchon where a baby was found abandoned in trash at a u s army depot baby was brought to an orphanage and hayward sent point cruz s chaplain in response to a request for assistance nun running orphanage felt blue eyed baby would not be safe if he remained in korea hayward is said to have told chaplain you are not to return to this vessel until you have procured that baby hayward is credited with putting his naval career on line by bringing baby on ship which was against regulations and he subsequently received orders to get baby off ship however having a baby on board boosted sailors morale and hayward later said that a leader must know when to intelligently disregard regulations a visa was obtained by intervention of richard nixon s staffers and a passport was secured by winning a poker game against south korean who issued passports baby adopted by navy surgeon hugh keenan who was also in port at inchon was later named daniel and was transferred to a civilian ship in japan daniel keenan was raised in seattle and began attending reunions of crew of

ordnance laboratory at white oak maryland in june 1954 he was first naval aviator to do so all previous commanders having been naval ordnance officers under his guidance naval ordnance laboratory developed mark 52 naval mine an air delivered weapon with acoustic magnetic and pressure sensors hayward encountered some resistance with this project as mine warfare was a neglected field in navy naval ordnance laboratory also developed mark 90 nuclear bomb a nuclear depth charge which was tested during operation wigwam in may 1955 from a naval career point of view hayward s most notable drawback was his lack of time in command of a ship at sea admiral arleigh burke now chief of naval operations arranged for hayward to be given command of aircraft carrier franklin d roosevelt in february 1956 this would normally be climax of naval aviator s career but that year he was selected for promotion to rear admiral his record of 13 200 flight hours was highest ever achieved by a flag officer on 7 january 1957 he was assigned to office of assistant chief of naval operations for plans and operations in october he became assistant chief of naval operations for research and

service medal for his leadership judgment and foresight in research and development associated with antisubmarine warfare and training of antisubmarine warfare groups during his tenure of command hayward was president of naval war college in newport rhode island from 1966 until 1968 he strove to transform naval war college into navy s premier postgraduate school one from which graduation would fit officers for and mark them out as future flag officers heading a captain s selection board in may 1967 he disapproved of two officers with spotless records you mean they never argued never had a difference of opinion he remarked what kind of man is that hayward was awarded a second navy distinguished service medal for his service as president of naval war college he retired in 1968 but

of shroud of turin in vatican city while speaking at naval war college in 1982 hayward said that evidence collected during investigation convinced him that shroud was in fact used to bury jesus christ however he spoke only for himself and not entire team according to rest of team image on shroud was rather formed by a combination of heat and light hayward decided that further research into age of shroud via carbon 14 dating was needed but church authorities would not permit this to happen at time hayward died of cancer on 23 may 1999 in atlantic beach florida and was buried in arlington
