races further developments of same concept including wings by end of decade were highly competitive up until 1971 of 1972 was brabham s first production monocoque and first not designed by tauranac although 40 were ordered it was less successful than its predecessors angular bt41 was final formula three brabham hodges 1998 pp 34 39 formula 5000 brabham made one car for formula 5000 racing brabham bt43 rolled out in late 1973 it was tested in early 1974 by john watson at silverstone before making its debut at rothmans f5000 championship round at monza on june 30 1974 driven by martin former australian drivers champion kevin bartlett used chevrolet powered brabham bt43 to finish 3rd in 1978 australian drivers championship including finishing 5th in 1978 australian grand prix sports cars tauranac did not enjoy designing sports cars and could only spare a small amount of his time from mrd s very successful single seater business only 14 sports car models were built between 1961 and 1972 out of a total production of almost 600 chassis lawrence 1999 pp 205 207 was only one built in any numbers and was quite successful in national level racing in uk in 1964 and 1965 lawrence 1999 p 55 design was stretched in 1966 to become one off originally fitted with 4 3 litre version of repco engine for can am racing it was quickly abandoned by mrd after engine reliability problems became evident lawrence 1999 pp 84 85 technical innovation right thumb 250px 1978 bt46b fan car won its only race before being banned brabham was considered a technically conservative team in 1960s chiefly because it persevered with traditional spaceframe cars long after lotus introduced lighter stiffer monocoque chassis to formula one in 1962 chief designer tauranac reasoned that monocoques of time were not usefully stiffer than well designed spaceframe chassis and were harder to repair and less suitable for mrd s customers lawrence 1999 pp 44 45 his old fashioned cars won brabham team 1966 and 1967 championships and were competitive in formula one until rule changes forced a move to monocoques in 1970 nye 1986 p 60 brabham s and matra s experimental four wheel drive of 1969 were last cars with spaceframe chassis cars in f1 for 1970 fia mandated use of bag tanks for fuel which were to be carried inside box structures this effectively forced team to design a monocoque structure from 1968 brabham s indycars were monocoques for same reason despite perceived conservatism in 1963 brabham was first formula one team to use a wind tunnel to hone their designs to reduce drag and stop cars lifting off ground at speed henry 1985 p 39 initial tests were carried out at motor industry research association wind tunnel under auspices of malcolm sayer who had been responsible for aerodynamics of jaguar d type le mans winning car practice only became norm in early 1980s and is possibly most important factor in design of modern cars towards end of 1960s teams began to exploit aerodynamic downforce to push cars tyres down harder on track and enable them to maintain faster speeds through high speed corners at 1968 belgian grand prix brabham were first alongside ferrari to introduce full width rear wings to this effect lawrence 1999 p 100 team s most fertile period of technical innovation came in 1970s and 1980s when gordon murray became technical director during 1976 team introduced carbon carbon brakes to formula one which promised reduced unsprung weight and better stopping performance due to carbon s greater coefficient of friction initial versions used carbon carbon composite brake pads and a steel disc faced with carbon pucks technology was not reliable at first in 1976 carlos pace crashed at at osterreichring circuit after heat build up in brakes boiled brake fluid leaving him with no way of stopping car henry 1985 p 163 by 1979 brabham had developed an effective carbon carbon braking system combining structural carbon discs with carbon brake pads howard june 2006 p 52 interview with gordon murray and john barnard on early uses of carbon fibre in formula one for brakes and chassis structure by late 1980s carbon brakes were used by all competitors in almost all top level motor sports although brabham experimented with and underbody skirts in mid 1970s team like rest of field did not immediately understand lotus s development of a ground effect car in 1977 brabham bt46b fan car of 1978 generated enormous downforce with a fan which sucked air from beneath car although its claimed use was for engine cooling car only raced once in formula one world championship niki lauda winning 1978 swedish grand prix before a loophole in regulations was closed by fia henry 1985 p 186 187 it is often claimed that car was never banned but rather withdrawn by ecclestone ecclestone did agree to withdraw it after three races but fia changed regulations to render fan cars in general not bt46b in particular illegal before it could race again although in 1979 murray was first to use lightweight carbon fibre composite panels to stiffen brabham s aluminium alloy monocoques he echoed his predecessor tauranac in being last to switch to new fully composite monocoques murray was reluctant to build entire chassis from composite materials until he understood their behaviour in a crash an understanding achieved in part through an instrumented crash test of a bt49 chassis team did not follow mclaren s 1981 mp4 1 with their own fully composite chassis until lowline bt55 in 1986 hodges 1998 p 43 last team to do so this technology is now used in all top level single seater racing cars for 1981 season fia introduced a minimum ride height for cars intended to slow them in corners by limiting downforce created by aerodynamic ground effect gordon murray devised a hydropneumatic suspension system for bt49c which allowed car to settle to a much lower ride height at speed brabham were accused of cheating by other teams although murray believes that system met letter of regulations no action was taken against team and others soon produced systems with similar effects henry 1985 pp 223 225 at 1982 british grand prix brabham reintroduced idea of re fuelling and changing car s tyres during race unseen since 1957 formula one season to allow their drivers to sprint away at start of races on a light fuel load and soft tyres after studying techniques used at indianapolis 500 and in nascar racing in united states team were able to refuel and re tyre car in 14 seconds in tests ahead of race in 1982 murray felt tactic did little more than get our sponsors noticed at races we had no chance of winning but in 1983 team made good use of tactic hamilton ed 1983 pp 63 72 pitstops a split second spectacle feature by denis jenkinson refuelling was banned for 1984 although it reappeared between 1994 and 2009 but tyre changes have remained part of formula one controversy fan car and hydropneumatic suspension exploited loopholes in sporting regulations in early 1980s brabham was accused of going further and breaking regulations during 1981 piquet s first championship year rumours circulated of illegal underweight brabham chassis driver jacques laffite was among those to claim that cars were fitted with heavily ballasted bodywork before being weighed at scrutineering accusation was denied by brabham s management no formal protest was made against team and no action was taken against them by sporting authorities henry 1985 p 225 from 1978 ecclestone was president of formula one constructors association foca a body formed by teams to represent their interests this left his team open to accusations of having advance warning of rule changes ecclestone denies that team benefited from this and murray has noted that contrary to this view at end of 1982 team had to abandon their new car built on basis that ground effect would be permitted in 1983 brabham had to design and build a replacement bt52 in only three months henry 1985 p 255 at end of 1983 season renault and ferrari both beaten to drivers championship by piquet protested that research octane number ron of team s fuel was above legal limit of 102 fia declared that a figure of up to 102 9 was permitted under rules and that brabham had not exceeded this limit drackett 1985 p 133 although protested as used by drackett implies a formal protest he does not specify this and henry 1985 p 267 says no action was ever taken championship results results achieved by works brabham team bold results indicate a championship
