meth mouth is severe tooth decay and tooth loss as well as tooth fracture acid erosion and other oral problems potentially symptomatic of extended use of drug methamphetamine condition is thought to be caused by a combination of side effects of drug clenching and grinding of teeth dry mouth and lifestyle factors infrequent oral hygiene frequent consumption of sugary drinks as well as neglecting regular dental cleanings and preventive care which may be present in long term users however legitimacy of meth mouth as a unique condition has been questioned because of similar effects of some other drugs on teeth images of diseased mouths are often used in anti drug campaigns condition is difficult to treat and may involve fillings fluoride to fight tooth decay and drugs that increase saliva for dry mouth as well as oral hygiene instruction it can be dangerous for active methamphetamine users to undergo dental surgery because of cardiac problems that can result from interaction of local anesthetic with drug signs and symptoms methamphetamine informally referred to as meth is a stimulant drug with a high potential for addiction in its recreational users it incurs physical and psychological side effects that users find desirable other side effects like bruxism and stimulant psychosis can result in users neglecting their dental health eventually leading to advanced tooth decay caries and gum infections further a common side effect of stimulant drugs is xerostomia which accelerates tooth decay methamphetamine is most discussed illegal drug in dental literature for its extensive effect on users dental health teeth of some methamphetamine users appear to be dark and extensively eroded epithet meth mouth is result of these superficial presentations of advanced tooth decay and gum infection caries often occur in cervical regions of teeth where tooth surface narrows at junction of crown and root decay is primarily centered on buccal cheek side of teeth and on tooth surfaces that are adjacent to incisors and canines eventually coronal tooth area near crown can be affected by decay and erosion dental caries of meth mouth often progress slowly perhaps because their advancement is hindered by intermittent hygienic practices decay can lead to tooth fractures and severe pain in some cases teeth are permanently damaged and must be removed along with malnutrition and weight loss dental effects of methamphetamine use contribute to appearance of premature aging seen in some users methamphetamine users sometimes experience soreness in joint of jaw and dental attrition tooth wear due to bruxism a common side effect of stimulant drugs this bruxism can occur continuously chronic use of drug might also cause inability to open jaw effects of meth mouth are similar to those of sjogren s syndrome an autoimmune disease that causes a lack of saliva which results in tooth decay causes thumb powder methamphetamine on tin foil hypothesized causes of meth mouth are a combination of ma side effects and lifestyle factors which may be present in users dry mouth xerostomia clenching and grinding of teeth bruxism infrequent oral hygiene frequent consumption of sugary fizzy drinks caustic nature of methamphetamine dental effects of long term methamphetamine use are often attributed to its effects on saliva reduction in saliva increases likelihood of dental caries enamel erosion and periodontal disease although it is clear that use of drug decreases saliva mechanism by which it does so is unclear one theory is that drug causes vasoconstriction narrowing of blood vessels in salivary glands decreasing salivary flow this constriction is thought to be due to activation of alpha adrenergic receptors by both methamphetamine itself and norepinephrine levels of which are dramatically increased by methamphetamine use these factors can be compounded by dehydration which occurs in many methamphetamine users after drug induced increases in metabolism characteristics of saliva produced during use of drug which includes high protein content may also contribute to sensation of dry mouth long term methamphetamine use can cause parafunctional habits routine actions of a body part that are different than their common use which can result in tooth wear and exacerbate periodontal diseases one such habit that may affect development of meth mouth is bruxism particularly as drug s effects wane and stereotypy occurs a phase that is often referred to as tweaking this bruxism may be due to a drug induced increase in other behaviors of long term methamphetamine users that may cause or accelerate symptoms of meth mouth are failure to pay attention to oral hygiene and excessive food intake during binges especially sugary foods drug s users often report strong cravings for sugar and consume large amounts of high sugar beverages altered mental state that accompanies methamphetamine use lasts longer than that of some other common drugs increasing amount of time user engages in drug induced behavior hydrochloric acid is used in methamphetamine s manufacturing process but academic reviews have not supported idea that acid contributes to dental decay speculation that oral consumption of drug causes tooth decay by raising acidity of users mouths is also unsupported meth mouth is generally most severe in users who inject drug rather than those who smoke ingest or inhale it treatment right thumb alt photograph of teeth and gums on lower right hand side of mouth showing large caries lesions on all teeth at level of gum rampant caries caused by methamphetamine abuse damaging effects of meth mouth on teeth and gums for most part are irreversible although if treated at an early stage they can be dramatically reduced through habitual use of common hygienic practices under normal circumstances user will not seek a remedy until damage has already begun to take control causing severe mouth pain and general discomfort because many drug users lack access to dental treatment due to affordability and poverty it is important to take medical precautions to prolong lifespan of your mouth and your health in general those who are willing to seek dental treatment should seek professional advice as soon as possible if they are experiencing any painful symptoms relatable to meth mouth from abusing methamphetamine providing dental treatment to individuals who use methamphetamine can be dangerous because potential combination of local anesthetic and methamphetamine can cause serious heart problems there is also an increased risk of serious side effects if opioid medications are used in patient s treatment treatment of meth mouth usually attempts to increase flow of saliva halt tooth decay and encourage behavioral changes toothpaste with fluoride is very important to restoration of dental health prescription fluoride can adequately treat condition as well sialogogues drugs that increase amount of saliva in mouth can be used to treat dry mouth and protect against dental health problems pilocarpine and are sialogogues approved by food and drug administration fda to treat low salivation caused by sjogren s syndrome and may have potential to effectively treat dry mouth caused by methamphetamine use uncertainty there have not been any controlled studies on meth mouth and several of its aspects are unclear although condition has been popularized by media coverage and case reports no systematic studies have been conducted to conclusively tie methamphetamine use to symptoms that are commonly described as meth mouth there are few ties between dental scholars and those who study drug use and it can be difficult for dental researchers to find methamphetamine users to study whether drug has a unique effect on dental health has been questioned by a few academics who note that long term use of several other drugs sometimes causes dental problems several academic reviews have contradicted this perspective affirming meth mouth s status as a discrete condition in favor of its unique status these reviews cite differences between methamphetamine caused caries and those that occur for other reasons such as cocaine use as well as scope of tooth decay found in some long term methamphetamine users society and culture although most methamphetamine users lived in asia in early 2000s use of drug increased dramatically in other parts of world in that decade in areas where use of drug has become common meth mouth is often widespread condition is expensive to treat and has strained public health resources prompting concerns among dental authorities in several countries about burden of treatment images of meth mouth are usually considered disturbing and have been used in anti drug campaigns even being placed on hoardings billboards condition is often mentioned in media coverage of methamphetamine and it has been included in media portrayals of drug abuse to demonstrate scope of drug s effects or to provoke disgust in audience opponents argue that term is used to negatively stereotype methamphetamine users and that it is falsely portrayed as inevitable or characteristic drama series breaking bad which centres around production of crystal meth features a number of minor characters who have meth mouth series creator vince gilligan has said one of his regrets about series is that one of lead
