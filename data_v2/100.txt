railway fare cash fare is 2 75 same fare as new york city subway and mta buses fares are paid on entry and exit only at st george and tompkinsville rides not originating or terminating at st george or tompkinsville are free fares are payable by metrocard since card enables free transfers for a continuous ride on subway and bus systems for many more riders there is effectively no fare for riding sir riders can also transfer between a staten island bus sir and a manhattan bus or subway near south ferry because of this sir s 2001 farebox recovery ratio was 0 16 for every dollar of expense 16 cents
