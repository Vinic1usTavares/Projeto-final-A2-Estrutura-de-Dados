angevins from anjou were a royal house of french origin that ruled england in 12th and early 13th centuries its monarchs were henry ii richard i and john in 10 years from 1144 two successive counts of anjou in france geoffrey and his son future henry ii won control of a vast assemblage of lands in western europe that would last for 80 years and would retrospectively be referred to as angevin empire as a political entity this was structurally different from preceding norman and subsequent plantagenet realms geoffrey became duke of normandy in 1144 and died in 1151 in 1152 his heir henry added aquitaine by virtue of his marriage to eleanor of aquitaine henry also inherited claim of his mother empress matilda daughter of king henry i to english throne to which he succeeded in 1154 following death of king stephen henry was succeeded by his third son richard whose reputation for martial prowess won him epithet or lionheart he was born and raised in england but spent very little time there during his adult life perhaps as little as six months despite this richard remains an enduring iconic figure both in england and in france and is one of very few kings of england remembered by his nickname as opposed to regnal number when richard died his brother john henry s fifth and only surviving son took throne in 1204 john lost much of angevins continental territories including anjou to french crown he and his successors were still recognized as dukes of aquitaine loss of anjou from which dynasty is named is rationale behind john s son henry iii of england being considered first plantagenet a name derived from nickname of his great grandfather geoffrey where no distinction is made between angevin subsequent english kings henry ii is first plantagenet king from john dynasty continued successfully and unbroken in senior male line until reign of richard ii before dividing into two competing cadet branches house of lancaster and house of york terminology angevin adjective angevin is especially used in english history to refer to kings who were also counts of with henry from geoffrey and matilda their characteristics descendants and period of history which they covered from mid twelfth to early thirteenth centuries in addition it is also used pertaining to anjou or any sovereign government derived from this as a noun it is used for any native of anjou or angevin ruler as such angevin is also used for other counts and dukes of anjou including three kings ancestors their cousins who held crown of jerusalem and unrelated later members of french royal family who were granted titles to form different dynasties amongst which were capetian house of anjou and valois house of anjou angevin empire term angevin empire was coined in 1887 by kate norgate as far as it is known there was no contemporary name for this assemblage of territories which were referred at clumsy circumlocutions such as our kingdom and everything subject to our rule whatever it may be or whole of kingdom which had belonged to his father whereas angevin part of this term has proved empire portion has proved controversial in 1986 a convention of historical specialists concluded that there had been no angevin state and no empire but term espace plantagenet was acceptable origins thumb right 350px alt an illuminated diagram showing angevins coloured lines connect two to show lineal

of gatinais and ermengarde of anjou in 1060 this couple inherited via cognatic kinship county of anjou from an older line dating from 870 and a noble called ingelger marriage of count geoffrey to matilda only surviving legitimate child of henry i of england was part of a struggle for power during tenth and eleventh centuries among lords of normandy brittany poitou blois maine and kings of france it was from this marriage that geoffrey s son henry inherited claims to england normandy and anjou that marks beginning of angevin and plantagenet dynasties this was third attempt by geoffrey s father fulk v to build a political alliance with normandy first was by marrying his daughter matilda to henry s heir william adelin who drowned in wreck of white ship fulk then married his daughter sibylla to william clito heir to henry s older brother robert curthose but henry had marriage annulled to avoid strengthening william s rival claim to his lands inheritance custom and angevin practice as society became more prosperous and stable in 11th century inheritance customs developed that allowed daughters in absence of sons to succeed to principalities as well as landed estates twelfth century chronicler ralph de diceto noted that counts of anjou extended their dominion over their neighbours by marriage rather than conquest marriage of geoffrey to daughter of a king and widow of an emperor occurred in this context it is unknown whether king henry intended to make geoffrey his heir but it is known that threat presented by william clito s rival claim to duchy of normandy made his negotiating position very weak even so it is probable that should marriage be childless king henry would have attempted to be succeeded by one of his norman kinsmen such as theobald ii count of champagne or stephen of blois who in event did seize king henry s english crown king henry s great relief in 1133 at birth of a son to couple described as heir to kingdom is understandable in light of this situation following this birth of a second son raised question of whether custom would be followed with maternal inheritance passing to first born and paternal inheritance going to his brother geoffrey according to william of newburgh writing in 1190s plan failed because of geoffrey s early death in 1151 dying geoffrey decided that henry would have paternal and maternal inheritances while he needed resources to overcome stephen and left instructions that his body would not be buried until henry swore an oath that once england and normandy were secured younger geoffrey would have anjou henry s brother geoffrey died in 1154 too soon to receive anjou but not before being installed count in nantes after henry aided a rebellion by its citizens against their previous lord unity of henry s assemblage of domains was largely dependent on ruling family influencing opinion of most historians that this instability made it unlikely to endure french custom of partible inheritance at time would lead to political fragmentation indeed if henry ii s sons henry young king and geoffrey of brittany had not died young inheritance of 1189 would have been fundamentally altered henry and richard both planned for partition on their deaths while attempting to provide overriding sovereignty to hold lands together for example in 1173 and 1183 henry tried to force richard to acknowledge allegiance to his older brother for duchy of aquitaine and later richard would confiscate ireland from john this was complicated by angevins being subjects of kings of france who felt these feudal rights of homage and right of allegiance more legally belonged to them this was particularly true when wardship of geoffrey s son arthur and lordship of brittany was contended between 1202 and 1204 on young king s death in 1183 richard became heir in chief but refused to give up aquitaine to give john an inheritance more by accident than design this meant that while richard inherited patrimony john would become lord of ireland and arthur would be duke of brittany by mid thirteenth century there was a clear unified patrimony and plantagenet empire but this cannot be called an angevin empire as by this

lands known as angevin empire in shades of red henry i of england named his daughter matilda heir but when he died in 1135 matilda was far from england in anjou or maine while her cousin stephen was closer in boulogne giving him advantage he needed to race to england and have himself crowned and anointed king of england matilda s husband geoffrey though he had little interest in england commenced a long struggle for duchy of normandy to create a second front matilda landed in england during 1139 to challenge stephen instigating civil war known as anarchy in 1141 she captured stephen at battle of lincoln prompting collapse of his support while geoffrey pushed on with conquest of normandy over next four years matilda threw away her position through arrogance and inability to be magnanimous in victory she was even forced to release stephen in a hostage exchange for her half brother robert 1st earl of gloucester allowing stephen to resume control of much of england geoffrey never visited england to offer practical assistance but instead sent henry as a male in 1142 when henry was only a view that if england was conquered it would be henry that would become king in 1150 geoffrey also transferred title of duke of normandy to henry but retained dominant role in governance three fortuitous events allowed henry to finally bring conflict to a successful conclusion in 1151 count geoffrey died before having time to complete his plan to divide his inheritance between his sons henry and geoffrey who would have received england and anjou respectively louis vii of france divorced eleanor of aquitaine whom henry quickly married greatly increasing his resources and power with acquisition of duchy of aquitaine in 1153 stephen s son eustace died disheartened stephen who had also recently been widowed gave up fight and with treaty of wallingford repeated peace offer that matilda had rejected in 1142 stephen would be king for life henry his successor preserving stephen s second son william s rights to his family estates stephen did not live long and so henry inherited in late 1154 henry faced many challenges to secure possession of his father s and grandfathers lands that required reassertion and extension of old suzerainties in 1162 theobald archbishop of canterbury died and henry saw an opportunity to re establish what he saw as his rights over church in england by appointing his friend thomas becket to succeed him instead becket proved to be an inept politician whose defiance alienated king and his counsellors henry and becket clashed repeatedly over church tenures henry s brother s marriage and taxation henry reacted by getting becket and other members of english episcopate to recognise sixteen ancient relations between king his courts and writing for first time in constitutions of clarendon when becket tried to leave country without permission henry attempted to ruin him by laying a number of suits relating to becket s time as chancellor in response becket fled into exile for five years relations later improved allowing becket s return but soured again when becket saw coronation of henry s son as coregent by archbishop of york as a challenge to his authority and excommunicated those who had offended him when he heard news henry said what miserable drones and traitors have i nurtured and promoted in my household who let their lord be treated with such shameful contempt by a low born clerk three of henry s men killed becket in canterbury cathedral after becket resisted a botched attempt to arrest him within christian europe henry was widely considered complicit in becket s death opinion of this transgression against church made henry a pariah so in penance he walked barefoot into canterbury cathedral where he was by monks in 1171 henry invaded ireland to assert his overlordship following alarm at success of knights he had allowed to recruit soldiers in england and wales who had assumed role of colonisers and accrued autonomous power including strongbow pope adrian iv had given henry a papal blessing to expand his power into ireland to reform irish church originally this would have allowed some territory to be granted to henry s brother william but other matters had distracted henry and william was now dead instead henry s designs were made plain when he gave lordship of ireland to his youngest son john in 1172 henry ii tried to give his landless youngest son john a wedding gift of three castles of chinon loudun and mirebeau this angered 18 year old young king who had yet to receive any lands from his father and prompted a rebellion by henry ii s wife and three eldest sons louis vii supported rebellion to destabilise henry ii william lion and other subjects of henry ii also joined revolt and it took 18 months for henry to force rebels to submit to his authority in le mans in 1182 henry ii gathered his children to plan a partible inheritance in which his eldest son also called henry would inherit england normandy and anjou richard duchy of aquitaine geoffrey brittany and john ireland this degenerated into further conflict younger henry rebelled again before he died of dysentery and in 1186 geoffrey died after a tournament accident in 1189 richard and philip ii of france took advantage of henry s failing health and forced him to accept humiliating peace terms including naming richard as his sole heir two days later old king died defeated and miserable in knowledge that even his favoured son john had rebelled this fate was seen as price he paid for murder of beckett decline

contemporaries varied he had rejected and humiliated king of france s sister deposed king of cyprus and sold island insulted and refused to give spoils from third crusade to leopold v duke of austria and allegedly arranged assassination of conrad of montferrat his cruelty was exemplified by massacre of 2 600 prisoners in acre however richard was respected for his military leadership and courtly manners despite victories in third crusade he failed to capture jerusalem retreating from holy land with a small band of followers richard was captured by leopold on his return journey he was transferred to henry vi holy roman emperor and a 25 percent tax on goods and income was required to pay his 150 000 mark ransom philip ii of france had overrun normandy while john of england controlled much of richard s remaining lands however when richard returned to england he forgave john and re established his control leaving england permanently in 1194 richard fought philip for five years for return of holdings seized during his incarceration on brink of victory he was wounded by an arrow during siege of chateau de chabrol and died ten days later his failure to produce an heir caused a succession crisis anjou brittany maine and touraine chose richard s nephew arthur as heir while john succeeded in england and normandy philip ii of france again destabilised plantagenet territories on european mainland supporting his vassal arthur s claim to english crown eleanor supported her son john who was victorious at battle of mirebeau and captured rebel leadership arthur was

angevin barons ended john s control of his continental possessions de facto end of angevin empire although henry iii would maintain his claim until 1259 after re establishing his authority in england john planned to retake normandy and anjou by drawing french from paris while another army under otto iv holy roman emperor attacked from north however his allies were defeated at battle of bouvines in

and william marshall s appointment as protector of nine year old henry iii to mark end of angevin period and beginning of plantagenet dynasty marshall won war with victories at lincoln and dover in 1217 leading to treaty of lambeth in which louis renounced his claims in victory marshal protectorate reissued magna carta as basis of future government legacy house of plantagenet historians use period of prince louis s invasion to mark end of angevin period and beginning of plantagenet dynasty outcome of military situation was uncertain at john s death william marshall saved dynasty forcing louis to renounce his claim with a military victory however philip had captured all angevin possessions in france except gascony this collapse had several causes including long term changes in economic power growing cultural differences between england and normandy and in particular fragile familial nature of henry s empire henry iii continued his attempts to reclaim normandy and anjou until 1259 but john s continental losses and consequent growth of capetian power during 13th century marked a turning point in european history richard of york adopted plantagenet as a family name for

criticised by chroniclers for taxing clergy for crusade and his ransom clergy were usually exempt from taxes chroniclers richard of devizes william of newburgh roger of hoveden and ralph de diceto were generally unsympathetic to john s behaviour under richard but more tolerant of earliest years of john s reign accounts of middle and later years of his reign are limited to gervase of canterbury

official title acts and monuments viewed john s reign positively according to historian john gillingham henry and his reign have attracted historians for many years and richard whose reputation has fluctuated wildly is remembered largely because of his military exploits steven runciman in third volume of history of crusades wrote he was a bad son a bad husband and a bad king but a gallant and splendid soldier eighteenth century historian david hume wrote that angevins were pivotal in creating a genuinely english monarchy and ultimately a unified britain interpretations of magna carta and role of rebel barons in 1215 have been revised although charter s symbolic constitutional value for later generations is unquestionable for most historians it is a failed peace agreement between factions john s opposition to papacy and his promotion of royal rights and prerogatives won favour from 16th century tudors john foxe william tyndale and robert barnes viewed john as an early protestant hero and foxe included king in his book of martyrs john speed s 1632 historie of great praised john s great renown as king blaming biased medieval chroniclers for king s poor reputation similarly later protestant historians view henry s role in thomas becket s death and his disputes with french as worthy of praise similarly increased access to contemporary records during late victorian era led to a recognition of henry s contributions to evolution of english law and exchequer william stubbs called henry a legislator king because of his responsibility for major long term reforms in england in contrast richard was a bad son a bad husband a selfish ruler and a vicious man growth of british empire led historian kate norgate to begin detailed research into henry s continental possessions and create term angevin empire during 1880s however 20th century historians challenged many of these conclusions during 1950s jacques john jolliffe and others focused on nature of henry s empire french scholars in particular analysed mechanics of royal power during this period anglocentric aspects of many histories of henry s reign were challenged beginning in 1980s with efforts to unite british and french historical analyses of period detailed study of henry s written records has cast doubt on earlier interpretations robert s 1878 volume tracing henry s itinerary by deductions from pipe rolls for example has been criticised for not acknowledging uncertainty although many of henry s royal charters have been identified their interpretation financial information in pipe rolls and broad economic data from his reign has proven more challenging than once thought significant gaps in historical analysis of henry remain particularly about his rule in anjou and south of france interest in morality of historical figures and scholars waxed during victorian period leading to increased criticism of henry s behaviour and becket s death historians relied on judgement of chroniclers to focus on john s ethos norgate wrote that john s downfall was due not to his military failures but his almost superhuman wickedness and james ramsay blamed john s family background and innate cruelty for his downfall richard s sexuality has been controversial since 1940s when john harvey challenged what he saw as conspiracy of silence surrounding king s homosexuality with chronicles of richard s behaviour two public confessions penances and childless marriage opinion remains divided with gillingham arguing against richard s homosexuality and jean flori acknowledging its possibility according to recent biographers ralph turner and lewis warren although john was an unsuccessful monarch his failings were exaggerated by 12th and 13th century chroniclers jim bradbury echoes contemporary consensus that john was a hard working administrator an able man an able general with as turner suggests distasteful even dangerous personality traits john gillingham author of a biography of richard i agrees and judges john to be a less effective general than turner and warren do bradbury takes a middle view suggesting that modern historians have been overly lenient in evaluating john s flaws popular historian frank mclynn wrote that king s modern reputation amongst historians is bizarre and as a monarch john fails almost all those tests that can be legitimately set
