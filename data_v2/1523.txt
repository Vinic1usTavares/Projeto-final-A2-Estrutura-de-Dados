of men unfit for combat but still able to perform other military duties in june continental congress accepted proposal appointing nicola commander of about 1 000 troops divided into eight companies of soldiers invalid corps was stationed in philadelphia for most part of revolutionary war but it was forced to move once general william howe advanced into city in 1777 haggard 2002 p 149 on september 25 1777 invalid corps retreated to fort mifflin haggard 2002 p 150 due to sickness lack of clean water and worries about british incursions it was recommended to nicola that he move corps to trenton

falling into enemies hands and taking thirty men to claim cargo following its brief stay in trenton invalid corps moved to allentown pennsylvania as suggested by richard peters on september 29 1777 however instead of allentown corps was eventually stationed at easton and bethlehem pennsylvania to assist in management of hospitals and stores like rest of continental army invalid corps suffered harshly from winter of 1777 to 1778 after a brief period in camp of valley forge in spring of 1778 invalid corps moved back to their original quarters at philadelphia just after british evacuated from it bell 1983 p 4 cited in haggard 2002 p 151 service prior to 1782 invalid corps continued its many moves including one from pennsylvania to boston however for next three years corps remained either in philadelphia or future massachusetts capital haggard 2002 p 151 during this three year period nicola drew plan of english lines near philadelphia which showed locations of important fortifications from delaware river to schuylkill river as well as other locations of british military facilities following drawing of plan nicola submitted two papers where he obtained information from british to congress a scheme for a partisan corps and judicious remarks on a proposed reformation in army moreover he strengthened corps by recruiting soldiers around philadelphia thumb left nicola and invalid corps were stationed at west point new york pictured and faced multiple difficulties while there on june 13 1781 nicola and invalid corps was given order by congress to move to west point new york this however was difficult to accomplish on june 26 nicola wrote a letter to george washington that corps would not move until a replacement unit could take over for them haggard 2002 p 152 another reason hindering move was pay corps did not receive a payment for nearly ten months a compromise was later reached between nicola and board of war that six months pay would be given to invalid corps after their leave to pennsylvania john david woelper a captain of invalid corps sent a letter to washington on july 20 1781 claiming nicola was treating corps badly in note woelper requested nicola s arrest haggard 2002 p 153 nicola sent letters about situation to washington who wanted to have it settled as soon as corps arrived at west point washington who did not show any favoritism to either sent both series of letters to general alexander mcdougall and asked court in west point to settle matter upon arrival of invalid corps at west point charges were dropped and nicola was cleared of all charges on august 4 1781 nicola complained to george washington that corps would have great difficult during winter time two months later on september 19 nicola complained to general horatio gates about mcdougall s lack of respect to corps haggard 2002 pp 153 154 eventually nicola proposed to washington that invalid corps should move back to philadelphia however for various reasons washington denied it haggard 2002 p 154 during corps tenure at west point nicola faced many challenges firstly his troops did not act way he wanted in october 1777 nicola sent out an arrest warrant for sergeant major jonathan guy for giving uniforms of continental army to british other example was in april 1778 nicola stopped robberies done by members of corps in easton secondly nicola was unable to fill higher ranks because of lack of qualifications from men in a letter to washington nicola wrote that without men he was unable to keep men under proper discipline during court trials nicola had to borrow men from other units as jury third problem was lack of enlisted men for corps final problem was poor financial situation that nicola was in haggard 2002 p 155 in a letter to pennsylvania supreme executive council dated april 7 1779 nicola asked for a pay raise saying he was unable to purchase food or even clothes some members of invalid corps claimed they were unable to provide for themselves on february 5 1782 pennsylvania supreme executive council fired nicola from position of town major their reasoning was that no such duty was needed at time hazard 1853 p 185 during that same month and struggling for money nicola asked continental superintendent of finance robert morris for money that congress did not pay corps even that however failed to give invalid corps its money morris 1978 pp 125 126 newburgh letter thumb right an excerpt of newburgh letter 1782 on may 22 1782 nicola wrote newburgh letter to george washington from his army quarters in newburgh new york nicola used first part of letter to describe a financial hardship that both he and many of men under his command were facing their lack of pay most of army had been waiting for months some even for years for their pay from congress justification for this was found in articles of confederation which allowed continental congress to set up an army in time of war but was not obligated to levy taxes right to collect taxes was reserved for respective states most of which were unable to afford maintenance of an army nicola believed that this condition was manifested weakness of a republic writing when benefits of a mixed government are pointed out and duly considered will be examined readily adopted alluding to person on nicola wrote washington it is well recognized that same abilities which have led us through difficulties apparently insurmountable by human power to victory and glory those qualities that have merited and universal esteem and veneration obtained of an army would be most likely to conduct and direct us in smoother paths of peace nicola 1782 p 265 after concluding his criticism of republican form of government nicola suggested that washington take title of king recognizing that terms tyranny and monarchy had too many negative connotations at time nicola advised using an alternative title in near future but if all other things were once adjusted i believe strong argument might be produced for admitting title of king which i conceive would be attended with some material advantages washington was aware that some feared he aspired to be an american cromwell in his reply dated same day he gave nicola a decidedly clear answer washington said no incident in course of war in me triggers painful feelings as your message that such ideas are circulating in army as you expressed it haggard 2002 p 158 washington mentioned that he knew not what part of his conduct could have given rise to such a petition which he thought a calamity facing united states david humphreys and jonathan trumbull two of washington s aides certified in a rare precautionary measure that proved document to be genuine nicola responded to harsh rejection of his complaints and suggestions on may 23 he replied to washington expressing his sadness at displeasing washington and claiming that nothing had ever affected him so greatly as his reproof furthermore nicola asked washington to evaluate every mistake that he had committed haggard 2002 p 159 washington s answer to this and two other letters of apology written by nicola on may 24 and 28 are not known however relationship between nicola and washington soon returned to its prior normalcy haggard 2002 p 160 dissolution of invalid corps and promotion in november 1782 nicola complained to washington about fact that secretary at war general benjamin lincoln wanted invalid corps dissolved saying its affected military more than its benefits nicola argued against its dissolution he claimed that no other regiment had done more service than corps against recommendation of washington dissolution of invalid corps was ordered by continental congress in may 1783 haggard 2002 p 161 between june and august nicola was back on road to philadelphia there he resided for two months after official conclusion of peace by treaty of paris 1783 serving as a commissioner in regard to settlement of matters concerning him and his regiment on november 27 1793 he was elevated to rank of brigadier general in june 1784 congress finally charged him for a period of four and a half months to draw up certificates for members of his former command final years in mid 1780s nicola advocated construction of a stagecoach route between philadelphia and reading haggard 2002 p 166 failing to secure route he planned to temporarily operate a guest house for financial reasons he instead became manager of workhouse in philadelphia in 1788 in 1793 nicola became inspector of philadelphia city militia brigade haggard 2002 p 167 during whiskey rebellion of 1794 he briefly returned to his former position as barrack master and commander of city of philadelphia during this period nicola was maintained his affiliation with american philosophical society serving multiple terms as curator and continuing with his research in 1791 he wrote a controversial pamphlet entitled divinity of jesus christ considered from scripture evidences this pamphlet concluded that christ s divinity cannot be found in scripture due to its controversial nature nicola considered publishing it in various forms but eventually decided on attaching his name to writing nicola s second wife died in 1797 and he retired following year haggard 2002 p 168 in 1798 he moved to alexandria virginia to be closer to his daughter he died on august 8 1807 earlier in that year because of financial troubles he had added words any deficiency i presume cincinnati society will make good to his will bell 1983 p 8 at time of
