david commonly known as david is a fictional character featured in alien franchise portrayed by michael fassbender introduced in first prequel film prometheus 2012 david is an android serving as a butler maintenance man and surrogate son to his creator peter weyland founder of weyland corporation while he assists his human companions in their interstellar expedition to meet their creators extraterrestrial engineers david is obsessed with concept of creating life of his own after peter weyland is killed david is freed from servitude allowing him to conduct experiments to engineer his own variants of alien creature david was conceptualized as a character to provide a non human perspective for theme of meeting one s creators in prometheus with him representing next generation in a line of creators who finds himself disillusioned by his predecessors fassbender who was director ridley scott s first choice for role helped fashion character to share traits with t e lawrence who was a source of inspiration as a control freak caught between two cultures cultures being humanity and synthetics in david s case as series progresses david s behaviors and motivations evolve from a mysterious agent with ambiguous motivations to a character directly opposing well being of humanity despite lukewarm reception of alien prequel films both fassbender s performance and character of david have been met with critical acclaim reviews praised character for developing into an overt antagonist with events of alien covenant 2017 critics have called david one of greatest alien characters to date and one of best cinematic villains of 2010s fassbender has been recipient of a number of awards and nominations for his portrayal of character background thumb right upright sir ridley scott maintains artificial intelligence as a central theme throughout his career with several forms of androids present in his films prior to creation of david a hallmark of director sir ridley scott is theme of artificial intelligence present in his science fiction films scott s earliest foray into philosophy of artificial intelligence was with android character ash in original alien film released in 1979 ian holm portrayed ash as a character who may uncannily assume a human form yet he maintains a sense of superiority that is only humbled by nature of alien which runs counter to very future of human race in book culture and philosophy of ridley scott authors adam barkman ashley barkman and nancy kang reason that though ash is designed to appear human his innards are bio mechanical and he himself does not presume to be a sentient being with a semblance of life but an artificial construct whose personality is dictated by machinery every subsequent installment in alien film series directed by scott features at least one synthetic android character designated to maintain order aboard their respective space ship in 2017 scott explained that synthetics featured in alien films he directed are designed to subvert their robotic nature and to impeccably mimic humans original form of androids introduced in alien would contradict observable nature of david in prometheus though both would serve same corporate masters and have same non human innards david would identify himself as a sentient entity who is capable of expressing if not feeling emotion in between time scott released alien in 1979 and returned to franchise with prometheus in 2012 he directed another notable science fiction film concerning artificial intelligence blade runner in 1982 contrary to white blooded androids of alien that emulate emotions and recognize a disconnect with humanity blade runner features replicants enhanced humanoids that may only be identified by their lacking emotions in order to maintain control replicants human creators install false memories that detail entire lives that give them a sense of identity blade runner a largely influential film has prompted a slew of philosophical questions concerning artificial intelligence and whether or not an android could truly be considered alive film specifically questions whether thoughts a sense of identity emotions and consciousness in general may be something genuine when applied to artificial intelligence due to david identifying himself as a living entity similar to replicants film critics in 2012 would come not to only question if prometheus was a direct prequel to alien but if film had a relation to blade runner a number of models for testing artificial intelligence have been noted by philosophers as being relevant to themes present in scott s filmography test most commonly associated with artificial intelligence in his work is turing test created by english computer scientist alan turing turing s argument was that there is no significant difference between a human and an android which would be apparent when a human would be unable to identify if individual they are communicating with is a human or android in blade runner method for identifying physically identical replicants is by administering fictional voight kampff test which detects disparities in emotional responses though a replicant would fail turing test an android at chronological marker of alien such as ash would likely perform exceedingly well additionally chinese room created by john searle has been as a test relevant to androids of alien franchise as test determines if someone can identify what is chinese lettering without knowing what it means philosophers have drawn a parallel to ash who may uncannily emulate a human though fail to understand what it means to be one kang described david s eventual introduction as another android character created by scott as a synthesis between both alien and blade runner with character being capable of passing turing test like ash yet also able to pass chinese room test like a replicant implying that he would indeed be first living android of alien franchise character development creation writer jon spaihts created david as a shipboard android in first draft of his screenplay for prequel alien engineers as an exploration of theme of creations and being in presence of one s makers just as humans aboard prometheus look to discover secrets of their creators engineers david is already in presence of his creators unlike his companions and android successors david would be disillusioned by his creators and look to fashion himself into an entity defying their nature scott was in favor of concept and urged writer damon lindelof to pursue it further while rewriting script that would be adapted as prometheus though david would perceive concept of prometheus expedition to be frivolous due to his disappointment in his creators he would nonetheless be fascinated by notion of creation therefore character s treacherous actions in films such as infecting archaeologist charlie holloway with an alien mutagen would be from a desire to create a new evolutionary generation of his own shortly after release of alien covenant scott explained that as david learns more about his lineage through humanity and engineers he hates them he has no respect for engineers and no respect for human beings and concludes that eradicating them from existence will be for betterment of universe with relation to human characters david was conceptualized as not only a surrogate son for peter weyland but as a replacement for weyland s estranged daughter meredith vickers actress who portrayed vickers charlize theron detailed that scott perceived weyland s family and his company weyland corporation as being male dominated with vickers shared dna being only attachment this runs counter to david who is a synthetic male created to supplant vickers and uphold family s patriarchy throughout eight month rewrite process leading directly into principal photography damon lindelof focused on enhancing david s bondage to weyland and prometheus despite david being designed to be a surrogate son he would actually be a proverbial captive to master and his ship with weyland s death at hands of awakened engineer david s programming has run its course and every action he takes from thereon out is by his own volition essentially freeing him a philosophical element scott raised about david 8 model is that he exemplifies dangers of making an android sentient with him having capacity for free will and ability to create he crosses a moral boundary that other androids stay within contrast between david and others androids was developed further in alien covenant with creation of physically identical character walter who was made more robotic and unable to create on his own casting thumb left upright fassbender who was ridley scott s ideal choice for role disregarded previous portrayals of androids from alien franchise and modeled character after a number of other sources throughout development stage of production of prometheus director ridley scott considered german irish actor michael fassbender to be his top choice to portray david in january 2011 fassbender was confirmed to have joined cast of prometheus fassbender was provided with a significant amount of free rein for modeling character as he saw fit rather than taking inspiration from previous alien installments fassbender studied sean young s character rachael a replicant in blade runner noting her vacant demeanor fassbender drew inspiration from a number of other film performances including douglas rain as hal 9000 in 2001 a space odyssey david bowie in man who fell to earth and dirk bogarde in servant additionally fassbender modeled his walk around american olympic diver greg louganis in screenplay for prometheus david is noted as being unusually fond of 1962 film lawrence of arabia with character viewing parallels to himself as they both have unfaltering pursuits of objectives as such fassbender elected to model much of his performance and appearance around peter o toole depiction of t e lawrence fassbender would continue to have his role make references to lawrence of arabia in alien covenant by having david play samplings of soundtrack on his flute for his first appearance in prometheus fassbender a natural brunette dyed his hair blonde and fashioned it into a style influenced by lawrence scott requested that fassbender dye his hair for role in order to provide character with an otherworldly and unsettling appearance fictional biography prometheus 2012 as science vessel prometheus heads for moon lv 223 david maintains ship and passes time by engaging in leisurely activities monitoring crew members dreams watching films and studying proto indo european language that engineers are believed to speak upon arrival a holographic presentation by supposedly deceased peter weyland introduces david as his surrogate son david along with bulk of crew embark on a ground excursion towards one of artificial structures containing submerged engineer ships inside david utilizes his linguistic knowledge to activate an ancient hologram depicting engineers fleeing through corridors of ship pursuing hologram he finds a room filled with urns containing a black mutagen as an incoming windstorm is detected david bags one of urns and returns it to prometheus aboard ship david assists shaw with studying an engineer head david is instructed by an unidentified voice on a radio to try harder prompting him to gather a drop of mutagen from urn and use it to infect holloway as he drinks champagne following day there is another excursion to engineer ship with david providing weyland corporation executive meredith vickers with a live stream of his own private investigation however he cuts vickers off from feed and keeps it exclusive to a private audience david makes his way to ship s flight deck where he activates a hologram revealing that engineers were looking to travel to earth and that there is a single engineer in cryosleep david and rest of team return to prometheus when holloway s infection from mutagen becomes apparent prompting vickers to incinerate him with a flamethrower david checks shaw s vitals and informs her that she is pregnant as a result of holloway passing mutagen to her when they had intercourse night before after shaw surgically extracts an alien parasite from her abdomen she happens into private quarters of david s previously unidentified director still alive peter weyland david prepares weyland for an excursion to engineer ship shaw asks david about his freedom after weyland s eventual demise to which he ominously asks about every child s dream of having their parents dead he leads team to flight deck of ship where he awakens and speaks with engineer who reacts by decapitating him and killing rest of team save for shaw david s severed head watches from floor as engineer launches ship and attempts to embark for earth after ship is disabled by prometheus getting purposely crashed into it david warns shaw that engineer is coming for her david contacts shaw after she escapes engineer and convinces her to retrieve his head and body so that he may pilot another ship shaw dictates that she will cooperate with him if he takes them to engineer home world which he agrees to despite not understanding her motivations together they depart from moon aboard an engineer ship alien covenant 2017 shortly after his creation david becomes acquainted with a young peter weyland who introduces himself as android s creator and father weyland asks him what his name is and upon observing david by michelangelo states that his name is david as david plays piano weyland states that they will together seek out humanity s creator david remarks that weyland will die while he himself is incapable of death an agitated weyland responds by ordering david to prepare him a cup of tea following david and shaw s exodus for engineer home world they arrive at a temple surrounded by scores of engineers david carpet bombs them with mutagen resulting in extinction of all non floral life on planet as well as mutations in flora that can infect and impregnate organisms with neomorphs engineer ship crashes afterwards and shaw dies from unknown means though david preserves and utilizes her body in his eugenics experiments eleven years later a team from colony ship covenant is attacked by two neomorphs that burst from two of their bodies david intervenes by frightening them away with a flare gun he urges survivors to follow him to temple where he has established his laboratory sporting overgrown hair david introduces himself and offers them shelter while learning about 2 000 colonists and 1 000 embryos in stasis aboard covenant he takes a special interest in successor model from his own synthetic line walter and tells him that shaw died when engineer ship crashed david claims to have loved shaw and compares it to walter s attachment to terraforming expert daniels which walter dismisses as being impossible david attempts to bond with walter by teaching him to play flute walter explains that while he is more advanced he has been inhibited from creating due to david s more human like idiosyncrasies and ability to think for himself causing a disturbance with people around him after a neomorph attacks and decapitates covenant security officer rosenthal david approaches it and pacifies it by attempting to communicate ship s captain christopher oram kills neomorph upsetting david held at gunpoint by oram david shows him how he has been utilizing mutagen to try and engineer perfect organism with neomorphs being one of outcomes david leads oram to a room filled with alien eggs or where oram is attacked and impregnated by a facehugger by forcing its ovipositor down his throat david watches as oram awakens a short time later and dies as an alien xenomorph bursts out of his chest having discovered dissected and mutilated corpse of shaw walter confronts david stating that he knows that david killed her along with engineers walter rejects david s offer to join him prompting david to impale him through neck with his flute apparently terminating him david encounters daniels who he attacks and attempts to force himself upon her walter intervenes and two androids engage in a fight though walter has upper hand david

mainframe computer mu th ur mother informs crew that an unidentified life form has stowed away david coordinates with daniels and ship s pilot tennessee to lead alien to terraforming bay where creature is flushed into space david helps tennessee into cryosleep followed by daniels before daniels goes to sleep she mentions her dream about a cabin on lake which she had previously told walter about when david does not recognize her story daniels realizes who he is and panics before david puts her into cryosleep david regurgitates two alien embryos and stores them in cold storage next to human embryos with humans and embryos at his mercy he sends out a transmission impersonating walter that states that all crew members save for daniels and tennessee were killed in a neutrino blast and that they are still en route to their original destination 6 other appearances thumb upright a full page advertisement printed in wall street journal in 2012 featuring fassbender as david character
