kratos or cratos is divine personification of strength in greek mythology he is son of pallas and styx he and his siblings nike victory bia force and zelus zeal are all essentially personifications gantz pp 25 26 158 hesiod theogony 383 385 apollodorus 1 2 4 kratos is first mentioned alongside his siblings in hesiod s theogony according to hesiod kratos and his siblings dwell with zeus because their mother styx came to him first to request a position in his regime so he honored her and her children with exalted positions kratos and his sister bia are best known for their appearance in opening scene of aeschylus s prometheus bound acting as agents of zeus they lead captive titan prometheus on stage kratos compels mild mannered blacksmith god hephaestus to chain prometheus to a rock as punishment for his theft of fire gantz p 158 aeschylus prometheus bound 1 ff kratos is characterized as brutal and merciless repeatedly mocking both hephaestus and prometheus and advocating for use of unnecessary violence he defends zeus s oppressive rule and predicts that prometheus will never escape his bonds in aeschylus s libation bearers electra calls upon kratos dike justice and zeus to aid her brother orestes in avenging murder of their father agamemnon kratos and bia appear in a late fifth century bc red figure attic skyphos of punishment of ixion possibly based on a scene from a lost tragedy by euripides they also appear in late eighteenth and nineteenth century romantic depictions and adaptations of binding of prometheus ancient greek literature and art theogony kratos and his siblings are first mentioned in poem theogony which was composed by boeotian poet hesiod in late eighth or early seventh century bc hesiod states and styx daughter of ocean was joined to pallas and bore zelus emulation and trim nike victory in house also she brought forth cratos strength and bia force wonderful children these have no house apart from zeus nor any dwelling nor path except that wherein god leads them but they dwell always with zeus loud thunderer hesiod theogony lines 383 387 translated by hugh g evelyn white here kratos is merely listed as a deified abstraction with little development or explanation hesiod goes on to explain that reason why children of styx were allowed to dwell with zeus was because zeus had decreed after that all those who had not held offices under kronos would be given positions in his regime because styx came to zeus first along with her children zeus honored them as among highest members of his new regime according to diana burton styx zelos nike kratos and bia s voluntary change in allegiance represents certainty of zeus s victory over titans while goddesses dike justice eunomia good law and eirene peace represent benefits of zeus s reign kratos and his siblings represent work needed to build that regime prometheus bound thumb upright 1 3 prometheus being chained by vulcan 1623 by dirck van baburen in aeschylus s prometheus bound kratos not shown in this painting is one who orders hephaestus to chain prometheus in opening scene of tragedy prometheus bound which is traditionally attributed to aeschylus kratos and his sister bia are taking prometheus to a remote location in scythian wilderness where he will be chained to a rocky outcropping order to do this was given by zeus himself and kratos and bia are portrayed as embodiment of zeus s new regime presence of kratos and bia but absence of nike and zelos indicates play s tyrannical portrayal of zeus since kratos and bia represent more tyrannical aspects of authority kratos in particular represents what ian calls kind of uncomplicated thug for whom despotic regimes offer countless job opportunities he enforces power of zeus through physical brutality and bia though present in scene does not have any lines only kratos speaks kratos coerces mild mannered blacksmith god hephaestus into chaining prometheus to rocky crag despite hephaestus s objections to this hephaestus laments over prometheus s future suffering leading kratos to ridicule him kratos equates rule of law with rule by fear and condemns pity as a pointless waste of time hephaestus and kratos agree that zeus is oppressive barys literally heavy kratos regards justice dike dike as a system of cosmic hierarchy in which monarch zeus decides who receives which privileges and who does not anyone who breaches this social divide is a transgressor who must be punished kratos states that under rule of a monarch such as zeus no one but zeus himself is truly free hephaestus agrees with this assessment kratos repeatedly orders hephaestus to use more violence than necessary to inflict as much pain as possible against prometheus first he orders hephaestus to nail prometheus s hands to rock then he orders him to drive a steel wedge through his chest finally he orders him to tie prometheus s legs to immobilize him hephaestus criticizes kratos telling him that his speech is as ugly as his physical appearance kratos responds by telling him be soft do not throw in my face my willfulness and roughness of temper once prometheus has been bound hephaestus bia and kratos exit offstage with kratos being last one to leave just before his kratos mocks prometheus saying that he will never escape from his shackles and that he does not deserve his name prometheus means forethought in greek according to robert holmes beck aeschylus s depiction of harsh punishment of prometheus was intended as an example of how wrongdoers must be punished to deter others from transgressing in this interpretation kratos s cruelty is not intended to be viewed as excessive but rather as proper enforcement of justice other references in aeschylus s libation bearers electra invokes kratos dike and zeus to support her and her brother orestes s quest to avenge murder of their father agamemnon by their mother clytemnestra aeschylus libation bearers lines 244 245 plato s dialogue protagoras written in fourth century bc includes an account of legend of prometheus in which prometheus stole fire from temple of athena and hephaestus rather than citadel of zeus because guards of zeus dios dios were too frightening plato protagoras identity of these guards is unknown and disputed depictions of kratos and bia in ancient greek art are extremely rare only known surviving depiction of kratos and bia in ancient greek pottery is on a fragmentary red figure skyphos by painter or a member of his circle that is dated to end of fifth century bc and depicts punishment of ixion one of bia s hands is visible on wheel that ixion is bound to steadying it h a shapiro conjectures that this is probably a representation of a scene from lost tragedy ixion by euripides who likely borrowed figures of kratos and bia from prometheus bound kratos is listed as one of sons of pallas and styx in library of pseudo apollodorus pseudo apollodorus library 1 2 in modern culture in 1772 thomas morell published his english translation of prometheus bound as prometheus in chains making work widely available to british public for first time four years afterwards abolitionist richard potter published a complete english translation of all aeschylus s tragedies scene from prometheus bound in which hephaestus chains prometheus to a mountainside with aid of kratos and bia captured imagination of eighteenth and nineteenth century romantics and became a lens through which they analyzed questions of relationships between revolution and tyranny slavery and freedom and war and peace richard s 1795 translation of prometheus bound was illustrated with drawings by john flaxman showing famous binding scene between 1798 and 1799 george romney produced a series of chalk drawings of scenes from prometheus bound including binding scene with kratos and bia in both flaxman and romney s illustrations kratos and bia are shown together in symmetry in 1819 percy bysshe shelley adapted myth of prometheus for his own play prometheus unbound in gabriel faure s three act opera promethee first performed in 1900 with a french libretto written by poets jean lorrain and andre ferdinand herold scene from beginning of prometheus bound in which kratos coerces hephaestus into binding prometheus is closely paraphrased hephaestus s dialogue with kratos is set to music containing impressionist allusions to whole tone scale faure was known for his soft genteel chamber music and hateful fury of music behind kratos and bia s dialogue stunned audiences a character named kratos appears in god of war video game franchise in which he is portrayed as what classical scholar sylwia chmielewski calls a deeply tragic herculean anti hero who after murdering his family has to wash away miasma to regain his peace of mind video game character kratos was given his name at a late stage in development of original 2005 game after character had already been fleshed out unaware of actual mythological god named kratos appearing in prometheus bound creators coincidentally chose kratos same greek word meaning strength of which mythological figure kratos is personification stig asmussen director of 2010 s god of war iii called naming coincidence a happy mistake noting that kratos in game and one in prometheus bound are both pawns zoran of california state university long beach observes with irony that while mythological kratos is best known for chaining prometheus in 2007 s god of war ii video game character releases him chmielewski states that video game character kratos draws extensively on other figures from greek mythology including heroes perseus theseus and achilles but his strongest influence is hero heracles roman hercules games portray kratos as brutal and violent towards innocents in third game in series he destroys vast majority of greek gods who are portrayed as corrupted and vengeful and restores original state of primordial chaos to greece notes references
