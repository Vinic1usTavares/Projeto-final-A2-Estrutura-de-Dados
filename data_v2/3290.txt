council building script called for an indiana jones style tunnel for headless monks chamber but as that kind of location was not available in cardiff a set was built instead skulls were hand crafted and required a lot of preparation so it was one of first things started for episode s production broadcast and reception wedding of river song was first broadcast in united kingdom on bbc one on 1 october 2011 and on same date in united states on bbc america overnight ratings showed that episode was watched by 6 1 million viewers third most watched programme of evening and an improvement upon

to 91 critical reception episode received mostly positive reviews from critics with some reservations over resolution and character interactions dan martin of guardian gave a positive review believing that episode moves along bigger 50 year story and effectively reboots show he particularly praised it for being simplistic as well as visuals of all history running together at once rachel tarley writing for metro praising gripping race against time and noting that script was snappy and witty throughout but episode had its eerie and touching moments where necessary too a v club keith phipps gave episode an a calling it pretty close to a perfect season finale for those not looking for all of answers morgan jeffery of digital spy wrote as a piece of saturday night entertainment it works packed full of strong performances stunning visuals and sharp dialogue and as resolution to a series long arc it s mostly satisfactory though episode poses as many questions as it answers dave golder of sfx gave episode four and a half out of five stars explaining that he was in conflict whether to rate it five or four stars and calling it about nine tenths a great great episode he referred to many concepts of episode as a sumptuous confection made mostly out of finest ingredients and found teselecta resolution a cool twist at first but it meant whole episode is just an elaborate version of classic star trek voyager alternate timeline shtick complete with reset button ign s matt risley rated wedding of river song 8 5 out of 10 writing it managed to tie together plot threads and character arcs without too much deus ex predictability and with a whole host of trademark sci fi spectacle to boot though he thought wedding felt a little too rushed to leave any lingering emotional aftertaste he praised other emotional moments in episode and fact that everyone thinks doctor is dead will help show explore a new angle gavin fuller of daily telegraph called it an uneven ending he praised it for being visually clever and liked way silence were handled but thought teselecta solution was a bit of a cop out neela debnath of independent was displeased with episode calling it a that refused to tie up loose ends neatly and that as a finale it was underwhelming in terms of drama and overwhelming in terms of information however she praised fact that moffat appears to be spreading storylines over several series believing it strengthens show on other hand hitfix s alan sepinwall thought that resolutions from wedding on were excellent but felt it could have done without another alternate universe as it was similar to previous finale big bang maureen ryan of tv squad criticised episode for having too many bells and whistles which undermined emotional moments especially wedding which she did not believe showed that doctor was really in love with river however she did enjoy callbacks to previous episodes such as churchill and amy and rory s relationship charlie jane anders of io9 thought it was better than previous finale big bang as there were more answers fun and a satisfying resolution however she was critical of reason river had to kill doctor as well as their relationship and believed that amy s killing madame kovarian was no substitute for amy s dealing with what kovarian had done to her child references external links category 2011 british television episodes
