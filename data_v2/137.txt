sms hela was an aviso built for german kaiserliche marine imperial navy in mid 1890s last vessel of that type to be built by german empire as culmination of type in german service she represented significant improvements over earlier vessels particularly and es which had been disappointments in service she was intended to serve as a fleet scout and as a flotilla leader for torpedo boats hela marked a step toward development of light cruiser armed with a battery of four guns and three torpedo tubes ship proved to be too weakly armed for front line combat hela had a relatively short active career engine damage during sea trials shortly after her completion in 1896 delayed start of her service with fleet until 1898 she served as a scout for i squadron from then until 1900 when she was deployed as part of an expeditionary force to help suppress boxer rebellion in qing china hela saw little action during deployment instead frequently patrolling coast of china and yangtze river after returning to germany in mid 1901 she served with i scouting group and main fleet until late 1902 when she was reduced to a gunnery training ship though boiler problems forced a more thorough reconstruction that lasted from 1903 to 1910 ship was used as a tender for fleet from october 1910 through mid 1914 with few events of note for hela during this period following outbreak of world war i in july 1914 hela was deployed to patrol line guarding german bight she was present at but was not engaged in battle of helgoland bight in august next month while conducting training off helgoland she was torpedoed and sunk by british submarine despite fact that hela sank in less than half an hour all of her crew save two men were rescued by a german u boat and patrol boat design hela named for schooner of 1852 vintage was culmination in development of aviso type in german fleet avisos were developed from earlier torpedo boats and were intended for use in home waters with fleet both as flotilla leaders to direct groups of torpedo boats and as scouts for fleet s capital ships first aviso was purchased from a british shipbuilder in 1875 seven more ships were built in german yards by early 1890s of these last four vessels comprising and es had proved to be significant disappointments in service owing to their poor seaworthiness and insufficient speed in 1893 naval construction staff prepared a design for a new vessel designated h which remedied problems of earlier vessels in part through a significant increase in size aviso type culminated in what would later be referred to as light cruiser german designers incorporated best aspects of helas design with those of their contemporary unprotected cruisers resulting in s which were first true light cruisers built general characteristics and machinery thumb left hela early in her career hela was long at waterline and overall she had a beam of and a draft of forward and aft she was designed to displace and at full load displacement increased to her hull was constructed with transverse and longitudinal steel frames which contained twenty two watertight compartments above armored deck and ten below a double bottom ran for thirty five percent of length of hull which had a pronounced ram bow ship had a minimal superstructure with a small conning tower a raised forecastle deck extended from stem to funnel she was fitted with a pair of light pole masts fitted with spotting tops hela s crew consisted of 7 officers and 171 enlisted men as completed and later increased to 8 officers and 187 enlisted men she carried a number of small boats including one barge one yawl and three dinghies later in her career barge was exchanged for a picket boat hela was very seaworthy but she rolled badly having a metacentric height of and tended to ship a significant amount of water in a head sea owing to fact that she was slightly bow heavy steering was controlled by a single rudder she had average maneuverability ship was powered by two 3 cylinder triple expansion steam engines each drove a screw propeller that was in diameter each engine had its own separate engine room engines were supplied with steam by six locomotive boilers split into two boiler rooms which were ducted into a single funnel amidships engines were rated at and a top speed of though on trials they reached a half knot better coal storage amounted to range figures for ship in her original configuration have not survived hela was equipped with three electrical generators that produced 36 kilowatts at 67 volts armament and armor thumb hela in kiel in was armed with four sk l imperial german navy gun nomenclature sk denotes that gun is quick firing while l 30 denotes length of gun in this case l 30 gun is 30 calibers meaning that gun barrel is 30 times as long as it is in diameter quick firing guns in individual mountings they were carried in mpl c 89 mounts with an elevation range of 10 to 20 degrees at maximum elevation guns could reach targets at guns fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of these guns were provided with a total of 800 rounds for 200 per gun rate of fire was theoretically fourteen shots per minute but in practice it was limited to ten rounds per minute she was also equipped with six sk l 40 quick firing guns each mounted in individual torpedo boat mount c 92 these guns fired shells at a muzzle velocity of maximum elevation for guns was twenty degrees which provided a range of shell storage amounted to 1 500 rounds or 300 per gun her armament was completed with three torpedo tubes two were placed on deck on broadside and third was submerged in bow of ship these were supplied with a total of eight torpedoes which carried a warhead their maximum range at 32 knots was when set to their range increased to hela was lightly armored she was protected by an armor deck that was thick and composed of steel deck sloped on sides and was slightly increased in thickness to to provide a measure of protection against direct fire an armored coaming that was thick protected uptakes from boilers her conning tower was armored with thick steel on sides she was equipped with cork cofferdams to reduce ingress of water in event of hull damage was modernized in 1903 1910 at kaiserliche werft imperial shipyard in danzig vessel s internal subdivision was improved with eight additional watertight compartments above waterline and an extension of double bottom to cover thirty nine percent of hull as part of modifications to her hull both of broadside torpedo tubes were moved to torpedo rooms below waterline she also received eight marine type water tube boilers in place of her old models and a second funnel was added new boilers produced on trials propelling ship to same top speed coal storage was increased to which permitted a cruising radius of at a speed of both of her stern 8 8 cm guns were removed and their ammunition allotment was reduced to 156 shells per gun her aft superstructure was enlarged to provide additional accommodation space ship also received a larger bridge service history thumb left hela shortly after entering was laid down in december 1893 at ag weser shipyard in bremen she was launched on 28 march 1895 and at ceremony vizeadmiral vice admiral victor valois chief of marinestation der nordsee north sea naval station christened ship she was moved to kaiserliche werft imperial shipyard in wilhelmshaven for final fitting out in january 1896 ship was commissioned for sea trials on 3 may initially under command of korvettenkapitan kk corvette captain johannes stein though he was replaced by kapitanleutnant kl captain lieutenant carl in august her initial testing was interrupted by damage to her engines which necessitated her decommissioning on 19 september for repairs she spent next year and a half out of service hela was recommissioned on 10 march 1898 under command of kk fritz sommerwerck and was assigned to i squadron to serve as its aviso these duties were interrupted beginning on 14 june when hela was chosen to escort kaiser wilhelm ii aboard his yacht hohenzollern for sailing regattas in germany and then a cruise to norwegian waters in july that included a stop in hardangerfjord on 31 july hela returned to i squadron before being detached again on 17 september following conclusion of annual fleet maneuvers she again escorted hohenzollern with wilhelm ii and his wife augusta victoria aboard along with protected cruiser for a voyage to eastern mediterranean sea she returned to her unit on 8 december after which kk paul rampold relieved sommerwerck in early 1899 hela and rest of i squadron embarked on a training cruise into atlantic while passing through english channel ships stopped in

that were completed by 4 september allowing her to return to unit for rest of maneuvers in mid september she accompanied hohenzollern for a cruise to sweden and she and pre dreadnought battleship escorted kaiser s yacht on a visit to britain that lasted from 17 to 30 november hela concluded year with a training cruise with i squadron in skagerrak in december boxer rebellion thumb hela as originally spent first half of 1900 as she had previous years conducting training exercises with fleet her routine was interrupted by events in qing china where on 20 june during boxer rebellion german ambassador clemens von was murdered by chinese nationalists widespread violence against westerners in china led to a creation of an alliance between germany and seven other great powers so called eight nation alliance united kingdom italy russia austria hungary united states france and japan those soldiers who were in china at time were too few in number to defeat boxers in peking there was a force of slightly more than 400 officers and infantry from armies of eight european powers at time primary german military force in china was east asia squadron which consisted of protected cruisers hertha and unprotected cruiser and gunboats and there was also a german 500 man detachment in taku combined with other nations units force numbered some 2 100 men these men led by british admiral edward seymour attempted to reach peking but were stopped in battle of tientsin as a result kaiser determined an expeditionary force would be sent to china to reinforce east asia squadron hela was assigned to naval expedition on 4 july which included four s sent to china to reinforce german squadron there ships departed kiel five days later and arrived off coast of china in late august hela entered mouth of yangtze and then patrolled yellow sea through end of september she contributed a landing party consisting of four officers and seventy four men to participate in assault on chinese fortifications at shanhai pass aviso spent november anchored in wusong roadstead remaining there until mid december when she returned to yangtze at end of month she was sent to shanghai hela then returned to yangtze in january 1901 stopping in zhenjiang before returning to shanghai in february and remaining there into march at that time kk maximilian von spee arrived to take command of vessel from rampold she later visited german concession at tsingtao before returning to shanghai at end of may while there she received orders to return to germany and kk joachim von bredow took command of vessel for voyage home on 1 june she and rest of expeditionary force departed to return home arriving in wilhelmshaven on 11 august 1901 1913 thumb alt a long slender ship with a tall smoke stack belching thick black smoke hela off norwegian coast after her modernization after returning from china hela immediately participated in annual fleet maneuvers serving for duration with i scouting group from 26 august to 19 september she joined unit again for a voyage to oslo norway in mid december arriving back in wilhelmshaven on 16th hela returned to service with main fleet in 1902 and while on a cruise in atlantic in may she was detached to escort light cruiser which had been damaged off lightship by this time german naval command had decided that hela was too weakly armed to be useful as a fleet scout and so she was sent to kaiserliche werft in kiel on 16 october to be modernized for use as a training ship for light guns while in shipyard hela passed from bredow s command to kk karl zimmerman s work was completed on 21 december and she was recommissioned for this duty on 31 january 1903 but poor condition of ship s boilers required further modifications which were carried out at kaiserliche werft in danzig beginning on 25 april aviso replaced hela in her intended role some ship location reports in german archives in bundesarchiv german federal military archive indicate that hela was in service with i scouting group from june to september 1903 but naval historians hans hildebrand albert rohr and hans otto steinmetz have been unable to locate any official records of her commissioning or decommissioning during this period nor of who commanded vessel during this time no logbook exists in archives either according to location reports vessel was to have ended this period in wilhelmshaven but no records follow for transfer to danzig where it is definitively known that ship was reconstructed hildebrand rohr and steinmetz have nevertheless been unable to determine how mistake continued for several months or what ship is actually represented in reports hela remained in shipyard in danzig until 1910 where she underwent a significant reconstruction she was recommissioned on 1 october and conducted a brief set of sea trials from 14 to 18 october ship was thereafter employed as a fleet tender while on maneuvers on night of 29 30 march 1911 torpedo boat inadvertently crossed too closely in front of hela which struck torpedo boat with her bow neither vessel was seriously damaged in collision in april kk theodor pullen became ship s captain serving until october after that year s fleet maneuvers in august and september navy conducted a fleet review for visit of austro hungarian marinekommandant naval commander admiral rudolf montecuccoli hela then carried montecuccoli to visit wilhelmshaven and island of helgoland next two years passed uneventfully she was transferred to kiel on 1 april 1912 in september kk carl wilhelm weniger took command of ship in mid 1913 italian vice admiral prince luigi amedeo duke of visited germany and on 31 may she carried him for a visit to helgoland where fleet was anchored in september kk paul wolfram relieved weniger wolfram was to be vessel s last commander world war i thumb map of helgoland bight following start of world war i in july 1914 hela was brought back to active duty and assigned to iv scouting group unit was tasked with supporting german torpedo boats that formed outer ring of coastal scouting patrols in german bight she was modified slightly between 13 and 16 august having a third 8 8 cm gun installed hela was stationed to northeast of helgoland along with cruiser on 28 august british cruisers and destroyers from harwich force surprised and attacked german patrol line resulting in battle of helgoland bight helas commander received reports of fighting and turned east to reinforce vessels engaged in action while en route ship received a contradictory report that stated that british vessels were retreating leading now fregattenkapitan frigate captain wolfram to reverse course and return to his assigned location as a result she was not engaged in action later that night she regrouped with cruisers and to provide cover for remaining torpedo boats and reestablish bight patrol line two weeks later on morning of 13 september hela was attacked six miles southwest of helgoland by british submarine under command of future admiral max horton hela was conducting a training exercise at time area around helgoland was presumed safe from british submarines after surfacing e9 spotted german cruiser and immediately re submerged to fire two of her torpedoes one of which struck helas stern after 15 minutes e9 rose to periscope depth to inspect scene british submarine found hela sinking within another 15 minutes hela had slipped beneath waves despite speed with which ship sank her entire crew with exception of two sailors were rescued from sea by u boat u 18 and one of coastal patrol vessels hela was first german ship sunk by a british submarine in war as a result of her loss all german ships conducting training exercises were moved to baltic sea to prevent further such sinkings one of her 8 8 cm guns was retrieved from wreck and is now preserved at fort in cuxhaven footnotes notes citations references category avisos of imperial german navy
