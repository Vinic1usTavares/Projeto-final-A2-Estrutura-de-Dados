he wrote a book on shiva one of hindu gods tripathi s agent decided to publish book himself after its release in february 2010 immortals of meluha went on to become a huge commercial success it had to be reprinted a number of times to keep up with demand while first book was being released tripathi started work on second part of trilogy then titled naga secret tripathi wanted to start story from exactly where he ended in first book with sati s fate being revealed he also wanted to expand geography of story allowing characters to travel far east of india and also far south to land of nagas an ancient empire that existed more than five thousand years ago and was filled with eternal wars and legend of a blue throated god who would save world in an interview with mumbai mirror in july 2011 he clarified that it was difficult for him to do research about geographical situations of india in 4000 bc in just one year so he relied on his own knowledge and that of his relatives i was an atheist till eight years ago but i have always been surrounded by relatives with immense faith so scriptures are something i have inadvertently grown up with and learned he added mythological and technical aspects included in story also came from tripathi s habit of reading storybooks on history and ancient technology he was helped by his father who is a scientist tripathi quit his job as a banker while writing book dedicating his whole time to book tripathi revealed in an interview with ibn live that story would continue from where it ended in first book secret of nagas was edited by pandit who also edited first book rashmi pusalkar designed book cover which depicted shiva holding a snake and looking towards banks of city of kashi secret of nagas 2011 acknowledgements p xii photo was shot by

thumb 300px actor vivek oberoi right at release of secret of nagas with author amish tripathi khanna from mint praised tripathi s portrayal of shiva in book complimenting fact that he was able to successfully deliver humane side of his characters and their emotions and motivations he also pointed out that tripathi s experimentation with indian scriptures has been successful in transforming an otherwise mundane genre long overdue in popular literature especially by an indian author however he was disappointed in weak dialogue and grammatical errors scattered throughout book especially inclusion of glaringly out of place world words thus having too many anachronism in book rito paul from daily news and analysis shared khanna s opinion while saying that book is impressive in its conception but it is executed poorly we re thrust into narrative mid action exactly from where first book ended and breathless pace of action hardly ever lets up there are more twists and turns than in a gordian knot and at least two revelations of luke i am your father variety and it really because there is so much scope for flair adventure and wonder in world tripathi has imagined secrets is not a bad book plot holds your attention and story races along but writing veers between pedestrian and ridiculous tripathi is an excellent story teller but he is a poor writer pal of mumbai boss was disappointed in book and theorized a number of reasons for it he felt that solid plot and unambiguous storytelling of immortals of meluha was missing in secret of nagas whose ending failed to live up curiosity pal particularly criticized tripathi s language saying it seems that while writing secret of nagas much of amish s attention was upon language there are obvious and woefully inept attempts at literary flair that make novel a tiresome read book suffers from a rash of exclamation marks and unnecessary italics sentences have been sliced to create weak dangling fragments parashuram charged followed by his vicious horde instead of simply talking people bellow scream whisper and fall silent they are flabbergasted they pirouette in middle of a fight and use words like exponentially gargantuan and plethora in their speech net result is text that is labored trite and awkward kishwar desai from asian age felt that in secret of nagas characterization of shiva lost some of fervor in it from first book and is cast more as a bollywood hero comparable to likes of actor salman khan desai also noticed that there were too many characters in book most of them remaining unexplored likening book with a computer game reviewer concluded that one of remarkable qualities of book is that it is a very visual tale and less like a literary exercise some critics like deb of outlook though favored visual style more and felt that tripathi stayed true to fantasy genre well detailed world with its own geography history and mythology and he adds a quirky charm to his tale with dashes of modern science and second part is arguably toughest to write since it s at centre of arc of plot where trajectory could very easily flatten out writer has to keep momentum of first part going while setting up all pieces for finale scattering around a few clues to reader enough to stay with storyteller for full journey but amish does not disappoint mysterious hints dropped in immortals get explained scale widens by several orders of magnitude and nature of shiva s quest becomes more complex even as its ultimate goal becomes much more fundamental commercial performance secret of nagas was in high demand before its release of 100 000 copies printed for it 80 000 copies had already been pre ordered according to nielsen bookscan after release it quickly became a best selling fiction topping list published by hindustan times it went on to sell 95 000 copies with a second print run of 50 000 more being ordered khanna attributed this success to increasing interest in series he explained that tripathi s portrayal of mythology in a different way had been long been popular with comics writers but few indian writers have used it yet and none with sort of success that tripathi has achieved khanna drew a contrast between retail price of secret of nagas and that of contemporary author chetan bhagat s novel revolution 2020 explaining that while tripathi s book was selling at original price bhagat s novel was sold at a reduced price to attain sales this view was shared by deepanjana paul of first post who believed that if readers like writing they aren t averse to paying more book sold over 175 000 copies making it one of best selling fiction novels of 2010 and also of 2011 immortals of meluha and secret of nagas have crossed a print run of a million copies these books have continued to top bestseller lists of nielsen bookscan with gross retail sales of within two years of publishing as of june 2015 over 2 5 million copies of shiva trilogy have been sold with gross retail sales of over adaptations books have been translated into a number of local languages like english south asia hindi tamil marathi gujarati assamese english uk telugu and malayalam with author believing that publishing as a whole is gradually being embedded in indian business sensibilities further explaining his thoughts tripathi said i genuinely believe those five years from today we will have a situation when other languages will account for higher sales of books than in english that is big change happening in publishing it is taking pride in its own culture than knowing other cultures like in television where regional language channels have more trps other than local versions books have also been released in amazon kindle version available in india and uk references
