keller of aol s tv squad praised michael s maturity in episode saying even when we get an episode that didn t quite hit mark like last night s maturing of michael still makes episode interesting to watch margaret lyons of entertainment weekly was more critical referring to it as forced off pitch and strenuously unfunny she was also critical of michael s interaction with youth group writing that it didn t add any development to his character or to show s broader arcs it just seemed weird and not that humorous despite this she praised cold opening featuring pam lecturing office on proper hygiene hitfix reviewer alan sepinwall called episode spectacularly unfunny and criticized writers for using michael s loneliness as a joke instead of taking it seriously like they had in fourth
