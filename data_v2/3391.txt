tylopilus felleus commonly known as bitter bolete or bitter tylopilus is a fungus of bolete family its distribution includes east asia europe and eastern north america extending south into mexico and central america a mycorrhizal species it grows in deciduous and coniferous woodland often fruiting under beech and oak its fruit bodies have convex to flat caps that are some shade of brown buff or tan and typically measure up to in diameter pore surface is initially white before turning pinkish with age like most boletes it lacks a ring and it may be distinguished from boletus edulis and other similar species by its unusual pink pores and prominent dark brown netlike pattern on its stalk french mycologist pierre bulliard described this species as boletus felleus in 1788 before it was transferred into new genus tylopilus it is type species of tylopilus and only member of genus found in europe tylopilus felleus has been subject of research into bioactive compounds that have been tested for antitumour and antibiotic properties although not poisonous it is generally considered inedible due to its overwhelming bitterness taxonomy species was first described in scientific literature as le bolet boletus felleus by french mycologist pierre bulliard in 1788 as large genus boletus was carved up into smaller genera petter karsten transferred it in 1881 to tylopilus a genus diagnosed by its pink spores and adnate tubes t felleus is type species of tylopilus and only member of genus found in europe synonyms include boletus alutarius described by elias magnus fries in 1815 and later by friedrich wilhelm gottlieb rostkovius in 1844 and paul christoph hennings s subsequent transfer of fries s taxon into tylopilus t alutarius lucien quelet placed taxon in dictyopus in 1886 and then in 1888 but neither of these genera are recognised today former having been merged into boletus and latter into tylopilus genetic analysis published in 2013 shows that t felleus and many but not all other members of tylopilus form a tylopilus clade within a larger group informally called in boletineae other clades in group include porcini and strobilomyces clades as well as three other groups composed of members of various genera including xerocomus xerocomellus and boletus badius and relatives a variety described from great lakes region var uliginosus was recognised by alexander h smith and harry d thiers in 1971 on basis of its microscopic features a distinction supported by professor c b wolfe of pennsylvania state university however index fungorum does not consider this an independent taxon similarly boletus felleus var minor published originally by william chambers coker and a h beers in 1943 later transferred to tylopilus by albert pilat and aurel in 1974 has been folded into synonymy with t felleus charles horton peck described boletus felleus var obesus in 1889 but no record of a type specimen exists although some records exist of t felleus in australia their spores are of consistently smaller dimensions and this taxon has been classified as a separate species t brevisporus tylopilus felleus derives its genus name from greek bump and hat and its specific name from latin fel meaning bile referring to its bitter taste similar to bile mushroom is commonly known as bitter bolete or bitter tylopilus description cap of this species grows up to 15 cm 6 in in diameter though some north american specimens reach 30 cm 12 in across grey yellow to pale or walnut brown it is slightly downy at first and later becomes smooth with a matte lustre it is initially convex before flattening out with maturity cap skin does not peel away from flesh pores underneath are white at first and become pinkish with maturity they are adnate to stalk and bulge downwards as mushroom ages pores bruise carmine or brownish often developing rusty brown spots with age and number about one or two per millimetre tubes are long relative to size of cap measuring deep in middle part of cap stalk is initially bulbous before stretching and thinning in upper part lower part of stalk remains swollen sometimes shrinking at base where it attaches to substrate it measures rarely to tall and wide and can bulge out to across at base it is lighter in colour than cap and covered with a coarse brown network of markings which have been likened to fishnet stockings in appearance described as very appetising in appearance flesh is white or creamy and pink beneath cap cuticle flesh can also develop pinkish tones where it has been cut it has a slight smell which has been described as pleasant as well as faintly unpleasant flesh is softer than that of other boletes and tends to become more spongy as mushroom matures insects rarely infest this species thumb right spores seen with light microscopy alt several partly transparent oval objects in a microscope field colour of spore print is brownish with pink reddish or rosy tints spores are somewhat fuse shaped smooth and measure 11 17 by 3 5 um basidia spore bearing cells are club shaped four spored and measure 18 25 6 by 7 0 10 2 um cystidia on walls of tubes pleurocystidia are fuse shaped with a central swelling thin walled and have granular contents they possess sharp to tapered tips and have overall dimensions of 36 44 by 8 0 11 0 um on pore edges cheilocystidia are similar in shape to pleurocystidia measuring 24 8 44 0 by 7 3 11 0 um hymenium of smith and thiers s variety uliginosus when mounted in melzer s reagent shows reddish globules of pigment measuring 2 8 um that appear in hyphae and throughout hymenium and a large 8 12 um globule in pleurocystidia several chemical tests have been documented that can help confirm identify of this species on cap flesh application of formaldehyde turns tissue pinkish iron salts result in a colour change to greyish green aniline causes a lavender to reddish brown colour and phenol a purplish pink to reddish brown on cap cuticle nitric acid causes an orange salmon colour sulphuric acid creates orange red ammonia usually makes brown and a potassium hydroxide solution usually makes orange similar species italian cook and author antonio carluccio reports this is one of most common fungi brought to him to identify having been mistaken for an edible species young specimens can be confused with many edible boletes though as pores become more pink species becomes easier to identify some guidebooks advocate tasting flesh smallest piece of which will be very bitter dark on light reticulation in stalk is distinctive and is opposite colouration of that on stalk of prized boletus edulis t felleus is found in same habitat as b badius though latter s yellow tubes and blue bruising flesh easily distinguish it b can have a similar coloured cap but its yellow pores and slender stalk aid identification tylopilus found in hardwood forests of eastern north america is similar in appearance to t felleus but has a purplish to purple brown cap it is also inedible due to its bitter taste another north american species t has a cap that is reddish brown to chestnut brown with olive tones in youth it has shorter spores than t felleus typically measuring 9 13 by 3 4 5 mm in field it can be distinguished from latter species by its mild to slightly bitter taste t found in southeastern united states has a lighter coloured cap that is smaller up to in diameter edible t and t can be confused with t felleus but have less reticulated stalks dimensions of spores of australian species t brevisporus range from 9 2 to 10 5 by 3 5 to 3 9 mm t limited in distribution to deciduous forests of china new guinea japan and taiwan can be distinguished from t felleus macroscopically by its vinaceous brown cap and pinkish brown to vinaceous stalk and microscopically by its smaller spores measuring 11 14 by 4 5 mm and longer pleurocystidia 49 107 by 14 24 mm ecology distribution and habitat thumb left in maturity pores often bruise brownish while pore surface bulges downward alt two somewhat dingy looking brownish mushrooms with brown bruising in moss like all tylopilus species t felleus is mycorrhizal it is found in deciduous and coniferous woodland often under beech and oak in well drained acid soils which can be sandy gravelly or peaty if encountered on calcareous chalky soil it will be in moist areas that have become waterlogged and have ample leaf litter fruit bodies grow singly or in small groups and occasionally in small clusters with two or three joined at base of stem fruit bodies have also been growing in cavities of old trees on old conifer stumps or on buried rotten wood fungus obtains most of its nitrogen requirements from amino acids derived from breakdown of proteins although a lesser amount is obtained from amino sugar glucosamine a breakdown product of chitin a major component of fungal cell walls mycorrhizal plant partner benefits from fungus s ability to use these forms of nitrogen which are often abundant in forest floor fruit bodies appear over summer and autumn anytime from june to october or even november in many of northern temperate zones large numbers may appear in some years and none in others generally proportional to amount of rainfall variety uliginosus known from michigan grows among lichens and mosses under pines in north america it is known from eastern canada south to florida and west to minnesota in united states and into mexico and central america its european distribution is widespread it is relatively common in many regions but rare or almost absent in others in asia it has been recorded from vicinity of in district of northern pakistan and as far east as china where it has been recorded from hebei jiangsu fujian guangdong and sichuan provinces and korea strong taste of fruit body may have some role in insects avoiding it small fly species megaselia pygmaeoides feeds on and infests fruit bodies of t felleus in north america though it seems to prefer other boletes in europe fruit bodies can be parasitized by mould sepedonium ampullosporum infection results in necrosis of mushroom tissue and a yellow colour caused by formation of large amounts of pigmented single celled conidia produced by extrusion from conidiophores bacterium has been isolated from of t felleus this is region around its subterranean hyphae where nutrients released from fungus affect activity of microbial population in soil bacterium excretes enzymes that allow it to break down chitin fruit bodies of t felleus have a high capacity to accumulate radioactive caesium 137cs from contaminated soil a characteristic attributed to deep soil penetration achieved by mycelium in contrast species has a limited capacity to accumulate radioactive isotope edibility as its common name suggests it is extremely bitter though not toxic as such this bitterness is worsened by cooking one specimen can foul taste of a whole meal prepared with mushrooms despite this it is sold in local markets in mexico a local recipe from france romania and east germany calls for stewing it in skimmed milk after which it can be eaten or powdered and used for flavouring mushroom is not bitter for those who lack genetic sensitivity to bitter taste a trait endowed by gene taste receptor 2 member 38 compound responsible for bitter taste has not been identified research mycelium of tylopilus felleus can be grown in culture on agar containing growth medium fungus can form fruit bodies if temperature is suitable and light conditions simulate a 12 hour day mushrooms are usually deformed often lacking stalks so that cap grows directly on surface and caps are usually in diameter there are few boletaceae species known to fruit in culture as ectomycorrhizal fungi tend to not fruit when separated from their host plant compounds from t felleus have been extracted and researched for potential medical uses is a beta glucan that was isolated from fruit bodies in 1988 and shown in laboratory tests to have cytotoxic properties and to stimulate non specific immunological response in particular it enhances phagocytosis process by which macrophages and engulf and digest foreign bacteria in experiments on mice with tumour cells it appeared to have antitumour effects when administered in combination with a preparation of cutibacterium acnes in a 1994 polish study researchers in 2004 reported that extracts of fruit body inhibit enzyme pancreatic lipase it was second most inhibitory of 100 mushrooms they tested a compound present in mushroom n g glutamyl has mild
