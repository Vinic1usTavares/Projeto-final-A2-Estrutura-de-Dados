kantian ethics refers to a deontological ethical theory ascribed to german philosopher immanuel kant theory developed as a result of enlightenment rationalism is based on view that only intrinsically good thing is a good will an action can only be good if its principle behind itis duty to moral law central to kant s construction of moral law is categorical imperative which acts on all people regardless of their interests or desires kant formulated categorical imperative in various ways his principle of universalizability requires that for an action to be permissible it must be possible to apply it to all people without a contradiction occurring his formulation of humanity as an end in itself requires that humans are never treated merely as a means to an end but always also as ends in themselves formulation of autonomy concludes that rational agents are bound to moral law by their own will while kant s concept of kingdom of ends requires that people act as if principles of their actions establish a law for a hypothetical kingdom kant also distinguished between perfect and imperfect duties a perfect duty such as duty not to lie always holds true an imperfect duty such as duty to give to charity can be made flexible and applied in particular time and place american philosopher louis pojman has cited pietism political philosopher jean jacques rousseau modern debate between rationalism and empiricism and influence of natural law as influences on development of kant s ethics other philosophers have argued that kant s parents and his teacher martin knutzen influenced his ethics those influenced by kantian ethics include philosopher jurgen habermas political philosopher john rawls and psychoanalyst jacques lacan german philosopher g w f hegel criticised kant for not providing specific enough detail in his moral theory to affect decision making and for denying human nature german philosopher arthur schopenhauer argued that ethics should attempt to describe how people behave and criticised kant for being prescriptive michael stocker has argued that acting out of duty can diminish other moral motivations such as friendship while marcia baron has defended theory by arguing that duty does not diminish other motivations catholic church has criticised kant s ethics as contradictory and regards christian ethics as more compatible with virtue ethics claim that all humans are due dignity and respect as autonomous agents means that medical professionals should be happy for their treatments to be performed upon anyone and that patients must never be treated merely as useful for society kant s approach to sexual ethics emerged from his view that humans should never be used merely as a means to an end leading him to regard sexual activity as degrading and to condemn certain specific sexual practices feminist philosophers have used kantian ethics to condemn practices such as prostitution and pornography because they do not treat women as ends kant also believed that because animals do not possess rationality we cannot have duties to them except indirect duties not to develop immoral dispositions through cruelty towards them kant used example of lying as an application of his ethics because there is a perfect duty to tell truth we must never lie even if it seems that lying would bring about better consequences than telling truth outline thumb portrait of immanuel kant who developed ethical theory although all of kant s work develops his ethical theory it is most clearly defined in groundwork of metaphysic of morals critique of practical reason and metaphysics of morals as part of enlightenment tradition kant based his ethical theory on belief that reason should be used to determine how people ought to act brinton 1967 p 519 he did not attempt to prescribe specific action but instructed that reason should be used to determine how to behave singer 1983 pp 42 good will and duty in his combined works kant constructed basis for an ethical law from concept of duty blackburn 2008 p 240 kant began his ethical theory by arguing that only virtue that can be unqualifiedly good is a good will no other virtue has this status because every other virtue can be used to achieve immoral ends virtue of loyalty is not good if one is loyal to an evil person for example good will is unique in that it is always good and maintains its moral value even when it fails to achieve its moral intentions benn 1998 pp 101 102 kant regarded good will as a single moral principle which freely chooses to use other virtues for moral ends guyer 2011 p 194 for kant a good will is a broader conception than a will which acts from duty a will which acts from duty is distinguishable as a will which overcomes hindrances in order to keep moral law a dutiful will is thus a special case of a good will which becomes visible in adverse conditions kant argues that only acts performed with regard to duty have moral worth this is not to say that acts performed merely in accordance with duty are worthless these still deserve approval and encouragement but that special esteem is given to acts which are performed out of duty wood 1999 p 26 27 kant s conception of duty does not entail that people perform their duties grudgingly although duty often constrains people and prompts them to act against their inclinations it still comes from an agent s volition they desire to keep moral law thus when an agent performs an action from duty it is because rational incentives matter to them more than their opposing inclinations kant wished to move beyond conception morality as externally imposed duties and present an ethics of autonomy when rational agents freely recognise claims reason makes upon them wood 1999 p 37 perfect and imperfect duties applying categorical imperative duties arise because failure to fulfil them would either result in a contradiction in conception or in a contradiction in will former are classified as perfect duties latter as imperfect a perfect duty always holds true there is a perfect duty to tell truth so we must never lie an imperfect duty allows flexibility beneficence is an imperfect duty because we are not obliged to be completely beneficent at all times but may choose times and places in which we are driver 2007 p 92 kant believed that perfect duties are more important than imperfect duties if a conflict between duties arises perfect duty must be followed driver 2007 p 93 categorical imperative main article categorical imperative primary formulation of kant s ethics is categorical imperative hill 2009 p 3 from which he derived four further formulations wood 2008 p 67 kant made a distinction between categorical and hypothetical imperatives a hypothetical imperative is one we must obey if we want to satisfy our desires go to doctor is a hypothetical imperative because we are only obliged to obey it if we want to get well a categorical imperative binds us regardless of our desires everyone has a duty to not lie regardless of circumstances and even if it is in our interest to do so these imperatives are morally binding because they are based on reason rather than contingent facts about an agent driver 2007 p 83 unlike hypothetical imperatives which bind us insofar as we are part of a group or society which we owe duties to we cannot opt out of categorical imperative because we cannot opt out of being rational agents we owe a duty to rationality by virtue of being rational agents therefore rational moral principles apply to all rational agents at all times universalizability kant s first formulation of categorical imperative is that of universalizability driver 2007 p 87 when someone acts it is according to a rule or maxim for kant an act is only permissible if one is willing for maxim that allows action to be a universal law by which everyone acts maxims fail this test if they produce either a contradiction in conception or a contradiction in will when universalized a contradiction in conception happens when if a maxim were to be universalized it ceases to make sense because maxim would necessarily destroy itself as soon as it was made a universal law kant fundamental principles of metaphysic of morals trans abbott 1879 55 for example if maxim it is permissible to break promises was universalized no one would trust any promises made so idea of a promise would become meaningless maxim would be self contradictory because when universalized promises cease to be meaningful maxim is not moral because it is logically impossible to we could not conceive of a world where this maxim was universalized driver 2007 p 88 a maxim can also be immoral if it creates a contradiction in will when universalized this does not mean a logical contradiction but that maxim leads to a state of affairs that no rational being would desire for example driver argues that maxim i will not give to charity produces a contradiction in will when universalized because a world where no one gives to charity would be undesirable for person who acts by that maxim driver 2007 pp 89 90 kant believed that morality is objective law of reason just as objective physical laws necessitate physical actions apples fall down because of gravity for example objective rational laws necessitate rational actions he thus believed that a perfectly rational being must also be perfectly moral because a perfectly rational being subjectively finds it necessary to do what is rationally necessary because humans are not perfectly rational they partly act by instinct kant believed that humans must conform their subjective will with objective rational laws which he called conformity obligation kant argued that objective law of reason is a priori existing externally from rational being just as physical laws exist prior to physical beings rational laws morality exist prior to rational beings therefore according to kant rational morality is universal and cannot change depending on circumstance humanity as an end in itself kant s second formulation of categorical imperative is to treat humanity as an end in itself kant argued that rational beings can never be treated merely as means to ends they must always also be treated as ends themselves requiring that their own reasoned motives must be equally respected this derives from kant s claim that reason motivates morality it demands that we respect reason as a motive in all beings including other people a rational being cannot rationally consent to being used merely as a means to an end so they must always be treated as an end benn 1998 p 95 kant justified this by arguing that moral obligation is a rational necessity that which is rationally willed is morally right because all rational agents rationally will themselves to be an end and never merely a means it is morally obligatory that they are treated as such this does not mean that we can never treat a human as a means to an end but that when we do we also treat him as an end in himself formula of autonomy kant s formula of autonomy expresses idea that an agent is obliged to follow categorical imperative because of their rational will rather than any outside influence kant believed that any moral law motivated by desire to fulfill some other interest would deny categorical imperative leading him to argue that moral law must only arise from a rational will kant paton 1991 p 34 this principle requires people to recognize right of others to act autonomously and means that as moral laws must be universalisable what is required of one person is required of all kant 1788 book 1 ch 1 1785 section 1 1989 p 165 kingdom of ends another formulation of kant s categorical imperative is kingdom of ends this formulation requires that actions be considered as if their maxim is to provide a law for a hypothetical kingdom of ends accordingly people have an obligation to act upon principles that a community of rational agents would accept as laws in such a community each individual would only accept maxims that can govern every member of community without treating any member merely as a means to an end atwell 1986 p 152 although kingdom of ends is an ideal actions of other people and events of nature ensure that actions with good intentions sometimes result in harm we are still required to act categorically as legislators of this ideal kingdom 1996 p 24 influences on kantian ethics louis pojman has suggested four strong influences on kant s ethics first is lutheran sect pietism to which kant s parents subscribed pietism emphasised honesty and moral living over doctrinal belief more concerned with feeling than rationality kant believed that rationality is required but that it should be concerned with morality and good will second is political philosopher jean jacques rousseau whose work social contract influenced kant s view on fundamental worth of human beings pojman also cites contemporary ethical debates as influential to development of kant s ethics kant favoured rationalism over empiricism which meant he viewed morality as a form of knowledge rather than something based on human desire natural law belief that moral law is determined by nature and belief that humans have intuitive awareness of objective moral truths were according to pojman also influential for kant pojman 2008 p 122 biographer of kant manfred kuhn suggested that values kant s parents held of hard work honesty cleanliness and independence set him an example and influenced him more than their pietism did in stanford encyclopedia of philosophy michael suggests that kant was influenced by his teacher martin knutzen himself influenced by work of christian wolff and john locke and who introduced kant to work of english physicist isaac newton significance of kantian ethics influenced by kantian ethics jurgen habermas thumb photograph of jurgen habermas whose theory of discourse ethics was influenced by kantian ethics german philosopher jurgen habermas has proposed a theory of discourse ethics that he claims is a descendant of kantian ethics payrow shabani 2003 p 53 he proposes that action should be based on communication between those involved in which their interests and intentions are discussed so they can be understood by all rejecting any form of coercion or manipulation habermas believes that agreement between parties is crucial for a moral decision to be reached collin 2007 p 78 like kantian ethics discourse ethics is a cognitive ethical theory in that it supposes that truth and falsity can be attributed to ethical propositions it also formulates a rule by which ethical actions can be determined and proposes that ethical actions should be universalisable in a similar way to kant s ethics payrow shabani 2003 p 54 habermas argues that his ethical theory is an improvement on kant s ethics he rejects dualistic framework of kant s ethics kant distinguished between phenomena world which can be sensed and experienced by humans and or spiritual world which is inaccessible to humans this dichotomy was necessary for kant because it could explain autonomy of a human agent although a human is bound in phenomenal world their actions are free in intelligible world for habermas morality arises from discourse which is made necessary by their rationality and needs rather than their freedom payrow shabani 2003 pp 55 6 john rawls social contract theory of political philosopher john rawls developed in his work a theory of justice was influenced by kant s ethics rawls argued that a just society would be fair to achieve this fairness he proposed a hypothetical moment prior to existence of a society at which society is ordered this is original position this should take place from behind a veil of ignorance where no one knows what their own position in society will be preventing people from being biased by their own interests and ensuring a fair result rawls theory of justice rests on belief that individuals are free equal and moral he regarded all human beings as possessing some degree of reasonableness and rationality which he saw as constituents of morality and entitling their possessors to equal justice rawls dismissed much of kant s dualism arguing that structure of kantian ethics once reformulated is clearer without it he described this as one of goals of a theory of justice brooks 2005 pp 155 156 jacques lacan french psychoanalyst jacques lacan linked psychoanalysis with kantian ethics in his works ethics of psychoanalysis and kant avec sade and compared kant with marquis de sade martyn 2003 p 171 lacan argued that sade s maxim of jouissance pursuit of sexual pleasure or enjoyment is morally acceptable by kant s criteria because it can be universalised he proposed that while kant presented human freedom as critical to moral law sade further argued that human freedom is only fully realised through maxim of jouissance scott lee 1991 p 167 contemporary kantian ethicists onora o neill philosopher onora o neill who studied under john rawls at oxford university is a contemporary kantian ethicist who supports a kantian approach to issues of social justice o neill argues that a successful kantian account of social justice must not rely on any unwarranted or assumption she notes that philosophers have previously charged kant with idealising humans as autonomous beings without any social context or life goals though maintains that kant s ethics can be read without such an idealisation o neill 2000 p 75 o neill prefers kant s conception of reason as practical and available to be used by humans rather than as principles attached to every human being conceiving of reason as a tool to make decisions with means that only thing able to restrain principles we adopt is that they could be adopted by all if we cannot will that everyone adopts a certain principle then we cannot give them reasons to adopt it to use reason and to reason with other people we must reject those principles that cannot be universally adopted in this way o neill reached kant s formulation of universalisability without adopting an idealistic view of human autonomy o neill 2000 pp 76 77 this model of universalisability does not require that we adopt all universalisable principles but merely prohibits us from adopting those that are not o neill 2000 p 77 from this model of kantian ethics o neill begins to develop a theory of justice she argues that rejection of certain principles such as deception and coercion provides a starting point for basic conceptions of justice which she argues are more determinate for human beings that more abstract principles of equality or liberty nevertheless she concedes that these principles may seem to be excessively demanding there are many actions and institutions that do rely on non universalisable principles such as injury o neill 2000 pp 78 79 marcia baron in his paper schizophrenia of modern ethical theories philosopher michael stocker challenges kantian ethics and all modern ethical theories by arguing that actions from duty lack certain moral value he gives example of smith who visits his friend in hospital out of duty rather than because of friendship he argues that this visit seems morally lacking because it is motivated by wrong thing stocker 1976 p 462 marcia baron has attempted to defend kantian ethics on this point after presenting a number of reasons that we might find acting out of duty objectionable she argues that these problems only arise when people misconstrue what their duty is acting out of duty is not intrinsically wrong but immoral consequences can occur when people misunderstand what they are duty bound to do duty need not be seen as cold and impersonal one may have a duty to cultivate their character or improve their personal relationships baron 1999 pp 120 123 baron further argues that duty should be construed as a secondary motive that is a motive that regulates and sets conditions on what may be done rather prompts specific actions she argues that seen this way duty neither reveals a deficiency in one s natural inclinations to act nor undermines motives and feelings that are essential to friendship for baron being governed by duty does not mean that duty is always primary motivation to act rather it entails that considerations of duty are always action guiding a responsible moral agent should take an interest in moral questions such as questions of character these should guide moral agents to act from duty baron 1999 pp 131 132 critics of kantian ethics g w f hegel thumb portrait of g w f hegel german philosopher g w f hegel presented two main criticisms of kantian ethics he first argued that kantian ethics provides no specific information about what people should do because kant s moral law is solely a principle of non contradiction he argued that kant s ethics lack any content and so cannot constitute a supreme principle of morality to illustrate this point hegel and his followers have presented a number of cases in which formula of universal law either provides no meaningful answer or gives an obviously wrong answer hegel used kant s example of being trusted with another man s money to argue that kant s formula of universal law cannot determine whether a social system of property is a morally good thing because either answer can entail contradictions he also used example of helping poor if everyone helped poor there would be no poor left to help so beneficence would be impossible if universalised making it immoral according to kant s model brooks 2012 p 75 hegel s second criticism was that kant s ethics forces humans into an internal conflict between reason and desire for hegel it is unnatural for humans to suppress their desire and subordinate it to reason this means that by not addressing tension between self interest and morality kant s ethics cannot give humans any reason to be moral singer 1983 pp 44 45 arthur schopenhauer german philosopher arthur schopenhauer criticised kant s belief that ethics should concern what ought to be done insisting that scope of ethics should be to attempt to explain and interpret what actually happens whereas kant presented an idealised version of what ought to be done in a perfect world schopenhauer argued that ethics should instead be practical and arrive at conclusions that could work in real world capable of being presented as a solution to world s problems 2003 pp 101 102 schopenhauer drew a parallel with aesthetics arguing that in both cases prescriptive rules are not most important part of discipline because he believed that virtue cannot be taught a person is either virtuous or is not he cast proper place of morality as restraining and guiding people s behaviour rather than presenting unattainable universal laws janaway 2002 p 88 friedrich nietzsche philosopher friedrich nietzsche criticised all contemporary moral systems with a special focus on christian and kantian ethics he argued that all modern ethical systems share two problematic characteristics first they make a metaphysical claim about nature of humanity which must be accepted for system to have any normative force and second system benefits interests of certain people often over those of others although nietzsche s primary objection is not that metaphysical claims about humanity are untenable he also objected to ethical theories that do not make such claims his two main targets kantianism and christianity do make metaphysical claims which therefore feature prominently in nietzsche s criticism nietzsche rejected fundamental components of kant s ethics particularly his argument that morality god and immorality can be shown through reason nietzsche cast suspicion on use of moral intuition which kant used as foundation of his morality arguing that it has no normative force in ethics he further attempted to undermine key concepts in kant s moral psychology such as will and pure reason like kant nietzsche developed a concept of autonomy however he rejected kant s idea that valuing our own autonomy requires us to respect autonomy of others janaway robertson 2012 pp 202 204 a naturalist reading of nietzsche s moral psychology stands contrary to kant s conception of reason and desire under kantian model reason is a fundamentally different motive to desire because it has capacity to stand back from a situation and make an independent decision nietzsche conceives of self as a social structure of all our different drives and motivations thus when it seems that our intellect has made a decision against our drives it is actually just an alternative drive taking dominance over another this is in direct contrast with kant s view of intellect as opposed to instinct instead it is just another instinct there is thus no self capable of standing back and making a decision decision self makes is simply determined by strongest drive janaway robertson 2012 p 205 kantian commentators have argued that nietzsche s practical philosophy requires existence of a self capable of standing back in kantian sense for an individual to create values of their own which is a key idea in nietzsche s philosophy they must be able to conceive of themselves as a unified agent even if agent is influenced by their drives he must regard them as his own which undermines nietzsche s conception of autonomy janaway robertson 2012 p 206 john stuart mill utilitarian philosopher john stuart mill criticised kant for not realising that moral laws are justified by a moral intuition based on utilitarian principles that greatest good for greatest number ought to be sought mill argued that kant s ethics could not explain why certain actions are wrong without appealing to utilitarianism ellis 1998 p 76 as basis for morality mill believed that his principle of utility has a stronger intuitive grounding than kant s reliance on reason and can better explain why certain actions are right or wrong miller 2013 p 110 virtue ethics virtue ethics is a form of ethical theory which emphasises character of an agent rather than specific acts many of its proponents have criticised kant s deontological approach to ethics elizabeth anscombe criticised modern ethical theories including kantian ethics for their obsession with law and obligation as well as arguing that theories which rely on a universal moral law are too rigid anscombe suggested that because a moral law implies a moral lawgiver they are irrelevant in modern secular society in his work after virtue alasdair macintyre criticises kant s formulation of universalisability arguing that various trivial and immoral maxims can pass test such as keep all your promises throughout your entire life except one he further challenges kant s formulation of humanity as an ends in itself by arguing that kant provided no reason to treat others as means maxim let everyone except me be treated as a means though seemingly immoral can be universalised macintyre 2013 pp 54 55 bernard williams argues that by abstracting persons from character kant misrepresents persons and morality and philippa foot identified kant as one of a select group of philosophers responsible for neglect of virtue by analytic philosophy louden 2011 p 4 roman catholic priest servais pinckaers regarded christian ethics as closer to virtue ethics of aristotle than kant s ethics he presented virtue ethics as freedom for excellence which regards freedom as acting in accordance with nature to develop one s virtues initially this requires following rules but intention is that agent develop and regard acting morally as a joy this is in contrast with freedom of indifference which pinckaers attributes to william ockham and likens to kant on this view freedom is set against nature free actions are those not determined by passions or emotions there is no development or progress in an agent s virtue merely forming of habit this is closer to kant s view of ethics because kant s conception of autonomy requires that an agent is not merely guided by their emotions and is set in contrast with s conception of christian ethics pinckaers 2003 pp 67 75 catholic church catholic church has criticised kantian ethics for its apparent contradiction arguing that humans being co legislators of morality contradicts claim that morality is a priori catholic philosophers including elizabeth anscombe anscombe 1958 p 2 jean elshtain elshtain 2008 note 22 and servais 2003 p 48 have made similar criticisms they argue that if something is universally a priori i e existing prior to experience then it cannot also be in part dependent upon humans who have not always existed this objection seems to rest on a misunderstanding of kant s views since kant argued that morality is dependent upon concept of a rational will and related concept of a categorical imperative which is one which any rational being must necessarily will for itself immanuel kant 1786 p 35 it is not based on contingent features of any being s will nor upon human wills in particular so there is no sense in which kant makes ethics dependent upon anything which has not always existed furthermore sense in which our wills are subject to law is precisely that if we our wills are rational we must will in a fashion that is we must will according to moral judgments we apply all rational beings including ourselves o neill 2000 43 ironically in another passage willing according to reason is precisely kind of capacity elshtain ascribes to god as basis of his moral authority and she commends this over an alternative version of divine command theory elshtain 2008 260 note 75 kant s theory is a version of first rather than second view of autonomy but attributes capacity to will according to reason and hence morally to all rational agents rather than uniquely to god and hence neither god nor any human authority including contingent human institutions play any unique authoritative role in his moral theory applications medical ethics kant believed that shared ability of humans to reason should be basis of morality and that it is ability to reason that makes humans morally significant he therefore believed that all humans should have right to common dignity and respect eaton 2004 p 39 margaret eaton argues that according to kant s ethics a medical professional must be happy for their own practices to be used by and on anyone even if they were patient themselves for example a researcher who wished to perform tests on patients without their knowledge must be happy for all researchers to do so eaton 2004 p 40 she also argues that kant s requirement of autonomy would mean that a patient must be able to make a fully informed decision about treatment making it immoral to perform tests on unknowing patients medical research should be motivated out of respect for patient so they must be informed of all facts even if this would be likely to dissuade patient eaton 2004 pp 40 1 jeremy sugarman has argued that kant s formulation of autonomy requires that patients are never used merely for benefit of society but are always treated as rational people with their own goals sugarman 2010 p 44 aaron hinkley notes that a kantian account of autonomy requires respect for choices that are arrived at rationally not for choices which are arrived at by idiosyncratic or non rational means he argues that there may be some difference between what a purely rational agent would choose and what a patient actually chooses difference being result of non rational idiosyncrasies although a kantian physician ought not to lie to or coerce a patient hinkley suggests that some form of paternalism such as through withholding information which may prompt a non rational response could be acceptable engelhardt 2011 pp 12 13 in her work how kantian ethics should treat pregnancy and abortion susan feldman argues that abortion should be defended according to kantian ethics she proposed that a woman should be treated as a dignified autonomous person with control over their body as kant suggested she believes that free choice of women would be paramount in kantian ethics requiring abortion to be mother s decision kneller 1998 pp 265 266 dean harris has noted that if kantian ethics is to be used in discussion of abortion it must be decided whether a fetus is an autonomous person harris 2011 p 15 kantian ethicist carl cohen argues that potential to be rational or participation in a generally rational species is relevant distinction between humans and inanimate objects or irrational animals cohen believes that even when humans are not rational because of age such as babies or fetuses or mental disability agents are still morally obligated to treat them as an ends in themselves equivalent to a rational adult such as a mother seeking an abortion carl cohen 1986 p 865 69 sexual ethics kant viewed humans as being subject to animalistic desires of self preservation species preservation and preservation of enjoyment he argued that humans have a duty to avoid maxims that harm or degrade themselves including suicide sexual degradation and drunkenness denis 1999 p 225 this led kant to regard sexual intercourse as degrading because it reduces humans to an object of pleasure he admitted sex only within marriage which he regarded as a merely animal union he believed that masturbation is worse than suicide reducing a person s status to below that of an animal he argued that rape should be punished with castration and that bestiality requires expulsion from society wood 1999 p 2 feminist philosopher catharine mackinnon has argued that many contemporary practices would be deemed immoral by kant s standards because they dehumanise women sexual harassment prostitution and pornography she argues objectify women and do not meet kant s standard of human autonomy commercial sex has been criticised for turning both parties into objects and thus using them as a means to an end mutual consent is problematic because in consenting people choose to objectify themselves alan soble has noted that more liberal kantian ethicists believe that depending on other contextual factors consent of women can vindicate their participation in pornography and prostitution soble 2006 549 animal ethics because kant viewed rationality as basis for being a moral patient one due moral consideration he believed that animals have no moral rights animals according to kant are not rational thus one cannot behave immorally towards them driver 2007 p 97 although he did not believe we have any duties towards animals kant did believe being cruel to them was wrong because our behaviour might influence our attitudes toward human beings if we become accustomed to harming animals then we are more likely to see harming humans as acceptable driver 2007 p 98 ethicist tom regan rejects kant s assessment of moral worth of animals on three main points first he rejects kant s claim that animals are not self conscious he then challenges kant s claim that animals have no intrinsic moral worth because they cannot make moral judgement regan argues that if a being s moral worth is determined by its ability to make a moral judgement then we must regard humans who are incapable of moral thought as being equally undue moral consideration regan finally argues that kant s assertion that animals exist merely as a means to an ends is unsupported fact that animals have a life that can go well or badly suggests that like humans they have their own ends regan 2004 p 178 lying kant believed that categorical imperative provides us with maxim that we ought not to lie in any circumstances even if we are trying to bring about good consequences such as lying to a murderer to prevent them from finding their intended victim kant argued that because we cannot fully know what consequences of any action will be result might be unexpectedly harmful therefore we ought to act to avoid known wrong lying rather than to avoid a potential wrong if there are harmful consequences we are blameless because we acted according to our duty rachels 1999 p 128 driver argues that this might not be a problem if we choose to formulate our maxims differently maxim i will lie to save an innocent life can be universalised however this new maxim may still treat murderer as a means to an end which we have a duty to avoid doing thus we may still be required to tell truth to murderer in kant s example driver 2007 p 96 references bibliography external links category ethical theories category kantianism category
