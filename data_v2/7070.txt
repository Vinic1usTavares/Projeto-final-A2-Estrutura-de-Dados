hungarian occupation of yugoslav territories consisted of military occupation then annexation of backa baranja medimurje and prekmurje regions of kingdom of yugoslavia by kingdom of hungary during world war ii these territories had all been under hungarian rule prior to 1920 and had been transferred to yugoslavia as part of post world war i treaty of trianon they now form part of several states yugoslav backa is now part of vojvodina an autonomous province of serbia yugoslav baranja and medimurje are part of modern day croatia and yugoslav prekmurje is part of modern day slovenia occupation began on 11 april 1941 when 80 000 hungarian troops crossed yugoslav border in support of german led axis invasion of yugoslavia that had commenced five days earlier there was some resistance to hungarian forces from serb chetnik irregulars but defences of royal yugoslav army had collapsed by this time hungarian forces were indirectly aided by local volksdeutsche german minority which had formed a militia and disarmed around 90 000 yugoslav troops despite only sporadic resistance hungarian troops killed many civilians during these initial operations including some volksdeutsche government of newly formed axis puppet state independent state of croatia subsequently consented to hungarian annexation of medimurje area which dismayed croat population of region occupation authorities immediately classified population of backa and baranja into those that had lived in those regions when they had last been under hungarian rule in 1920 and mostly serb settlers who had arrived since areas had been part of yugoslavia they then began herding thousands of local serbs into concentration camps and expelled them to independent state of croatia italian occupied montenegro and german occupied territory of serbia ultimately tens of thousands of serbs were deported from occupied territories this was followed by implementation of a policy of magyarisation of political social and economic life of occupied territories which included re settlement of hungarians and szekelys from other parts of hungary magyarisation did not impact volksdeutsche who received special status under hungarian rule and in prekmurje hungarian authorities were more permissive towards ethnic slovenes small scale armed resistance to hungarian occupation commenced in latter half of 1941 and was answered with harsh measures including summary executions expulsions and internment insurgency was mainly concentrated in ethnic serb area of southern backa in region where hungarian forces avenged their losses in august 1941 a civilian administration took over government of recovered southern territories and they were formally annexed to hungary in december in january 1942 hungarian military conducted raids during which they killed over 3 300 people mostly serbs and jews in march 1944 when hungary realised that it was on losing side in war and began to negotiate with allies germany took control of country including annexed territories during operation margarethe i this was followed by collection and transport of remaining jews in occupied territories to extermination camps resulting in deaths of 85 per cent of jews in occupied territories prior to their withdrawal from balkans in face of advance of soviet red army germans evacuated 60 000 70 000 volksdeutsche from backa and baranja to austria backa and baranja were restored to yugoslav control when germans were pushed out of region by red army in late 1944 medimurje and prekmurje remained occupied until last

among other things treaty defined border between hungary and newly created kingdom of serbs croats and slovenes kscs renamed kingdom of yugoslavia in 1929 it divided previously hungarian ruled regions of banat backa and baranja between hungary kscs and romania and transferred medimurje region and about two thirds of prekmurje region from hungary to kscs sizable numbers of hungarians and volksdeutsche remained in areas incorporated into kscs between 1918 and 1924 44 903 hungarians including 8 511 government employees were deported to hungary from territories transferred to yugoslavia and approximately 10 000 yugoslav military settlers lit salonika volunteers mainly serbs were settled in backa and baranja by yugoslav government during interwar period hungary agitated for a revision of borders agreed in treaty of trianon and relations between two countries were difficult on 22 august 1938 czechoslovakia romania and yugoslavia agreed to a revision of trianon that allowed hungary to re arm itself demographics prior to occupation most recent yugoslav census had been taken in 1931 this census used language as primary criterion and counted all speakers of serbo croatian as one group rather than recognising distinct serb croat bosnian muslim macedonian and montenegrin nationalities aligning data on religious affiliation with linguistic data has been used by scholars to determine approximate numbers of serbs and croats in 1931 census by counting those of roman catholic denomination as croats according to 1931 census territories of backa and baranja had a combined population of 837 742 this included between 275 014 and 283 114 hungarians and between 185 458 and 194 908 volksdeutsche hungarians therefore made up around one third of population of these territories with volksdeutsche comprising slightly less than one quarter according to historian dr krisztian 1931 census showed that population of backa and baranja included 150 301 serbs and 3 099 croats this corresponds to a serb population of about 18 per cent these figures vary considerably from combined serb and croat population of 305 917 provided by professor jozo tomasevich corresponding to 36 5 per cent of population 1931 census figures for medimurje and prekmurje show a total population of 193 640 of which 101 467 52 2 per cent were croats 75 064 38 7 per cent were slovenes and 15

vienna awards and hungarian invasion of carpatho ukraine hungary enlarged its territory it absorbed parts of southern czechoslovakia carpathian ruthenia and northern part of transylvania which kingdom of romania ceded one of ethno cultural areas that changed hands between romania and hungary at this time was szekely land support that hungary received from germany for these border revisions meant that relationship between two countries became even closer on 20 november 1940 hungary formally joined axis tripartite pact on 12 december 1940 at initiative of prime minister count pal teleki hungary concluded a friendship and non aggression treaty with yugoslavia although concept had received support from both germany and italy actual signing of treaty did not as germany s planned invasion of greece would be simplified if yugoslavia could be neutralised after yugoslav military coup of 27 march 1941 when germans asked hungarian regent miklos horthy for clearance to launch one of their armoured thrusts using hungarian territory teleki was unable to dissuade regent concluding that hungary had disgraced itself irrevocably by siding with germans against yugoslavs teleki shot himself horthy informed hitler that evening that hungary would abide by friendship treaty with yugoslavia though it would likely cease to apply should croatia secede and yugoslavia cease to exist invasion on 10 april 1941 independent state of croatia ndh was established in zagreb by ustase that day horthy and new prime minister of hungary laszlo bardossy issued a joint declaration that yugoslavia had ceased to exist releasing hungary from its obligations under non aggression pact and treaty of trianon according to declaration hungarian troops would act to protect hungarians who live in south parts from anarchy of april war which had begun there several days earlier when italian and german troops invaded following day hungarian 3rd army began occupying those regions of yugoslavia using mobile iv and v corps with i and vii corps in reserve that day 11 april headquarters of 3rd army informed that of german 2nd army that hungarian forces had crossed frontier north of osijek and near subotica german army s rapid manoeuvres during invasion had forced tactical withdrawal of yugoslav forces facing hungarian army units and there was no significant fighting between two armies hungarian forces advanced south to danube between vukovar and confluence with tisza without any real military resistance serb chetnik irregulars fought isolated engagements and hungarian general staff considered irregular resistance forces to be their only significant opposition on 12 april hungarian 1st parachute battalion captured canal bridges at vrbas and srbobran meanwhile sombor was captured against determined chetnik resistance and subotica was also captured this first airborne operation in hungarian history was not without incident battalion s aircraft consisted of five italian made savoia marchetti sm 75 transport aircraft formerly with civilian airline but pressed into service with royal hungarian air force at start of european war shortly after takeoff from airport at veszprem on afternoon of 12 april command plane code e 101 crashed with loss of 20 or 23 lives including 19 paratroopers this was heaviest single loss suffered by hungarians during yugoslav campaign on 13 april 1st and 2nd motorized brigades occupied novi sad then pushed south across danube into northern part of croatian syrmia capturing vinkovci and vukovar on 18 april these brigades then drove southeast to capture western serbian town of valjevo a day later other hungarian forces occupied yugoslavian regions of prekmurje and medimurje a later american assessment concluded that german forces had to take brunt of fighting observing that hungarian forces had displayed great reluctance to attack until enemy had been soundly beaten and thoroughly disorganized by germans when a yugoslav delegation signed an armistice with german and italian representatives at belgrade on 17 april hungarians were represented by a liaison officer but he did not sign document because hungary was not at war with yugoslavia armistice came into effect at noon next day news of success of hungarian armed forces in yugoslavia was welcomed in hungarian parliament german forces occupied a narrow slice of northeastern prekmurje along german yugoslav border which included four volksdeutsche villages in mid june 1941 this area was absorbed into reichsgau steiermark hungarian troops suffered 126 dead and 241 wounded during sporadic fighting and killed between 1 122 and 3 500 civilians including some volksdeutsche many civilians were arrested and tortured on 14 april 1941 around 500 jews and serbs were bayoneted to death probably as a warning to others not to resist during post war questioning horthy insisted that he had not wished to invade yugoslavia but that he had been compelled to act by disorder and massacre of hungarians in backa but these claims have been dismissed by tomasevich geography thumb right 300px map showing division of areas of yugoslavia occupied then annexed by hungary

consisting of in backa in baranja and in medimurje and prekmurje regions administration at first occupied territories were placed under military administration international legal scholar professor raphael lemkin who coined word genocide as meaning destruction of a nation or of an ethnic group described policies implemented by hungarian authorities in occupied territories as genocidal lemkin asserted that genocidal policies were those that were aimed at destroying political social cultural religious and economic existence and language of those living in occupied territories in first two weeks of hungarian rule 10 000 serbs were expelled to german occupied territory of serbia ndh or italian ruled montenegro on 1 may 1941 germans estimated that population of territories occupied by hungary was 1 145 000 on 9 july 1941 military governor of town of cakovec in medimurje colonel zsigmond timar issued a declaration that following day medimurje was to be placed permanently under military administration and hungarian rule according to professor sabrina ramet government of ndh consented to hungarian annexation of medimurje area on 10 july but according to davor kovacic and marica of croatian institute of history hungarian declaration was made without consulting with ndh government and was never recognised by it croat population of region were unhappy with decision and military rule remained in place until 16 august 1941 after which civil administration was introduced on 12 july yugoslav dinar ceased to be legal tender in occupied territories and was replaced by hungarian pengo a census of occupied yugoslav territories was conducted by hungarian authorities in 1941 which counted a total population of 1 030 027 in this census ethnic proportions in these territories combined were 37 per cent hungarian 19 per cent volksdeutsche 18 per cent croats and 16 per cent serbs and population of prekmurje was 102 867 on 14 december these regions referred to by hungary as recovered southern territories were formally incorporated into hungary and were given full representation in hungarian parliament although representatives were to be nominated by parliament rather than elected although plans to deport 150 000 serbs including colonists from interwar period but also native inhabitants to german occupied territory of serbia were opposed by german command in belgrade hungarian occupational regime managed to expel between 25 000 and 60 000 of them mostly to serbia during war hungarian government resettled some of its pre war population in backa and baranja primarily szekelys from areas of transylvania ceded to hungary by romania in 1940 between 15 000 and 18 000 were reportedly resettled in backa and baranja hungarian authorities established concentration camps for serbs from which they were eventually expelled to german occupied territory of serbia as part of systematic magyarisation of these territories hungarian political parties and patriotic organisations were encouraged to be active in backa and baranja which resulted in discrimination against less desirable elements of population such as serbs croats and jews discrimination extended to education and communication where hungarian and german were only languages permitted in almost all secondary schools and books newspapers and periodicals in serbo croat language were virtually banned well educated serbs and croats were precluded from undertaking work commensurate with their education despite this serbs and croats that had lived in territories prior to 1918 retained their citizenship rights as hungarians and some lower level non hungarian public employees were retained in their jobs one former serb senator and one former croat parliamentary deputy sat in hungarian parliament in prekmurje hungarian authorities were more permissive making no attempt to deport slovenes in large numbers and allowing slovene language to be used in public likewise hungarians favour with minority in order to persuade them that they were neither serbs nor croats nor even slavs at all they were hungarians of mother tongue volksdeutsche of occupied territories were an important part of economies of occupied territories and by 1941 they were entirely in thrall of nazi party relations between occupation authorities and volksdeutsche were strained by killing of ethnic germans during invasion to extent that adolf hitler became aware of issue volksdeutsche were not active in hungarian military or civil administration but were represented in hungarian parliament and from 1942 were permitted to conscript their members into wehrmacht official organisation of volksdeutsche in hungary der deutschen in ungarn national league of germans in hungary was essentially autonomous during war including within occupied territories districts backa and baranja had both been part of danube banovina of yugoslavia before war medimurje had been part of banovina of croatia and prekmurje had been part of drava banovina hungarian authorities referred to occupied territories by following names for backa baranya for baranja for medimurje and for prekmurje following occupation hungarian authorities divided occupied territories between counties that corresponded with administrative divisions that had existed when area had formed part of kingdom of hungary prior to 1920 these were bacs bodrog baranya vas and zala counties officials in these territories were appointed rather than elected counties were further divided into districts and authorities reverted many districts cities and towns to names used prior to 1920 and in some cases to names which had no historical precedent some examples of name changes in each county are shown

around 15 405 in backa and baranja about 425 in medimurje and approximately 850 in prekmurje hungarian government had passed anti semitic laws in 1939 and these were applied to occupied and annexed territories initially laws were applied selectively due to transfer of territories from military to civilian administration some jews that had settled in occupied territories were sent to german occupied territory of serbia where they were placed in banjica concentration camp in belgrade and subsequently killed others were expelled to ndh where they met same fate but it is unknown how many deported jews died in this way after violence of initial occupation no further massacres of jews occurred during remainder of 1941 jews of occupied territories were subjected to forced labour by hungarian authorities with about 4 000 backa and baranja jews being sent to hard labour camps within hungary 1 500 backa jews being among 10 000 hungarian jews sent to perform labour tasks for hungarian army on eastern front in september 1942 and about 600 backa jews sent to work in bor copper mine in german occupied territory of serbia in july 1943 only 2 per cent of those sent to eastern front survived war resistance and repression in backa and baranja volksdeutsche and hungarian authorities killed significant numbers of serbs after small scale armed resistance broke out in hungarian occupied backa and baranja in second half of 1941 hungarian military reacted with heavy repressive measures in september 1941 alone hungarian occupation forces summarily executed 313 people measures included establishment of temporary concentration camps at ada backa topola odzaci becej and subotica as well as at novi sad and baja according to professor paul some 2 000 jews and a large number of serbs were detained in these camps for periods from two weeks to two months with jews that had not been interned being employed as forced labourers several thousand people remained in camps until end of war some of jews that had migrated to backa and baranja during inter war period were expelled to ndh or german occupied territory of serbia where they were killed communist led partisan resistance movement of josip broz tito was never strong in backa and baranja because flat terrain of region did not lend itself to guerilla warfare and because south slavs from which partisans drew their recruits only made up one third of regional population some partisan units raised in occupied territories were sent to ndh to reinforce partisan formations operating there despite their initial resistance chetnik movement was largely inactive during occupation maintaining some covert activity only partisans and their regional committee had largely been destroyed by end of 1941 in january 1942 hungarian army and gendarmerie undertook a major raid in southern backa during which they massacred 2 550 serbs 743 jews and 47 other people in places such as becej srbobran and novi sad under pretext that they were searching for partisans other sources place number of serbs and jews massacred in novi sad as being much lower at around 879 raids were carried out in over 4 19 january in novi sad over 21 23 january and in becej over 25 29 january over period 4 24 january massacres were carried out by hungarian 15th light division commanded by major general jozsef grassy and units of royal gendarmerie operations were ordered by grassy lieutenant general ferenc feketehalmy czeydner colonel laszlo deak and royal gendarmerie captain dr marton zoldi in addition to serbs and jews members of other ethnicities were also victims roma people a small number of russian refugees who had fled russia after bolshevik revolution and some local hungarians in mid 1942 yugoslav government in exile reported that churches had been looted and destroyed and that serbian orthodox holy days had been prohibited by hungarian administration these reports stated that a camp in novi sad held 13 000 serb and jewish men women and children under pressure from hungarian political opposition hungarian government charged 14 hungarian officers with high treason in relation to massacres including feketehalmy czeydner grassy deak and zoldi a military trial was held in budapest between 23 december 1943 and january 1944 and those that were convicted were sentenced to between 10 and 15 years imprisonment for their part in massacres feketehalmy czeydner grassy deak and zoldi were not sentenced as they could not be located and had fled to germany it is apparent from trial proceedings that zoldi was present during some of trial professor klajn has stated that those most responsible for massacre were not tried before this military court and that they included prime minister bardossy and minister for interior affairs dr ferenc keresztes fischer both of whom appeared only as witnesses klajn also states that chief of general staff ferenc szombathelyi and minister of defence should also have been examined by court that genocide had been planned by highest military and political circles in hungary for a long time in advance and had been intended to convince german foreign minister joachim von ribbentrop that hungarian troops were needed on its territory instead of eastern front in mid 1944 partisan activity increased in backa to such an extent that special regulations similar to special administrative regulations that applied to operational zones of hungarian army were extended to backa curfews were imposed and political activities were forbidden a self defence organization was created aftermath german occupation and holocaust thumb 200px monument to 1942 raid victims in novi sad alt a sculpture in novi sad of three tall gaunt figures dedicated to 1942 raid victims occupation of backa and baranja lasted until 1944 fearing that hungary might conclude a separate peace with allies hitler launched operation margarethe i on 15 march 1944 and ordered german troops to occupy hungary in meantime some of those that had escaped prosecution for 1942 massacres had joined various german military and police organisations feketehalmy czeydner had become highest ranking

after germany occupied hungary in march 1944 genocidal policies of authorities were applied comprehensively hungarian jews were subjected to starvation and death marches and those that had remained in occupied territories were transported to extermination camps from 26 april 1944 remaining jews in backa and baranja mostly women but including children and elderly were rounded up into local concentration camps then moved to larger camps in hungary proper between 14 000 and 15 000 jews from backa baranja and other parts of hungary were collected at baja and then transported to auschwitz
