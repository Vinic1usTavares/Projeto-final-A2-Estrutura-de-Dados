lord hindlip s brothers alfred percy allsopp stood for conservative party while james harris sanders was candidate for liberal party allsopp was elected with a majority of 536 votes 23 1 although they had considered not contesting election because area was a conservative stronghold liberals decided to do so in order to generate a discussion on issue of home rule for ireland allsopp was in agreement

for liberal party was in favour of devolution of powers to ireland background vacancy and nominations at 1886 general election samuel allsopp held his seat in parliament unopposed for conservative party in april 1887 his father henry allsopp 1st baron hindlip died as a result of this samuel allsopp succeeded entering house of lords as a peer this left parliamentary constituency of taunton vacant conservative party offered samuel allsopp s brother alfred percy allsopp commonly known as percy allsopp chance to contest vacancy initially it was reported that liberal party would not contest seat if percy allsopp was only conservative candidate but a meeting of local executive could not reach a consensus some believed that as area was so strongly conservative a large loss would be damaging to party while others wanted to generate a debate on home rule despite taunton executive of conservative party selecting percy allsopp as their preferred candidate town s mayor samuel farrant declared that he would also stand for conservatives which led to concern within that party that a split of votes could result in a liberal candidate being elected farrant later withdrew his candidacy
