battle of baykand was fought in 729 between turkic turgesh khaganate and its soghdian allies and arabs of umayyad caliphate at baykand a town near bukhara in transoxiana in modern uzbekistan arab army under governor of khurasan ashras ibn abdallah al sulami campaigned across oxus river to suppress a large scale rebellion of subject soghdian princes that had broken out previous year and received turgesh support as arab army advanced on bukhara it was encircled by turgesh and cut off from water a series of engagements followed that almost ended in a disaster for arabs like day of thirst five years earlier but in end through inspirational bravery of a few arab leaders and actions of vanguard under al harith ibn surayj and qatan ibn qutayba arabs broke through and reached bukhara which they laid siege to background region of transoxiana arabic ma wara al nahr had been conquered by umayyad leader qutayba ibn muslim in reign of al walid i reigned 705 715 following muslim conquests of persia and khurasan in mid 7th century loyalties of transoxiana s native iranian and turkic populations and of autonomous local rulers remained questionable however in 719 transoxianian princes sent a petition to chinese court and their turgesh vassals for military aid against umayyad caliphate s governors in response from 720 on turgesh launched a series of attacks against muslims in transoxiana coupled with uprisings against caliphate among local sogdians umayyad governors initially managed to suppress unrest although control over ferghana valley was lost in 724 governor muslim ibn sa id al kilabi and his army suffered a heavy defeat so called day of thirst at hands of turgesh when he tried to subdue ferghana this defeat pushed arabs on defensive and even though no pitched battles took place over next few years arab position in transoxiana collapsed swiftly ashras al sulami s campaign faced with this crisis caliph hisham ibn abd al malik r 723 743 took drastic measures khurasan was separated from purview of governor of iraq and raised to a separate province under jaziran general ashras ibn abdallah al sulami like his predecessor asad ibn abdallah al qasri ashras tried to win over loyalties of local population and native non arab converts to islam mawali by addressing some of their grievances on taxation soon however this policy was reversed possibly due to pressure from caliph himself and often brutal measures arab tax gatherers employed to gather taxes from mawali and local landed aristocracy dihqans led to a general revolt in transoxiana this was made all more dangerous to arabs due to rebels call for assistance to turgesh ruler khagan who replied by leading his army in person against arabs by time khagan entered field in 728 only samarkand and two fortresses of kamarja and dabusiyya on zarafshan river remained in arab hands in all of transoxiana in order to confront turgesh ashras assembled forces of khurasan and led them to amul on oxus river a vanguard under qatan son of qutayba ibn muslim was sent over river and established a fortified camp but with arrival of combined native soghdian and turgesh armies bulk of arab force was unable to cross for three months during this period qatan s force was beleaguered by turgesh who at same time crossed oxus in small raiding parties ashras gave command of his cavalry to thabit who managed to rout raiders and drive them to amul there arabs defeated turgesh although a decisive victory eluded them as turgesh reinforcements crossed river and allowed raiders to escape to safety back over oxus at length ashras got his forces across linked up with qatan ibn qutayba and began to advance on bukhara arabs beat off attacks to reach trading town of some five farsakhs roughly south of bukhara itself and outside oasis that surrounded latter after arab army encamped at baykand turgesh and soghdians cut off water supply from oasis threatened with thirst arab army left baykand and headed for bukhara with qatan in vanguard when turgesh and soghdian forces attacked vanguard some 6 000 men was cut off from main body under ashras and ashras and qatan gave each other up for lost until they met again two days later king of samarkand ghurak who had unto this moment remained ostensibly loyal to arabs although ever careful to hedge his bets he had sent his son mukhtar to khagan now switched sides exhausted by thirst arab vanguard was almost cut down by their enemies losing 700 men at this point according to account preserved by al tabari tamimi warrior al harith ibn surayj who was later to lead a widespread revolt in khurasan urged arabs forward crying that being killed by sword is nobler in this world and greater in reward with god than death by thirst encouraged by his example tamimi and qaysi cavalry under al harith and qatan broke through turgesh lines and reached water sources narrowly staving off a second day of thirst and allowing ashras to continue his advance towards bukhara aftermath following series of battles around baykand turgesh retired north to samarkand where they assaulted fortress of kamarja while ashras with his troops besieged bukhara and wintered in its oasis warfare did not die down however and arabs situation remained precarious when in early 730 ashras newly appointed successor junayd ibn abd al rahman al murri tried to reach army which was still encamped in bukhara oasis he had to be escorted from amul by 7 000 cavalry who were attacked on way by turgesh and almost destroyed although bukhara was recovered by arabs at this time either under ashras or under junayd in very next year latter led khurasani army to disaster in battle of defile an event which shattered tenuous arab control over what remained of their possessions in transoxiana arabs were not able to recover their position until governorship of nasr ibn sayyar who in 739 741 managed to re establish caliphate s authority up to samarkand references sources baykand
