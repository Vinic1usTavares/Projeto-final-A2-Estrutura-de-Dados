thumb tracks of north atlantic tropical cyclones 1851 2012 an atlantic hurricane or tropical storm is a tropical cyclone that forms in atlantic ocean usually between months of june and november a hurricane differs from a cyclone or typhoon only on basis of location a hurricane is a storm that occurs in atlantic ocean and northeastern pacific ocean a typhoon occurs in northwestern pacific ocean and a cyclone occurs in south pacific or indian ocean tropical cyclones can be categorized by intensity tropical storms have one minute maximum sustained winds of at least 39 mph 34 knots 17 m s 63 km h while hurricanes have one minute maximum sustained winds exceeding 74 mph 64 knots 33 m s 119 km h national hurricane center glossary of nhc tpc terms retrieved on 2006 10 28 most north atlantic

subtropical ridge in pacific shows up as a large area of black dryness on this water vapor satellite image from september 2000 tropical cyclones are steered by surrounding flow throughout depth of troposphere atmosphere from surface to about eight miles 12 km high neil frank former director of united states national hurricane center used analogies such as a leaf carried along in a stream or a brick moving through a river of air to describe way atmospheric flow affects path of a hurricane across ocean specifically air flow around high pressure systems and toward low pressure areas influences hurricane tracks in tropical latitudes tropical storms and hurricanes generally move westward with a slight tendency toward north under influence of subtropical ridge a high pressure system

from west to east hurricane research division frequently asked questions subject g6 what determines movement of tropical cyclones retrieved on 2006 10 28 intensity generally speaking intensity of a tropical cyclone is determined by either storm s maximum sustained winds or lowest barometric pressure following table lists most intense atlantic hurricanes in terms of their lowest barometric pressure in terms of wind speed hurricane allen in 1980 was strongest atlantic tropical cyclone on record with maximum sustained winds of 190 mph 305 km h however these measurements are suspect since instrumentation used to document wind speeds at time would likely succumb to winds of such intensity nonetheless their central pressures are low enough to rank them among strongest recorded atlantic hurricanes owing to their intensity strongest atlantic hurricanes have all attained category 5 classification hurricane opal strongest category 4 hurricane recorded intensified to reach a minimum pressure of 916 mbar hpa 27 05 inhg a pressure typical of category 5 hurricanes nonetheless pressure remains too high to list opal as one of ten strongest atlantic tropical cyclones hurricane wilma is strongest atlantic hurricane recorded after reaching an intensity of 882 mbar hpa 26 05 inhg in october 2005 this also made wilma strongest tropical cyclone worldwide outside of west pacific where seven tropical cyclones have been recorded to intensify to lower pressures however this was later superseded by hurricane patricia in 2015 in east pacific which had a pressure reading of 872 mbar preceding wilma is hurricane gilbert which had also held record for most intense atlantic hurricane for 17 years 1935 labor day hurricane with a pressure of 892 mbar hpa 26 34 inhg is third strongest atlantic hurricane and strongest documented tropical cyclone prior to 1950 since measurements taken during wilma and gilbert were documented using dropsonde this pressure remains lowest measured over land hurricane rita is fourth strongest atlantic hurricane in terms of barometric pressure and one of three tropical cyclones from 2005 on list with others being wilma and katrina at first and seventh respectively however with a barometric pressure of 895 mbar hpa 26 43 inhg rita is strongest tropical cyclone ever recorded in gulf of mexico mitch and dean share intensities for eighth strongest atlantic hurricane at 905 mbar hpa 26 73 inhg tenth place for most intense atlantic tropical cyclone is hurricane maria listed to have deepened to a pressure as low as 908 mbar hpa 26 81 inhg many of strongest recorded tropical cyclones weakened prior to their eventual landfall or demise however three of storms remained intense enough at landfall to be considered some of strongest landfalling hurricanes three of ten hurricanes on list constitute three most intense atlantic landfalls in recorded history 1935 labor day hurricane made landfall at peak intensity making it most intense atlantic landfall though it weakened slightly before its eventual landfall on yucatan peninsula hurricane gilbert maintained a pressure of 900 mbar hpa 26 58 inhg at landfall as did camille making their landfalls tied as second strongest similarly hurricane dean made landfall on peninsula though it did so at peak intensity and with a higher barometric pressure its landfall marked fourth strongest in

for making forecasts most storms form in warm waters several hundred miles north of equator near intertropical convergence zone from tropical waves coriolis force is usually too weak to initiate sufficient rotation near equator storms frequently form in warm waters of gulf of mexico caribbean sea and tropical atlantic ocean as far east as cape verde islands origin of strong and long lasting cape verde type hurricanes systems may also strengthen over gulf stream off coast of eastern united states wherever water temperatures exceed although most storms are found within tropical latitudes occasionally storms will form further north and east from disturbances other than tropical waves such as cold fronts and upper level lows these are known as baroclinically induced tropical cyclones there is a strong correlation between atlantic hurricane activity in tropics and presence of an el nino or la nina in pacific ocean el nino events increase wind shear over atlantic producing a less favorable environment for formation and decreasing tropical activity in atlantic basin conversely la nina causes an increase in activity due to a decrease in wind shear marc c cove james j o brien et al effect of el nino on u s landfalling hurricanes revisited retrieved on 2006 10 28 according to azores high hypothesis by kam biu liu an anti phase pattern is expected to exist between gulf of mexico coast and north american atlantic coast during quiescent periods 3000 1400 bc and 1000 ad to present a more northeasterly position of azores high would result in more hurricanes being steered toward atlantic coast during hyperactive period 1400 bc to 1000 ad more hurricanes were steered towards gulf coast as azores high was shifted to a more southwesterly position near caribbean such a displacement of azores high is consistent with paleoclimatic evidence that shows an abrupt onset of a drier climate in haiti around 3200 14c years bp and a change towards more humid conditions in great plains during late holocene as more moisture was pumped up mississippi valley through gulf coast preliminary data from northern atlantic coast seem to support azores high hypothesis a 3000 year proxy record from a coastal lake in cape cod suggests that hurricane activity has increased significantly during past 500 1000 years just as gulf coast was amid a quiescent period of last millennium seasonal variation climatologically speaking approximately 97 percent of tropical cyclones that form in north atlantic develop between dates of june 1 and november 30 dates which delimit modern day atlantic hurricane season though beginning of annual hurricane season has historically remained same official end of hurricane season has shifted from its initial date of october 31 regardless on average once every few years a tropical cyclone develops outside limits of season as of january 2016 there have been 68 tropical cyclones in off season with most recent being subtropical storm andrea in 2019 first tropical cyclone of 1938 atlantic hurricane season which formed on january 3 became earliest forming tropical storm and hurricane after reanalysis concluded on storm in december 2012 hurricane able in 1951 was initially thought to be earliest forming major hurricane a tropical cyclone with winds exceeding however following post storm analysis it was determined that able only reached category 1 strength which made hurricane alma of 1966 new record holder as it became a major hurricane on june 8 though it developed within bounds of atlantic hurricane season hurricane audrey in 1957 became earliest developing category 4 hurricane on record after it reached intensity on june 27 however reanalysis from 1956 to 1960 by noaa downgraded audrey to a category 3 making hurricane

latter from 2005 to 2006 no storms have been recorded to exceed category 1 hurricane intensity in december in 1999 hurricane lenny reached category 4 intensity on november 17 as it took an unprecedented west to east track across caribbean its intensity made it latest developing category 4 hurricane though this was well within bounds of hurricane season hurricane hattie october 27 november 1 1961 was initially thought to have been latest forming category 5 hurricane ever documented though reanalysis indicated that a devastating hurricane in 1932 reached such an intensity at a later date consequently this made hurricane latest developing tropical cyclone to reach all four saffir simpson hurricane wind scale classifications past category 1 intensity june thumb typical

has increased since 1995 there is no obvious global trend annual number of tropical cyclones worldwide remains about 87 10 however ability of climatologists to make long term data analysis in certain basins is limited by lack of reliable historical data in some basins primarily in southern hemisphere in spite of that there is some evidence that intensity of hurricanes is increasing in 2006 kerry emanuel stated records of hurricane activity worldwide show an upswing of both maximum wind speed in and duration of hurricanes energy released by average hurricane again considering all hurricanes worldwide seems to have increased by around 70 in past 30 years or so corresponding to about a 15 increase in maximum wind speed and a 60 increase in storm lifetime at time emanuel theorized that increased heat from global warming was driving this trend however some argue that emanuel s own research in 2008 refuted this theory others contend that trend does not exist at all but instead is a figment created by faulty readings from primitive 1970s era measurement equipment vecchi and knutson 2008 found a weakly positive although not statistically significant trend in number of north atlantic tropical cyclones for 1878 2006 but also a surprisingly strong decrease in cyclone duration over this period on may 15 2014 journal nature published a peer reviewed submission from october

published online 14 may 2014 focus of report is on latitude at which recent tropical cyclones in atlantic are reaching maximum intensity their data indicates that during past thirty years peak intensity of these storms has shifted poleward in both hemispheres at a rate of approximately 60 km per decade amounting to approximately one degree of latitude per decade atlantic storms are becoming more destructive financially since five of ten most expensive storms in united states history have occurred since 1990 according to world meteorological organization recent increase in societal impact from tropical cyclones has largely been caused by rising concentrations of population and infrastructure in coastal regions pielke et al 2008 normalized mainland u s hurricane damage from 1900 2005 to 2005 values and found no remaining trend of increasing absolute damage 1970s and 1980s were notable because of extremely low amounts of damage compared to other decades decade 1996 2005 has second most damage among past 11 decades with only decade 1926 1935 surpassing its costs most damaging single storm is 1926 miami hurricane with 157 billion of normalized damage often in part because of threat of hurricanes many coastal regions had sparse population between major ports until advent of automobile tourism therefore most severe portions of hurricanes striking coast may have gone in some instances combined effects of ship destruction and remote landfall severely limit number of intense hurricanes in official record before era of hurricane reconnaissance aircraft and satellite meteorology although record shows a distinct increase in number and strength of intense hurricanes therefore experts regard early data as suspect christopher landsea et al estimated an undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 and zero to four per year between 1886 and 1910 these undercounts roughly take into account typical size of tropical cyclones density of shipping tracks over atlantic basin and amount of populated coastline number and strength of atlantic hurricanes may undergo a 50 70 year cycle also known as atlantic multidecadal oscillation nyberg et al reconstructed atlantic major hurricane activity back to early eighteenth century and found five periods averaging 3 5 major hurricanes per year and lasting 40 60 years and six other averaging 1 5 2 5 major hurricanes per year and lasting 10 20 years these periods are associated with atlantic multidecadal oscillation throughout a decadal oscillation related to solar irradiance was responsible for enhancing dampening number of major hurricanes by 1 2 per year although more uncommon since 1995 few above normal hurricane seasons occurred during 1970 94 destructive hurricanes struck frequently from 1926 60 including many major new england hurricanes twenty one atlantic tropical storms formed in 1933 a record only recently exceeded in 2005 which saw 28 storms tropical hurricanes occurred infrequently during seasons of 1900 25 however many intense storms formed during 1870 99 during 1887 season 19 tropical storms formed of which a record 4 occurred after november 1 and 11 strengthened into hurricanes few hurricanes occurred in 1840s to 1860s however many struck in early 19th century including an 1821 storm that made a direct hit on new york city some historical weather experts say these storms may have been as high as category 4 in strength these active hurricane seasons predated satellite coverage of atlantic basin before satellite era began in 1960 tropical storms or hurricanes went undetected unless a reconnaissance aircraft encountered one a ship reported a voyage through storm or a storm landed in a populated area official record therefore could miss storms in which no ship experienced gale force winds recognized it as a tropical storm as opposed to a high latitude extra tropical cyclone a tropical wave or a brief squall returned to port and reported experience proxy records based on paleotempestological research have revealed that major hurricane activity along gulf of mexico coast varies on timescales of centuries to millennia few major hurricanes struck gulf coast during 3000 1400 bc and again during most recent millennium these quiescent intervals were separated by a hyperactive period during 1400 bc and 1000 ad when gulf coast was struck frequently by catastrophic hurricanes and their landfall probabilities increased by 3 5 times this millennial scale variability has been attributed to long term shifts in position of azores high which may also be linked to changes in strength of north atlantic oscillation according to azores high hypothesis an anti phase pattern is expected to exist between gulf of mexico coast and atlantic coast during quiescent periods a more northeasterly position of azores high would result in more hurricanes being steered towards atlantic coast during hyperactive period more hurricanes were steered towards gulf coast as azores high was shifted to a more southwesterly position near caribbean such a displacement of azores high is consistent with paleoclimatic evidence that shows an abrupt onset of a drier climate in haiti around 3200 14c years bp and a change towards more humid conditions in great plains during late holocene as more moisture was pumped up mississippi valley through gulf coast preliminary data from northern atlantic coast seem to support azores high hypothesis a 3 000 year proxy record from a coastal lake in cape cod suggests that hurricane activity increased significantly during past 500 1000 years just as gulf coast was amid a quiescent period during last millennium evidence also shows that average latitude of hurricane impacts has been steadily shifting northward towards eastern seaboard over past few centuries this change has been sped up in modern times due to arctic ocean heating up especially much from fossil fuel caused global warming see also
