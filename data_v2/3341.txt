folate also known as vitamin b9 and folacin is one of b vitamins manufactured folic acid which is converted into folate by body is used as a dietary supplement and in food fortification as it is more stable during processing and storage folate is essential for body to make dna and rna and metabolise amino acids which are required for cell division as humans cannot make folate it is required from diet making it an essential vitamin it occurs naturally in many foods recommended adult daily intake of folate in u s is 400 micrograms from foods or dietary supplements folate in form of folic acid is used to treat anemia caused by folate deficiency folic acid is also used as a supplement by women during pregnancy to reduce risk of neural tube defects ntds in baby low levels in early pregnancy are believed to be cause of more than half of babies born with ntds more than 80 countries use either mandatory or voluntary fortification of certain foods with folic acid as a measure to decrease rate of ntds long term supplementation with relatively large amounts of folic acid is associated with small reduction in risk of stroke and an increased risk of prostate cancer there are concerns that large amounts of supplemental folic acid can hide vitamin b12 deficiency not consuming enough folate can lead to folate deficiency this may result in a type of anemia in which red blood cells become abnormally large symptoms may include feeling tired heart palpitations shortness of breath open sores on tongue and changes in color of skin or hair folate deficiency in children may develop within a month of poor dietary intake in adults normal total body folate is between 10 and 30 mg with blood levels of greater than 7 nmol l 3 ng ml folate was discovered between 1931 and 1943 it is on world health organization s list of essential medicines most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system wholesale cost of supplements in developing world is between us 0 001 and 0 005 per dose as of 2014 term folic is from latin word which means leaf because it was found in dark green leafy vegetables definition thumb left 250px chemical structure of folate family folate vitamin b9 refers to many forms of folic acid and its related compounds including acid active form methyltetrahydrofolate primary form found in blood folinic acid folacin and acid historic names included l casei factor vitamin bc and vitamin m terms folate and folic acid have somewhat different meanings in different contexts although sometimes used interchangeably within field of organic chemistry folate refers to conjugate base of folic acid within field of biochemistry folates refer to a class of biologically active compounds related to and including folic acid within field of nutrition folates are a family of essential nutrients related to folic acid obtained from natural sources whereas term folic acid is reserved for manufactured form that is used as a dietary supplement chemically folates consist of three distinct chemical moieties linked together a pterin 2 amino 4 hydroxy pteridine heterocyclic ring is linked by a methylene bridge to a p aminobenzoyl group that in turn is bonded through an amide linkage to either glutamic acid or poly glutamate one carbon units in a variety of oxidation states may be attached to n5 nitrogen atom of pteridine ring and or n10 nitrogen atom of p aminobenzoyl group health effects folate is especially important during periods of frequent cell division and growth such as infancy and pregnancy folate deficiency hinders dna synthesis and cell division affecting hematopoietic cells and neoplasms most because of their greater frequency of cell division rna transcription and subsequent protein synthesis are less affected by folate deficiency as mrna can be recycled and used again as opposed to dna synthesis where a new genomic copy must be created folate deficiency folate deficiency can be caused by unhealthy diets that do not include enough vegetables and other folate rich foods diseases in which folates are not well absorbed in digestive system such as crohn s disease or celiac disease some genetic disorders that affect levels of folate and certain medicines such as phenytoin or trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole folate deficiency is accelerated by alcohol consumption possibly by interference with folate transport folate deficiency may lead to glossitis diarrhea depression confusion anemia and fetal neural tube and brain defects other symptoms include fatigue gray hair mouth sores poor growth and swollen tongue folate deficiency is diagnosed by analyzing a complete blood count cbc and plasma vitamin b12 and folate levels a serum folate of 3 mg l or lower indicates deficiency serum folate level reflects folate status but erythrocyte folate level better reflects tissue stores after intake an erythrocyte folate level of 140 mg l or lower indicates inadequate folate status serum folate reacts more rapidly to folate intake than erythrocyte folate since folate deficiency limits cell division erythropoiesis production of red blood cells is hindered this leads to megaloblastic anemia which is characterized by large immature red blood cells this pathology results from persistently thwarted attempts at normal dna replication dna repair and cell division and produces abnormally large red cells called and neutrophils with abundant cytoplasm capable of rna and protein synthesis but with clumping and fragmentation of nuclear chromatin some of these large cells although immature reticulocytes are released early from marrow in an attempt to compensate for anemia both adults and children need folate to make normal red and white blood cells and prevent anemia which causes fatigue weakness and inability to concentrate increased homocysteine levels suggest tissue folate deficiency but homocysteine is also affected by vitamin b12 and vitamin b6 renal function and genetics one way to differentiate between folate deficiency and vitamin b12 deficiency is by testing for acid mma levels normal mma levels indicate folate deficiency and elevated mma levels indicate vitamin b12 deficiency folate deficiency is treated with supplemental oral folic acid of 400 to 1000 mg per day this treatment is very successful in replenishing tissues even if deficiency was caused by malabsorption people with megaloblastic anemia need to be tested for vitamin b12 deficiency before treatment with folic acid because if person has vitamin b12 deficiency folic acid supplementation can remove anemia but can also worsen neurologic problems deficiency may lead to folate deficiency which in turn increases homocysteine levels and may result in development of cardiovascular disease or birth defects birth defects deficiency of folate in pregnant women has been implicated in neural tube defects ntds with an estimate of 300 000 cases worldwide prior to implementation in many countries of mandatory food fortification ntds occur early in pregnancy first month therefore women must have abundant folate upon conception and for this reason there is a recommendation that any woman planning to become pregnant consume a folate containing dietary supplement before and during pregnancy compliance with this recommendation is not complete and many women become pregnant without this being a planned pregnancy or may not realize that they are pregnant until well into first trimester which is critical period for reducing risk of ntds countries have implemented either mandatory or voluntary food fortification of wheat flour and other grains or else have no such program and depend on public health and healthcare practitioner advice to women of childbearing age a meta analysis of global birth prevalence of spina bifida showed that when mandatory fortification was compared to countries with voluntary fortification or no fortification program there was a 30 reduction in live births with spina bifida some countries reported a greater than 50 reduction united states preventive services task force recommends folic acid as supplement or fortification ingredient as forms of folate other than folic acid have not been studied a meta analysis of folate supplementation during pregnancy reported a 28 lower relative risk of newborn congenital heart defects prenatal supplementation with folic acid did not appear to reduce risk of preterm births one systematic review indicated no effect of folic acid on mortality growth body composition respiratory or cognitive outcomes of children from birth to 9 years old there was no relation between maternal folic acid supplementation and an increased risk for childhood asthma fertility folate contributes to spermatogenesis in women folate is important for oocyte quality and maturation implantation placentation fetal growth and organ development heart disease one meta analysis reported that multi year folic acid supplementation in amounts in most of included clinical trials at higher than ul of 1 000 mg day reduced relative risk of cardiovascular disease by a modest 4 two older meta analyses which would not have incorporated results from newer clinical trials reported no changes to risk of cardiovascular disease stroke absolute risk of stroke with supplementation decreases from 4 4 to 3 8 a 10 decrease in relative risk two other meta analyses reported a similar decrease in relative risk two of these three were limited to people with pre existing cardiovascular disease or coronary heart disease beneficial result may be associated with lowering circulating homocysteine concentration as stratified analysis showed that risk was reduced more when there was a larger decrease in homocysteine effect was also larger for studies that were conducted in countries that did not have mandatory grain folic acid fortification beneficial effect was larger in subset of trials that used a lower folic acid supplement compared to higher cancer chronically insufficient intake of folate may increase risk of colorectal breast ovarian pancreas brain lung cervical and prostate cancers early after fortification programs were implemented high intakes were theorized to accelerate growth of preneoplastic lesions that could lead to cancer specifically colon cancer subsequent meta analyses of effects of low versus high dietary folate elevated serum folate and supplemental folate in form of folic acid have reported at times conflicting results comparing low to high dietary folate showed a modest but statistically significant reduced risk of colon cancer for prostate cancer risk comparing low to high dietary folate showed no effect but same two studies reported a significant increased risk for prostate cancer correlating to elevated serum folate two reviews of trials that involved folic acid dietary supplements reported respectively a statistically significant 24 increase in prostate cancer risk and a not significant 17 increase in prostate cancer risk supplementation with folic acid at 1 000 to 2 500 mg day amounts used in many of supplement trials would result in higher concentrations of serum folate than what is achieved from diets high in food derived folate second study reported no significant increase or decrease in total cancer incidence colorectal cancer other gastrointestinal cancer genitourinary cancer lung cancer or hematological malignancies in people who were consuming folic acid supplements a third supplementation meta analysis limited to reporting only on colorectal cancer incidence showed that folic acid treatment was not associated with colorectal cancer risk anti folate chemotherapy folate is important for cells and tissues that divide rapidly cancer cells divide rapidly and drugs that interfere with folate metabolism are used to treat cancer antifolate drug methotrexate is often used to treat cancer because it inhibits production of active form of thf from inactive dihydrofolate however methotrexate can be toxic producing side effects such as inflammation in digestive tract that make eating normally more difficult bone marrow depression inducing leukopenia and thrombocytopenia and acute kidney and liver failure have been reported folinic acid under drug name a form of folate formyl thf can help rescue or reverse toxic effects of methotrexate folic acid supplements have little established role in cancer chemotherapy supplement of folinic acid in people undergoing methotrexate treatment is to give cells dividing less rapidly enough folate to maintain normal cell functions amount of folate given is depleted by rapidly dividing cells cancer quickly so does not negate effects of methotrexate neurological disorders conversion of homocysteine to methionine requires folate and vitamin b12 elevated plasma homocysteine and low folate are associated with cognitive impairment dementia and alzheimer s disease supplementing diet with folic acid and vitamin b12 lowers plasma homocysteine however several reviews reported that supplementation with folic acid alone or in combination with other b vitamins did not prevent development of cognitive impairment nor slow cognitive decline relative risk of autism spectrum disorders was reduced by 23 when maternal diet was supplemented during pregnancy subset analysis confirmed this among asian european and american populations some evidence links a shortage of folate with clinical depression limited evidence from randomized controlled trials showed using folic acid in addition to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ssris may have benefits research found a link between depression and low levels of folate exact mechanisms involved in development of schizophrenia and depression are not entirely clear but bioactive folate methyltetrahydrofolate 5 mthf a direct target of methyl donors such as s adenosyl methionine same recycles inactive bh2 into bh4 necessary cofactor in various steps of monoamine synthesis including that of dopamine bh4 serves a regulatory role in monoamine neurotransmission and is required to mediate actions of most antidepressants 5 mthf also plays both direct indirect roles in dna methylation no2 synthesis and one carbon metabolism folic acid b12 and iron a complex interaction occurs between folic acid vitamin b12 and iron a deficiency of one may be masked by excess of another so when taken as dietary supplements three need to be in balance malaria some studies show iron folic acid supplementation in children under five may result in increased mortality due to malaria this has prompted world health organization to alter their iron folic acid supplementation policies for children in malaria prone areas such as india metabolism biological activity of folate in body depends upon dihydrofolate reductase action in liver which converts folate into tetrahydrofolate thf this action is rate limiting in humans leading to elevated blood concentrations of unmetabolized folic acid when consumption from dietary supplements and fortified foods nears or exceeds u s tolerable upper intake level of 1 000 mg per day biosynthesis animals including humans cannot synthesize folate and therefore must obtain folate from their diet all plants and fungi and certain protozoa bacteria and archaea can synthesize folate de novo through variations on same biosynthetic pathway folate molecule is synthesized from pterin pyrophosphate and para aminobenzoic acid through action of dihydrofolate synthase pterin is in turn derived in a series of enzymatically catalyzed steps from guanosine triphosphate gtp while para aminobenzoic acid vitamin b10 is a product of pathway thumb 400px of folic acid into folinic acids where r para glutamate all of biological functions of folic acid are performed by thf and its methylated derivatives hence folic acid must first be reduced to thf this four electron reduction proceeds in two chemical steps both catalyzed by same enzyme dihydrofolate reductase folic acid is first reduced to dihydrofolate and then to tetrahydrofolate each step consumes one molecule of nadph biosynthetically derived from vitamin b3 and produces one molecule of mechanistically hydride is transferred from nadph to c6 position of pteridine ring a one carbon 1c methyl group is added to tetrahydrofolate through action of serine to yield 5 10 methylenetetrahydrofolate 5 10 ch2 thf this reaction also consumes serine and pyridoxal phosphate plp vitamin b6 and produces glycine and pyridoxal a second enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase oxidizes 5 10 methylenetetrahydrofolate to an cation which in turn is hydrolyzed to produce 5 thf and 10 formyl thf this series of reactions using b carbon atom of serine as carbon source provide largest part of one carbon units available to cell alternative carbon sources include formate which by catalytic action of formate tetrahydrofolate ligase add a 1c unit to thf to yield 10 formyl thf glycine histidine and can also directly contribute to thf bound 1c pool drug interference a number of drugs interfere with biosynthesis of thf from folic acid among them are antifolate dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors such as antimicrobial trimethoprim and chemotherapy drug methotrexate and sulfonamides competitive inhibitors of 4 aminobenzoic acid in reactions of synthetase acid one of most commonly prescribed epilepsy treatment drugs also used to treat certain psychological conditions such as bipolar disorder is a known inhibitor of folic acid and as such has been shown to cause birth defects including neural tube defects plus increased risk for children having cognitive impairment and autism there is evidence that folate consumption is protective function tetrahydrofolate s main function in metabolism is transporting single carbon groups i e a methyl group methylene group or formyl group these carbon groups can be transferred to other molecules as part of modification or biosynthesis of a variety of biological molecules folates are essential for synthesis of dna modification of dna and rna synthesis of methionine from homocysteine and various other chemical reactions involved in cellular metabolism these reactions are collectively known as folate mediated one carbon metabolism dna synthesis folate derivatives participate in biosynthesis of both purines and pyrimidines formyl folate is required for two of steps in biosynthesis of inosine monophosphate precursor to gmp and amp methylenetetrahydrofolate donates c1 center required for biosynthesis of dtmp 2 deoxythymidine 5 phosphate from dump 2 deoxyuridine 5 phosphate formyl folate is required for two of steps in biosynthesis of inosine monophosphate precursor to gmp and amp

activation thumb simplified schematic diagram of folate methionine cycle 360px methyl thf converts vitamin b12 to methyl b12 methylcobalamin methyl b12 converts homocysteine in a reaction catalyzed by homocysteine methyltransferase to methionine a defect in homocysteine methyltransferase or a deficiency of b12 may lead to a so called methyl trap of thf in which thf converts to methyl thf causing a deficiency in folate thus a deficiency in b12 can cause accumulation of methyl thf mimicking folate deficiency diet united states department of agriculture agricultural research service maintains a food composition database from which folate content in hundreds of foods can be searched as shown in table food fortification initiative lists all countries in world that conduct fortification programs and within each country what nutrients are added to which foods and whether those programs are voluntary or mandatory in us mandatory fortification of enriched breads cereals flours corn meal pastas rice and other grain products began in january 1998 as of december 21 2018 81 countries required food fortification with one or more vitamins most commonly fortified vitamin as used in 62 countries is folate most commonly fortified food is wheat flour followed by maize flour and rice from country to country added folic acid amounts range from 0 4 to 5 1 mg 100 g but great majority are in a more narrow range of 1 5 to 2 5 mg 100 g folate naturally found in food is susceptible to destruction from high heat cooking especially in presence of acidic foods and sauces it is soluble in water and so may be lost from foods boiled in water for foods that are normally consumed cooked values in table are for folate naturally occurring in cooked foods plant sourcesamount asfolate mg 100g

dietary recommendations because of difference in bioavailability between supplemented folic acid and different forms of folate found in food dietary folate equivalent dfe system was established one dfe is defined as 1 mg of dietary folate one mg of folic acid supplement counts as 1 7 mg dfe reason for difference is that when folic acid is added to food or taken as a dietary supplement with food it is at least 85 absorbed whereas only about 50 of folate naturally present in food is absorbed national institutes of health u s nutritional recommendations ug dfe per day for rda ug folic acid for

differ somewhat from u s rdas united kingdom s dietary reference value for folate set by committee on medical aspects of food and nutrition policy in 1991 is 200 mg day for adults safety risk of toxicity from folic acid is low because folate is a water soluble vitamin and is regularly removed from body through urine one potential issue associated with high doses of folic acid is that it has a masking effect on diagnosis of pernicious anaemia due to vitamin b12 deficiency and may even precipitate or exacerbate neuropathy in vitamin b12 deficient individuals this evidence justified development of a ul for folate in general uls are set for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient adult ul of 1 000 mg for folate and lower for children refers specifically to folic acid used as a supplement as no health risks have been associated with high intake of folate from food sources efsa reviewed safety question and agreed with united states that ul be set at 1 000 mg japan national institute of health and nutrition set adult ul at 1 300 or 1 400 mg depending on age reviews of clinical trials that called for long term consumption of folic acid in amounts exceeding ul have raised concerns one theory is that consumption of large amounts of folic acid leads to detectable amounts of unmetabolized folic acid circulating in blood because enzyme dihydrofolate reductase that converts folic acid to biologically active forms is rate limiting evidence of a negative health effect of folic acid in blood is not consistent and folic acid has no known cofactor function that would increase likelihood of a causal role for free fa in disease development however low vitamin b12 status in combination with high folic acid intake in addition to previously mentioned neuropathy risk appeared to increase risk of cognitive impairment in elderly long term use of folic acid dietary supplements in excess of 1 000 mg day has been linked to an increase in prostate cancer risk food

protein fat saturated fat carbohydrates sugars and salt voluntary nutrients may be shown if present in significant amounts instead of daily values amounts are shown as percent of reference intakes ris for folate 100 ri was set at 200 mg in 2011 food fortification folic acid fortification is a process where synthetic folic acid is added to wheat flour or other foods with intention of promoting public health through increasing blood folate levels in populace it is used as it more stable during processing and storage after discovery of link between insufficient folic acid and neural tube defects governments and health organizations worldwide made recommendations concerning folic acid supplementation for women intending to become pregnant because neural tube closes in first four weeks of gestation often before many women even know they are pregnant many countries in time decided to implement mandatory food fortification programs a meta analysis of global birth prevalence of spina bifida showed that when mandatory fortification was compared to countries with voluntary fortification or no fortification program there was a 30 reduction in live births with spina bifida with some countries reporting a greater than 50 reduction folic acid is added to grain products in more than 80 countries either as required or voluntary fortification and these fortified products make up a significant source of population s folate intake fortification is controversial with issues having been raised concerning individual liberty as well as theorized health concerns described in safety section in u s there is concern that federal government mandates fortification but does not provide monitoring of potential undesirable effects of fortification food fortification initiative lists all countries in world that conduct fortification programs and within each country what nutrients are added to which foods as of december 21 2018 81 countries required food fortification with one or more vitamins most commonly mandatory fortified vitamin in 62 countries is folate most commonly fortified food is wheat flour australia and new zealand australia and new zealand jointly agreed to wheat flour fortification through food standards australia new zealand in 2007 requirement was set at 135 ug of folate per 100 g of bread australia implemented program in 2009 new zealand was also planning to fortify bread excluding organic and unleavened varieties starting in 2009 but then opted to wait until more research was done association of bakers and green party had opposed mandatory fortification describing it as mass medication food safety minister kate wilkinson reviewed decision to fortify in july 2009 citing as reasons to oppose claims for links between over consumption of folate with increased risk of cancer in 2012 delayed mandatory fortification program was revoked and replaced by a voluntary program with hope of achieving a 50 bread fortification target canada canadian public health efforts focused on promoting awareness of importance of folic acid supplementation for all women of childbearing age and decreasing socio economic inequalities by providing practical folic acid support to vulnerable groups of women folic acid food fortification became mandatory in 1998 with fortification of 150 ug of folic acid per 100 grams of enriched flour and uncooked cereal grains results of folic acid fortification on rate of neural tube defects in canada have been positive showing a 46 reduction in prevalence of ntds magnitude of reduction was proportional to rate of ntds essentially removing geographical variations in rates of ntds seen in canada before fortification united kingdom while food standards agency recommended folic acid fortification bbc experts back folic acid in flour 11 may 2007 and wheat flour is fortified with iron folic acid fortification of wheat flour is allowed voluntarily rather than required a 2018 review by authors based in united kingdom strongly recommended that mandatory fortification be reconsidered as a means of reducing risk of neural tube defects united states right thumb in united states and many other countries wheat flour is fortified with folic acid some countries also fortify maize flour and rice in 1996 united states food and drug administration fda published regulations requiring addition of folic acid to enriched breads cereals flours corn meals pastas rice and other grain products this ruling took effect on 1 january 1998 and was specifically targeted to reduce risk of neural tube birth defects in newborns there were concerns expressed that amount of folate added was insufficient fortification program was expected to raise a person s folic acid intake level by 70 130 ug day however an increase of almost double that amount was actually observed this could be from fact that many foods are fortified by 160 175 over required amount much of elder population take supplements that add 400 ug to their daily folic acid intake this is a concern because 70 80 of population have detectable levels of unmetabolized folic acid in their blood a consequence of folic acid supplementation and fortification however at blood concentrations achieved via food fortification folic acid has no known cofactor function that would increase likelihood of a causal role for free fa in disease development u s national center for health statistics conducts biannual national health and nutrition examination survey nhanes to assess health and nutritional status of adults and children in united states some results are reported as what we eat in america 2013 2014 survey reported that for adults ages 20 years and older men consumed on average of 249 mg day folate from food plus 207 mg day of folic acid from consumption of fortified foods for a combined total of 601 mg day of dietary folate equivalents dfes because each microgram of folic acid counts as 1 7 mg of food folate for women values are 199 153 and 459 mg day respectively this means that fortification led to a bigger increase in folic acid intake than first projected and that more than half adults are consuming more than rda of 400 mg as dfes even so fewer than half of pregnant women are exceeding pregnancy rda of 600 mg day before folic acid fortification about 4 100 pregnancies were affected by a neural tube defect each year in united states centers for disease control and prevention reported in 2015 that since addition of folic acid in grain based foods as mandated by fda rate of neural tube defects dropped by 35 this translates to an annual saving in total direct costs of approximately 508 million for ntd affected births that were prevented in 2016 folate was 96th most prescribed medication in united states with more than 8 million prescriptions history in 1920s scientists believed folate deficiency and anemia were same condition in 1931 researcher lucy wills made a key observation that led to identification of folate as nutrient required to prevent anemia during pregnancy wills demonstrated that anemia could be reversed with brewer s yeast in late 1930s folate was identified as corrective substance in brewer s yeast it was first isolated via extraction from spinach leaves by herschel k mitchell esmond e snell and roger j williams in 1941 term folic is from latin word which means leaf because it was found in dark green leafy vegetables historic names included l casei factor vitamin bc after research done in chicks and vitamin m after research done in monkeys bob stokstad isolated pure crystalline form in 1943 and was able to determine its chemical structure while working at lederle laboratories of american company this historical research project of obtaining folic acid in a pure crystalline form in 1945 was done by team called folic acid boys under supervision and guidance of director of research dr at lederle lab pearl river ny this research subsequently led to synthesis of antifolate which was used to treat childhood leukemia by sidney farber in 1948 in 1950s and 1960s scientists began to discover biochemical mechanisms of action for folate in 1960 researchers linked folate deficiency to risk of neural tube defects in late 1990s u s and canadian governments decided that despite public education programs and availability of folic acid supplements there was still a challenge for women of child bearing age to meet daily folate recommendations which is when those two countries implemented folate fortification programs as of december 2018 62 countries mandated food fortification with folic acid other animals veterinarians may test cats and dogs if a risk of folate deficiency is indicated cats with exocrine pancreatic
