quirigua is an ancient maya archaeological site in department of izabal in south eastern guatemala it is a medium sized site covering approximately along lower motagua river ashmore 1980 p 24 with ceremonial center about from north bank during maya classic period ad 200 900 quirigua was situated at juncture of several important trade routes site was occupied by 200 construction on acropolis had begun by about 550 and an explosion of grander construction started in 8th century all construction had halted by about 850 except for a brief period of reoccupation in early postclassic c 900 c 1200 quirigua shares its architectural and sculptural styles with nearby classic period city of copan with whose history it is closely entwined miller 1999 p 49 quirigua s rapid expansion in 8th century was tied to king k ak tiliw chan yopaat s military victory over copan in 738 when greatest king of copan uaxaclajuun ub aah k awiil or 18 rabbit was defeated he was captured and then sacrificed in great plaza at quirigua looper 2003 pp 4 5 83 before this quirigua had been a vassal state of copan but it maintained its independence afterwards ceremonial architecture at quirigua is quite modest

nearby village of same name looper 2003 viii and is located a little over northeast of guatemala city stross et al 1983 p 333 it lies in municipality of los in department of izabal and has an elevation of above mean sea level positioned on north bank of lower reaches of motagua river quirigua is situated at point where valley broadens into a flood plain which has exposed site to periodic flooding over centuries looper 2003 p 35 although river passed close to site during period of city s occupation it has since changed course and now flows south of ceremonial centre quirigua is north of copan and is located north west of international border with honduras local bedrock is a hard red sandstone which inhabitants used in construction of monuments and architecture this local sandstone is very strong and not prone to shearing or fracturing allowing sculptors at quirigua to erect tallest freestanding stone monuments in americas miller 1999 p 82 quirigua was built directly over motagua fault and city suffered damage in ancient times as a result of major earthquakes sharer traxler 2006 p 507 population although quirigua elite were clearly maya in ethnicity looper 1999 p 264 site lies on southern periphery of mesoamerican area and population was at least bi ethnic sheets 2000 p 442 with ethnic maya in a minority majority of population belonged ethnically to less complex intermediate area lying beyond eastern border of mesoamerica population density of site has been estimated at 400 to 500 per square kilometer 1040 to 1300 per square mile in centre of city during late 1999 p 344 with an estimated peak population of 1200 1600 sharer traxler 2006 p 688 surveys have revealed an average of 130 structures per square kilometer 338 per square mile at site compared with 1449 structures km2 per square mile in central copan sharer traxler 2006 p 686 low population density indicates that quirigua served as focus for a dispersed rural population looper 2003 p 1 population levels of quirigua valley increased rapidly after successful rebellion against copan in 738 although it was never a heavily populated site martin grube 2000 p 219 in 9th century there was a severe decline in population culminating in abandonment of city economy motagua river flows down from western guatemalan highlands and quirigua was ideally positioned to control trade of uncut jade majority of which was found in middle reaches of motagua valley miller 1999 p 54 as well as controlling flow of other important commodities up and down river such as cacao which was produced as a local cash crop drew 1999 p 240 although cacao was produced for trade maize remained primary local crop due to its central role in maya diet ashmore 2007 p 111 in addition maize probably formed an important component in site s tribute payments to its overlords at copan a city that was exhausting its own local resources although little jade has been recovered from site there is evidence for trade in obsidian originating from source situated near upper reaches of motagua stross et al 1983 p 335 in classic period location of site would have placed quirigua on a crossroads between trading route from highlands to caribbean coast and route from copan to major cities of peten basin looper 2003 p 2 known rulers as recorded on hieroglyphic inscriptions at quirigua all dates are ad maya inscriptions for rulers sometimes include reference to a number hel number or count named after its main glyph that are believed to specify position of that ruler in sequence of dynastic succession to

elaborate decoration stela d north face there is evidence that quirigua was occupied as early as late preclassic 400 bc ad 200 although no structures have been securely dated to this period a number of late preclassic artifacts have been recovered including 63 figurines and a chert blade early classic ceramics from quirigua are similar to finds at both copan and chalchuapa in el salvador while jade hunchback figurines from same period resemble those found in central honduras and in guatemalan highlands these early finds demonstrate participation of quirigua in wider southeastern maya region from late preclassic onwards looper 2003 p 38 a combination of hieroglyphic texts from tikal copan and quirigua together with architectural styles and chemical tests of bones of founder of copan dynasty all suggest that quirigua and copan were founded by elite colonists from great city of tikal as a part of its expansion into southeastern border area of maya region sharer traxler 2006 p 333 sharer et al 2005 p 196 looper 2003 pp 37 38 recorded history of quirigua starts in 426 in early classic c 200 c 600 according to hieroglyphic inscriptions at other sites on 5 september of that year k inich yax k uk mo was enthroned as king of copan martin grube 2000 p 192 just three days later he installed tok casper first known king of quirigua upon throne from this it is evident that right from beginning of its recorded history quirigua was subservient to its southern neighbour and was founded to bring lucrative trade route of motagua river under control of copan and indirectly of tikal during next few centuries about which little is known ceremonial architecture at quirigua was limited to hilltop group a and a broad earthen platform on valley floor it is recorded that a stela as yet undiscovered was erected in 455 by tutuum yohl k inich second king of quirigua martin grube 2000 p 217 an early monument records supervision of a ritual in 480 by then overlord from copan demonstrating quirigua s continued status as a vassal of that city a hieroglyphic text dating to 493 mentions two further kings of quirigua but interruptions in text make reading and decipherment of their names particularly difficult there are close parallels between 5th century architecture and monuments of quirigua and uaxactun in northern peten a site that fell under domination of tikal in late 4th century similarities show that quirigua remained strongly aligned with great tikal alliance network looper 2003 p 50 hiatus and recovery quirigua suffered a hiatus from turn of 6th century that lasted through to middle of 7th century this may be linked to tikal hiatus of middle classic caused by tikal s defeat by calakmul there is evidence that quirigua suffered an attack by unknown enemies in this period as demonstrated by apparently deliberate defacement of stela u and monument 26 characteristic of damage inflicted by invading warriors no monuments were erected during this hiatus which lasted from 495 to 653 in 6th or early 7th century a natural disaster caused a devastating flood of motagua valley and buried surface of site under a deep layer of silt completely changing landscape only those buildings that stood above mud continued in use including group a saved by its hilltop location earthen platform on valley floor also continued in use at least those parts of it that stood above silt and it was one of site s smaller complexes that grew to become new centre of quirigua as represented by monuments visible to this day a revival can be identified by dedication of first new monument in a century and a half raised by otherwise unknown king k awiil yopaat in 653 continued contact with copan is evident as well as longer distance contacts possibly with caracol in belize at about same time major construction work was undertaken in acropolis including building of site s first ballcourt looper 2003 pp 50 53 apogee quirigua traditionally had been subordinate to its southern neighbour copan and in 724 uaxaclajuun ub aah k awiil king of copan installed k ak tiliw chan yopaat upon quirigua s throne as his vassal as early as 734 however k ak tiliw chan yopaat had shown that he was no longer an obedient subordinate of copan when he started to refer to himself as k ul ahaw holy lord instead of using lesser term ahaw subordinate lord at same time he began to use his own quirigua emblem glyph drew 1999 p 241 these early assertions of independence can only have been made if quirigua had managed to form an external alliance thumb left upright alt

158 184 indeed this local act of rebellion appears to have been part of larger political struggle between two maya superpowers great cities of tikal and calakmul in 736 only two years later k ak tiliw chan yopaat received a visit from k awiil high king of distant calakmul while copan was one of tikal s oldest allies timing of this visit by king of calakmul is highly significant falling between accession of k ak tiliw chan yopaat to throne of quirigua as a vassal of copan and outright rebellion that was to follow this strongly suggests that calakmul sponsored quirigua s rebellion in order to weaken tikal and to gain access to rich trade route of motagua valley looper 2003 p 79 it is likely that contact with calakmul had been initiated soon after k ak tiliw chan yopaat acceded to throne since quirigua experienced rapid growth soon after suggesting that quirigua already was receiving external support in 738 interlinked fortunes of quirigua and copan took a stunning change of direction when k ak tiliw chan yopaat reigning lord of quirigua captured powerful but elderly 13th king of copan uaxaclajuun ub aah k awiil webster 2002 p 300 who had installed him on his throne in 725 this coup does not seem to have affected either copan or quirigua physically there is no evidence that either city was attacked at this time and victor seems not to have received any detectable tribute drew 1999 p 286 quirigua seems rather to have gained its independence and control of important trade routes an inscription at quirigua although difficult to interpret suggests that capture took place on 27 april 738 when quirigua seized and burned wooden images of copan s patron deities all of this seems to imply that k ak tiliw chan yopaat managed to somehow ambush uaxaclajuun ub aah k awiil rather than to have defeated him in outright battle in classic period statues of maya deities often were carried into battle on palanquins facilitating their capture in event of defeat it has been suggested that king of copan was attempting to attack another site in order to secure captives for sacrifice and was ambushed by k ak tiliw chan yopaat and his quirigua warriors looper 2003 p 78 captured lord was taken back to quirigua and on 3 may 738 he was decapitated in a public ritual sacrificial offering of blood of such a powerful overlord greatly enhanced standing of quirigua and its royal family throughout region and it proclaimed quirigua as new capital of south eastern maya region looper 2003 p 76 after this quirigua engaged in a major monument building programme closely mimicking sculptural style of copan possibly using captured copan sculptors to carry out work miller 1999 pp 134 35 population of quirigua and of other sites in valley rapidly increased after events

2003 pp 58 61 in late classic c 600 c 900 alliance with calakmul frequently was associated with promise of military support fact that copan a much more powerful city than quirigua failed to retaliate against its former vassal implies that it feared military intervention of calakmul calakmul itself was far enough away from quirigua that k ak tiliw chan yopaat was not afraid of falling directly under its power as a full vassal state even though it is likely that calakmul sent warriors to help in defeat of copan alliance instead seems to have been one of mutual advantage calakmul managed to weaken a powerful ally of tikal while quirigua gained its independence looper 1999 p 271 looper 2003 p 81 in 718 city of xkuy an as yet undiscovered site was attacked and burned by copan under leadership of king uaxaclajuun ub aah k awiil after king of copan was sacrificed in 738 xkuy seems to have become a loyal vassal of quirigua and in 762 k ak tiliw chan yopaat supervised accession of

continued activity in most of maya region cities already were suffering terminal decline engulfed by classic maya collapse but in quirigua sky xul dedicated three great zoomorph sculptures and two altars considered marvels of maya sky xul died some time between 795 and 800 martin grube 2000 pp 222 24 decline and collapse little is known of jade sky who succeeded sky xul and was last recorded

three days in 1881 they were first pre columbian ruins that he saw and they were sufficiently impressive to inspire him to take up a permanent interest in central american archaeology he was able to return on three further occasions last being in 1894 and he made first efforts to clear monuments before recording them he carried out a very thorough examination and made a photographic record of all visible monuments carried out some minor excavations made paper and plaster molds of hieroglyphic inscriptions and surveyed principal sculptures drew 1999 p 89 these molds were then shipped to
