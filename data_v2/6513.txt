eastern voalavo voalavo antsahabensis is a rodent in family which occurs in anjozorobe forest of eastern madagascar although surveys before 2002 failed to record species it is common in some places however it is threatened by habitat loss because of slash and burn agriculture species was formally described in 2005 and is most closely related to only other species of voalavo northern voalavo from northern madagascar two species of voalavo are only subtly different in morphology with a body mass of eastern voalavo is a small rodent it has a longer tail than northern voalavo as well as a longer rostrum front part of skull and diastema gap between incisors and molars but shorter molar rows two species also differ in details of configuration of palate taxonomy it was first recorded in 2002 when three individuals were captured in madagascar s anjozorobe forest in 2005 species was formally described by steven goodman and colleagues as voalavo antsahabensis second species in genus voalavo only previously known species northern voalavo occurs further to north in northern highlands goodman et al 2005 p 863 sequences of cytochrome b gene differ by about 10 in these two species goodman et al 2005 p 871 specific name antsahabensis derives from name of village of which is near place where holotype was found goodman et al 2005 p 870 common name eastern voalavo has been used for this species description species of voalavo are small rodents with a delicate skull and without a tuft at tip of tail as present in closely related genus eliurus goodman et al 2005 pp 865 866 eastern voalavo is similar to northern voalavo and differs only in subtle characters tail is shorter in eastern voalavo but head and body is slightly longer as is ear however latter two apparent contrasts may be result of differences in measurement technique goodman et al 2005 pp 868 869 in both species final of tail are covered with white hairs goodman et al 2005 p 868 in three specimens of eastern voalavo head and body length ranges from tail length is hindfoot length ear length and body mass in skull it has a significantly longer rostrum front part of skull and diastema gap between incisors and molars furthermore it has shorter molar rows in both upper and lower jaws goodman et al 2005 table 1 back end of incisive foramina openings in front part of palate which is located in front of first molars is rounded in eastern voalavo but angular in northern voalavo goodman et al 2005 p 869 sutures of maxillary and palatine bones line where two bones part of skull join are straight and parallel to each other and midline of skull in eastern voalavo northern voalavo in contrast are more curved statistical analysis of measurements of skull and teeth clearly separates two species of voalavo distribution and ecology it is only known from forests at anjozorobe on eastern margin of madagascar s central highlands among specimens found in 2002 two were captured at altitude on a uapaca densifolia branch about over ground in moist montane forest and a third was caught on ground at altitude goodman et al 2005 p 866 this last specimen a male had its testicles located in scrotum and therefore was reproductively mature even though its skull bones were not completely fused indicating it was not yet mature before it was collected in 2002 species was not recorded in earlier biological surveys of anjozorobe taking place in 1977 1986 and 1996 whether this is because animal is difficult to collect because its abundance varies from year to year or because its distribution is patchy is unknown goodman and colleagues argued on basis of this example that rapid surveys may not necessarily yield complete inventories of fauna of an area later surveys in 2005 and 2006 did find it at several other sites in region at some of which it was abundant anjozorobe is about from nearest occurrence of northern voalavo and most of intervening area contains montane forest however this forest zone is bisected by low lying window which may serve as a barrier between two species of voalavo goodman et al 2005 p 872 conservation status it is listed as endangered on iucn red list because of its small vulnerable range anjozorobe forest is threatened by practice of slash and burn agriculture tavy however its habitat has been designated as a protected area d anjozorobe references literature cited goodman s m rakotondravony d h n and m 2005 a new species of rodent from montane forest of central eastern madagascar muridae nesomyinae voalavo subscription required proceedings of biological society of washington 118 4 863 873 category voalavo category mammals of madagascar category mammals described in 2005
