noted when you dish upon a star was written to be one of funnier episodes in a simpsons flashback review robert canning of ign reviewed episode positively commenting i m not saying this episode is one of greatest series has ever produced but it is very very funny and it features one of my all time favorite guest performances authors of book i can t believe it s a bigger and better updated unofficial simpsons guide warren martyn and adrian wood wrote in a negative review despite three very high profile guest actors this episode is really rather dull and uninspired only real moment of interest is car chase at end and kim basinger s delightfully self deprecating quips about her constant adoration of her oscars alec baldwin apparently not having one himself ign rated ron howard as twelfth greatest guest appearance on simpsons total film s nathan ditum ranked baldwin and basinger s performances as second best guest appearances in show s history references external links when you
