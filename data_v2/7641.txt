players to play alongside each other instead of against each other in addition they found it more fun than typical competitive multiplayer experience however they thought that this type of game was not well developed and often encouraged players to complete objectives alone as a result company decided to develop a game which tasks players to deploy strategy and work with other players leading to development of both left 4 dead and evolve company s management and staff enjoy a close relationship any staff member can play a game provide feedback suggest improvements and even criticize it regardless of their position team thought that they were open with their games as a result instead of holding a press conference to explain game to critics they choose to invite people to play it in studio this practice allows them to see people leaving with a smile enabling them to gauge real reactions of players and to see whether game is welcomed or not they also hope that through early access they can introduce their games to a wide audience and share experience with community prior to game s official launch list of games turtle rock studios is best known for their work on valve s counter
