pronunciation official chinese sources refer to this battle as eastern part of second phase campaign or offensive western half of second phase campaign resulted in a chinese victory in battle of ch ongch on river battle took place about a month after people s republic of china entered conflict and sent people s volunteer army pva 9th army to infiltrate northeastern part of north korea on 27 november 1950 chinese force surprised us x corps commanded by major general edward almond at chosin reservoir area a brutal 17 day battle in freezing weather soon followed between 27 november and 13 december 30 000 united nations command troops later nicknamed chosin few under field command of major general oliver p smith were encircled and attacked by about 120 000 chinese troops under command of song shilun who had been ordered by mao zedong to destroy un forces un forces were nevertheless able to break out of encirclement and to make a fighting withdrawal to port of hungnam inflicting heavy casualties on chinese us marine units were supported in their withdrawal by us army s task force faith to their east which suffered heavy casualties and full brunt of chinese offensive retreat

eighth army advanced north through western coast of korean peninsula while republic of korea rok i corps and us x corps advanced north on eastern coast at same time people s republic of china entered conflict after issuing several warnings to united nations on 19 october 1950 large formations of chinese troops dubbed people s volunteer army pva secretly crossed border and into north korea one of

reservoir and yudami ni on west side of reservoir faced with sudden attacks by chinese forces in eighth army sector general douglas macarthur ordered eighth army to launch home by christmas offensive to support offensive macarthur ordered x corps to attack west from chosin reservoir and to cut vital supply line as a response major general edward m almond commander of us x corps formulated a plan on 21 november it called for us 1st marine division to advance west through yudami ni while us 7th infantry division would provide a regimental combat team to protect right flank at sinhung ni us 3rd infantry division would also protect left flank while providing security in rear area by then x corps was stretched thin along a 400 mile front surprised by marine landing at wonsan china s chairman

corps of 9th army relieving 42nd corps near yudami ni prelude location terrain and weather chosin reservoir is a man made lake located in northeast of korean peninsula name chosin is japanese pronunciation of korean place name changjin and name stuck due to outdated japanese maps used by un forces battle s main focus was around long road that connects hungnam and chosin reservoir which served as only retreat route for un forces through these roads yudami ni and sinhung ni located at west and east side of reservoir respectively are connected at hagaru ri now changjin up from there road passes through koto ri and eventually leads to port of hungnam area around chosin reservoir was sparsely populated battle was fought over some of roughest terrain during some of harshest winter weather conditions of korean war road was created by cutting through hilly terrain of korea with steep climbs and drops dominant peaks such as funchilin pass and toktong pass overlook entire length of road road s quality was poor and in some places it was reduced to a one lane gravel trail on 14 november 1950 a cold front from siberia descended over chosin reservoir and temperature plunged according to estimates to as low as cold weather was accompanied by frozen ground creating considerable danger of frostbite casualties icy roads and weapon malfunctions medical supplies froze morphine syrettes had to be defrosted in a medic s mouth before they could be injected frozen blood plasma was useless on battlefield even cutting off clothing to deal with a wound risked gangrene and frostbite batteries used for jeeps and radios did not function properly in temperature and quickly ran down lubrication in guns gelled and rendered them useless in battle likewise springs on firing pins would not strike hard enough to fire round or would jam forces and strategies thumb left 250px alt a map showing force emplacements around a lake map of battle of changjin chosin reservoir although 1st marine division landed at wonsan as part of almond s us x corps almond and major general oliver p smith of 1st marine division shared a mutual loathing of each other that dated back to a meeting before landing at inchon when almond had spoken of how easy amphibious landings are even though he had never been involved in one smith believed there were large numbers of chinese forces in north korea despite fact that higher headquarters in tokyo said otherwise but almond felt smith was overly cautious mutual distrust between commanders caused smith to slow 1st marine division s advance towards chosin reservoir in violation of almond s instructions smith established supply points and airfields along way at hagaru ri and koto ri as us x corps was pushing towards reservoir chinese formulated their strategy based on their experiences in chinese civil war working from assumption that only a light un presence would be at reservoir chinese 9th army was first to destroy un garrisons at yudami ni and sinhung ni then push towards hagaru ri believing bulk of us x corps would move to rescue destroyed units 9th army would then block and trap main un forces on road between hagaru ri and hungnam 9th army initially committed eight divisions for battle with most of forces concentrated at yudami ni and sinhung ni flaw in chinese plan was a lack of accurate intelligence about un forces even though us x corps was stretched thin over northeast korea slow marine advance allowed bulk of us 1st marine division including 5th 7th and 11th marines to be concentrated at yudami ni furthermore strategically important hagaru ri where a c 47 capable airfield was under construction and a supply dump was not a priority for chinese despite being lightly defended by 1st and 7th marines only regimental combat team 31 rct 31 an understrength and hastily formed regimental combat team of us 7th infantry division was thinly spread along eastern bank of reservoir those units would later take brunt of chinese assaults as for un forces 1st marine division had an effective strength of 25 473 men at start of battle and it was further reinforced by british royal marines unit 41 independent commando and equivalent of two regiments from 3rd and 7th army infantry divisions un forces had a combined strength of about 30 000 men during course of battle un forces at chosin were also supported by one of greatest concentrations of air power during korean war since 1st marine aircraft wing stationed at yonpo airfield and five aircraft carriers from us navy s task force 77 were able to launch 230 sorties daily to provide close air support during battle while us air force far east combat cargo command in japan reached capacity of airdropping 250 tons of supplies per day to resupply trapped un forces although 9th army was one of china s elite formations composed of veterans and former pows from huaihai campaign several deficiencies hampered its ability during battle initially 9th army was intended to be outfitted in manchuria during november but mao suddenly ordered it into korea before that could happen as a result 9th army had almost no winter clothing for harsh korean winter similarly poor logistics forced 9th army to abandon heavy artillery while working with little food and ammunition food shortage forced 9th army to initially station a third of its strength away from chosin reservoir in reserve and starvation and exposure broke out among chinese units since foraging was not an option in sparsely populated area by end of battle more chinese troops had died from cold than from combat and air raids chinese strength is usually estimated at 120 000 troops for battle as 9th army was composed of 12 divisions with a strength of 10 000 men per division appleman roy e 1992 south to naktong north to yalu center of military history united states army washington d c 768 before arriving in korea 9th army was also reinforced each of its three corps now had four divisions instead of regular three infantry from two formerly liberated surrendered nationalist divisions were absorbed to bring each infantry company up to strength some companies had approximately 150 men but other companies were reinforced with more than 200 men however attrition due to un air raids poor logistics and cold weather had also taken a toll on 9th army in its attempt to reach battlefield on day 9th army entered korea for example frostbite immediately inflicted 700 casualties while most of its transport vehicles were destroyed by un air raid indeed during course of battle chinese prisoners of war reported that most of 9th army s divisions had become under strength numbering about 6 500 to 7 000 men per division these factors plus uncertainties over chinese order of battle in western sources had also led to some historians to revise chinese strength down to as low as 60 000 during course of battle eventually all 12 chinese divisions of 9th army were deployed although 78th and 88th divisions of pva 26th corps did not make contact with un forces during course of battle eight divisions of pva 20th and 27th corps served as main attacking force four divisions of pva 26th corps initially were held back in reserve and deployed after 20th and 27th corps exhausted all their available strength battle thumb left 250px alt three asian man standing

and withdrawing marines smith remarked retreat hell we re not retreating we re just advancing in a different direction for breakout marines formed into a convoy with a single m4a3 sherman tank as lead

high command scrambled 79th division to resume attacks on yudam ni while 89th division rushed south towards kot o ri chinese struck at night and ferocity of fighting forced rear covering forces to call in night fighters to suppress attacks fighting lasted well into morning of 2 december until all marines had managed to withdraw from yudam ni at same time 1 7 marines also tried to break chinese blockade at hill 1419 on 1 december despite being badly reduced by combat hunger and frostbite pva 59th division sent in its last five platoons and refused to yield as night approached 1 7 finally captured peak and started to march through hills on east side of road relying on element of surprise they managed to destroy several chinese positions along road on morning of 2 december a joint attack by fox company and 1 7 secured toktong pass thus opening road between yudam ni and hagaru ri although road had been opened between yudam ni and hagaru ri convoy still had to fight through numerous chinese positions on hills overlooking road on first night of retreat chinese struck convoy in force and inflicted heavy casualties on 3 5 marines although strong air cover suppressed most of chinese forces for rest of march cold weather harassing fire raiding parties and roadblocks slowed retreat to a crawl while inflicting numerous casualties despite those difficulties convoy reached
