headline a welsh language concert at builth wells in august 1993 but they performed in both welsh and english despite being signed to crai this was more as promoter than as a record label itself it

and matthews housemate roland mwyn successfully got record on bbc radio 1 after sending a copy to radio presenter mark radcliffe after iestyn george heard release journalist named it as record of week

from a fan to pay toll on severn bridge on way back to cardiff band returned to falcon where they played a still but better gig in front of record executives meanwhile george had put band in touch

later replaced him as catatonia s drummer when ieuan left to join super furry animals label wanted to market band and so at some expense had photographer mankowitz conduct a photoshoot with matthews she band and their management all hated photos but label wanted to use them in order not to write cost off as a loss in order to have some photos a series of black and white photos of matthews drinking a bottle of wine while wearing a pepsi t shirt were taken by one of press agency staff warner bros liked images and authorised their use band had a recording session at sawmills studios cornwall which saw some disagreements during recording between matthews and roberts afterwards sampson was removed as producer following a row over arrangement for sweet catatonia music reviewers

great we re really looking forward to what they new songs are going to sound like live it ll be good to get back on old live circuit again they played several tracks from their upcoming album at that point entitled it s what s not there that makes what s there what it is by may it had been renamed to paper scissors stone matthews was looking forward to new releasing explaining to nme that i think it s stronger than last album a bit more avant garde it s a bit less stupid equally cursed and blessed was all over shop stylistically i think it s a bit more focused and i think it s a bit more impassioned catatonia went on to headline nme stage at t in park festival on 7 july having conducted a warm up concert at lighthouse glasgow lead single from new album stone by stone was poorly received by media with nme giving it a score of one out of ten calling it lumpen voice grating and that catatonia are fading from public consciousness quicker than shane ritchie and awkwardly out of date media reported that matthews entered drug rehabilitation for drinking and smoking in mid 2001 with singer stating that she was also suffering from depression as a result tour to support paper scissors stone was cancelled at start of august at time this was because matthews had not yet finished her ongoing treatment for anxiety and exhaustion it was suggested that band might split up in august which was dismissed as rubbish by catatonia however on 21 september it was announced that they were breaking up with record label releasing a statement which said their decision has been made entirely amicably and there are no details at present as to their future plan tributes came in for band from a variety of sources with bbc radio 1 presenter huw stephens describing them as international superstars and adding i always thought they were one of best welsh bands they were not just a throwaway pop band they had real meaningful songs iestyn george editor of magazine maxim at time praised influence that matthews had through catatonia in later 1990s saying that around 1998 and 1999 cerys was in papers every other day he also referenced that she had never intended this role as catatonia had thought that they had already peaked prior to international velvet matthews went on to release her first solo album in may 2003 her second album never said goodbye was released in august 2006 in november 2007 she released a mini album of welsh language songs aeroplane on my kung fu label matthews returned in late 2009 as first recording artist to release albums simultaneously in both welsh and english paid i and don t look down respectively powell has gone on to write songs including for duffy and from 2007 onwards has presented a welsh language show on radio cymru he also replaced drummer stuart cable from stereophonics following his death in supergroup stand they released a charity single in 2010 to fund construction of a statue of welsh footballer fred keenor in cardiff city centre side projects and collaborations while working on international velvet matthews was approached by tommy scott of liverpool based band space to perform on single duet ballad of tom jones they had met while on tour two years prior and had kept in touch she joined them on tour for several dates to sing duet live matthews said of song it s great i feel like nancy sinatra because it s a superb ballad she went on to duet with tom jones on a single for his album reload it was a cover of song baby it s cold outside which was released as a christmas single in 1999 she was credited as cerys from catatonia musical style and influences matthews said that they did not have any particular influences in their music however she said that her family had always been singing along to bbc radio 2 she held ambition to have band appear on radio 2 as due to poor levels of radio reception in wales they had been unable to listen to other stations she attributed style of welsh music as never attempting to be cool as they wouldn t have been aware of what was in fashion at time catatonia frequently used metaphors in their songwriting such as road rage which references emotional anger line if it turns to blue what are we going to do in single you ve got a lot to answer for from way beyond blue references a pregnancy test other works from international velvet were compared to poetry by katharine viner in guardian all members of band were involved in writing of songs and there may have been more than one person s set of lyrics appearing in a single release powell said that it s quite interesting to have two people s viewpoints within same song i m not sure how many bands actually do that in most bands guitarist writes music and singer writes lyrics we tend to share things out more evenly he also criticised attachment of an indie pop label to band saying we re seen as one of indie bands but we ve always just tried to make pop music even if it is pop music with a hard edge and quite a twisted little view of life we ve always seen ourselves as a little bigger than an indie band style of music played by catatonia changed slightly over time adrian thrills of daily mail said that way beyond blue was guitar dominated and showed them to be a talented but typical alternative rock outfit but songs on international velvet showed that they had become one of britain s most inventive pop bands an article in people newspaper described international velvet as purest pop by time that paper scissors stone was released band were using country music influences in some of their songs according to fiona shepherd at scotsman she compared music to that of scottish band mogwai while elements of nightfall were compared to arab strap thrills compared some of elements of album to
