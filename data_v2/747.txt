hurricane sergio was a powerful and long lived tropical cyclone that affected baja california peninsula as a tropical storm and caused significant flooding throughout southern texas in early october 2018 sergio became eighth in east pacific for 2018 breaking old record of seven set in 2015 twentieth named storm eleventh hurricane and ninth major hurricane of season sergio originated from a system that was located over northwestern south america on september 24 national hurricane center monitored disturbance for several days as system organized into a tropical storm on september 29 sergio gradually strengthened for next couple of days as it traveled west southwestward becoming a hurricane on october 2 storm then turned towards northwest as it underwent rapid intensification and an eyewall replacement cycle before peaking as a category 4 hurricane on october 4 with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph 220 km h hurricane maintained peak intensity for 12 hours before undergoing a second eyewall replacement and turning towards southwest system then began another period of intensification achieving a secondary peak with winds of 125 mph 205 km h on october 6 next day sergio began a third eyewall replacement cycle falling below major hurricane strength at same time system unexpectedly assumed some annular characteristics over next few days cyclone curved from southwest to northeast weakening into a tropical storm on october 9 sergio made landfall as a tropical storm on october 12 on baja california peninsula and later in northwestern mexico as a tropical depression before dissipating early on october 13 sergio s approach warranted issuance of tropical storm watches and warnings along western and eastern coasts of baja california from october 10 11 cyclone made landfall in western baja california sur and sonora on october 13 as a tropical storm and tropical depression respectively causing over us 2 in damage over a thousand school closures and a few hundred evacuations due to severe flooding sergio s remnants brought heavy rainfall to arizona resulting in closure of its state fair multiple tornadoes also spawned in texas as a result of increased moisture about us 548 000 in damage occurred throughout both states no injuries or deaths were reported in association with hurricane or its remnants meteorological history origins of hurricane sergio can be traced to a system that was located over northwestern south america on september 24 although uncertain there is a possibility that sergio arose from a tropical wave that departed from west coast of africa on september 13 national hurricane center nhc forecasted on september 25 that a low pressure area would form a few hundred miles south of gulf of tehuantepec in about two days a low pressure system materialized a few hundred miles south southeast of mexico s southern coast around 12 00 utc on september 26 nhc continued to track disturbance for a few more days as system traveled west northwest before it developed into tropical storm sergio on september 29 at 12 00 utc while approximately 385 mi 620 km south of zihuatanejo mexico unlike most other tropical cyclones sergio did not possess an inner wind core instead maximum sustained winds were located in a rainband approximately 125 mi 205 km east of center thumb right hurricane sergio acquiring annular characteristics on october 7 alt category 3 hurricane sergio acquiring some annular characteristics on october 7 despite being located within a favorable environment of warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear sergio only gradually intensified over next couple of days system becoming a category 1 hurricane on october 2 at 00 00 utc meanwhile storm tracked just south of west as a mid level ridge developed to north at that point storm had developed a well defined eye surrounded by clouds hurricane then began a period of rapid intensification reaching category 3 major hurricane status by 18 00 utc wind speed then leveled off for about 18 hours as system underwent an eyewall replacement cycle at same time mid level ridge had weakened resulting in storm travelling to northwest sergio then began another period of intensification becoming eighth category 4 hurricane of season on october 4 at 00 00 utc breaking old record of seven set in 2015 six hours later system peaked with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph 220 km h and a minimum central pressure of 942 mbar 27 82 inhg while located about 825 mi 1325 km southwest of cabo san lucas storm maintained peak intensity for 12 hours before weakening due to another eyewall replacement cycle as a result its structure deteriorated eye fading and surrounding cloud tops warming a faraway mid latitude ridge caused sergio to turn towards southwest from october 5 6 after bottoming out as a low end category 3 hurricane on october 5 at 06 00 utc sergio began to intensify once more reaching a secondary peak with winds of 125 mph 205 km h on october 6 at 00 00 utc after maintaining its intensity for 18 hours hurricane began to weaken around 00 00 utc on october 7 due to upwelling and a third eyewall replacement cycle soon after sergio began another turn rotating from southwest to northeast over next few days due to influence of a mid latitude trough it unexpectedly acquired some annular characteristics early on october 7 eye having doubled in size while most of banding features disappeared system gradually weakened over next two days falling to tropical storm status on october 9 at 18 00 utc due to cooling sea surface temperatures sergio made landfall near los baja california sur around 12 00 utc on october 12 as a 50 mph 85 km h tropical storm after crossing over baja california peninsula and traversing gulf of california storm made a second landfall near guaymas sonora as a tropical depression around 18 00 utc before dissipating over northwest mexico around midnight its remnants continued northeastward
