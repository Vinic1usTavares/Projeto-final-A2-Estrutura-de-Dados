benevolent fund richard briers was one of his first visitors at flat and was shocked by change he saw s there motionless he was just a mere shadow a crippled crushed shadow it was really bloody awful

was held at st john baptist church busbridge where theme from those magnificent men in their flying machines was played he was cremated at guildford crematorium screen persona and technique although there were exceptions terry thomas s screen characters were generally similar geoff mayer wrote that although there would be variations he would remain rotter a pretentious elitist seedy sometimes lecherous cad with an eye for quick money and easy life eric sykes with whom terry thomas shared a number of screen moments stated that it was always same character and always funny andrew spicer writing for british film institute called him definitive postwar cad or rotter terry thomas himself agreed with view he presented writing in 1980s that t t with his permanent air of caddish disdain bounder aristocratic rogue upper class english twit genuine english eccentric one of last real gentlemen wet genteel englishman high bred idiot cheeky camel haired cad amiable buffoon pompous englishman twentieth century dandy stinker king of cads all those descriptions added up to my image as terry thomas terry thomas identified himself as a comedy actor but regarded himself first and foremost as a comedian with a built in ability to inject humour into situations he worked hard at humour element especially during his days in cabaret and revue he wrote that he spent an enormous amount of time studying how to write humour and reading books on philosophical approach to it but it didn t get me very far i decided that humour was like a good watch it would go well if left to do its job but moment one started poking around it went wonky while working on his television series how do you view he would change lines around to ensure scene worked well even if he gave best lines to others it was a quality which was appreciated by a number of others including jack lemmon who appeared with terry thomas in how to murder your wife lemmon commented that like most really good professionals he was generous to fellow actors he worked with you not at you before starting filming or making an entrance on stage terry thomas had a routine he would undertake my own technique to get myself going was to jump in air and execute a few dance steps his approach for much of his film work was to underplay many of his reactions filming a scene in a cinema in private s progress a close up was needed showing his character registering shock fury indignation and anything else i could stuff in he just looked into camera and kept my mind blank it s a trick i ve used often since in this way audience does work terry thomas said i like to do my own stunts which he did for films such as a matter of who and bachelor flat this included some dangerous work for example during those magnificent men in their flying machines he ran along roof of a moving train legacy and reputation thumb right terry thomas in 1961 showing his dental diastema which later provided basis for naming a widening of space terry thomas sign in a traumatic wrist injury following terry thomas s death lionel jeffries called him last of great gentlemen of cinema while director michael winner commented that no matter what your position was in relation to his as star he was always terribly nice he was kindest man and he enjoyed life so much reviewing his career in guardian adrian turner considered that we took him for granted and he was ideal for his time not to put too serious a point on it his portrayal of crass stupidity and blatant deviousness struck a chord with british audiences during fifties as they experienced clumsy dismemberment of empire and never had it so good ethos of macmillan era during sixties he became a glorious anachronism much in demand in america who saw in him irrelevant pageantry of britain he also said that terry thomas was a national treasure gilbert adair writing in independent considered that for three decades and in literally scores of films he personified englishman as amiable bounder adair wrote that characterisation he was to assume represented very essence of patrician double barrelled terry thomas s friend jack lemmon called him a consummate professional he was a gentleman a delight to be with personally let alone professionally and above all as an actor he had one of qualities that i admire so much he made it look simple terry thomas s image of an english cad was used by others personification started in 1960s when voice actor ivan owen who had worked alongside terry thomas in stars in battledress based voice for basil brush on that of terry thomas in a characterisation which also copied terry thomas s penchant for bad self satisfied golf club bore jokes 1960s also witnessed fictional cartoon character dick dastardly in two hanna barbera cartoon series wacky races and dastardly and muttley in their flying machines who was inspired by terry thomas other actors have also used terry thomas s persona as an inspiration for their characters dustin hoffman acknowledged that he based his interpretation of character captain hook in hook on terry thomas rupert everett disclosed that when he provided voice for prince charming in shrek 2 terry thomas was vocally my role model while i was doing it and paul whitehouse s character 13th duke of from fast show was also modelled on terry thomas s on screen persona terry thomas s popularity continued after his death in february 1999 national film theatre ran a season of his films an spokesman described how attendees turned up in evening dress with false moustaches and carrying cigarettes in long holders everyone has been trying to steal cardboard cutouts of terry we ve never had a response like it to be honest we are rather unprepared nobody expected terry thomas fever some of innovations terry thomas brought into his earlier television programmes were later copied by others how do you view later provided prologue format of up pompeii and was first to use regular bbc announcers as foils in comic sketches a practice continued later particularly with shows of morecambe and wise terry thomas s anecdotes stringing several stories together later inspired ronnie corbett in his monologue spot in his series two ronnies in 2014 bbc radio 4 broadcast memories of a cad a comedy drama by roy smiles about relationship between terry thomas and richard briers played by martin
