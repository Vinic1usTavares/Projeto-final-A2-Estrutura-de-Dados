became his most important cult center from then on after fall of assyrian empire ninurta s statues were torn down and his temples abandoned because he had become too closely associated with assyrian regime which many conquered peoples saw as tyrannical and oppressive in epic poem lugal e ninurta slays demon asag using his talking mace sharur and uses stones to build tigris and euphrates rivers to make them useful for irrigation in a poem sometimes referred to as sumerian georgica ninurta provides agricultural advice to farmers in an akkadian myth he was champion of gods against anzu bird after it stole tablet of destinies from his father enlil and in a myth that is alluded to in many works but never fully preserved he killed a group of warriors known as slain heroes his major symbols were a

center was eshumesha temple in sumerian city state of nippur where he was worshipped as god of agriculture and son of chief god enlil though they may have originally been separate deities in

personalities are closely intertwined king gudea of lagash ruled 2144 2124 bc dedicated himself to ningirsu and gudea cylinders dating to 2125 bc record how he rebuilt temple of ningirsu in lagash as result of a dream in which he was instructed to do so gudea cylinders record longest surviving account written in sumerian language known to date gudea s son ur ningirsu incorporated ningirsu s name as part of his own in order to honor him as city state of girsu declined in importance ningirsu became increasingly known as ninurta though ninurta was originally worshipped solely as a god of agriculture in later times as mesopotamia became more urban and militarized he began to be increasingly seen as a warrior deity instead he became primarily characterized by aggressive warlike aspect of his nature in spite of this however he continued to be seen as a healer and protector and he was commonly invoked in spells to protect against demons disease and other dangers thumb upright 1 3 1853 restoration of what city of kalhu ninurta s main cult center in assyrian empire might have originally looked like based on excavations of british archaeologist austen henry layard there in 1840s in later times ninurta s reputation as a fierce warrior made him immensely popular among assyrians in late second millennium bc assyrian kings frequently held names which included name of ninurta such as tukulti ninurta trusted one of ninurta ninurta ekur ninurta is heir of s temple ekur and ninurta tukulti ashur ninurta is god assur s trusted one tukulti ninurta i ruled 1243 1207 bc declares in one inscription that he hunts at command of god ninurta who loves me similarly adad nirari ii ruled 911 891 bc claimed ninurta and assur as supporters of his reign declaring his destruction of their enemies as moral justification for his right to rule in ninth century bc when ashurnasirpal ii ruled 883 859 bc moved capital of assyrian empire to kalhu first temple he built there was one dedicated to ninurta walls of temple were decorated with stone relief carvings including one of ninurta slaying anzu bird ashurnasirpal ii s son shalmaneser iii ruled 859 824 bc completed ninurta s ziggurat at kalhu and dedicated a stone relief of himself to god on carving shalmaneser iii s boasts of his military exploits and credits all his victories to ninurta declaring that without ninurta s aid none of them would have been possible when adad nirari iii ruled 811 783 bc dedicated a new endowment to temple of assur in assur they were sealed with both seal of assur and seal of ninurta assyrian stone reliefs from kalhu period show assur as a winged disc with ninurta s name written beneath it indicating two were seen as near equals after capital of assyria was moved away from kalhu ninurta s importance in pantheon began to decline sargon ii favored nabu god of scribes over ninurta nonetheless ninurta still remained an important deity even after kings of assyria left kalhu inhabitants of former capital continued to venerate ninurta who they called ninurta residing in kalhu legal documents from city record that those who violated their oaths were required to place two minas of silver and one mina of gold in lap of ninurta residing in kalhu last attested example of this clause dates to 669 bc last year of reign of king esarhaddon ruled 681 669 bc temple of ninurta at kalhu flourished until end of assyrian empire hiring poor and destitute as employees main cultic personnel were a sangu priest and a chief singer who were supported by a cook a steward and a porter in late seventh century bc temple staff witnessed legal documents along with staff of temple of nabu at two temples shared a official iconography thumb upright 1 3 male figure in an assyrian winged sun emblem from northwest palace at kalhu some authors have speculated that this figure may in fact be ninurta but most scholars reject this assertion as unfounded in artistic representations ninurta is shown as a warrior carrying a bow and arrow and clutching sharur his magic talking mace he sometimes has a set of wings raised upright ready to attack in babylonian art he is often shown standing on back of or riding a beast with body of a lion and tail of a scorpion ninurta remained closely associated with agricultural symbolism as late as middle of second millennium bc on from kassite period 1600 1155 bc a plough is captioned as a symbol of ningirsu plough also appears in neo assyrian art possibly as a symbol of ninurta a perched bird is also used as a symbol of ninurta during neo assyrian period one speculative hypothesis holds that winged disc originally symbolized ninurta during ninth century bc but was later transferred to assur and sun god shamash this idea is based on some early representations in which god on winged disc appears to have tail of a bird most scholars have rejected this suggestion as unfounded astronomers of eighth and seventh centuries bc identified ninurta or pabilsag with constellation sagittarius alternatively others identified him with star sirius which was known in akkadian as meaning arrow constellation of canis major of which sirius is most visible star was known as meaning bow after bow and arrow ninurta was believed to carry in babylonian times ninurta was associated with planet saturn family thumb right 240px limestone bust of a goddess from

mother is instead goddess ninlil under name ninurta his wife is usually goddess gula but as ningirsu his wife is goddess bau gula was goddess of healing and medicine and she was sometimes alternately said to be wife of god pabilsag or minor vegetation god abu bau was worshipped almost exclusively in lagash and was sometimes alternately identified as wife of god she and ningirsu were believed to have two sons gods ig and sul bau also had seven daughters but ningirsu was not claimed to be their father as son of enlil ninurta s siblings include nanna nergal and sometimes inanna mythology lugal e second only to goddess inanna ninurta probably appears in more myths than any other mesopotamian deity in sumerian poem lugal e also known as ninurta s exploits a demon known as asag has been causing sickness and poisoning rivers ninurta s talking mace sharur urges him to battle asag ninurta confronts asag who is protected by an army of stone warriors ninurta initially flees like a bird but sharur urges him to fight ninurta slays asag and his armies then ninurta organizes world using stones from warriors he has defeated to build mountains which he designs so that streams lakes and rivers all flow into tigris and euphrates rivers making them useful for irrigation and agriculture ninurta s mother ninmah descends from heaven to congratulate her son on his victory ninurta dedicates mountain of stone to her and renames her ninhursag meaning lady of mountain goddess of scribes appears and writes down ninurta s victory as well as ninhursag s new name finally ninurta returns home to nippur where he is celebrated as a hero this myth combines ninurta s role as a warrior deity with his role as an agricultural deity title lugal e means o king and comes from poem opening phrase in original sumerian ninurta s exploits is a modern title assigned to it by scholars poem was eventually translated into akkadian after sumerian became regarded as too difficult to understand a companion work to lugal e is angim dimma or ninurta s return to nippur which describes ninurta s return to nippur after slaying asag it contains little narrative and is mostly a praise piece describing ninurta in larger than life terms and comparing him to god an angim dimma is believed to have originally been written in sumerian during third dynasty of ur 2112 2004 bc or early old babylonian period 1830 1531 bc but oldest surviving texts of it date to old babylonian period numerous later versions of text have also survived it was translated into akkadian during middle babylonian period 1600 1155 bc anzu myth thumb upright 1 3 ninurta with his thunderbolts pursues anzu who has stolen tablet of destinies from enlil s sanctuary austen henry layard monuments of nineveh 2nd series 1853 in old middle and late babylonian myth of anzu and tablet of destinies anzu is a giant monstrous bird enlil gives anzu a position as guardian of his sanctuary but anzu betrays enlil and steals tablet of destinies a sacred clay tablet belonging to enlil that grants him his authority while enlil is preparing for his bath rivers dry up and gods are stripped of their powers gods send adad and shara to defeat anzu but all of them fail finally god ea proposes that gods should send ninurta enlil s son ninurta confronts anzu and shoots it with his arrows but tablet of destinies has power to reverse time and anzu uses this power to make ninurta s arrows fall apart in midair and revert to their original components shafts turn back into feathers into live birds and arrowheads return to quarry even ninurta s bow returns to forest and wool bowstring turns into a live sheep ninurta calls upon south wind for aid which rips anzu s wings off ninurta slits anzu s throat and takes tablet of destinies god dagan announces ninurta s victory in assembly of gods and as a reward ninurta is a granted a prominent seat on council enlil sends messenger god birdu to request ninurta to return tablet of destinies ninurta s reply to birdu is fragmentary but it is possible he may initially refuse to return tablet in end however ninurta does return tablet of destinies to his father this story was particularly popular among scholars of assyrian royal court myth of ninurta and turtle recorded in 6 1 2 is a fragment of what was originally a much longer literary composition in it after defeating anzu ninurta is honored by enki in eridu ninurta has brought back a chicklet from anzu for which enki praises him ninurta however hungry for power and even greater accolades set s his sights on whole world enki senses his thoughts and creates a giant turtle which he releases behind ninurta and which bites hero s ankle as they struggle turtle digs a pit with its claws which both of them fall into enki gloats over ninurta s defeat end of story is missing last legible portion of account is a lamentation from ninurta s mother ninmah who seems to be considering finding a substitute for her son according to charles in this account enki is clearly intended as hero and his successful foiling of ninurta s plot to seize power for himself is intended as a demonstration of enki s supreme wisdom and cunning other myths thumb upright 1 sumerian cylinder seal impression dating to 3200 bc showing an ensi and his acolyte feeding a sacred herd ninurta was an agricultural deity and in a poem known as sumerian georgica he offers detailed advice on farming in ninurta s journey to eridu ninurta leaves ekur temple in nippur and travels to abzu in eridu led by an unnamed guide in eridu ninurta sits in assembly with gods an and enki and enki gives him me for life poem ends with ninurta returning to nippur account probably deals with a journey in which ninurta s cult statue was transported from one city to another and guide is person carrying cult statue story closely resembles other sumerian myth of inanna and enki in which goddess inanna journeys to eridu and receives mes from enki in a poem known as sumerian georgica written sometime between 1700 and 1500 bc ninurta delivers detailed advice on agricultural matters including how to plant tend and harvest crops how to prepare fields for planting and even how to drive birds away from crops poem covers nearly every aspect of farm life throughout course of year though poem starts out seeming as though advice is being given from a father to his son at end it concludes with words these are instructions of ninurta son of enlil o ninurta trustworthy farmer of enlil your praise is good father at beginning of poem is thereby revealed to be ninurta himself myth of slain heroes is alluded to in many texts but is never preserved in full in this myth ninurta must fight a variety of opponents black and green describe these opponents as bizarre minor deities they include six headed wild ram palm tree king and seven headed serpent some of these foes are inanimate objects such as boat which carries souls of dead to underworld and strong copper which represents a metal that was conceived as precious this story of successive trials and victories may have been source for greek legend of twelve labors of heracles later influence in antiquity thumb upright 1 1 nimrod 1832 by david scott nimrod great hunter mentioned in is believed by many scholars to be inspired by either ninurta himself or assyrian king tukulti ninurta i named after him in late seventh century bc kalhu was captured by foreign invaders ninurta like many other deities had become inextricably associated with assyrian empire which was widely hated for what were perceived as cruel policies as a result his statues were torn down and his temples was abandoned and never restored including his most famous one in kalhu despite this ninurta was never completely forgotten most scholars agree that ninurta was probably inspiration for biblical figure nimrod mentioned in as a mighty hunter though it is still not entirely clear how name ninurta became nimrod in hebrew two figures bear mostly same functions and attributes and ninurta is currently regarded as most plausible etymology for nimrod s name city of kalhu is specifically referenced in association with nimrod in where it is described as a great city eventually ruins of city of kalhu itself became known in arabic as because of its association with ninurta later in old testament in both and king sennacherib of assyria is reported to have been murdered by his sons and in temple of nisroch which is most likely a scribal error for nimrod this hypothetical error would result from hebrew letter m mem being replacing with s and letter d being replaced with kh kaf due to obvious visual similarities of letters involved and fact that no assyrian deity by name of nisroch has ever been attested most scholars consider this error to be most likely explanation for name if nisroch is ninurta this would make ninurta s temple at kalhu most likely location of sennacherib s murder other scholars have attempted to identify nisroch as assyrian god of fire hans rejects all suggested identifications as linguistically implausible although book of genesis itself portrays nimrod positively as first king after flood of noah and a builder of cities greek septuagint translation of hebrew bible refers to him as a giant and hebrew words meaning before yahweh as in opposition against god because of this nimrod became envisioned as archetypal idolator early works of jewish midrash described by first century ad philosopher philo in his quaestiones portrayed nimrod as instigator of building of tower of babel who persecuted jewish patriarch abraham for refusing to participate in project saint augustine of hippo refers to nimrod in his book city of god as a deceiver oppressor and destroyer of earth born creatures in modernity thumb upright 1 3 stone relief carving of an eagle headed genius from temple of ninurta at kalhu such depictions were widely but erroneously identified as ninurta in nineteenth century and were popularly known as nisrochs in sixteenth century nisroch became seen as a demon dutch demonologist johann weyer listed nisroch in his daemonum 1577 as chief cook of hell nisroch appears in book vi of john milton s epic poem paradise lost first published in 1667 as one of satan s demons nisroch who is described as frowning and wearing beaten armor calls into question satan s argument that fight between angels and demons is equal objecting that they as demons can feel pain which will break their morale according to milton scholar roy flannagan milton may have chosen to portray nisroch as timid because he had consulted hebrew dictionary of c stephanus which defined name nisroch as flight or delicate temptation in 1840s british archaeologist austen henry layard uncovered numerous stone carvings of winged eagle headed genii at kalhu remembering biblical story of sennacherib s murder layard mistakenly identified these figures as nisrochs such carvings continued to be known as nisrochs in popular literature throughout remaining portion of nineteenth century in edith nesbit s classic 1906 children s novel story of amulet child protagonists summon an eagle headed nisroch to guide them nisroch opens a portal and advises them walk forward without fear and asks is there aught else that servant of great name can do for those who speak that name some modern works on art history still repeat old misidentification but near eastern scholars now generally refer to nisroch figure as a griffin demon in 2016 during its brief conquest of region islamic state of iraq and levant isil demolished ashurnasirpal ii s ziggurat of ninurta at kalhu this act was in line with isil s longstanding policy of destroying any ancient ruins which it deemed incompatible with its militant interpretation of islam according to a statement from american schools of oriental research s cultural heritage initiatives isil may have destroyed
