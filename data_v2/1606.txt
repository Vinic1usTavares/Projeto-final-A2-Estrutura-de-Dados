installment of super smash bros was soon to be in development for its next console and would be a launch title with wi fi compatibility for online play announcement was a surprise to sakurai who left hal laboratory in 2003 he was not informed of nintendo s intent to release another smash bros game despite fact that iwata told sakurai shortly after his resignation from hal that if a new smash game was to be developed he would want sakurai to again serve as director it was not until after conference that iwata requested that sakurai hold a private meeting with him where he was asked to be involved as brawls director sakurai agreed to become director and development of game began in october 2005 when nintendo opened a new office in tokyo just for its production help from a variety of studios such as monolith soft and paon was enlisted with game arts as main team in preliminary development stages in addition several smash bros staff members that resided in area of new office joined project altogether roughly 100 individuals worked on project full time and were given access to all original material and tools from development of melee courtesy of hal laboratory game was absent from nintendo s wii showing at its 2006 pre e3 press conference nintendo officially revealed game under name of super smash bros brawl next day may 10 2006 along with game s first official trailer during e3 after hours press conference in an interview with ign sakurai said wii s motion sensing features might not be included because his team found that trying to implement too much motion sensory functionality can get in way of game as far as wi fi play is concerned sakurai stated his plan was to include wi fi connection compatibility from start he goes on to say one of primary reasons super smash bros brawl was created was that nintendo when taking wii online wanted to have smash bros to do that however sakurai stated on japanese version of smash bros website that there were hurdles of all sorts that made it very difficult to implement online battles furthermore he said that an online ranking system is unlikely to be implemented during a test play between sakurai and hideo kojima kojima stated that game felt complete and that nintendo could put it out now and it would sell millions of copies starting may 22 2007 and ending april 14 2008 game s official site had daily weekday updates revealing characters stages items music and more at nintendo media conference at e3 2007 nintendo of america president reggie fils aime announced that super smash bros brawl would be released on december 3 2007 in americas however just two months before its anticipated december release development team asked for more time to work on game during nintendo conference on october 10 2007 president iwata announced delay in order to fine tune smash bros with this unprecedented game depth we have decided that we have to take a little more time to complete game than we announced before we are sorry for fans that are already anxiously waiting for launch but we would like to launch this game on january 24 2008 in japan as for north american launch we will review that too and our local subsidiaries will make their own announcements on october 11 2007 george harrison of nintendo of america stated that super smash bros brawl would be released on february 10 2008 in north america on january 15 2008 game s release was delayed one week in japan to january 31 and nearly a month in americas to march 9 on april 24 2008 nintendo of europe confirmed that brawl would be released in europe on june 27 similarly nintendo australia announced on may 15 2008 that game would be released in that region on june 26 2008 technical issues super smash bros brawl uses a dual layer disc due to size of game data nintendo of america has stated that some wii consoles may have difficulty reading high density software due to a contaminated laser lens nintendo offered a free repair for owners who experienced this issue music sakurai revealed a list of 36 musicians providing musical arrangements for game on may 22 2007 he asked composers such as koji kondo yasunori mitsuda yoko shimomura and yuzo koshiro amongst many others to listen to an elite selection of nintendo music and arrange several of their favorite songs game s various stages have multiple musical tracks which players can listen to using new my music feature including some pieces taken directly from other games without any modification or special arrangements this feature allows player to select how often a piece gets played during a stage some of pieces need to be unlocked by collecting cds which are awarded via game s challenges mode or by spawning randomly while playing game s original music was composed by takahiro nishi shogo sakai masaaki iwasaki yutaka keigo ozaki and kentaro ishizaka while main theme was composed by former final fantasy series composer nobuo uematsu and arranged by sakai inclusion of characters sakurai originally stated that he did not want to emphasize japan only characters however reflecting upon marth and roy s inclusion in melee which led to international release of fire emblem series he became more interested in characters exclusive to japan only releases sakurai said that third party characters would amount to two at most aside from snake inclusion of konami created character solid snake may seem to conflict with super smash bros paradigm to only include characters from games made by nintendo and its second parties but sakurai said that metal gear creator hideo kojima practically begged for snake to be included in super smash bros melee which did not happen since game was too far into development this in turn led to his appearance in following game instead similarly now playable lucas from mother 3 was intended to be used in melee but was left out due to delay of mother 3 japanese fans were asked to submit their desired characters and musical themes via a forum on game s official japanese site for possible inclusion most requested third party character sega s sonic hedgehog was announced to be in brawl on october 10 2007 shigeru miyamoto wanted sonic to be included in melee but like snake could not be implemented because game was too far into development event occurs at 03 47 57 during brawl s development sakurai briefly considered adding miis as playable characters however due to concerns about miis lighter tone not with that of brawl or potential associations with bullying he ultimately decided against it miis would later be integrated into series as playable characters in super smash bros for nintendo 3ds and wii u reception super smash bros brawl has received universal acclaim and has been commercially successful worldwide in united

unpredictability of final smashes and dynamic fighting styles of characters chris slate of nintendo power awarded brawl a perfect score in march 2008 issue calling it one of very best games that nintendo has ever produced gamespot editor lark anderson noted that brawls simple controls and gameplay make it remarkably accessible to beginners yet still appealing to veterans while gametrailers mentioned amount of content that gives game staying power that few other games possess eurogamer praised game s ability to stay fun in both single player and multiplayer modes while fulfilling its usual role of dominating a willing crowd s evening into early hours and now allowing you to sustain that after everyone s gone home game revolution hailed brawls soundtrack as spectacular spanning a generous swath of gaming history game informer highlighted brawls finely tuned balance core fighting mechanics and local multiplayer modes edge concluded that while smash bros games have often been derided as button mashing brawl features one of most enduringly innovative and deep systems of any fighter ign editor matt casamassina however noted that although brawl is completely engrossing and wholly entertaining it suffers from long loading times and uninspired enemies and locales in subspace emissary adventure mode he also described graphics as an enhanced version of melee with backgrounds that lack detail in areas gamespy echoed this by equating quality of graphics to that of gamecube mitchell saltzman of gameworld network expressed disappointment at lack of stat tracking voice chat and a mostly lag free environment in online mode matthew castle points to franchise s lack of innovation with verdict smash bros risks growing too familiar it never breeds contempt but it doesn t quite muster that galaxy magic jeff gerstmann rated game 4 out of 5 stars on giant bomb saying that players who are not into nintendo s history or multiplayer probably won t understand what all fuss is about in first place 1up com however suggested that brawl is not directed exclusively towards serious gamers as it offers a curious diversion for uninterested gamers as well awards super

year awards 2008 game placed 15th in official nintendo magazine s 100 greatest nintendo games of all time brawl was ranked by nintendo power as fifth best game of 2000s released on a nintendo system modding brawl is unusually for a console game due to smash stack exploit found within game s built in stage builder when loading stages from an sd card rather than stage data a specialized program can be inserted onto sd card that renders builder unusable while present but allows loading of fan made patches from card on top of game s on disc data these patches range from simple character skins and balance adjustments to more complex modifications such as whole additional characters and extra stages more complex than internal stage builder allows project m in 2011 a team of competitive super smash bros players known collectively as project m back room began development on a mod of brawl titled project m project was designed to retool brawl to play more like its predecessor super smash
