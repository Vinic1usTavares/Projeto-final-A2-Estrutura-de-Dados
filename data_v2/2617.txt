cancer pagurus commonly known as edible crab or brown crab is a species of crab found in north sea north atlantic ocean and perhaps mediterranean sea it is a robust crab of a reddish brown colour having an oval carapace with a characteristic pie crust edge and black tips to claws a mature adult may have a carapace width up to and weigh up to c pagurus is a nocturnal predator targeting a range of molluscs and crustaceans it is subject of largest crab fishery in western europe centred on coasts of british isles with more than 60 000 tonnes caught annually description thumb right mouthparts and chelae of a female thumb left in carapace of c pagurus adults is a reddish brown colour while in young specimens it is purple brown it occasionally bears white patches and is shaped along front edge into nine rounded lobes resembling a pie crust males typically have a carapace long and females long although they may reach up to long in exceptional cases carapace width is typically or exceptionally up to a fold of carapace extends ventrally to constitute a branchial chamber where gills lie thumb right close up first pereiopod is modified into a strong claw bearing leg claw s fingers dactylus and propodus are black at tips other are covered with rows of short stiff setae dactylus of each is black towards tip and ends in a sharp point from front antennae and antennules are visible beside these orbits are where eyes are situated mouthparts comprise three pairs of maxillipeds behind which are a pair of maxillae a pair of and finally mandibles in common with most crabs abdomen is folded under thorax and shows clear sexual dimorphism in males it is comparatively narrow whereas in female it is wider lifecycle reproduction occurs in winter male stands over female and forms a cage with his legs protecting her while she moults internal fertilisation takes place before hardening of new carapace with aid of two abdominal appendages gonopods after mating female retreats to a pit on sea floor to lay her eggs between 250 000 and 3 000 000 fertilised eggs are held under female s abdomen up to eight months until they hatch thumb left a female edible crab with eggs on scrap first developmental stage after hatching is a planktonic larva 1 mm called zoea that develops into a megalopa and finally a juvenile first juvenile stage is characterised by a well developed abdomen which in time becomes reduced in size and folded under sternum juveniles settle to sea floor in intertidal zone where they stay until they reach a carapace width of and then migrate to deeper water growth rate in males slows from an increase in carapace width of 10 mm per year before it is 8 years old to 2 mm per year thereafter females grow at about half rate of males probably due to energetic demands of egg laying sexual maturity is reached at a carapace width of in females and in males longevity is typically 25 30 years although exceptional individuals may live up to 100 years distribution and ecology thumb right blue mussel mytilus edulis is a favourite food of c pagurus c pagurus is abundant throughout northeast atlantic as far as norway in north and north africa in south on mixed coarse grounds mud and sand from shallow to depths around it is frequently found inhabiting cracks and holes in rocks but occasionally also in open areas smaller specimens may be found under rocks in littoral zone unconfirmed reports suggest that c pagurus may also occur in mediterranean sea and black sea adults of c pagurus are nocturnal hiding buried in substrate during day but foraging at night up to from their hideouts their diet includes a variety of crustaceans including crabs carcinus maenas and porcelain crabs and pisidia longicornis and squat lobster galathea and molluscs including gastropods and and bivalves ensis mytilus edulis edule edulis and lutraria lutraria it may stalk or ambush motile prey and may dig large pits to reach buried molluscs main predator of c pagurus is octopus which even attacks them inside crab pots that fishermen use to trap them compared to other commercially important crab species relatively little is known about diseases of c pagurus its parasites include viruses such as white spot syndrome virus various bacteria that cause dark lesions on exoskeleton and like dinoflagellates that cause pink crab disease other microscopic pathogens include fungi microsporidians and ciliates c pagurus is also targeted by metazoan parasites including trematodes and parasitic barnacles a number of sessile animals occasionally settle as on exoskeleton of c pagurus including barnacles sea anemones serpulid polychaetes such as bryozoans and saddle oysters fishery thumb left crab pots lindisfarne north sea c pagurus is heavily exploited commercially throughout its range being most commercially important crab species in western europe crabs are caught using crab pots similar to lobster pots which are placed offshore and baited catch of c pagurus has increased steadily rising from 26 000 tonnes in 1978 to 60 000 t in 2007 of which more than 70 was caught around british isles fishery is widely dispersed around british and irish coasts and c pagurus is thought to be overfished across much of this area most of edible crabs caught by british fleet are exported live for sale in france and spain a number of legal restrictions apply to catching of c pagurus catching berried crabs females carrying eggs is illegal but since females remain in pits dug in sediment and do not feed fishing pressure does not affect supply of larvae minimum landing sizes for c pagurus are set by both european union technical regulations and by uk government different minimum sizes are employed in different geographical areas to reflect differences in crab s growth rate across its range in particular cromer crab fishery along coasts of suffolk norfolk and lincolnshire is subject to an mls of rather than mls in most of species range an intermediate value of is used in rest of north sea between and essex kent border and in irish sea south of around devon cornwall and isles of scilly mls for males is different from females norwegian catch is 8 500 tons annually compared to 20 000 tons in united kingdom 13 000 tons in ireland 8 500 tons in france and a total 45 000 tons globally recent studies have shown that edible crabs are negatively affected by electromagnetic fields emitted from sub sea power cables around offshore wind farms cookery thumb cooked claws of edible crab around one third of weight of an adult edible crab is meat of which one third is white meat from claws see of crabs and two thirds is brown meat from body as food male edible crabs are referred to as cocks and females as hens cocks have more sweet white meat hens have more rich brown meat dishes include crab meat arranged in cleaned shell sometimes with decoration of other foodstuffs soups such as or mousses and hot taxonomy and systematics according to rules of international code of zoological nomenclature cancer pagurus was first described by carl linnaeus in 1758 in tenth edition of his systema naturae which marks starting point of zoological nomenclature it was chosen to be type species of genus cancer by pierre andre latreille in 1810 specific epithet is a latin word deriving from ancient greek which alongside was used to refer to edible marine crabs neither classical term can be confidently assigned to a particular species although genus cancer formerly included most crabs it has since been restricted to eight species within that set of closely related species closest relative of c pagurus is jonah crab c borealis from east coast of north america references external links dressed crab recipe from bbc food
