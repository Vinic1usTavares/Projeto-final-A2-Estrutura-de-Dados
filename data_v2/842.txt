battle of karameh was a 15 hour military engagement between israel defense forces idf and combined forces of palestine liberation organization plo and jordanian armed forces in jordanian town of karameh on 21 march 1968 during war of attrition it was planned by israel as one of two concurrent raids on plo camps one in karameh and one in distant village of safi codenamed operation inferno and operation asuta mbts respectively but former turned into a full scale battle after jordan lost control of west bank to israel in 1967 palestinian fighters known as fedayeen moved their bases to jordan and stepped up their attacks on israel and israeli occupied territories taking border town of karameh as their headquarters idf claimed that purpose was to destroy fedayeen camps at karameh and to capture yasser arafat leader of plo as reprisal israel also wanted to punish jordan for its perceived support to fedayeen a large israeli force launched an attack on town on dawn of 21 march supported by fighter jets israel assumed jordanian army would choose to not get involved in battle but latter deployed heavy artillery fire while palestinian irregulars engaged in guerrilla warfare israelis

upsurge of support from arab countries to fedayeen in jordan palestinians had limited success in inflicting israeli casualties but king hussein allowed them to take credit after battle hussein proclaimed i think we may reach a position where we are all fedayeen however as plo s strength began to grow in aftermath fedayeen began to speak openly of overthrowing hashemite monarchy and ensuing tensions with jordanian authorities eventually precipitated in their expulsion to lebanon during events of black september in 1970 background palestinian groups used to initiate few attacks on israeli targets from both west bank and jordan before six day war some of which caused israel to retaliate which became known as reprisal operations following seizure of west bank from jordan in june 1967 six day war israel destroyed existing palestinian group fatah networks there in early 1968 however fatah guerrillas began raiding israel from bases on jordanian side of river most of these attacks were blocked by israel defense forces at times jordanian army infantry and artillery units gave fatah squads covering fire leading to frequent direct skirmishes between idf and jordanian army on 14 15 february jordanian mortars hit several israeli settlements in beit shean valley and jordan valley israeli artillery and air forces retaliated against jordanian bases and artillery batteries as well as american financed east ghor canal now known as king abdullah canal as a result thousands of jordanian farmers fled eastwards and fedayeen agents willing to sacrifice themselves for palestinian cause

53 and on a tactical level battle did indeed end in israel s favor operation exposed vulnerability of plo units deployed along jordan river and so they moved their concentrations up into mountains this imposed additional strains on them and made their operations into west bank even more involved and difficult than they had been hitherto politically however israel was heavily condemned by world opinion u s ambassador to un arthur goldberg said we believe that military counteractions such as those which have just taken place on a scale out of proportion to acts of violence that preceded it are greatly to be deplored us ambassador to israel walworth barbour said that in twenty years time a historian would write that day down as beginning of destruction of israel eban reported s statement to cabinet and menachem begin said such an utterance must not be cited in a cabinet meeting thumb right ruins of karameh following battle relatively high casualties were a considerable surprise for idf and was stunning to israelis although palestinians were not victorious on their own king hussein let palestinians take credit however battle of karameh provided fatah with a propaganda boost chief of bureau of then israeli foreign ministry gideon rafael later said that operation gave an enormous lift to yasser arafat s fatah organization and irrevocably implanted palestine problem onto international agenda no longer as a humanitarian issue of homeless refugees but as a claim to palestinian statehood uzi who commanded operation resigned as chief of central command for a position in jewish agency shortly after battle thumb right a jordanian soldier with abandoned israeli equipment jordan claimed to have won battle and stopped an israeli drive on balqa governorate in intentions of occupying it and turning into a security buffer zone which was supposed to serve as a punishment due to jordanian support to plo jordanians made this assumption as they saw size of raiding israeli forces entering battle arafat said what we have done is to make world realize that palestinian is no longer refugee number so and so but member of a people who hold reins of their own destiny and are in a position to determine their own future palestinians and arabs generally considered battle a psychological victory over idf which had been seen as invincible until then and recruitment to guerilla units soared a i arab nationalism in twentieth century from triumph to despair princeton university press 2003 p 258 fatah reported that 5 000 volunteers applied to join within 48 hours of battle by late march there were nearly 20 000 fedayeen in jordan iraq and syria offered training programs for several thousand guerrillas persian gulf states led by kuwait raised money for them through a 5 tax

pollack 2002 p 335 in which kingdom managed to expel palestinian groups to lebanon after they had started to gain control over jordan later united nations security council issued resolution 248 which condemned israeli raid on jordanian territory and violation of cease fire line it recalled on resolutions 237 which had encouraged israel to ensure safety of civilians in military areas resolution affirmed that reprisals were not to be tolerated and that repetitions of such violations would have forced security council to take further steps battle was first engagement between israelis and palestinians in which latter used suicide bombers files released by idf in 2011 contradict official israeli narrative which claimed that operation was carried out in retaliation for bus incident files revealed that idf began planning two operations in 1967 one year before bus incident they also revealed that idf had practiced crossing jordan river in 1966 while jordan still controlled west bank historiography israeli historiography israel maintains that it had performed a coordinated withdrawal after achieving its goal of destroying karameh camp however few israeli military personnel who participated in karameh agree according to lt col arik regev chief of central command s operations branch moshe a sergeant in israeli armored corps later talked about his participation in karameh

of jordan river including balqa governorate to create a situation similar to golan heights which israel had captured just 10 months prior to be used a bargaining chip jordanians claim that moshe dayan
