cumberland island horses are a band of feral horses living on cumberland island in state of georgia popular myth holds that horses arrived on island sometime in 16th century with arrival of spanish conquistadors however it is unlikely that any horses left by spanish survived and more likely current population descends from horses brought to island in 18th century by english cumberland island became part of cumberland island national seashore in 1972 when national park service nps took over its management these horses are similar to bands of horses living on islands of chincoteague and assateague there is estimated to be a population of between 150 and 200 horses on island horses on cumberland island have a relatively short life expectancy due to pest infestations disease and their rugged environment in 2000 a behavioral study found that instability marks bands with large numbers of co dominant stallions early dispersal of juveniles and frequent band changing among mares herd has been studied periodically since late 1980s with researchers recommending various management strategies depending on focus of their study current herd levels have been shown to have a negative effect on their environment and researchers focused on environmental issues recommend a severe reduction in herd numbers other researchers looking at genetic variability state that a herd size nearly as large as current is necessary to prevent inbreeding but also state herd is not genetically unique enough to warrant special preservation national park service has no current management plan for horses and their one effort to create one was blocked by jack kingston a georgia member of us house of representatives history thumb left a cumberland foal horses are not native to cumberland island popular myth states they were brought to island by spanish in 16th century however it is believed that these first horses more than likely did not survive due to lack of visits made by spanish and local native americans on island finding them of little practical use in 18th century english began settling cumberland island horses seen there today are most likely descendants of horses brought by these settlers as this is when a large majority of horses began to roam freely and revert to their natural state becoming feral during 19th century efforts were made to capture and make use of horses first attempts were made by island plantation owner robert stafford who allowed visitors to purchase and capture horses which stafford called marsh for their own personal use horses were next used as cavalry animals during american civil war after war records suggest that people from jekyll island captured some of horses for horse meat around 1881 thomas m carnegie bought two plantations on island and introduced tennessee walking horses paso finos and arabians into feral horse population in an attempt to improve animals carnegie received a small amount of income from buying and selling of these animals later many island residents began introducing additional breeds into herds on island further diversifying bands of horses in 1921 a large number of horses were brought onto island from globe arizona all of which had been running wild on western rangeland national park service nps acquired island in 1972 and declared it cumberland island national seashore since then few new horses have been introduced to island though four arabians were introduced in early 1990s in hopes of diversifying and bettering existing population since 1981 nps has been monitoring horses and tracking their impact on environment in 1991 an outbreak of eastern equine encephalitis killed about 40 horses or approximately 18 of herd population on cumberland island is one of seven feral horse herds on us barrier islands characteristics a 2009 resource assessment of cumberland island national seashore by national parks conservation association npca estimated that there were approximately 200 feral horses on cumberland island as of 2010 121 horses were counted on island during yearly census censuses conducted between 2000 and 2010 have counted between 120 and 154 horses not all horses are counted during census and park management estimates that approximately 50 horses are missed in counts each year bringing 2010 total to around 170 horses life span of horses on cumberland island is approximately half that of their ancestors due to infestations of parasites and disease they also suffer from digestive issues linked to ingestion of a great amount of sand which causes intestinal blockages and abdominal a study published in 2000 by researchers from university of georgia and us fish and wildlife service looked at data collected between 1986 and 1990 in an effort to better understand herd dynamics of cumberland island herd study found that band instability was high with mares not generally forming close relationships with each other and commonly switching which stallion they banded with and juveniles dispersing quickly researchers attributed this to a lack of territory with bands frequently inhabiting overlapping areas along with a high number of bachelor stallions those without mares they also saw a high number of co dominant stallions where two or more stallions would lead a band together and alternate breeding of band s mares foals born on cumberland island were less likely to survive than comparable foals in western feral herds with survival rates of 58 8 61 1 and 80 respectively this was found to be especially true in animals born after 1 june which was attributed to higher temperatures higher insect levels and reduced food availability number of horses in cumberland bands was comparable to western bands and those on some eastern islands however assateague and shackleford banks horses tended to have larger bands with an average of 8 1 and 12 3 horses per band respectively controversy and management an initial study published in 1988 by a researcher from oak ridge national laboratory demonstrated then current population of 180 horses was over grazing island researcher recommended reducing herd size to between 49 and 73 animals which she contended was maximum size that island could support without environmental damage study showed that horses were significantly reducing plant stocks on island and reducing future plant production due to trampling a 1991 study of genetic variation in feral horse herds on eastern us barrier islands was conducted by researchers from university of georgia and university of kentucky study concluded that a herd of 122 was minimum size necessary to prevent inbreeding researchers noted that they were looking at herd size solely as it related to genetic variation and did not take environmental damage into consideration in addition it was found that due to large amount of introduced blood from outside horses cumberland island horses were not genetically unique due to this and ongoing environmental damage it was concluded that horses met neither genetic nor environmental requirements for feral horses on public lands and that herd should be reduced or removed completely researchers conceded however that their analysis did not take local historical and cultural elements into consideration only environmental and genetic thumb right cumberland horses among vegetation on island in 1995 nps began process of developing a management plan for cumberland island horse after compiling information they released a draft environmental assessment in early 1996 and began taking public comment on a potential management plan public opinion was severely divided with environmentalists approving of management plan which would have likely resulted in reduction or removal of herd and animal rights activists and island residents protesting plan however before a plan could be implemented us representative jack kingston included a provision in a federal appropriations bill that prevented any management of horses kingston made change to bill after touring island but without consultation with nps he initially claimed that he personally did not see significant damage to island from horses and that herd size had decreased however upon later questioning he refused to expand upon his observations of damage to island provision expired in 1997 but effectively halted momentum toward a park management plan study published in 2000 recommended a management strategy that reduced herd populations to environmentally recommended sizes through a combination of off island adoption to private owners and contraceptives researchers recommended that contraceptive use be focused on female members of herd due to high numbers of bachelor stallions in 2009 a study was conducted by warnell school of forestry and natural resources at university of georgia to determine public opinion on management of feral livestock horses and pigs on island researchers found that 68 of visitors believed horses were damaging habitat of island there was no consensus on a solution to problem majority of visitors tended to prefer non lethal methods of managing population as opposed to non management or complete eradication at that time park management felt that although horses were popular with tourists they were also destructive to beach ecosystems including an increase in erosion where horses had eaten grasses that previously held sand in place 2009 npca report emphasized negative impact that horses were having on island environment and endorsed study findings that between 50 and 70 animals would be an appropriate population for island however report also noted management challenges resulting from public and political appeal for animals but stated that a management plan is necessary potential solutions offered by npca included eradicating herd confining a reduced herd to a portion of island and using contraceptives to reduce herd numbers as of april 2014 there was no management plan published by nps which considers herd feral free ranging and unmanaged see also carolina marsh tacky colonial spanish horse florida cracker horse banker horse references category horse
