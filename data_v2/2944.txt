upright thumb an hourglass keeping track of elapsed time hourglass was one of earlier timekeeping devices and has become a symbol of concept of time for thousands of years devices have been used to measure and keep track of time current sexagesimal system of time measurement dates to approximately 2000 from sumerians egyptians divided day into two 12 hour periods and used large obelisks to track movement of sun they also developed water clocks which were probably first used in precinct of amun re and later outside egypt as well they were employed frequently by persians and ancient greeks who called them clepsydrae zhou dynasty is believed to have used outflow water clock around same of time devices which were introduced from mesopotamia as early as 2000 other ancient timekeeping devices include candle clock used in ancient china ancient japan england and mesopotamia widely used in persia india and tibet as well as some parts of europe and hourglass which functioned similarly to a water clock sundial another early clock relies on shadows to provide a good estimate of hour on a sunny day it is not so useful in cloudy weather or at night and requires recalibration as seasons change if gnomon was not aligned with earth s axis earliest known clock with a water powered escapement mechanism which transferred rotational energy into intermittent motions david landes revolution in time clocks and making of modern world rev and enlarged edition harvard university press cambridge 2000 p 18f dates back to 3rd century in ancient greece chinese engineers later invented clocks incorporating mercury powered escapement mechanisms in 10th century followed by arabic engineers inventing water clocks driven by gears and weights in 11th century first mechanical clocks employing verge escapement mechanism with a foliot or balance wheel timekeeper were invented in europe at around start of 14th century and became standard timekeeping device until pendulum clock was invented in 1656 invention of mainspring in early 15th century allowed portable clocks to be built evolving into first pocketwatches by 17th century but these were not very accurate until balance spring was added to balance wheel in mid 17th century pendulum clock remained most accurate timekeeper until 1930s when quartz oscillators were invented followed by atomic clocks after world war ii although initially limited to laboratories development of microelectronics in 1960s made quartz clocks both compact and cheap to produce and by 1980s they became world s dominant timekeeping technology in both clocks and wristwatches atomic clocks are far more accurate than any previous timekeeping device and are used to calibrate other clocks and to calculate international atomic time a standardized civil system coordinated universal time is based on atomic time timekeeping devices of early civilizations thumb right sun rising over stonehenge on june solstice many ancient civilizations observed astronomical bodies often sun and moon to determine times dates and seasons p 1 first calendars may have been created during last glacial period by hunter gatherers who employed tools such as sticks and bones to track phases of moon or seasons stone circles such as england s stonehenge were built in various parts of world especially in prehistoric europe and are thought to have been used to time and predict seasonal and annual events such as equinoxes or solstices as those megalithic civilizations left no recorded history little is known of their calendars or timekeeping methods richards p 55 methods of sexagesimal timekeeping now common in both western and eastern societies are first attested nearly 4 000 years ago in mesopotamia and egypt barnett p 102 mesoamericans similarly modified their usual vigesimal counting system when dealing with calendars to produce a 360 day year p 136 ancient egypt thumbnail ancient egyptian sundial c 1500 bc from valley of kings daytime divided into 12 parts oldest known sundial is from egypt it dates back to around 1500 bc 19th dynasty and was discovered in valley of kings in 2013 one of world s oldest sundials dug up in kings valley upper egypt sundials have their origin in shadow clocks which were first devices used for measuring parts of a day major p 9 ancient egyptian obelisks constructed about 3500 bc are also among earliest shadow clocks thumb left upright luxor obelisk in place de la concorde paris france egyptian shadow clocks divided daytime into 12 parts with each part further divided into more precise parts one type of shadow clock consisted of a long stem with five variable marks and an elevated crossbar which cast a shadow over those marks it was positioned eastward in morning so that rising sun cast a shadow over marks and was turned west at noon to catch afternoon shadows obelisks functioned in much same manner shadow cast on markers around it allowed egyptians to calculate time obelisk also indicated whether it was morning or afternoon as well as summer and winter solstices a third shadow clock developed c 1500 bc was similar in shape to a bent t square it measured passage of time by shadow cast by its crossbar on a non linear rule t was oriented eastward in mornings and turned around at noon so that it could cast its shadow in opposite direction barnett p 18 although accurate shadow clocks relied on sun and so were useless at night and in cloudy weather egyptians therefore developed a number of alternative timekeeping instruments including water clocks and a system for tracking star movements oldest description of a water clock is from tomb inscription of 16th century bc egyptian court official amenemhet identifying him as its inventor p 118 there were several types of water clocks some more elaborate than others one type consisted of a bowl with small holes in its bottom which was floated on water and allowed to fill at a near constant rate markings on side of bowl indicated elapsed time as surface of water reached them oldest known waterclock was found in tomb of pharaoh amenhotep i 1525 1504 bc suggesting that they were first used in ancient egypt philbin p pp 59 61 another egyptian method of determining time during night was using plumb lines called merkhets in use since at least 600 bc two of these instruments were aligned with polaris north pole star to create a north south meridian time was accurately measured by observing certain stars as they crossed line created with merkhets p 28 ancient greece and rome thumb upright ctesibius s clepsydra from 3rd century clepsydra literally water thief is greek word for water clock water clocks or clepsydrae were commonly used in ancient greece following their introduction by plato who also invented a water based alarm clock one account of plato s alarm clock describes it as depending on nightly overflow of a vessel containing lead balls which floated in a columnar vat vat held a steadily increasing amount of water supplied by a cistern by morning vessel would have floated high enough to tip over causing lead balls to cascade onto a copper platter resultant clangor would then awaken plato s students at academy barnett p 28 another possibility is that it comprised two jars connected by a siphon water emptied until it reached siphon which transported water to other jar there rising water would force air through a whistle sounding an alarm greeks and chaldeans regularly maintained timekeeping records as an essential part of their astronomical observations greek astronomer andronicus of cyrrhus supervised construction of tower of winds in athens in 1st century thumb upright tower of winds in athens greece a 1st century bc clocktower from period of roman greece in greek tradition clepsydrae were used in court later romans adopted this practice as well there are several mentions of this in historical records and literature of era for example in theaetetus plato says that those men on other hand always speak in haste for flowing water urges them on another mention occurs in lucius apuleius golden ass clerk of court began bawling again this time summoning chief witness for prosecution to appear up stepped an old man whom i did not know he was invited to speak for as long as there was water in clock this was a hollow globe into which water was poured through a funnel in neck and from which it gradually escaped through fine perforations at base clock in apuleius s account was one of several types of water clock used another consisted of a bowl with a hole in its centre which was floated on water time was kept by observing how long bowl took to fill with water although clepsydrae were more useful than sundials they could be used indoors during night and also when sky was cloudy they were not as accurate greeks therefore sought a way to improve their water clocks although still not as accurate as sundials greek water clocks became more accurate around 325 and they were adapted to have a face with an hour hand making reading of clock more precise and convenient one of more common problems in most types of clepsydrae was caused by water pressure when container holding water was full increased pressure caused water to flow more rapidly this problem was addressed by greek and roman horologists beginning in 100 and improvements continued to be made in following centuries to counteract increased water flow clock s water containers usually bowls or jugs were given a conical shape positioned with wide end up a greater amount of water had to flow out in order to drop same distance as when water was lower in cone along with this improvement clocks were constructed more elegantly in this period with hours marked by gongs doors opening to miniature figurines bells or moving mechanisms there were some remaining problems however which were never solved such as effect of temperature water flows more slowly when cold or may even freeze between 270 and 500 hellenistic ctesibius hero of alexandria archimedes and roman horologists and astronomers began developing more elaborate mechanized water clocks added complexity was aimed at regulating flow and at providing fancier displays of passage of time for example some water clocks rang bells and gongs while others opened doors and windows to show figurines of people or moved pointers and dials some even displayed astrological models of universe although greeks and romans did much to advance water clock technology they still continued to use shadow clocks mathematician and astronomer theodosius of bithynia for example is said to have invented a universal sundial that was accurate anywhere on earth though little is known about it others wrote of sundial in mathematics and literature of period marcus vitruvius pollio roman author of de architectura wrote on mathematics of or sundial blades during reign of emperor augustus romans constructed largest sundial ever built solarium augusti its gnomon was an obelisk from heliopolis similarly obelisk from campus martius was used as gnomon for augustus s zodiacal sundial pliny elder records that first sundial in rome arrived in 264 looted from catania sicily according to him it gave incorrect time until markings and angle appropriate for rome s latitude were used a century later barnett p 21 ancient and medieval persia thumb ancient persian clock thumb ancient persian clock thumb reconstruction of scene of a water clock manager iran according to callisthenes persians were using water clocks in 328 to ensure a just and exact distribution of water from to their shareholders for agricultural irrigation use of water clocks in iran especially in zeebad dates back to 500 later they were also used to determine exact holy days of pre islamic religions such as nowruz or shortest longest and equal length days and nights of years water clocks used in iran were one of most practical ancient tools for timing yearly calendar conference of qanat in iran water clock in persia 1383 in persian water clocks or fenjaan in persia reached a level of accuracy comparable to today s standards of timekeeping fenjaan was most accurate and commonly used timekeeping device for calculating amount or time that a farmer must take water from a qanat or well for irrigation of farms until it was replaced by more accurate current clock persian water clocks were a practical and useful tool for qanat s shareholders to calculate length of time they could divert water to their farm qanat was only water source for agriculture and irrigation so a just and fair water distribution was very important therefore a very fair and clever old person was elected to be manager of water clock and at least two full time managers were needed to control and observe number of and announce exact time during days and nights br s t aby news in persian fenjaan was a big pot full of water and a bowl with small hole in center when bowl become full of water it would sink into pot and manager would empty bowl and again put it on top of water in pot he would record number of times bowl sank by putting small stones into a jar place where clock was situated and its managers were collectively known as fenjaan usually this would be top floor of a public house with west and east facing windows to show time of sunset and sunrise there was also another time keeping tool named a or astrolabe but it was mostly used for superstitious beliefs and was not practical for use as a farmers calendar zeebad water clock was in use until 1965 when it was substituted by modern clocks ancient and medieval china joseph needham speculated that introduction of outflow clepsydra to china perhaps from mesopotamia occurred as far back as 2nd millennium during shang dynasty and at latest by 1st millennium by beginning of han dynasty in 202 outflow clepsydra was gradually replaced by inflow clepsydra which featured an indicator rod on a float to compensate for falling pressure head in reservoir which slowed timekeeping as vessel filled zhang heng added an extra tank between reservoir and inflow vessel around 550 ad yin gui was first in china to write of overflow or constant level tank added to series which was later described in detail by inventor shen kuo around 610 this design was trumped by two sui dynasty inventors geng xun and yuwen kai who were first to create balance clepsydra with standard positions for steelyard balance joseph needham states that timekeeping innovations in medieval and pre modern periods term clock encompasses a wide spectrum of devices ranging from wristwatches to clock of long now english word clock is said to derive from middle english old north french or middle dutch all of which mean bell and are derived from medieval latin also meaning bell indeed bells were used to mark passage of time they marked passage of hours at sea and in abbeys throughout history clocks have had a variety of power sources including gravity springs and electricity mechanical clocks became widespread in 14th century when they were used in medieval monasteries to keep regulated schedule of prayers clock continued to be improved with first pendulum clock being designed and built in 17th century candle clocks thumb right a candle clock earliest mention of candle clocks comes from a chinese poem written in 520 by you according to poem graduated candle was a means of determining time at night similar candles were used in japan until early 10th century candle clock most commonly mentioned and written of is attributed to king alfred great it consisted of six candles made from 72 of wax each high and of uniform thickness marked every inch 2 54 cm as these candles burned for about four hours each mark represented 20 minutes once lit candles were placed in wooden framed glass boxes to prevent flame from extinguishing most sophisticated candle clocks of their time were those of al jazari in 1206 one of his candle clocks included a dial to display time and for first time employed a bayonet fitting a fastening mechanism still used in modern times donald routledge hill described al jazari s candle clocks as follows thumb left upright an oil lamp clock a variation on this theme were oil lamp clocks these early timekeeping devices consisted of a graduated glass reservoir to hold oil usually whale oil which burned cleanly and evenly supplying fuel for a built in lamp as level in reservoir dropped it provided a rough measure of passage of time incense clocks in addition to water mechanical and candle clocks incense clocks were used in far east and were fashioned in several different forms richards p 52 incense clocks were first used in china around 6th century in japan one still exists in shosoin although its characters are not chinese but devanagari due to their frequent use of devanagari characters suggestive of their use in buddhist ceremonies edward h schafer speculated that incense clocks were invented in india although similar to candle clock incense clocks burned evenly and without a flame therefore they were more accurate and safer for indoor use several types of incense clock have been found most common forms include incense stick and incense seal an incense stick clock was an incense stick with calibrations most were elaborate sometimes having threads with weights attached at even intervals weights would drop onto a platter or gong below signifying that a certain amount of time had elapsed some incense clocks were held in elegant trays open bottomed trays were also used to allow weights to be used together with decorative tray levy p 18 sticks of incense with different scents were also used so that hours were marked by a change in fragrance richards p 130 incense sticks could be straight or spiraled spiraled ones were longer and were therefore intended for long periods of use and often hung from roofs of homes and temples in japan a geisha was paid for number of incense sticks that had been consumed while she was present a practice which continued until 1924 incense seal clocks were used for similar occasions and events as stick clock while religious purposes were of primary importance these clocks were also popular at social gatherings and were used by chinese scholars and intellectuals bedini pp 103 104 seal was a wooden or stone disk with one or more grooves etched in it into which incense was placed fraser p 52 these clocks were common in china but were produced in fewer numbers in japan to signal passage of a specific amount of time small pieces of fragrant woods resins or different scented could be placed on incense powder trails different powdered incense clocks used different formulations of incense depending on how clock was laid out length of trail of incense directly related to size of seal was primary factor in determining how long clock would last all burned for long periods of time ranging between 12 hours and a month bedini p p 56 while early incense seals were made of wood or stone chinese gradually introduced disks made of metal most likely beginning during song dynasty this allowed craftsmen to more easily create both large and small seals as well as design and decorate them more aesthetically another advantage was ability to vary paths of grooves to allow for changing length of days in year as smaller seals became more readily available clocks grew in popularity among chinese and were often given as gifts bedini pp 104 106 incense seal clocks are often sought by modern day clock collectors however few remain that have not already been purchased or been placed on display at museums or temples bedini p 187 sundials thumb a 20th century sundial in seville andalusia spain sundials had been used for timekeeping since ancient egypt ancient dials were based with straight hour lines that indicated unequal hours also called temporary hours that varied with seasons every day was divided into 12 equal segments regardless of time of year thus hours were shorter in winter and longer in summer sundial was further developed by muslim astronomers idea of using hours of equal length throughout year was innovation of abu l hasan ibn al shatir in 1371 based on earlier developments in trigonometry by muhammad ibn jabir al al battani ibn al shatir was aware that using a gnomon that is parallel to earth s axis will produce sundials whose hour lines indicate equal hours on any day of year his sundial is oldest polar axis sundial still in existence concept appeared in western sundials starting in 1446 following acceptance of heliocentrism and equal hours as well as advances in trigonometry sundials appeared in their present form during renaissance when they were built in large numbers in 1524 french astronomer oronce fine constructed an ivory sundial which still exists later in 1570 italian astronomer giovanni padovani published a treatise including instructions for manufacture and laying out of mural vertical and horizontal sundials similarly giuseppe s ad c 1620 discusses how to construct sundials hourglass since hourglass was one of few reliable methods of measuring time at sea it is speculated that it was used on board ships as far back as 11th century when it would have complemented magnetic compass as an aid to navigation however earliest unambiguous evidence of their use appears in painting allegory of good government by ambrogio from 1338 p 83 from 15th century onwards hourglasses were used in a wide range of applications at sea in churches in industry and in cooking they were first dependable reusable reasonably accurate and easily constructed time measurement devices hourglass also took on symbolic meanings such as that of death temperance opportunity and father time usually represented as a bearded old man portuguese navigator ferdinand magellan used 18 hourglasses on each ship during his circumnavigation of globe in 1522 though also used in china hourglass s history there is unknown but does not seem to have been used in china before mid 16th century see notes fig 995 plate in science and civilization in china volume 4 part 3 joseph needham 1971 cambridge university press library of congress catalogue card number 54 and hourglass implies use of glassblowing which appears to be an

driven escapement was described by greek engineer philo of byzantium fl 3rd century in his technical treatise chapter 31 where he likens escapement mechanism of a automaton with those as employed in water clocks another early clock to use escapements was built during 7th century in chang an by tantric monk and mathematician yi xing and government official liang lingzan an astronomical instrument that served as a clock it was discussed in a contemporary text as follows it was made in image of round heavens and on it were shown lunar mansions in their order equator and degrees of heavenly circumference water flowing into scoops turned a wheel automatically rotating it one complete revolution in one day and night besides this there were two rings fitted around celestial sphere outside having sun and moon threaded on them and these were made to move in circling orbit and they made a wooden casing surface of which represented horizon since instrument was half sunk in it it permitted exact determinations of time of dawns and dusks full and new moons and hurrying moreover there were two wooden jacks standing on horizon surface having one a bell and other a drum in front of it bell being struck automatically to indicate hours and drum being beaten automatically to indicate quarters all these motions were brought about by machinery within casing each depending on wheels and shafts hooks pins and interlocking rods stopping devices and locks checking mutually thumb left upright original diagram of su song s book showing inner workings of his clock tower since yi xing s clock was a water clock it was affected by temperature variations that problem was solved in 976 by zhang sixun by replacing water with mercury which remains liquid down to zhang implemented changes into his clock tower which was about tall with escapements to keep clock turning and bells to signal every quarter hour another noteworthy clock elaborate cosmic engine was built by su song in 1088 it was about size of zhang s tower but had an automatically rotating armillary sphere also called a celestial globe from which positions of stars could be observed it also featured five panels with mannequins ringing gongs or bells and tablets showing time of day or other special times furthermore it featured first known endless power transmitting chain drive in horology originally built in capital of kaifeng it was dismantled by jin army and sent to capital of yanjing now beijing where they were unable to put it back together as a result su song s son su xie was ordered to build a replica thumb drawing of jayrun water clock in damascus from treatise on construction of clocks and their use 1203 clock towers built by zhang sixun and su song in 10th and 11th centuries respectively

syria which struck once every hour it was constructed by muhammad al sa ati in 12th century and later described by his son ridwan ibn al sa ati in his on construction of clocks and their use 1203 when repairing clock in 1235 an early monumental water powered alarm clock that announced appointed hours of prayer and time both by day and by night was completed in entrance hall of madrasah in baghdad first geared clock was invented in 11th century by arab engineer ibn khalaf al muradi in islamic iberia it was a water clock that employed a complex gear train mechanism including both segmental and gearing capable of transmitting high torque clock was unrivalled in its use of sophisticated complex gearing until mechanical clocks of mid 14th century al muradi s clock also employed use of mercury in its hydraulic linkages which could function mechanical automata al muradi s work was known to scholars working under alfonso x of castile hence mechanism may have played a role in development of european mechanical clocks other monumental water clocks constructed by medieval muslim engineers also employed complex gear trains and arrays of automata like earlier greeks and chinese arab

observatories during 11th century in song dynasty chinese astronomer horologist and mechanical engineer su song created a water driven astronomical clock for his clock tower of kaifeng city it incorporated an escapement mechanism as well as earliest known endless power transmitting chain drive which drove armillary sphere contemporary muslim astronomers also constructed a variety of highly accurate astronomical clocks for use in their mosques and observatories such as water powered astronomical clock by al jazari in 1206 and clock by ibn al shatir in early 14th century most sophisticated timekeeping astrolabes were geared astrolabe mechanisms designed by abu rayhan biruni in 11th century and by muhammad ibn abi bakr in 13th century these devices functioned as timekeeping devices and also as calendars thumb upright castle clock by al jazari 14th century illustration a sophisticated water powered astronomical clock was built by al jazari in 1206 this castle clock was a

production of very earliest watches in 16th century elizabeth i of england received a wristwatch from robert dudley in 1571 described as an arm watch from beginning wrist watches were almost exclusively worn by women while men used pocket watches up until early 20th century this was not just a matter of fashion or prejudice watches of time were notoriously prone to fouling from exposure to elements and could only reliably be kept safe from harm if carried securely in pocket when waistcoat was introduced as a manly fashion at court of charles ii in 17th century pocket watch was tucked into its pocket prince albert consort to queen victoria introduced albert chain accessory designed to secure pocket watch to man s by way of a clip by mid nineteenth century most watchmakers produced a range of wristwatches often marketed as bracelets for women wristwatches were first worn by military men towards end of nineteenth century when importance of synchronizing manoeuvres during war without potentially revealing plan to enemy through signalling was increasingly recognized it was clear that using pocket watches while in heat of battle or while mounted on a horse was impractical so officers began to strap watches to their wrist company of london patented a watch wristlet design in 1893 although they were probably producing similar designs from 1880s clearly a market for men s wristwatches was coming into being at time officers in british army began using wristwatches during colonial military campaigns in 1880s such as during anglo burma war of 1885 during boer war importance of coordinating troop movements and synchronizing attacks against highly mobile boer insurgents was paramount and use of wristwatches subsequently became widespread among officer class

company in 1946 wilsdorf was an early convert to wristwatch and contracted swiss firm to produce a line of wristwatches his rolex wristwatch of 1910 became first such watch to receive certification as a chronometer in switzerland and it went on to win an award in 1914 from kew observatory in richmond west london impact of first world war dramatically shifted public perceptions on propriety of man s wristwatch and opened up a mass market in post war era creeping barrage artillery tactic developed during war required precise synchronization between artillery gunners and infantry advancing behind barrage service watches produced during war were specially designed for rigours of trench warfare with luminous dials and unbreakable glass wristwatches were also found to be needed in air as much as on ground military pilots found them more convenient than pocket watches for same reasons as santos dumont had british war department began issuing wristwatches to combatants from 1917 thumb a wristwatch from 1920s left company h williamson ltd based in coventry was one of first to capitalize on this opportunity during company s 1916 agm it was noted that public is buying practical things of life nobody can truthfully contend that watch is a luxury it is said that one soldier in every four wears a wristlet watch and other three mean to get one as soon as they can by end of war almost all enlisted men wore a wristwatch and after they were demobilized fashion soon caught on british horological journal wrote in 1917 that wristlet watch was little used by sterner sex before war but now is seen on wrist of nearly every man in uniform and of many men in civilian attire within a decade sales of wristwatches had outstripped those of pocket watches equation clock in late 17th and 18th centuries equation clocks were made which allowed user to see or calculate apparent solar time as would be shown by a sundial before invention of pendulum clock sundials were only accurate timepieces when good clocks became available they appeared inaccurate to people who were used to trusting sundials annual variation of equation of time made a clock up to about 15 minutes fast or slow relative to a sundial depending on time of year equation clocks satisfied demand for clocks that always agreed with sundials several types of equation clock mechanism were devised which can be seen in surviving examples mostly in museums era of precision timekeeping thumb right 180px dutch polymath and horologist christiaan huygens originator of era of precision timekeeping macey samuel l ed

simon alan 2007 tales of mathematicians and physicists p 79 pendulum clock innovations to mechanical clock continued with miniaturization leading to domestic clocks in 15th century and personal watches in 16th in 1580s italian polymath galileo galilei investigated regular swing of pendulum and discovered that it could be used to regulate a clock although galileo studied pendulum as early as 1582 he never actually constructed a clock based on that design first pendulum clock was designed and built by dutch scientist christiaan huygens in 1656 early versions erred by less than one minute per day and later ones only by 10 seconds very accurate for their time in england manufacturing of pendulum clocks was soon taken up longcase clock also known as grandfather clock was first created to house pendulum and works by english clockmaker william clement in 1670 or 1671 this became feasible after clement invented anchor escapement mechanism in about 1670 before then pendulum clocks used older verge escapement mechanism which required very wide pendulum swings of about 100deg to avoid need for a very large case most clocks using verge escapement had a short pendulum anchor mechanism however reduced pendulum s necessary swing to between 4deg to 6deg allowing clockmakers to use longer pendulums with consequently slower beats these required less power to move caused less friction and wear and were more accurate than their shorter predecessors most longcase clocks use a pendulum about a metre 39 inches long to center of bob with each swing taking one second this requirement for height along with need for a long drop space for weights that power clock gave rise to tall narrow case clement also introduced pendulum suspension spring in 1671 concentric minute hand was added to clock by daniel quare a london clock maker and second hand was introduced jesuits were another major contributor to development of pendulum clocks in 17th and 18th centuries having had an unusually keen appreciation of importance of precision woods pp 100 p 103 in measuring an accurate one second pendulum for example italian astronomer father giovanni battista riccioli persuaded nine fellow jesuits to count nearly 87 000 oscillations in a single day they served a crucial role in spreading and testing scientific ideas of period and collaborated with contemporary scientists such as huygens

watch movement from its invention in 1675 by huygens spiral hairspring balance spring system for portable timekeepers is still used in mechanical watchmaking industry today like pendulum clocks spiral hairspring watches were early precision timekeeping devices invention of mainspring in early 15th century allowed portable clocks to be built evolving into first pocketwatches by 17th century but these were not very accurate until balance spring was added to balance wheel in mid 17th century some dispute remains as to whether british scientist robert hooke his was a straight spring or dutch scientist christiaan huygens was actual inventor of balance spring huygens was clearly first to use a spiral balance spring form used in virtually all watches to present day addition of balance spring made balance wheel a harmonic oscillator like pendulum in a pendulum clock which oscillated at a fixed resonant frequency and resisted oscillating at other rates this innovation increased watches accuracy enormously reducing error from perhaps several hours per day to perhaps 10 minutes per day resulting in addition of minute hand to watch face around 1680 in britain and 1700 in france like invention of pendulum clock huygens spiral hairspring balance spring system of portable timekeepers helped lay foundations for modern watchmaking industry application of spiral balance spring for watches ushered in a new era of accuracy for portable timekeepers similar to that which pendulum had introduced for clocks from its invention in 1675 by christiaan huygens spiral hairspring balance spring system for portable timekeepers still used in mechanical watchmaking industry today pocket watch in 1675 huygens and robert hooke invented spiral balance or hairspring designed to control oscillating speed of balance wheel this crucial advance finally made accurate pocket watches possible this resulted in a great advance in accuracy of pocket watches from perhaps several hours per day to 10 minutes per day similar to effect of pendulum upon mechanical clocks great english clockmaker thomas tompion was one of first to use this mechanism successfully in his pocket watches and he adopted minute hand which after a variety of designs were trialled eventually stabilised into modern day configuration rev edward barlow invented rack and snail striking mechanism for striking clocks which was a great improvement over previous mechanism repeating clock that chimes number of hours or even minutes was invented by either quare or barlow in 1676 george graham invented deadbeat escapement for clocks in 1720 marine chronometer thumb left drawings of harrison s h4 chronometer of 1761 published in principles of mr harrison s time keeper 1767 principles of mr harrison s time keeper marine chronometers are clocks used at sea as time standards to determine longitude by celestial navigation a major stimulus to improving accuracy and reliability of clocks was importance of precise time keeping for navigation position of a ship at sea could be determined with reasonable accuracy if a navigator could refer to a clock that lost or gained less than about 10 seconds per day marine chronometer would have to keep time of a fixed location usually greenwich mean time allowing seafarers to determine longitude by comparing local high noon to clock this clock could not contain a pendulum which would be virtually useless on a rocking ship thumb right a twin barrel box chronometer after scilly naval disaster of 1707 where four ships ran aground due to navigational mistakes british government offered a large prize of ps20 000 equivalent to millions of pounds today for anyone who could determine longitude accurately reward was eventually claimed in 1761 by yorkshire carpenter john harrison who dedicated his life to improving accuracy of his clocks in 1735 harrison built his first chronometer which he steadily improved on over next thirty years before submitting it for examination clock had many innovations including use of bearings to reduce friction weighted balances to compensate for ship s pitch and roll in sea and use of two different metals to reduce problem of expansion from heat chronometer was trialled in 1761 by harrison s son and by end of 10 weeks clock was in error by less than 5 seconds electric clock thumb upright 0 60 one of alexander

battery with extremely long life but disadvantage of its electrical properties varying with weather he trialled various means of regulating electricity and these models proved to be reliable across a range of meteorological conditions alexander bain a scottish clock and instrument maker was first to invent and patent electric clock in 1840 on january 11 1841 alexander bain along with john barwise a chronometer maker took out another important patent describing a clock in which an electromagnetic pendulum and an electric current is employed to keep clock going instead of springs or weights later patents expanded on his original ideas quartz clock and watch upright thumb internal construction of a modern high performance hc 49 package quartz crystal piezoelectric properties of crystalline quartz were discovered by jacques and pierre curie in 1880 first quartz crystal oscillator was built by walter g cady in 1921 and in 1927 first quartz clock was built by warren marrison

lower cost in case of rubidium clocks clock and watch making industry thumb a pocket watch first professional clockmakers came from guilds of and jewellers clockmaking developed from a specialized craft into a mass production industry over many years paris and blois were early centres of clockmaking in france french clockmakers such as julien le roy clockmaker of versailles were leaders in case design and ornamental clocks davies norman p 435 le roy belonged to fifth generation of a family of clockmakers and was described by his contemporaries as most skillful clockmaker in france possibly in europe he invented a special repeating mechanism which improved precision of clocks and watches a face that could be opened to view inside clockwork and made or supervised over 3 500 watches competition and scientific rivalry resulting from his discoveries further encouraged researchers to seek new methods of measuring time more accurately clockmakers came to american colonies from england and holland during early 1600s among earliest known clockmakers in colonies were thomas nash of new haven connecticut 1638 william davis of boston 1683 of new york city 1698 and james of boston 1707 thumb right 150px dallas museum of case striking clock constructed in boston by benjamin bagnall sr between 1730 and 1745 2017 connecticut clockmakers were crafting striking clocks

age of 17 1 2 3 between 1794 and 1795 in aftermath of french revolution french government briefly mandated decimal clocks with a day divided into 10 hours of 100 minutes each alder pp 149 150 astronomer and mathematician pierre simon laplace among other individuals modified dial of his pocket watch to decimal time a clock in palais des tuileries kept decimal time as late as 1801 but cost of replacing all nation s clocks prevented decimal clocks from becoming widespread alder pp 150 162 because clocks only helped astronomers rather than ordinary citizens it was one of most unpopular changes associated with metric system and it was abandoned in germany nuremberg and augsburg were early clockmaking centers and black forest came to specialize in wooden cuckoo clocks thumb left 220px an antique pocket watch movement from an 1891 encyclopedia english became predominant clockmakers of 17th and 18th centuries main centres of british industry were in city of london west end of london soho where many skilled french huguenots settled and later in clerkenwell worshipful company of clockmakers was established in 1631 as one of livery companies of city of london thomas tompion was first english clockmaker with an international reputation and many of his pupils went on to become great horologists in their own right such as george graham who invented deadbeat escapement orrery and mercury pendulum and his pupil thomas mudge who created first lever escapement famous clockmakers of this period included joseph windmills simon de charmes who established de charmes clockmaker firm and christopher pinchbeck who invented alloy pinchbeck later famous horologists included john arnold who made first practical and accurate modern watch by refining harrison s chronometer thomas earnshaw who was first to make these available to public daniel quare who invented a repeating watch movement a portable barometer and introduced concentric minute hand quality control and standards were imposed on clockmakers by worshipful company of clockmakers a guild which licensed clockmakers for doing business by rise of consumerism in late 18th century clocks especially pocket watches became regarded as fashion accessories and were made in increasingly decorative styles by 1796 industry reached a high point with almost 200 000 clocks being produced annually in london however by mid 19th century industry had gone into steep decline from swiss competition switzerland established itself as a clockmaking center following influx of huguenot craftsmen and in 19th century swiss
