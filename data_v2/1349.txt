vigilantes began in 1863 in what was at time a remote part of eastern idaho territory vigilante activities continued although somewhat sporadically through montana territorial period until territory became state of montana on november 8 1889 vigilantism arose because territorial law enforcement and courts had very little power in remote mining camps during territorial period in 1863 1864 montana vigilantes followed model of san francisco committee of vigilance that existed in 1850s california to bring order to lawless communities in and around gold fields of alder gulch and grasshopper creek there are estimates that over 100 persons were killed in road agent robberies in fall of 1863 vigilance committee of alder gulch organized in december 1863 and in first six weeks of 1864 at least 20 road agents of infamous plummer gang known as innocents were captured and hanged by organization formal territorial law reached alder gulch in late 1864 with arrival of territorial judge hezekiah l hosmer and vigilante activity ceased in region as gold fields of alder gulch and grasshopper creek declined in 1865 prospectors and fortune seekers migrated to newly discovered areas in and around last chance gulch now helena montana as lawlessness increased vigilante justice continued there with formation of committee of safety in 1865 during period 1865 1870 at least 14 alleged criminals were executed by helena s vigilantes in 1884 ranchers in central and eastern montana resorted to vigilante justice to deal with cattle rustlers and horse thieves best known vigilante group in that area were stuart s stranglers organized by granville stuart in musselshell region as formal law enforcement became more prevalent in region vigilantism fell into decline vigilantism in pre territorial and territorial montana has been written about romanticized and chronicled in personal memoirs biographies documentary and scholarly works film and fiction for well over a century first book published in montana was thomas j dimsdale s 1866 first edition of vigilantes of montana which was compiled from a series of newspaper articles he wrote for montana post in 1865 historical analysis of period ranges from disrepute to heroism with debates over whether lack of any functioning justice system and understanding of due process at time meant vigilantes acted in a way they thought was best for their communities or if modern standards of due process should govern analysis of their actions bannack and virginia city thumb right 200px alt image of montana ghost town bannack montana 2005 on july

new settlements generally lacked justice systems found in populated portions of territory such as in territorial capital in lewiston idaho in 1863 gold was preferred form of currency in western frontier communities and had a value fixed and guaranteed by u s government of 20 67 per ounce almost all economic transactions in western mining communities were accomplished with gold nuggets flakes or dust as currency and not surprisingly more gold one had more wealth one possessed during early years of territory there was no secure way to transport wealth out of region only means of transporting wealth out of alder gulch gold fields was via horseback or slow moving wagons and stagecoaches on a limited number of trails and primitive roads leading south and west to salt lake city and san francisco or east to minnesota roads and trails leading to alder gulch included bozeman and bridger trails connecting to oregon trail from east mullan road from points west and from fort

commercial freight and two passenger stage companies peabody and caldwell s and a j oliver s operated on this route stagecoaches had to stop at several different ranches during trip to water and

alder gulch had become common in their writings about vigilantes thomas dimsdale and nathaniel p langford estimated that at least 102 travelers were killed by robbers in fall of 1863 many more travelers left region and were never heard from again as this became a more frequent occurrence locals began suspecting that these crimes were being carried out by a single group of outlaws known as

confronted by three armed road agents he was carrying very little money and was allowed to depart unmolested but with warning that if he talked he would be killed he did not heed warning and told sanders wife hattie and sidney edgerton that he had recognized one of road agents as sheriff henry plummer although tilden s report was discounted because plummer was respected this incident led to

southmayd was cunning enough to avoid injury or death in november 1863 conrad kohrs traveled to bannack from deer lodge montana with 5000 in gold dust to buy cattle a conversation with sheriff plummer in bannack led kohrs to believe he might be robbed while on trail back to deer lodge while in an overnight camp his associates located road agents george ives and dutch john wagner surveying camp armed with shotguns a day or two later kohrs was on horseback returning to deer lodge when ives and wagner gave chase kohrs horse proved faster and he evaded confrontation before reaching safety of

they tried to shoot him he was able to avoid being shot and escaped into brush failure of miners courts prior to creation of montana territory on may 26 1864 and arrival of territorial courts only court system available for residents of bannack and virginia city were informal miners courts miners courts were a vehicle of organized mining districts to resolve mining claims and disputes between miners in district when confronted with a major crime such as murder they usually proved ineffective at resolving crime to satisfaction of community while there are not many accounts of early courts in alder gulch probably due to their informality and short existence john x beidler recalled a murder trial in virginia city miners court in his memoirs trial recalled by beidler occurred in fall of 1863 it concerned matter of murder of j w dillingham trial was held outside due to fact that every resident took part in end all three defendants were set free first charley forbes was freed after he gave an eloquent and sentimental speech about his mother other two buck stinson and haze lyons were convicted and set to be first men executed in what would become state of montana however at what would be a very public hanging friends and sympathizers of stinson and lyons convinced crowd to vote again on execution two attempts at counting vote were made according to beidler first people voting hang were to walk up hill while those voting no hang were to walk down hill this vote was rejected and next attempt had four men form two gates and people would cast their vote by walking through hang gate or no hang gate beidler claims that friends of condemned men simply walked through no hang gate multiple times casting multiple fraudulent votes that possibly allowed two murderers to walk free on december 19 21 1863 a public trial was held for george ives suspected murderer of a young dutch immigrant nicholas tiebolt hundreds of miners from around area attended 3 day outdoor trial george ives was prosecuted by wilbur f sanders and ives was convicted and hanged on december 21 1863 sanders played a prominent role in montana history and eventually became first u s senator from montana when territory gained statehood in 1889 while ives trial resulted in an execution many residents were frustrated by a cumbersome process that could easily be manipulated this sentiment is illustrated by a quote from thomas dimsdale who wrote first published account of montana vigilantes originally written in 1865 as a series of articles for montana post and later compiled into a book formation of vigilance committee on december 23 1863 two days after ives trial a group of five virginia city residents led by wilbur f sanders and including major alvin w brockie john nye captain nick d wall and paris pfouts organized vigilance committee of alder gulch committee was organized similar to earlier san francisco committee of vigilance 1851 56 in california of which some of alder gulch organizers were familiar with original committee oath signed by its earliest members was paris pfouts was elected as president of committee which drafted and adopted a comprehensive set of by laws establishing a formal structure and process by laws established position of president an executive officer an executive committee a secretary treasurer and positions of captains and lieutenants of companies most

bozeman 1867 and thomas dimsdale editor of montana s first newspaper montana post and author of vigilantes of montana 1866 due to secret nature of organization it is difficult to be sure when an execution was carried out by vigilance committee or another group of motivated citizens in months following ives trial many suspected road agents were hanged notably henry plummer sheriff of bannack who was suspected by many of being ringleader of road agents montana vigilantes hanged men using testimony of other men who faced their imminent executions as sole evidence of few accounts of early actions of alder gulch vigilantes beidler and dimsdale are most complete although they give little information about secret trials conducted by vigilantes estimates vary but noted vigilante historian frederick allen believes that between years 1863 and 1865 somewhere from 15 to 35 people were killed due to actions of alder gulch vigilantes vigilante justice over of course of approximately six weeks between december 1863 and february 1864 vigilante companies located arrested and executed suspected members of plummer road agent gang in bannack virginia city and hellgate montana bannack

towns around helena from july 1864 until august 1865 only justice system was miners court third district did not get its first chief judge until august 1865 when judge lyman munson arrived from east on june 8 1865 john keene and harry slater two men who had an unresolved quarrel from their days in salt lake city spotted each other in sam greer s saloon on helena s bridge street keene shot slater in head killing him instantly keene surrendered himself to helena sheriff george wood and freely admitted his guilt in shooting a two day trial ensued where some members of jury were known vigilantes

langford who had been asked to lead organization but declined he did serve on its executive committee reflected in his book vigilante days and ways that crimes of horse stealing murder and highway robbery would be punishable by death in july 1865 helena vigilantes captured jack silvie in diamond city montana and charged him with various crimes of robbery prior to his execution by hanging from helena s hangman s tree silvie confessed to being a member of virginia city road agents and to at least a dozen murders in territory shortly after judge lyman munson s arrival in helena he convened a grand jury on august 12 1865 however unlike judge hosmer in alder gulch munson made no remarks about vigilantism nor did he threaten vigilantes with prosecution if they continued their activities

robbery and attempted murder of george leonard double hanging is significant because it was photographed at time and image widely circulated had effect of damping public sentiment for vigilantism pax vigilanticus by 1870s montana as a whole was experiencing what montana historian frederic allen described as a sort of pax vigilanticus allen claims this was due to reputation for summary executions

subject to rustling by thieves after 1879 with threat from indian wars diminished on plains of montana stock ranches and open range cattle ranching moved east into central and eastern montana dhs ranch owned by samuel hauser andrew davis and granville stuart was established in 1879 in musselshell region of central montana and became one of largest open range ranches in montana first stockmen s association in montana was formed in virginia city in 1873 association was established to discuss branding standards how to deal with rustling and how to influence territorial legislature to pass laws favorable to cattle industry this association did not survive but led to creation of other organizations in subsequent years in 1878 montana stock association of lewis and clark county was organized one of its prominent members ross deegan editorialized about need for extralegal action if territorial legislature did not enact laws to protect cattle industry in july 1879 a territorial stock association was formed that ultimately spawned a number of small county or district based associations throughout montana by 1883 value of cattle in montana was estimated at greater than 25 million and annual losses from rustling exceeded three percent by summer of 1884 cattle men resorted to vigilantism to deal with rustlers and first recorded hanging occurred at fort maginnis on july 3 1884

1884 by hanging shootings or fire last hanging occurred on august 1 1884 in july 1884 theodore roosevelt who later became 26th president of united states was operating a cattle ranch in medora north dakota along little missouri river in cooperation with cattle merchant marquis de mores his ranch was suffering from rustling as well both mores and roosevelt offered their services to stranglers but stuart declined offer to avoid undue notoriety they would bring from that point forward stock detectives employed by various stock associations took responsibility for enforcing stock laws and deterring rustling although there was minor public outrage about killings none of stuart s stranglers were ever brought to trial for their actions and editorials in regional newspapers praised their efforts general acclamation of granville stuart s actions was reflected by his election as first president of montana s association in late july 1884 3 7 77 numerical symbol 3 7 77 has long been associated with montana vigilantes its meaning is unclear though many theories have been put forward trying to explain what it symbolized none conclusive including references to dimensions of a grave amount of time a miscreant had to leave town assorted masonic symbolism details of membership structure and a simple copying of symbol from organizations in colorado and california although it has been associated with vigilantes in alder gulch this is not supported by historical evidence first documented evidence of use of symbol in a vigilante scenario occurred in november 1879 in helena when

s association with vigilante captain james william in late 1800s lew callaway wrote extensively about vigilantes and his stories which add more intimate details about how vigilantes operated are captured in this volume although some vigilante activities during this period were criticized by citizens and civic leaders there was a general affirmation of their purpose and contribution to law and order in a growing territory mark c dillon s montana vigilantes 1863 1870 gold guns and gallows 2013 concludes that given lawless environment and criminal activity in alder gulch and helena at time lack of any functioning justice system and understanding of due process at time vigilantes acted in a way they thought was best for their communities he contends that judging vigilantes by today s understanding and standards of due process is problematic in 2004 frederick allen a journalist and historian published a decent and orderly lynching montana vigilantes reviewed as an up to day balanced account of montana s vigilante history 1864 1870 allen s book reinforces motivations and methods of earliest vigilantes in alder gulch while commenting on growing disdain for vigilantism in late 1860s more generalist works on montana history such as merrill g burlingame s montana frontier 1942 and michael p malone s montana a history of two centuries 1991 adequately summarize vigilante period largely based on earlier accounts by dimsdale langford and biedler additionally many topical histories of montana such as novelist and montana historian dan cushman s montana gold frontier 1973 cover vigilante period some works published in late 20th century about vigilante activity in alder gulch portray vigilantes and their leaders as conspirators with political motives rather than restoring law and order making an argument that victims were not afforded due process prior to their execution and evidence was insufficient to prove their guilt or innocence two works of ruth e mather and f e boswell hanging sheriff a biography of henry plummer 1987 1999 and vigilante victims montana s 1864 hanging spree 1991 have been criticized as revisionist and received poor reviews by montana historians such as michael p malone and richard b roeder additional criticism came from later authors such as mark c dillon and carol buchanan another account from john c fazio who writes for cleveland civil war roundtable contends that vigilance committee of alder gulch had more to do with national politics than with dealing with criminals he contends that sidney edgerton and wilbur sanders were pawns of abraham lincoln and other unionists who sought ways to rid montana gold fields of southerners and confederate sympathizers his views have been rebutted by novelist carol buchanan mock trial of henry plummer and plummer s pardon request on may 7 1993 twin bridges montana public schools organized a mock trial of henry plummer at madison county courthouse in virginia city trial received national media attention adults and students role played events using accounts of dimsdale x biedler and langford after a six hour trial jury of four men and eight women was in deadlock 6 6 student playing role of henry plummer was told he was free based in part on notoriety of mock trial academics sympathetic to view that plummer was innocent petitioned montana board of pardons and parole to grant plummer a pardon although supported by a number of prominent historians and scholars pardon was denied by board as plummer had never actually been convicted of a crime in montana and
