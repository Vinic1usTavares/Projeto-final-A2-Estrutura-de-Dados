increase in thunderstorm activity a tropical depression developed on august 3 after passing near guam janis tracked generally westward and on august 5 storm was believed to have attained typhoon intensity after intensifying at a brisk pace janis attained peak intensity on august 6 near okinawa thereafter typhoon began to weaken and accelerate as it recurved towards kyushu where it made landfall on next day land interaction took its toll on typhoon as it tracked northeast paralleling western coast of honshu on august 9 janis transitioned into an extratropical low over hokkaido five

analysis jtwc determined that due to high resolution of satellite eye temperature of storm was overestimated prompting agency to revise its dvorak methods to better match intensity estimates derived from geostationary satellites after tracking towards west northwest during its early stages typhoon janis turned towards north northeast and passed east of okinawa jtwc estimated that janis leveled off in intensity however jma estimates that janis was still strengthening and did not attain its highest intensity until 18 00 utc on august 6 when agency reported winds of and a barometric pressure of after its peak intensity typhoon began to weaken and accelerate as it recurved towards kyushu this turn was correctly predicted by jtwc at time of landfall on kyushu late on august 7 jtwc and jma
