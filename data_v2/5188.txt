as 6 miles 9 7 km during apache uprisings young burnham also learned much from al chief of scouts and his assistant archie mcintosh who had been chief of scouts in crook s last two campaigns burnham learned much about scouting from these indian trackers who were advanced in age and fading from frontier including vital lesson that it is imperative that a scout should know history tradition religion social customs and superstitions of whatever country or people he is called on to work in or among but scout who was to have perhaps greatest influence on burnham during his formative years was a man named holmes upright thumb six shooter burnham purchased as a teenager in prescott arizona which he kept all his life and later used in rhodesia east africa and mexico alt caption reads

lost all of his family in indian wars and before he died he wanted to impart his knowledge of frontier to young burnham two men traveled throughout american southwest and northern mexico and holmes taught him many scouting skills such as how to track a trail how to double and cover one s own trail how to properly ascend and descend precipices and how to tell time at night burnham also learned survival skills from holmes such as where to find water in desert how to protect himself from snakes and what to do in case of forest fires or floods a stickler for details holmes impressed on him that even in simplest things such as braiding a rope tying a knot or putting on or taking off a saddle there is a right way and a wrong way two men earned a living by hunting and prospecting burnham also worked as a cowboy a guard for mines a guide and a scout during these years in globe arizona burnham unwittingly joined losing side of pleasant valley war before mass killing started and only narrowly escaped death he had no stake in feud but he was drawn into conflict by his association with gordon family once killing started he felt he had to join a faction as a hired gun although it put him on wrong side of law in between raids and forays he practiced incessantly with his pistol he learned to shoot using either hand and from back of a galloping horse even after his faction admitted defeat feud would begin again years later burnham still had many enemies during this time he met a fine hard riding young kansan who i had met on an indian raid and whose nerve i greatly admired young kansan who had been swindled by an unscrupulous superintendent of mines had a plan to rustle cattle and horses from superintendent and sell them to curly bill william brocius an outlaw with whom he had indirectly been in contact both men were broke at time and job sounded easy but burnham had always rejected life of a thief and even as a wanted man he did not view himself as a criminal burnham began to see that even though he joined feud to help his friends he had been in wrong that avenging only led to more vengeance and to even greater injustice than that suffered through often unjustly administered laws of land burnham decided to reject offer of young kansan who followed through with plan and was later killed and that he needed to leave tonto basin judge aaron hackney editor of local arizona silver belt newspaper and a friend helped him escape to tombstone arizona with assistance of neil mcleod he was a well known prizefighter in tombstone and one of most successful smugglers along arizona mexico frontier gunfight at o k corral had occurred only a few months earlier but as tombstone was a boomtown attracting new silver miners from all parts it was an ideal location to hide out burnham assumed several aliases and occasionally he delivered messages for mcleod and his smuggler partners in sonora mexico from mcleod he learned many valuable tricks for avoiding detection passing coded messages and throwing off pursuers burnham eventually went back to california to attend high school but he never graduated he returned to arizona and was appointed deputy sheriff of pinal county but he soon went back to herding cattle and prospecting after he went to prescott iowa to visit his childhood sweetheart blanche two were married on february 6 1884 he was 23 years old he and blanche settled down soon after in pasadena california to tend to an orange grove but soon burnham returned to prospecting and scouting active as a freemason he rose to become a thirty second degree mason of scottish rite during 1880s sections of american press popularized notion that west had been won and there was nothing left to conquer in united states time when great scouts like kit carson daniel boone and davy crockett could explore and master wild and uncharted western territories was coming to a close contemporary scouts such as buffalo bill wild bill hickok and texas jack omohundro were leaving old west to become entertainers and they battled great native american chiefs like sitting bull chief joseph and geronimo only in wild west shows in 1890 united states census bureau formally closed american frontier ending system under which land in western territories had been sold cheaply to pioneers as a soldier of fortune as richard harding davis later called him burnham began to look elsewhere for next undeveloped frontier feeling that american west was becoming tame and unchallenging when he heard of work of cecil rhodes and his pioneers in southern africa who were working to build a railway across africa from cape to cairo burnham sold what little he owned in 1893 with his wife and young son he set sail for durban in south africa

american buckboard and six donkeys when war broke out between rhodes s british south africa company and matabele or ndebele king lobengula in late 1893 he signed up to scout for company immediately on reaching matabeleland and joined fighting leander starr jameson company s chief magistrate in mashonaland hoped to defeat matabele quickly by capturing lobengula at his royal town of bulawayo and so sent burnham and a small group of scouts ahead to report on situation there while on outskirts of town they watched as matabele burned down and destroyed everything in sight by time company troops had arrived in force lobengula and his warriors had fled and there was little left of old bulawayo company then moved into remains of bulawayo established a base and sent out patrols to find lobengula most famous of these patrols was shangani patrol led by major allan wilson and man he chose as his chief of scouts fred burnham shangani patrol thumb upright an 1895 sketch portraying a scene from shangani patrol episode burnham left on horse kills a matabele warrior alt a black and white sketch depicting a southern african battle fought amidst long grass in a thick wood image focuses on two figures in foreground a white soldier on horseback on left and a black warrior on foot on right white man has apparently just fired his rifle at warrior who is thrown back in his stride by shot his spear falling from his right hand more soldiers and warriors can be seen in background jameson sent a column of soldiers under major patrick forbes to locate and capture lobengula column camped on south bank of shangani river about north east of village of on evening of december 3 1893 next day late in afternoon a dozen men under command of major wilson were sent across river to patrol area wilson patrol came across a group of matabele women and children who claimed to know lobengula s whereabouts burnham who served as lead scout of wilson patrol sensed a trap and advised wilson to withdraw but wilson ordered his patrol to advance soon afterwards patrol found king and wilson sent a message back to laager requesting reinforcements forbes however was unwilling to set off across river in dark so he sent only 20 more men under command of henry borrow to reinforce wilson s patrol forbes intended to send main body of troops and artillery across river following morning however main column was ambushed by matabele warriors and delayed wilson s patrol too came under attack but shangani river had swollen and there was now no possibility of retreat in desperation wilson sent burnham and two other men pearl pete ingram a montana cowboy and william gooding an australian to cross shangani river find forbes and bring reinforcements in spite of a shower of bullets and spears three made it to forbes but battle raging there was just as intense as one they had left and there was no hope of anyone reaching wilson in time as burnham loaded his rifle to beat back matabele warriors he quietly said to forbes i think i may say that we are sole survivors of that party wilson borrow and their men were indeed surrounded by hundreds of matabele warriors escape was impossible and all were killed colonial era histories called this shangani patrol and hailed wilson and borrow as national heroes their last stand together became a kind of national myth as lewis gann writes a glorious memory rhodesia s own equivalent of bloody alamo massacre and custer s last stand in american west version of events recorded by history is based on accounts of burnham ingram and gooding matabele present at battle particularly induna mjaan and men of forbes column while all of direct evidence given by eyewitnesses supports findings of court of inquiry some historians and writers debate whether or not burnham ingram and gooding really were sent back by wilson to fetch help and suggest that they might have simply deserted when battle got rough earliest recording of this claim of desertion is long after event in a letter written in 1935 by john coghlan to a friend john carruthers that a very reliable man informed me that wools sampson told him that gooding had confessed on his deathbed that he and two americans had not actually been despatched by wilson and had simply left on their own accord this double hearsay confession coming from an anonymous source is not mentioned in gooding s 1899 obituary which instead recounts events as generally recorded several well known writers have used coghlan letter as shaky as it is as clearance to create hypothetical evidence in an attempt to challenge and revise historical record all of officers and troopers of forbes column had high praise for burnham s actions and none reported any doubts about his conduct even decades later one member of column trooper m e weale told rhodesia herald in 1944 that once commandant piet raaff took over command from disgraced major forbes it was greatly due to burnham s good scouting that column managed to get away i have always felt that honours were equally divided between these two men to whom we owed our lives on that occasion for his service in war burnham was presented british south africa company medal a gold watch and a share of a 300 acre 120 ha tract of land in matabeleland it was here that burnham uncovered many artifacts in huge granite ruins of ancient civilization of great zimbabwe matabeleland became part of company domain which was formally named rhodesia after rhodes in 1895 matabeleland and mashonaland became collectively called southern rhodesia northern rhodesia exploration in 1895 burnham oversaw and led northern territories british south africa exploration company expedition that first established for british south africa company that major copper deposits existed north of zambezi in north eastern rhodesia along kafue river burnham saw many similarities to copper deposits he had worked in united states and he encountered native peoples wearing copper bracelets after this expedition he was elected a fellow of royal geographical society later british south africa company built mining towns of copperbelt and a railroad to transport ore through portuguese mozambique second matabele war in march 1896 matabele again rose up against british south africa company administration in what became called second matabele war or first chimurenga liberation war mlimo matabele spiritual leader is credited with fomenting much of anger that led to this confrontation colonists defenses in matabeleland were undermanned due to ill fated jameson raid into south african republic or transvaal and in first few months of war alone hundreds of white settlers were killed with few troops to support them settlers quickly built a laager in centre of bulawayo on their own and mounted patrols under such figures as burnham robert baden powell and frederick selous matabele retreated into their stronghold of matopos hills near bulawayo a region that became scene of fiercest fighting between matabele warriors and settler patrols it was also during this war that two scouts of very different backgrounds burnham and baden powell would first meet and discuss ideas for training youth that would eventually become plan for program and code of honor for boy scouts assassination of mlimo thumb upright burnham and

holding their rifles and fleeing from scene burnham looks back and sees many angry matabele warriors running behind him in hot pursuit turning point in war came when burnham and bonar armstrong a company native commissioner found their way through matopos hills to a sacred cave not many miles from district to a sanctuary then known only to matabele where mlimo had been hiding not far from cave was a village now gone of about 100 huts filled with many warriors two men tethered their horses to a thicket and crawled on their bellies screening their slow cautious movements by means of branches held before them once inside cave they waited until mlimo entered mlimo was said to be about 60 years old with very dark skin sharp featured american news reports of time described him as having a cruel crafty look burnham and armstrong waited until mlimo entered cave and started his dance of immunity at which point burnham shot mlimo just below heart killing him burnham and armstrong leapt over dead mlimo and ran down a trail toward their horses warriors in village nearby picked up their arms and searched for attackers to distract them burnham set fire to some of their huts two men escaped and rode back to bulawayo shortly after cecil rhodes walked unarmed into matabele stronghold and made peace with rebels ending second matabele war klondike gold rush with matabele wars over burnham decided it was time to leave africa and move on to other adventures family returned to california soon after fred traveled to alaska and yukon to prospect in klondike gold rush taking with him his eldest son roderick who was then 12 years old on hearing of spanish american war burnham rushed home to volunteer his services but war had ended before he could get to fighting burnham returned to klondike having played no part in war colonel theodore roosevelt regretted this as much as burnham and paid him a great tribute in his book second boer war thumb burnham after his investiture with

british and two independent boer republics south african republic and orange free state partly result of long simmering strife between them it was directly caused by each side s desire to control lucrative witwatersrand gold mines in transvaal field marshal frederick roberts one of british army s most successful commanders of 19th century was appointed to take overall command of british forces relieving general redvers buller following a number of boer successes in early weeks of war including siege of mafeking in which baden powell his small regiment of men and townspeople had been besieged by thousands of boer troops since conflict began roberts asked general frederick carrington who had commanded british forces in matabeleland three years earlier whom he should appoint as his chief of scouts in south africa carrington had selected burnham for this role and advised roberts to do same describing burnham as finest scout who ever scouted in africa roberts sent for burnham soon after arriving in south africa on rms dunottar castle american scout was prospecting near skagway alaska when he received following telegram in january 1900 lord roberts appoints you on his personal staff as chief of scouts if you accept come at once quickest way possible cape town is at opposite end of globe from klondike so burnham left immediately in an unusual step for a foreigner burnham received a command post from roberts and british army rank of captain burnham reached front just before battle of paardeberg february 1900 during war burnham spent much time behind boer lines gathering information and blowing up railway bridges and tracks he was captured twice escaping both times and also temporarily disabled at one point by near fatal wounds burnham was first captured during fighting at sanna s post in orange free state he gave himself up in order to obtain information on enemy which he did and then he escaped from his guards and succeed in reaching british occupied bloemfontein safely after two days and nights on run second time he was captured was while trying to warn a british column approaching thaba nchu he came upon a group of boers hiding on banks of river toward which british were even then advancing cut off from his own side burnham chose to signal approaching soldiers even though it would expose him to capture with a red kerchief burnham signaled soldiers to turn back but column paid no attention and steadily on into ambush while burnham was at once taken prisoner in fight that followed burnham pretended to receive a wound in knee limping heavily and groaning with pain he was placed in a wagon with officers who really were wounded and who in consequence were not closely guarded later that evening burnham slipped over driver s seat dropped between two wheels of wagon lowered himself and fell between legs of oxen on his back in road in an instant wagon had passed over him safely and while dust still hung above trail he rolled rapidly over into ditch at side of road and lay motionless it was four days before he was able to re enter british lines during which time he had been lying in open veld he had subsisted on one biscuit and two handfuls of i e maize on june 2 1900 during british march on pretoria burnham was wounded almost fatally he was on a mission to cut off flow of boer gold and supplies to and from sea and to halt transportation of british prisoners of war out of pretoria he scouted alone far to east behind enemy lines trying to identify best choke point along pretoria delagoa bay railway line he came upon an underpass of a railway bridge an ideal location to disrupt trains but was immediately surrounded by a party of boers burnham instantly fled and he had almost escaped when his horse was shot and fell knocking him senseless and pinning him under its dead body it was night and he was already far away when his horse was shot so boer troopers apparently did not check to see if burnham had been injured or killed when he awoke hours later burnham was alone and in a dazed state having sustained serious injuries in spite of his acute agony burnham proceeded to creep back to railway placed his charges and blew up line in two places he then crept on his hands and knees to an empty animal enclosure to avoid capture and stayed there for two days and nights insensible next day burnham heard fighting in distance so he crawled in that direction by this time he was indifferent as to source of gunshots and by chance it was a british patrol that found him once in pretoria surgeons discovered that burnham had torn apart his stomach muscles and burst a blood vessel his very survival was due only to fact that he had been without food or water for three days burnham s injuries were so serious that he was ordered to england by lord roberts two days before leaving for london he was promoted to rank of major having received letters of commendation or congratulations from baden powell rhodes and field marshal roberts on his arrival in england burnham was commanded to dine with queen victoria and to spend night at osborne house a few months later after queen s death king edward vii personally presented burnham with queen s south africa medal with four bars for battles at driefontein march 10 1900 johannesburg may 31 1900 paardeberg february 17 26 1900 and cape colony october 11 1899 may 31 1902 in addition to cross of distinguished service order second highest decoration in british army for his heroism during victorious march to pretoria june 2 5 1900 king also made his british army appointment and rank permanent in spite of his u s citizenship burnham received highest awards of any american who served in second boer war following his investiture british press hailed him as king of army scouts burnham s most accomplished soldiers during second boer war were lovat scouts a scottish highland regiment he commanded whom he described as half wolf and half jackrabbit formed by lord lovat in 1899 this yeomanry unit was first to wear suits a type of camouflage clothing developed to resemble heavy foliage these scouts were well practiced in arts of marksmanship field craft and tactics after war lovat scouts went on to become british army s first sniper unit father of scouting thumb burnham standing and baden powell right at a boy scout event

men baden powell is wearing his stetson hat burnham has no hat and man on left has a modest hat behind burnham and to his right is a flag partially opened burnham was already a celebrated scout when he first befriended baden powell during second matabele war but backgrounds of these two scouts was as strange a contrast as it is possible to imagine from his youth on open plains burnham s earliest playmates were sioux indian boys and their ambitions pointed to excelling in lore and arts of trail and together they dreamed of some day becoming great scouts when burnham was a teenager he supported himself by hunting game and making long rides for western union through california deserts his early mentors were wise old scouts of american west and by 19 he was a seasoned scout chasing and being chased by apache british scout he would later befriend and serve with in matabeleland baden powell was born in london and had graduated from charterhouse one of england s most famous public schools baden powell developed an ambition to become a scout at an early age he passed an exam that gave him an immediate commission into british army when he was 19 but it would take several years before he was engaged in any active service when two men met in 1896 baden powell was an army intelligence officer and a brilliant outdoorsman who had organized a small scouting section in his regiment written a book called reconnaissance and scouting 1884 and served in india afghanistan natal and ashanti burnham meanwhile was general carrington s chief of scouts during siege of bulawayo these two men rode many times into matopos hills on patrol and it was in these hills that burnham first introduced baden powell to ways and methods of native americans and taught him woodcraft better known today as scoutcraft baden powell had written at length about reconnaissance and tracking but from burnham he learned many new dimensions such as how to travel in wild country without either a compass or map how to discover nearby dangers by observing animals and many techniques for finding potable water so impressed was baden powell by burnham s scouting spirit that he closely listened to all he had to tell it was also here that baden powell began to wear his signature stetson campaign hat and neckerchief like those worn by burnham for first time both men recognized that wars were changing markedly and that british army needed to adapt during their joint scouting missions baden powell and burnham discussed concept of a broad training program in woodcraft for young men rich in exploration tracking fieldcraft and self reliance in africa no scout embodied these traits more than burnham in his first scouting handbook aids to scouting 1899 baden powell published many of lessons he learned from burnham and this book was later used by boys groups as a guide to outdoor fun at urging of several youth leaders baden powell decided to adapt his scouting handbook specifically to training boys while baden powell went on to refine concept of scouting publish scouting for boys 1908 and become founder of international scouting movement burnham has been called movement s father james e west chief scout executive for boy scouts of america bsa summarized burnham s historical relevance to scouting there is an especial significance for those of us in scouting in this man s list for he was engaged for this work by lord baden powell who was then connected with british army in africa and who had unbounded admiration for scouting methods of frederick burnham so these two pioneers each of whom was to have such immeasurable influence in restoring old traditions of american youth met in africa years before scouting movement was ever thought of thumb upright 1 5 u s geological survey

bsa published his biography he who sees in dark boys story of frederick burnham american scout bsa made burnham an honorary scout in 1927 and for his noteworthy and extraordinary service to scouting movement burnham was bestowed highest commendation given by bsa silver buffalo award in 1936 throughout his life he remained active in scouting at both regional and national level in united states and he corresponded regularly with baden powell on scouting topics burnham and baden powell remained close friends for their long lives burnham called baden powell a wonderfully able scout and nicknamed him sherlock holmes baden powell considered burnham to be greatest scout alive seal on burnham baden powell letters at yale and stanford expired in 2000 and true depth of their friendship and love of scouting has again been revealed in 1931 burnham read speech dedicating mount baden powell california to his old scouting friend their friendship and equal status in world of scouting and conservation was honored in 1951 with dedication of adjoining peak as mount burnham burnham s descendants followed in his footsteps and are active in scouting and in military his son roderick enlisted in u s army

expedition in east africa protectorate kenya traveling extensively in area around lake rudolf now lake he discovered a huge soda lake mexico burnham returned to north america and for next few years became associated with yaqui river irrigation project in mexico while investigating yaqui valley for mineral and agricultural resources burnham reasoned that a dam could provide year round water to rich alluvial soil in valley turning region into one of garden spots of world and generate much needed electricity he purchased water rights and some of land in this region and contacted an old friend from his time in africa john hays hammond who conducted his own studies and then purchased an additional of this land an area size of rhode island burnham together with charles frederick holder made important archaeological discoveries of mayan civilization in this region including esperanza stone in 1909 william howard taft and porfirio diaz planned a summit in el paso texas and ciudad juarez mexico an historic first meeting between a u s president and a mexican president and also first time an american president would cross border into mexico but tensions rose on both sides of border including threats of assassination so texas rangers 4 000 u s and mexican troops u s secret service agents fbi agents and u s marshals were all called in to provide security burnham was put in charge of a 250 private security detail hired by hammond who in addition to owning large investments in mexico was a close friend of taft from yale and a u s vice presidential candidate in 1908 on october 16 day of summit burnham and private c r moore a texas ranger discovered a man holding a concealed palm pistol standing at el paso chamber of commerce building along procession route burnham and moore captured and disarmed assassin within only a few feet of taft and diaz after taft diaz summit burnham led a team of 500 men in guarding mining properties owned by hammond j p morgan and in mexican state of sonora just as irrigation and mining projects were nearing completion in 1912 a long series of mexican revolutions began final blow to these efforts came in 1917 when mexico passed laws prohibiting sale of land to foreigners burnham and hammond carried their properties until 1930 and then sold them to mexican government world war i during this period burnham was one of 18 officers selected by former u s president theodore roosevelt to raise a volunteer infantry division for service in france in 1917 shortly after united states entered war a plan to raise volunteer soldiers from western u s came out of a meeting of new york based rocky mountain club and burnham was put in charge of both general organization and recruitment congress gave roosevelt authority to raise up to four divisions similar to rough riders of 1st united states volunteer cavalry regiment and to british army 25th frontiersmen battalion royal fusiliers however as commander in chief president woodrow wilson refused to make use of roosevelt s volunteers roosevelt had been an outspoken critic of wilson s neutrality policies so even though roosevelt had made several attempts to come to an agreement with wilson president was unwilling to accept any compromise in an astute political maneuver wilson announced to press that he would not send roosevelt and his volunteers to france but instead would send an american expeditionary force under command of general john pershing roosevelt was left with no option except to disband volunteers he never forgave wilson and quickly published foes of our own household a harsh indictment of sitting president these relentless attacks helped republicans win control of congress in 1918 roosevelt might have been a serious candidate for president in 1920 had he
