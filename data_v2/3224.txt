hurricane belle was a strong tropical cyclone that caused moderate damage across east coast of united states in august 1976 in late july a tropical wave emerged off west coast of africa traversing atlantic ocean for more than a week system eventually consolidated into a tropical depression near bahamas on august 6 remaining nearly stationary for a day depression strengthened into a tropical storm on august 7 and a hurricane later that day as it acquired a northwest motion formation of an eye accompanied quick intensification and belle reached its peak following day with winds of 120 mph 195 km h hurricane subsequently turned north and accelerated skirting outer banks of north carolina early on august 10 belle made landfall on long island new york as a minimal hurricane crossing long island sound and hitting central coast of connecticut as strong tropical storm thereafter belle transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over new england before moving over atlantic canada system turned east while over north atlantic and ultimately dissipated on august 15 to south of iceland threatening much of east coast of united states hurricane warnings were issued from georgia to maine an estimated 500 000 people evacuated coastal areas accordingly overall impacts from belle were less than expected and mainly attributed to flooding across new england hundreds of thousands of residents

vermont were later declared major disaster areas by then president gerald ford some damage also took place in new brunswick canada from heavy rain meteorological history on july 28 1976 a tropical wave emerged off west coast of africa an unusually well organized system for time of year and location considerable deep convection accompanied it a possible low level circulation consolidated within system by july 31 as it raced west across atlantic ocean as it approached lesser antilles in early august convection separated from system and moved north of islands while wave itself continued into caribbean sea northern portion of system eventually reached a point north of bahamas on august 5 and grew increasingly organized well defined upper level outflow became established that evening a low level center formed early on august 6 and became a tropical depression by 06 00 utc while situated roughly 290 mi 465 km east northeast of nassau bahamas over next 24 hours system remained almost stationary and executed a small counter clockwise loop early on august 7 depression acquired gale force winds and became a tropical storm accordingly it was assigned name belle acquiring a slow northwest trajectory belle steadily intensified on august 7 reconnaissance aircraft investigating storm revealed system to have achieved hurricane strength by 18 00 utc as its pressure fell to 985 mbar hpa 29 09 inhg additionally a well defined eye was present by this time right thumb hurricane belle off coast of delaware and maryland approaching landfall in new york on august 9 cyclone turned northward and accelerated on august 8 while reaching major hurricane status that evening early on august 9 belle achieved its peak intensity with maximum estimated surface winds of 120 mph 195 km h and a minimum pressure of 957 mb hpa 28 26 inhg at higher altitudes within storm recon reported winds up to 150 mph 240 km h turning to just east of due north belle began weakening shortly thereafter with its eye becoming obscured late on august 9 hurricane passed within 60 mi 95 km of hatteras island north carolina contrary to most storms which threaten northeastern states belle did not accelerate tremendously as it neared land accordingly it weakened quickly in response to cooler waters in region around 05 00 utc on august 10 belle made landfall as a minimal hurricane with 75 mph 120 km h winds along jones beach long island new york briefly crossing long island sound belle made a second landfall as a strong tropical storm near bridgeport connecticut once inland over new
