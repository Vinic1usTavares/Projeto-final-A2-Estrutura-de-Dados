zara class was a group of four heavy cruisers built for italian regia marina royal navy in late 1920s and early 1930s class comprised vessels and last of which was completed to a slightly different design ships were a substantial improvement over preceding s incorporating significantly heavier armor protection at cost of very high speed of trentos they carried same main battery of eight guns and had a maximum speed of among best protected heavy cruisers built by any navy in 1930s heavy armor was acquired only by violating terms of washington naval treaty which limited cruiser displacement to all four ships served with main fleet in interwar period where they were primarily occupied with training exercises and fleet reviews during spanish civil war gorizia evacuated italian nationals and pola took part in non intervention patrols all four ships supported italian invasion of albania in april 1939 shortly before outbreak of world war ii after italy joined wider conflict in 1940 four ships saw extensive action in mediterranean sea against british forces ships took part in battles of calabria and cape matapan and in latter engagement zara pola and fiume were all sunk in a one sided night action with three british battleships gorizia continued in service seeing further action at first and second battles of sirte she was seriously damaged by american heavy bombers in april 1943 and towed to la spezia where she was still under repair when italy surrendered in september germany seized ship when they occupied port and italian commandos unsuccessfully attempted to sink her in june 1944 in poor condition by end of war postwar italian navy decided to sell ship for scrap in 1947 design while preceding of heavy cruisers were still being built elements of italian naval command began to doubt effectiveness of new vessels which sacrificed armor protection in favor of very high speeds they advocated a more balanced design that would incorporate more comprehensive armor with a main belt that was thick while retaining battery of eight guns and a speed of at least designers quickly found that these characteristics could not be incorporated into a vessel that remained within limit imposed by washington naval treaty naval command agreed to allow new ships to exceed displacement limits but instructed designers to eliminate unnecessary features to save as much weight as possible as a result belt armor was reduced in thickness and planned torpedo tubes were removed flush deck of trentos was abandoned with ships instead incorporating a forecastle deck and a stepped down main deck in addition zara design would be powered by just two propellers driven by lightweight machinery unlike four shaft arrangement used in trentos nevertheless ships still exceeded displacement limit by at least by 1928 work was finished on what would become zara class and first two ships and were ordered for 1928 1929 building program followed in 1929 1930 construction year and was ordered under 1930 1931 program all four ships were named for formerly austro hungarian cities that were annexed to italy in aftermath of world war i brescia p 76 general characteristics thumb left line drawing of pola zara was similar in appearance ships of zara class were long at waterline and long overall they had a beam of and a draft of ships had a standard displacement of and displaced at full load with fiume being lightest of four and gorizia heaviest first three ships were built with light superstructures as a weight saving measure but pola intended to serve as a flagship received a much larger bridge structure to accommodate an admiral s staff all four ships received two tripod masts with forward mast erected over bridge they had a crew of 841 officers and enlisted men ships carried a pair of imam ro 43 seaplanes for aerial reconnaissance hangar was located under forecastle and a fixed catapult was mounted on centerline at bow gardiner chesneau p 292 ships power plant consisted of two parsons steam turbines powered by eight oil fired thornycroft boilers with exception of fiume which received yarrow boilers boilers were trunked into two funnels amidships their engines were rated at and produced a top speed of though on sea trials all four vessels significantly exceeded those figures reaching a minimum of and speeds of nevertheless in service their practical speeds were in range of vessels each carried of fuel oil which allowed them to steam for at a cruising speed of when operating at maximum speed their operational radius fell to though due to fact that italian naval vessels were intended to operate only within narrow confines of mediterranean sea their relatively short cruising range was not a significant problem gardiner chesneau p 283 armament and armor thumb upright fiume launching a seaplane in 1935 note closeness of main battery guns zaras were armed with a main battery of eight mod 29 53 caliber guns in four gun turrets turrets were arranged in superfiring pairs forward and aft guns fired shells at a muzzle velocity of with a rate of fire of about three and a half rounds per minute turrets allowed elevation to 45 degrees which provided a maximum range of each ship carried 157 shells per gun like trentos zara class ships suffered from shell dispersion that hampered accuracy problem was in large part due to poor quality control in italian munition factories which failed to ensure tight manufacturing tolerances necessary for accurate shells friedman p 310 in addition single cradle mounts required guns to be very close together this caused shells to interfere with each other in flight and contributed to dispersion problem brescia pp 73 74 in an attempt to rectify dispersion problem guns were supplied with modified shells that fired at campbell p 326 anti aircraft defense was provided by a battery of sixteen 47 cal guns in twin mounts four vickers terni 40 mm 39 guns in single mounts and eight guns in twin mounts 100 mm guns were copies of austro hungarian guns designed in 1910 by skoda that were placed in newly designed dual purpose mounts that elevated to 85 degrees for a maximum range of campbell p 339 ships secondary battery was revised several times during their careers two of 100 mm guns and all of 40 mm guns were removed in late 1930s and eight 54 cal guns were installed in their place two 15 cal star shell guns were added in 1940 in 1942 star shell guns aboard gorizia by this time only surviving member of class were replaced with four more 37 mm guns following year a battery of fourteen guns in six twin and two single mounts replaced machine guns ships were protected with an armored citadel that covered ships vitals including machinery spaces and ammunition magazines vertical protection consisted of an armored belt that was thick at waterline and reduced to at bottom edge of belt their main armor deck was thick and box formed by belt and deck was capped at either end by armored bulkheads that were thick in upper portion and in lower section main deck was supplemented with an upper deck that was thick which was intended to detonate fuses of incoming shells before they struck main deck upper deck was connected to an upper belt that was thick gun turrets had 150 mm thick plating on faces and barbettes they sat in were also 150 mm thick main conning tower had 150 mm thick sides and an thick roof zara class carried three times armor protection of preceding trentos their heavy armor made zaras best protected cruisers until introduction of laid down in 1945 by united states martin p 69 this additional armor would have made ships decidedly nose heavy so to offset this rear of ship was raised by one deck behind front funnel fitzsimons p result was

history after entering service in early 1930s four members of zara class took part in training exercises with italian fleet and participated in fleet reviews held for foreign leaders including adolf hitler of nazi germany and miklos horthy regent of hungary gorizia and pola were involved in spanish civil war in 1936 pola conducted non intervention patrols and gorizia carried italian nationals from gijon spain to le verdon sur mer france that year after departing france gorizia visited germany and on way back she suffered a major explosion in an aviation gasoline tank that forced her to put into gibraltar for repairs there british shipyard inspectors discovered that ship was grossly over washington treaty s displacement restriction in march 1939 all four ships sortied to prevent a squadron of republican warships from reaching black sea forcing them to stop in bizerte tunisia where they were interned following month zara pola and gorizia provided gunfire support to italian forces invading albania hogg wiper pp 18 24 46 54 zara class cruisers saw extensive service during world war ii having taken part in several sorties to catch british convoys in mediterranean as flagship of 1st division at battle of calabria in july 1940 torpedo bombers from british aircraft carrier attacked zara class cruisers but they failed to score any hits ships steamed ahead to front of italian line of battle and joined attack on leading british battleship but they scored no hits british cruisers attacked as italians withdrew but heavy fire from italian cruisers drove them off greene

under repair in la spezia when italy surrendered to allies in september and she was seized by german forces when they occupied much of country on 22 june 1944 italian frogmen used chariot manned torpedoes to enter harbor and sink gorizia and heavy cruiser which was also out of service due to battle damage to prevent them from being used as blockships though gorizia survived attack she was nevertheless sold for scrap in 1947 since it would have been cost prohibitive to repair her hogg wiper pp 46 47 notes references category cruiser classes category world war ii cruisers of italy
