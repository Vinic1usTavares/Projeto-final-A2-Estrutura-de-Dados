determined by outsiders as a result in 1987 torajan village of kete kesu and several other designated tourist attractions closed their doors to tourists this closure lasted only a few days as villagers found it too difficult to survive without income from selling souvenirs tourism has also transformed toraja society originally there was a ritual which allowed commoners to marry nobles puang and thereby gain nobility for their children however image of torajan society created for tourists often by lower ranking guides has eroded its traditional strict hierarchy high status is not as
