brother herbert powell marge s mother jacqueline bouvier and other minor relatives concept and origins creation groening conceived of idea for simpsons in lobby of james l brooks s office brooks had asked groening to pitch an idea for a series of animated shorts which groening initially intended to present as his life in hell series however when groening realized that animating life in hell would require rescinding of publication rights for his life s work he chose another approach and formulated his version of a dysfunctional family he named characters after his own family members his father homer his mother margaret and his younger sisters lisa and maggie he substituted bart an anagram of brat for his own name and modeled character after his older brother mark groening matt 2006 commentary for my sister my sitter in simpsons complete eighth season dvd 20th century fox five family members were given simple designs so that their facial emotions could easily be changed with almost no effort and so that they would be recognizable in silhouette groening submitted only basic sketches to animators and assumed that figures would be cleaned up in production however animators merely re traced his drawings which led to crude appearance of characters in initial short episodes simpson family made their debut on april 19 1987 in tracey ullman show short good night in 1989 shorts were adapted into simpsons a half hour series airing on fox broadcasting company simpson family remained main characters on this new show casting dan castellaneta julie kavner nancy cartwright and yeardley smith all began voicing their characters on tracey ullman show nancy cartwright was only one of group who had been trained to be a voice actor while castellaneta had done some voice over work in chicago castellaneta and kavner had been part of regular cast of tracey ullman show and voices were needed for shorts so producers decided to ask them to voice homer and marge rather than hire more actors producers decided to hold casting for roles of bart and lisa yeardley smith had initially been asked to audition for role of bart but casting director bonita pietila believed her voice was too high smith later recalled i always sounded too much like a girl i read two lines as bart and they said thanks for coming smith was given role of lisa instead on march 13 1987 nancy cartwright went in to audition for role of lisa after arriving at audition she found that lisa was simply described as middle child and at time did not have much personality cartwright became more interested in role of bart who she found more fascinating because he was described as devious underachieving school hating irreverent and clever cartwright pp 35 40 matt groening let her try out for part instead and upon hearing her read gave her job on spot simpson family simpsons are a family who live in at 742 evergreen terrace in town of springfield in united states state in which in this town is located is never specified however they do have snow and sometimes wear sweaters in fall it s a running joke in show to be as vague and ambiguous as possible whenever hinting at which u s state town of springfield might be located in homer father works as a safety inspector at springfield nuclear power plant a position at odds with his careless personality he is married to marge simpson a stereotypical american housewife and mother they have three children bart a ten year old troublemaker lisa an eight year old child prodigy and maggie a baby who rarely speaks but communicates by sucking on a pacifier family owns a dog santa s little helper and a cat snowball ii both pets have had starring roles in several seasons despite passing of yearly milestones such as holidays or

stereotypes he is crude overweight incompetent clumsy thoughtless and a borderline alcoholic he has occasionally displayed flashes of great intellect and fitness whenever situation calls for it and an integrity reflecting his own values including a fierce devotion to and protectiveness of his family his voice started out as an impression of walter matthau but eventually evolved into a more robust voice during second and third season of half hour show allowing homer to cover a fuller range of emotions homer has since become one of most influential fictional characters and has been described by uk newspaper sunday times as greatest comedic creation of modern time he has inspired an entire line of merchandise and his catchphrase annoyed grunt d oh has been included in oxford english dictionary during production of episode insane clown poppy writers toyed with idea of giving homer a long lost legitimate biological daughter but when shows showrunner and writer mike scully as well

well meaning and extremely patient wife of homer and mother of bart lisa and maggie she often acts as voice of reason but displays exaggerated behavior traits of stereotypical mothers and takes

beehive julie kavner received a primetime emmy award in 1992 for voicing marge in episode i married marge for her performance in simpsons movie kavner received a nomination for best voice acting in an animated feature at 2007 annie awards but lost to ian holm in ratatouille kavner s emotional performance in movie got positive reviews and one critic said she gave what must be most heartfelt
