brioni agreement or brioni declaration is a document signed by representatives of slovenia croatia and yugoslavia under political sponsorship of european community ec on brijuni islands on 7 july 1991 agreement sought to create an environment in which further negotiations on future of yugoslavia could take place however ultimately it isolated federal prime minister ante markovic in his efforts to preserve yugoslavia and effectively stopped any form of federal influence over slovenia this meant yugoslav people s army jna would focus on combat in croatia creating a precedent of redrawing international borders and staking ec s interest in resolving yugoslav crisis agreement put an end to hostilities between yugoslav and slovene forces in ten day war slovenia and croatia agreed to suspend activities stemming from their 25 june declarations of independence for a period of three months document also resolved border control and customs inspection issues regarding slovenia s borders resolved air traffic control responsibility and mandated an exchange of prisoners of war brioni agreement also formed basis for an observer mission to monitor implementation of agreement in slovenia eleven days after agreement was made federal government pulled jna out of slovenia conversely agreement made no mitigating impact on fighting in croatia background on 23 june 1991 as slovenia and croatia prepared to declare their independence during breakup of yugoslavia european community ec foreign ministers decided ec member states would not extend diplomatic recognition to two states ec viewed declarations as unilateral moves and offered assistance in negotiations regarding future of sfr yugoslavia instead at same time ec decided to suspend direct talks with slovenia and croatia move was welcomed by yugoslav federal government slovenia and croatia declared independence on 25 june and yugoslav people s army jna units began to deploy from its bases in slovenia next day on 27 june armed conflict broke out as jna and territorial defence force of slovenia tds began fighting over control of slovenia s border posts in what became ten day war a three strong ec delegation made three visits to region in late june and early july to negotiate a political agreement which would facilitate further negotiations delegation consisted of foreign ministers of luxembourg as incumbent holder of ec presidency and italy and netherlands as previous and future holders of that office delegation members were jacques poos luxembourg gianni de michelis italy and hans van den broek netherlands prior to delegation s arrival in belgrade poos told reporters that ec would take charge of crisis there delegation was met by serbian president slobodan milosevic who dismissed prospect of croatia leaving yugoslav federation because its population contained 600 000 serbs on 29 june croatia and slovenia agreed to suspend their declarations of independence to allow time for a negotiated settlement ec delegation appeared to make progress when serbia responded to move by ceasing their opposition to appointment of a croatian member of federal presidency stjepan mesic as body s chairman on 30 june appearance of a success was reinforced when jna ordered its troops posted in slovenia to return to their barracks on 1 july de michelis was replaced by joao de deus pinheiro portuguese foreign minister to maintain formula of current former and future ec presidencies comprising ec delegation as netherlands took over presidency from luxembourg while portugal was scheduled to assume presidency after dutch conference at brijuni a further result of ec delegation s mission were talks attended by representatives of ec croatia slovenia serbia and yugoslav government talks were held at brijuni islands on 7 july besides ec delegation headed by van den broek five out of eight members of federal presidency attended talks mesic janez branko kostic and vasil yugoslav federal prime minister ante markovic was also present as were yugoslav federal foreign minister budimir interior minister petar and deputy defence minister vice admiral stane croatia was represented by president franjo tudman while president milan kucan attended on behalf of slovenia serbia was represented by borisav jovic a former serbian member of federal presidency who had resigned from position on 15 june instead of milosevic who refused to attend starting at 8 am ec delegation held separate talks with kucan and his assistants then with tudman and his assistants and finally with jovic in afternoon a plenary meeting was held with federal slovene and croatian delegations in attendance while jovic reportedly left dissatisfied with talks agreement was prepared at ec council of ministers in hague on 5 july it consisted of a joint declaration and two annexes detailing creation of an environment suitable to further political negotiations and guidelines for an observer mission to yugoslavia agreement which became known as brioni declaration or brioni agreement required jna and tds to return to their bases and stipulated that slovene officials were to control slovenia s borders alone and that both slovenia and croatia were to suspend all activities stemming from their declarations of independence for three months observer mission set out by brioni agreement materialised as european community monitor mission ecmm tasked with monitoring disengagement of jna and tds in slovenia and ultimately withdrawal of jna from slovenia aftermath even though little was agreed upon and agreement was later interpreted differently by its signatories brioni agreement established ec s interest in region and first ec ministerial conference on yugoslavia was held in hague on 10 july ecmm helped calm several standoffs around military barracks in slovenia and facilitated negotiations between slovene authorities and jna regarding withdrawal of jna from slovenia in croatia armed combat continued and jna shelled city of osijek same evening agreement was signed federal presidency ordered complete withdrawal of jna from slovenia on 18 july in response to slovene actions in breach of brioni agreement ecmm s scope of work was expanded to include croatia on 1 september by mid september war had escalated as croatian national guard and police blockaded jna barracks and jna embarked on a campaign against croatian forces brioni agreement isolated markovic who tried to preserve federation but was ignored by van den broek who appeared not to comprehend issues presented before him and ec delegation tacitly encouraged dissolution of yugoslavia agreement diminished authority of part of jna s leadership who fought for preservation of yugoslav federation agreement was also unfavourable for croatia because it was left to defend against jna and serb forces by effectively removing slovenia from influence of federal authorities especially jna agreement fulfilled one of serbian nationalists goals allowing redrawing of international borders sabrina ramet noted that kucan and milosevic reached an agreement in january 1991 in which milosevic gave his assurances that slovenia s independence bid would not be opposed by serbia in return kucan expressed his understanding for milosevic s interest to create a greater serbia at time ec viewed agreement as a method of defusing crisis and failed to attribute lull which coincided with brioni agreement to a shift in serbian strategy instead ec delegation s failure to respond to jovic s departure before plenary meeting and ec foreign ministers declaration of 10 july indicating ec would withdraw from mediation if brioni agreement was not implemented only encouraged serbia which unlike slovenia croatia or yugoslav federation had nothing to lose if ec pulled out in end ec took credit for a rapid resolution of armed conflict in slovenia without realising that its diplomatic efforts had little to do with situation on ground
