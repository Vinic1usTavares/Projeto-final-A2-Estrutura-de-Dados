metacritic some reviewers felt game was better than previous 3d sonic games but still below quality of 2d games ps2 version s reviews were considerably worse than others reviewers noted clipping graphic faults and its lower frame rate aesthetics and sound were generally well received ign lauded detailed varied and realistic character models and wrote that textures were detailed and crisp they also praised realistic shading and lighting effects although gamespot thought graphics were not much of an improvement from previous games comparing them to a glorified dreamcast game they still praised its steady frame rate art design and vibrant colors eurogamer disliked shiny models but was still pleased by imaginative aesthetics in regards to soundtrack game revolution found it upbeat and catchy offering particular praise for music of bingo highway although they called music laughable and not an improvement from previous games ign thought rest of sound was high quality and praised its perfectly implemented sound effects running in dolby pro logic ii multiple reviewers wrote that gameplay was very similar to that of genesis sonic games gamespot found sonic heroes closest sonic team ever got to recreating classic 2d sonic gameplay in 3d they praised game for stripping away shooting and hunting elements from sonic adventure games and called it a purer more action packed sonic experience than previous games ign considered sonic heroes a major improvement from sonic adventure writing sonic heroes does an absolutely sensational job of re creating intensely fast and unpredictable looping stages from classic games in 3d 1up com and gamespy agreed that game was a step in right direction for series reviewers called casino level bingo highway a highlight reviewers were generally divided over team based gameplay gamespy argued it was well balanced and thought it greatly increased replay value ign offered similar praise praising its easy to learn strategic controls game revolution wrote system added diversity however ign also thought it was not as ambitious as expected and did not change overall experience gamespot agreed controls were easy but considered large number of teams unnecessary no one cares about these peripheral characters people play sonic games to play as sonic hedgehog 1up found concept was more repetitive than innovative eurogamer considered gameplay original but boring and obvious and thought that controls were clunky and unorthodox while eurogamer argued sonic heroes was not difficult game revolution described it as hard to a fault exclaiming they died all time game was criticized for not addressing problems of prior sonic games 1up wrote problems with camera and hit or miss lock on attacks that leave you plunging to your doom that plagued sonic adventure games were still present in sonic heroes and hurt experience greatly gamespot said although camera worked well most of time coordination between camera position and character movement caused problems such that pushing forward may not move character in same direction camera is facing they also wrote that game suffered from problems with collision detection and noted all shortcomings were present in sonic adventure games ign agreed camera had not been improved voice acting was especially derided ign joked players should turn down volume during cut scenes and gamespy compared voice work to likes of playskool sales sonic heroes was a major commercial success by october 2004 game had sold over one million copies in europe
