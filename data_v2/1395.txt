raid on genoa was a minor naval engagement fought in harbour of italian city of genoa during first year of french revolutionary wars french republican forces in mediterranean under pressure from austrian and spanish armies royalist uprisings and british blockade had suffered loss of their principal naval base and fleet stationed there when british forces under lord hood seized toulon at invitation of city s royalist faction survivors of french fleet were scattered across mediterranean several sheltering in neutral italian harbours including frigates modeste at genoa and imperieuse at leghorn to eliminate threat these isolated frigates posed hood ordered a squadron under rear admiral john gell to investigate harbour at genoa squadron arrived on 5 october and discovered modeste and two smaller warships at anchor later in day three ships of squadron launched their ship s boats and instigated a boarding action against anchored ships in defiance of genoese neutrality french crews resisted but british boarding parties successfully captured all three vessels without suffering any casualties six days later detached hms captain also seized abandoned imperieuse which had fled to la spezia action had strategic consequences republican faction in genoa was strong and they successfully barred austrian reinforcements from sailing to join allied garrison at developing siege of toulon outnumbered defenders of port were overwhelmed and driven into sea by a republican assault on 17 december mediterranean in 1793 french revolutionary wars which began in 1792 as a conflict between new french republic and austrian empire following french revolution spread in 1793 to involve a number of other european nations including spain and great britain chandler p 269 in addition to these external threats political tensions within france led to a series of uprisings against republic in summer of 1793 particularly in south of country one of centres of royalist activity was city of toulon major naval base and home port for powerful french mediterranean fleet james p 66 on 28 august after fighting between republican forces and british troops for control of heights overlooking city toulon surrendered to lord hood commander of british royal navy s mediterranean fleet hood s forces occupied city seized french fleet in harbour and called for reinforcements to defend toulon against inevitable republican counterattack receiving spanish neapolitan and sardinian contingents over following weeks as siege of toulon developed clowes p 206 austrian troops were also promised to be dispatched from austrian army fighting french in northern italy these troops could only reach toulon by sea scheduled to embark from city port of genoa capital of italian state of republic of genoa which at this stage of war was officially neutral genoa was however in common with other northern italian cities in a state of political upheaval french revolution had inspired similarly minded revolutionaries in italy to support republican ideas and there was a substantial republican faction in genoese government which supported france s cause gardiner p 98 food supplies were regularly shipped from genoa to republican armies in southern france and demands of francis drake ambassador to genoa that this trade cease went unheeded rose p 48 situation at genoa was compounded by presence of french warships in genoese waters those parts of french fleet which had not been seized at toulon were now deprived of a home port and so had taken refuge in neutral italian ports relying on italian neutrality to protect them from attack by more numerous enemy fleets operating in ligurian sea clowes p 213 two of largest such ships were 36 gun frigate modeste and 40 gun imperieuse which had taken shelter at genoa and leghorn in grand duchy of tuscany respectively they presented both a threat to allied shipping and an impediment to movement of reinforcements through italian ports but despite strong protests from drake and lord hervey ambassador to tuscany republican sympathisers in genoa and leghorn refused to compel french ships to leave in july modeste and french corvette badine had deliberately obstructed frigate hms aigle in neutral harbour forcing captain john nicholson inglefield to take evasive action a calculated insult ireland p 146 in consequence hood resolved that frigates be eliminated so that republicans in genoa would be coerced into withdrawing their support james p 87 raid thumb upright 1 1 right john gell joshua reynolds 1786 national maritime museum to confront french frigates hood diverted a powerful squadron from his fleet at toulon this force was led by rear admiral john gell in 98 gun ship of line hms st george and included 74 gun hms bedford under captain robert mann and hms captain under captain samuel reeve as well as french royalist scipion smaller warships accompanied larger warships hms mermaid hms tartar hms alerte hms eclair hms vulcan hms conflagration and hms speedy under commander charles cunningham this force was ordered to sail to genoa and eliminate modeste hood stipulating in his orders that operation was a warning to republican sympathisers regicides in genoa ireland p 214 squadron arrived off port on 5 october modeste was clearly visible in harbour anchored at mole near two tartanes small mediterranean sailing craft here armed with four guns and carrying crews of around 70 men senior officers of squadron held a council to determine best course of action and decided that since diplomatic options had failed and genoese appeared to support french british would resort to a military solution on afternoon of 5 october bedford was slowly warped into harbour and alongside modeste as reeve launched ship s boats from captain and brought them close to other side of french frigate british arrival was reportedly greeted with derision by french sailors until a boarding party clambered onto frigate from bedford s deck to be met by resistance from french crew rose p 49 mann then ordered his ship s royal marines to fire into french sailors killing several and driving many more over side into harbour ireland p 215 this attack broke their resolve and french surrendered several leaping into sea to escape capture only to be collected by boats of captain as modeste was subdued boats of speedy approached tartanes as boat parties boarded small french warships crew of one surrendered while other resisted british boarders a short melee broke out on deck of tartane resulting in captain and one other french sailor wounded and tartane firmly in british hands raid completed british squadron withdrew from genoa with their prizes british sources reported that one french sailor had been killed in operation and ten wounded while british boarding parties had survived unscathed while french sources claimed five killed and 30 wounded or in most extreme accounts as many as 50 killed la spezia alarmed by raid on genoa authorities in leghorn ordered imperieuse to leave immediately frigate sailed north and took shelter at near port of la spezia french had decided that since capture was inevitable frigate should be destroyed and beached ship in order to remove guns and stores six days after capture of modeste captain reached la spezia acting on reports that imperieuse was in bay reeve discovered french ship under guns of santa maria shore battery and following morning 12 october used his ship s boats to tow captain alongside imperieuse at 08 00 boat parties from ship of line boarded frigate discovering that remaining french crew had abandoned their disarmed ship during night and scuttled it in shallow water british were able to take possession of imperieuse without opposition from battery reeve instructed his carpenters to make frigate seaworthy again refloating ship and completing temporary repairs on 13 october before sailing back to toulon with his prize james p 88 aftermath modeste and imperieuse were high quality modern ships and were both immediately recommissioned into royal navy modeste with same name and imperieuse as hms unite as there was already a ship with a similar name in service repercussions of this operation were severe however gell acting on instructions from hood had violated genoese neutrality in a deliberate attempt to intimidate pro republican faction in city but their actions were readily seized upon by french propagandists such as nicolas ozanne who portrayed raid as a massacre of unarmed sailors in print form genoese government broke off diplomatic relations with britain permitting only french ships to enter harbour british instituted a blockade and as a result 5 000 austrian reinforcements destined for toulon were unable to embark gardiner p 99 drake and all british inhabitants of genoa were expelled and gell initiated a blockade of city seizing neutral merchant shipping destined for port three ships were stationed at leghorn to watch more quiescent tuscan government including royalist scipion on 26 november scipion which was carrying 150 prisoners taken in raid on genoa caught fire possibly result of arson and was destroyed although other accounts suggest that a barrel of brandy was ignited accidentally by a candle blaze killed 390 of royalist crew many of whom were classed as unfit for duty grocott p 4 without austrian reinforcements defenders of toulon were outnumbered and outflanked coming under sustained attack by french troops directed by 24 year old artillery officer captain napoleon bonaparte tracy p 24 on 17 december french troops seized high ground over city and allies were forced into a chaotic withdrawal as hood s ships removed garrison and more than 14 000 refugees from city boat parties led by sir sidney smith attempted to destroy french fleet and dockyards with fireships mostert p 116 these efforts were only partially successful fifteen ships of line and five frigates survived conflagration to form nucleus of french mediterranean fleet in war to come by evening of 18 december toulon was firmly in republican hands clowes p 210 references bibliography
