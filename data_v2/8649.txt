hms hood was a modified pre dreadnought battleship built for royal navy in early 1890s she differed from other ships of class in that she had cylindrical gun turrets instead of barbettes and a lower freeboard she served most of her active career in mediterranean sea where her low freeboard was less of a disadvantage ship was placed in reserve in 1907 and later became receiving ship at queenstown ireland hood was used in development of anti torpedo bulges in 1913 and was scuttled in late 1914 to act as a blockship across southern entrance of portland harbour after start of world war i design hood last of eight royal sovereign class battleships to be built differed significantly from other ships of her class in that she had a forward freeboard of only compared to of other ships burt pp 62 87 royal sovereigns had reverted to a higher freeboard after several classes of low freeboard vessel had been constructed last being low freeboard had been popular for around ten years since it required less armour and made a smaller target for gunfire to hit although it had disadvantage that it reduced seaworthiness this low freeboard meant that hood was very wet in rough weather and her maximum speed reduced rapidly as wave height increased making her only suitable for service in relatively calm mediterranean this was seen as a vindication of barbette high freeboard design in rest of her class and all subsequent british battleship classes had high freeboard parkes pp 354 55 burt p 85 thumb left forward 13 5 inch 343 mm gun turret on hood lower freeboard was required by her use of armoured gun turrets a heavy type of rotating gun mounting of mid and late 19th century very different from what would later be known as turrets hoods half sisters mounted their guns exposed on top of barbettes a much lighter arrangement that allowed their freeboard to be substantially increased heavy old fashioned type of turrets added to amount of weight high up in ship compared to barbettes and decreased ship s stability chesneau kolesnik p 33 burt p 85 because stability of a ship is largely due to freeboard at high rolling angles she was given a larger metacentric height vertical distance between and centre of gravity below it of around instead of of rest of royal sovereigns to make her roll less in rough seas this had effect of making her roll period shorter by around 7 compared to her sisters which in turn made her gunnery less accurate brown p 124 bilge keels were fitted in 1894 which improved her manoeuvrability general characteristics hood had an overall length of a beam of and a draught of at deep load she displaced at normal load and at deep load her crew numbered 690 officers and enlisted men burt p 87 ship was powered by two 3 cylinder vertical triple expansion steam engines each driving one propeller eight water tube boilers provided steam to engines which produced a maximum of when forced this was intended to allow them to reach a speed of she carried a maximum of of coal enough to steam at burt p 63 armament ship was armed with four 32 calibre bl 13 5 inch mk i iv guns in two twin gun turrets one fore and aft of superstructure each gun was provided with 80 shells hoods secondary armament consisted of ten 40 calibre 6 inch mk i iii guns mounted in casemates in superstructure a major problem with four of these guns mounted on upper deck was that they were mounted low in ship and were unusable at high speed or in heavy weather they were removed in 1904 ship carried 200 rounds for each gun burt pp 63 69 85 defence against torpedo boats was provided by eight qf 6 pounder guns although exact type of gun is not known four of these were mounted on main deck in casemates on sides of hull and suffered from same problems as six inch guns hood also mounted a dozen qf 3 pounder hotchkiss guns mounted in superstructure and fighting tops like her sisters ship was fitted with seven 18 inch torpedo tubes two of these were mounted in bow below waterline four were placed in sides of hull two on each broadside and one in stern these last five tubes were all above water she also was fitted with a plough shaped underwater ram burt pp 63 87 in 1897 one of these 3 pounder guns was mounted on each turret top and three years later 3 pounders in fighting tops were transferred to forward superstructure at same time above water torpedo tubes were removed about 1902 03 6 pounders on main deck were removed two were remounted on superstructure but other two were not replaced in 1905 3 pounders on forward superstructure were removed while 3 pounders in lower fighting tops were removed while ship was in reserve from 1907 09 burt p 85 armour hoods protection used both compound armour and nickel steel armour her waterline main belt ranged in thickness between thick it covered middle of ship and was high of which was below waterline at normal load fore and aft bulkheads thick respectively closed off ends of central citadel at level of waterline upper strake of armour was long and protected ship s side between barbettes burt p 74 oblique bulkheads thick connected this strake to armour protecting bases of turrets gun turrets and their bases were protected by of armour that thinned to behind oblique bulkheads below armoured deck their armour was reduced to armour of main deck casemates was six inches thick and that of forward conning tower was 14 inches thick armoured deck was three inches thick over machinery but thinned to outside central citadel and ran to ends of ship at bow it dipped down to reinforce ship s ram parkes pp 363

commissioned on 1 june 1893 at cost of ps926 396 parkes p 364 her assignment to mediterranean fleet was delayed when she sprang a leak in her forward compartments on 7 june 1893 as a result of faulty riveting and excessive strain on hull when she had been docked repairs took only two days and ship left sheerness for mediterranean on 18 june 193 burt p 89 she arrived at malta on 3 july 1893
