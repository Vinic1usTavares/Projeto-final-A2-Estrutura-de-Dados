storm prediction center spc is a government agency that is part of national centers for environmental prediction ncep operating under control of national weather service nws which in turn is part of national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa of united states department of commerce doc headquartered at national weather center in norman oklahoma storm prediction center is tasked with forecasting risk of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes in contiguous united states it issues convective outlooks mesoscale discussions and watches as a part of this process convective outlooks are issued for following eight days issued separately for day 1 day 2 day 3 and days 4 8 and detail risk of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes during given forecast period although tornado hail and wind details are only available for day 1 days 2 and 3 as well as 4 8 use a probabilistic scale determining probability for a severe weather event in percentage categories mesoscale discussions are issued to provide information on certain individual regions where severe weather is becoming a threat and states whether a watch is likely and details thereof particularly concerning conditions conducive for development of severe thunderstorms in short term as well as situations of isolated severe weather when watches are not necessary watches are issued when forecasters are confident that severe weather will occur and usually precede onset of severe weather by one hour although this sometimes varies depending on certain atmospheric conditions that may inhibit or accelerate convective development agency is also responsible for forecasting fire weather indicating conditions that are favorable for wildfires in contiguous u s issuing fire weather outlooks for days 1 2 and 3 8 which detail areas with various levels of risk for fire conditions such as fire levels and fire alerts history storm prediction center began in 1952 as sels severe local storms unit u s weather bureau in washington d c in 1954 unit moved its forecast operations to kansas city missouri sels began issuing convective outlooks for predicted thunderstorm activity in 1955 and began issuing radar summaries in three hour intervals in 1960 with increased duties of compiling and disseminating radar summaries this unit became national severe storms forecast center nssfc in 1966 remaining headquartered in kansas city in 1968 national severe storms forecast center began issuing status reports on weather watches agency then made its first computerized data transmission in 1971 on april 2 1982 agency issued first particularly dangerous situation watch which indicates imminent threat of a major severe weather event over watches timespan in 1986 nssfc introduced two new forecast products day 2 convective outlook which include probabilistic forecasts for outlined areas of thunderstorm risk for following day and mesoscale discussion a short term forecast outlining specific areas under threat for severe thunderstorm development in october 1995 national severe storms forecast center relocated its operations to norman oklahoma and was rechristened storm prediction center at that time guidance center was housed at max westheimer airport now university of oklahoma westheimer airport co located in same building as national severe storms laboratory and local national weather service weather forecast office latter of which in addition to disseminating forecasts oversees issuance of weather warnings and advisories for western two thirds of oklahoma and western portions of north texas and issues outline and status updates for spc issued severe thunderstorm and tornado watches that include areas served by norman office in 1998 center began issuing national fire weather outlook to provide forecasts for areas potentially susceptible to development and spread of wildfires based on certain meteorological factors day 3 convective outlook which is similar in format to day 2 forecast was first issued on an experimental basis in 2000 and was made an official product in 2001 in 2006 storm prediction center national severe storms laboratory and national weather service norman forecast office moved their respective operations into newly constructed national weather center near westheimer airport since agency s relocation to norman 557th weather wing at offutt air force base would assume control of issuing storm prediction center s severe weather products in event that spc is no longer able to issue them in event of an outage such as a computer system failure or building wide power disruption or emergency such as an approaching strong tornadic circulation or tornado on ground affecting norman campus on april 1 2009 spc reassigned responsibilities for issuing center s products in such situations to 15th operational weather squadron based out of scott air force base overview storm prediction center is responsible for forecasting risk of severe weather caused by severe thunderstorms specifically those producing tornadoes hail of in diameter or larger and or winds of 50 knots or greater agency also forecasts hazardous winter and fire weather conditions it does so primarily by issuing convective outlooks severe thunderstorm watches tornado watches and mesoscale discussions there is a three stage process in which area time period and details of a severe weather forecast are refined from a broad scale forecast of potential hazards to a more specific and detailed forecast of what hazards are expected and where and in what time frame they are expected to occur if warranted forecasts will also increase in severity through this three stage process storm prediction center employs a total of 43 personnel including five lead forecasters ten mesoscale outlook forecasters and seven assistant mesoscale forecasters many spc forecasters and support staff are heavily involved in scientific research into severe and hazardous weather this involves conducting applied research and writing technical papers developing training materials giving seminars and other presentations locally and nationwide attending scientific conferences and participating in weather experiments convective outlooks storm prediction center issues convective outlooks ac consisting of categorical and probabilistic forecasts describing general threat of severe convective storms over contiguous united states for next six to 192 hours day 1 through day 8 these outlooks are labeled and issued by day and are issued up to five times per day categorical risks are tstm for

fuchsia line indicating a high risk of severe weather significant severe areas referred to as hatched areas because of their representation on outlook maps refer to a threat of increased storm intensity that is of significant severe levels f2 ef2 or stronger tornado or larger hail or winds or greater in april 2011 spc introduced a new graphical format for its categorical and probability outlooks which included shading of risk areas with colors corresponding to each category as mentioned above being changed as well and population county parish borough and interstate overlays new shaded maps also incorporated a revised color palette for shaded probability categories in each outlook in 2013 spc incorporated a small table under convective outlook s risk category map that indicates total coverage area by square miles total estimated population affected and major cities included within a severe weather risk area public severe weather outlooks pwo are issued when a significant or widespread outbreak is expected especially for tornadoes from november to march it can also be issued for any threat of significant tornadoes in nighttime hours noting lower awareness and greater danger of tornadoes at that time of year categories a marginal risk day indicates storms of only limited organization longevity coverage and or intensity typically isolated severe or near severe storms with limited wind damage large hail and perhaps a tornado wind gusts of at least and hailstones of around in diameter are common storm threats within a marginal risk depending on sufficient wind shear a tornado usually of weak ef0 to ef1 intensity and short duration may be possible this category replaced see text category on october 22 2014 a slight risk day typically will indicate that threat exists for scattered severe weather including scattered wind damage produced by straight line sustained winds and or gusts of 60 to 70 mph scattered severe hail varying in size from to and or isolated tornadoes often of shorter duration and varying weak to moderate intensity depending on available wind shear and other sufficient atmospheric parameters during peak severe weather season most days will have a slight risk somewhere in united states isolated significant severe events are possible in some circumstances but are generally not widespread an enhanced risk day indicates that there is a greater threat for severe weather than that which would be indicated by a slight risk but conditions are not adequate for development of widespread significant severe weather to necessitate a moderate category severe storms are expected to be more concentrated and of varying intensities these days are quite frequent in peak severe weather season and occur occasionally at other times of year this risk category replaced upper end of slight on october 22 2014 although a few situations that previously warranted a moderate risk were reclassified as enhanced i e 45 wind or 15 tornado with no significant area a moderate risk day indicates that more widespread and or more dangerous severe weather is possible sometimes with major hurricanes with significant severe weather often more likely numerous tornadoes some of which may be strong and potentially long track more widespread or severe wind damage and or very large destructive hail up to or exceeding in diameter could occur major events such as large tornado outbreaks or widespread straight line wind events are sometimes also possible on moderate risk days but with greater uncertainty moderate risk days are not terribly uncommon and typically occur several times a month during peak of severe weather season and occasionally at other times of year slight and enhanced risk areas typically surround areas under a moderate risk where threat is lower a high risk day indicates a considerable likelihood of significant to extreme severe weather generally a major tornado outbreak or much less often an extreme derecho event on these days potential exists for extremely severe and life threatening weather this includes widespread strong or violent tornadoes which may be on ground for a half hour or longer or very destructive straight line winds hail cannot verify or produce a high risk on its own although such a day usually involves a threat for widespread very large and damaging hail as well many of most prolific severe weather days were high risk days such days are rare a high risk is typically issued at most only a few times each year see list of storm prediction center high risk days high risk areas are usually surrounded by a larger moderate risk area where uncertainty is greater or threat is somewhat lower storm prediction center began asking for public comment on proposed categorical additions to day 1 3 convective outlooks on april 21 2014 for a two month period storm prediction center broadened this system beginning on october 22 2014 by adding two new risk categories to three used originally new categories that were added are a marginal risk replacing see text contours see below and an enhanced risk latter is used to delineate areas where severe weather will occur that would fall under previous probability criteria of an upper end slight risk but do not warrant issuance of a moderate risk in order from least to greatest threat these categories are ranked as marginal slight enhanced moderate and high issuance and usage convective outlooks are issued by storm prediction center in zulu time also known as universal coordinated time or utc categories at right refer to risk levels for specific severe weather event occurring within of any point in delineated region as described in previous section day 1 convective outlook issued five times per day at 0600z valid from 1200z of current day until 1200z following day and morning updates valid until 1200z following day 2000z afternoon update valid until 1200z following day and evening update valid until 1200z following day provides a textual forecast map of categories and probabilities and chart of probabilities day 1 is currently only outlook to issue specific probabilities for tornadoes hail or wind it is most descriptive and highest accuracy outlook and typically has highest probability levels day 2 outlooks issued twice daily at 0600z and refer to predicted risks of convective weather for following day 1200z to 1200z of next calendar day for example a day 2 outlook issued on april 12 2100 would be valid from 1200z on april 13 2100 through 1200z on april 14 2100 and include only a categorical outline textual description and a probability graph for severe convective storms generally day 2 moderate risks are fairly uncommon and a day 2 high risk has only been issued twice for april 7 2006 and for april 14 2012 day 3 outlooks refer to day after tomorrow and include same products categorical outline text description and probability graph as day 2 outlook as of june 2012 spc forecasts general thunderstorm risk areas higher probability forecasts are less and less likely as forecast period increases due to lessening forecast ability farther in advance day 3 moderate risks are quite rare these have been issued only eighteen times since product became operational most recently for may 20 2019 day 3 high risks are never issued and operational standards do not allow for such this is most likely because it would require both a very high degree of certainty 60 for an event which was still at least 48 hours away and a reasonable level of confidence that said severe thunderstorm outbreak would include significant severe weather ef2 tornadoes hurricane force winds and or egg sized hail day 4 8 outlooks are longest term official spc forecast product and often change significantly from day to day this extended forecast for severe weather was an experimental product until march 22 2007 when storm prediction center incorporated it as an official product areas are delineated in this forecast that have least a 15 or 30 chance of severe weather in day 4 8 period equivalent to a slight risk and an enhanced risk respectively as forecaster confidence is not fully resolute on how severe weather will evolve more than three days out day 4 8 outlook only outlines areas in which severe thunderstorms are forecast to occur during period at 15 and 30 likelihood and does not utilize other categorical risk areas or outline where general non severe thunderstorm activity will occur local forecast offices of national weather service radio and television stations and emergency planners often use forecasts to gauge potential severe weather threats to their areas even after marginal and enhanced risk categories were added in october 2014 some television stations have continued to use original three category system to outline forecasted severe weather risks though stations that do this may utilize in house severe weather outlooks that vary to some degree from spc convective outlooks while certain others that have switched to current system have chosen not to outline marginal risk areas generally convective outlook boundaries or lines general thunderstorms light green marginal dark green slight yellow enhanced orange moderate red and high purple will be continued as an arrow or line not filled with color if risk area enters another country canada or mexico or across waters beyond united states coastline this indicates that risk for severe weather is also valid in that general area of other side of border or oceanic boundary mesoscale discussions spc mesoscale discussions mds once covered convection mesoscale convective discussions mcds and precipitation mesoscale precipitation discussions mpds mpds are now issued by weather prediction center wpc mcds generally precede issuance of a tornado or severe thunderstorm watch by one to three hours when possible mesoscale discussions are designed to give local forecasters an update on a region where a severe weather threat is emerging and an indication of whether a watch is likely and details thereof as well as situations of isolated severe weather when watches are not necessary mcds contain meteorological information on what is happening and what is expected to occur in next few hours and forecast reasoning in regard to weather watches mesoscale discussions are often issued to update information on watches already in effect and sometimes when one is to be canceled mesoscale discussions are occasionally used as advance notice of a categorical upgrade of a scheduled convective outlook example thumb graphic associated with example mesoscale discussion weather watches watches wws issued by spc are generally less than in area and are normally preceded by a mesoscale discussion watches are intended to be issued preceding arrival of severe weather by one to six hours they indicate that conditions are favorable for thunderstorms capable of producing various modes of severe weather including large hail damaging straight line winds and or tornadoes in case of severe thunderstorm watches organized severe thunderstorms are expected but conditions are not thought to be especially favorable for tornadoes although they can occur in such areas where one is in effect and some severe thunderstorm watch statements issued by spc may note a threat of isolated tornadic activity if conditions are of modest favorability for storm rotation capable of inducing them whereas for tornado watches conditions are thought to be favorable for severe thunderstorms to produce tornadoes in situations where a forecaster expects a significant threat of extremely severe and life threatening weather a watch with special enhanced wording particularly dangerous situation pds is subjectively issued it is occasionally issued with tornado watches normally for potential of major tornado outbreaks especially those with a significant threat of multiple tornadoes capable of producing f4 ef4 and f5 ef5 damage and or staying on ground for long duration sometimes uninterrupted paths a pds severe thunderstorm watch is very rare and is typically reserved for derecho events impacting densely populated areas watches are not warnings where there is an immediate severe weather threat to life and property although severe thunderstorm and tornado warnings are ideally next step after watches watches cover a threat of organized severe thunderstorms over a larger area and may not always precede a warning watch busts do sometimes occur should thunderstorm activity not occur at all or that which does develop never reaches originally forecast level of severity warnings are issued by local national weather service offices not storm prediction center which is a national guidance center process of issuing a convective watch begins with a conference call from spc to local nws offices if after collaboration a watch is deemed necessary storm prediction center will issue a watch approximation product which is followed by local nws office issuing a specific county based watch product latter product is responsible for triggering public alert messages via television radio stations and noaa weather radio watch approximation product outlines specific regions covered by watch including approximate outlined area in statute miles and its time of expiration based on local time zone s of areas under watch associated potential threats a meteorological synopsis of atmospheric conditions favorable for severe thunderstorm development forecasted aviation conditions and a pre determined message informing public of meaning behind watch and to be vigilant of any warnings or weather statements that may be issued by their local national weather service office watch outline products provide a visual map depiction of issued watch spc typically delineates watches within this product in form of boxes which technically are represented as either squares rectangles horizontal or vertical or depending on area it covers jurisdictions outlined by county based watch product as being included in watch area may differ from actual watch box as such certain counties parishes or boroughs not covered by fringes of watch box may actually be included in watch and vice versa watches can be expanded contracted by removing jurisdictions where spc and nws forecasters no longer consider there to be a viable threat of severe weather in which case watch box may take on a trapezoidal representation in map based watch products or canceled before their set time of expiration by local nws offices example thumb right 310px graphic associated with example watch fire weather products day 3 8 probability to categorical fire weather outlook conversion

and relative humidity an extremely critical fire weather area for wind and relative humidity and a critical fire weather area for dry thunderstorms outlook type depends on forecast weather conditions severity of predicted threat and local climatology of a forecast region see text is a map label used for outlining areas where fire potential is great enough to pose a limited threat but not enough to warrant a critical area similar to areas using same notation title that were formerly outlined in convective outlooks critical fire weather areas for wind and relative humidity are typically issued when strong winds for florida and low relative humidity usually 20 are expected to occur where dried fuels exist similar to a slight enhanced or moderate risk of severe weather critical fire weather areas for dry thunderstorms are typically issued when widespread or numerous thunderstorms producing rainfall of little accumulation to provide sufficient ground wetting are expected to occur where dried fuels exist extremely critical fire weather areas for wind and relative humidity are issued when very strong winds and very low humidity are expected to occur with very dry fuels extremely critical areas are issued relatively rarely similar to very low frequency of high risk areas in convective outlooks see list of storm prediction center extremely critical days see also national
