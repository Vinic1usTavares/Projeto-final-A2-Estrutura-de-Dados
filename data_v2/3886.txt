1759 battle of ticonderoga was a minor confrontation at fort carillon later renamed fort ticonderoga on july 26 and 27 1759 during french and indian war a british military force of more than 11 000 men under command of general sir jeffery amherst moved artillery to high ground overlooking fort which was defended by a garrison of 400 frenchmen under command of brigadier general francois charles de bourlamaque rather than defend fort de bourlamaque operating under instructions from general louis joseph de montcalm and new france s governor marquis de vaudreuil withdrew his forces and attempted to blow up fort fort s powder magazine was destroyed but its walls were not severely damaged british then occupied fort which was afterwards known by name fort ticonderoga they embarked on a series of improvements to area and began construction of a fleet to conduct military operations on lake champlain french tactics were sufficient to prevent amherst s army from joining james wolfe at battle of plains of abraham however they also tied up 3 000 of their own troops that were not able to assist in quebec s defense capture of fort which had previously repulsed a large british army a year earlier contributed to what british called annus mirabilis of 1759 background french and indian war which started in 1754 over territorial disputes in what are now western pennsylvania and upstate new york had finally turned in favor of british in 1758 following a string of defeats in 1756 and 1757 british were successful in capturing louisbourg and fort frontenac in 1758 only significant french victory in 1758 came when a large british army commanded by james abercrombie was defeated by a smaller french force in battle of carillon during following winter french commanders

february france s war minister marshal belle isle notified general louis joseph de montcalm who was responsible for defense of canada that he would not receive any significant support from france due in large part to english naval domination of atlantic and risks associated with sending a large military force under those circumstances belle isle impressed on montcalm importance of maintaining at least a foothold in north america as territory would be virtually impossible to retake otherwise montcalm responded unless we have unexpected luck or stage a diversion elsewhere within north america canada will fall during coming campaign season english have 60 000 men we have 11 000 mclynn 2004 p 135 montcalm decided to focus french manpower on defending core territory of canada montreal city of

300 were assigned to fort carillon parkman 1898 volume 2 p 2003 pp 22 44 he knew after his own experience in previous year s battle there that this force was too small to hold carillon against a determined attack by a force with competent leaders parkman 1898 volume 2 p 185 instructions from montcalm and new france s governor marquis de vaudreuil to de bourlamaque were to hold carillon as long as possible then to destroy it as well as nearby fort st frederic before retreating toward montreal mclynn 2004 p 154 british advance and french retreat although general amherst had been ordered to move his forces as early in year as on or about 7th of may if season shall happen to permit amherst s army of 11 000 did not leave southern shores of lake george until july 21 there were several reasons for late departure one was logistical prideaux s expedition to forts oswego and niagara also departed from albany anderson 2000 p 340 another was slow arrival of provincial militias mclynn

reports that french were actively loading bateaux at fort kingsford 1890 p 332 his original plan had been to flank fort denying road to fort st frederic as a means of french escape in absence of french resistance outside fort he decided instead to focus his attention on fort itself hamilton 1964 p 94 for next three days british entrenched and began laying siege lines to establish positions near fort this work was complicated by fact there was little ground near fort and sandbags were required to protect siege works during this time french gun batteries fired at times quite heavily on british positions on july 25 a detachment of rogers rangers launched some boats onto lake north of fort and cut a log boom french had placed to prevent ships from moving further north on lake hamilton

to still be in french hands forty men were taken prisoner retreating french destroyed fort st frederic on july 31 leaving way clear for british to begin military operations on lake champlain denying british access to champlain had been reason for existence of both forts however french had a small armed fleet which would first need to be neutralized bradley 1902 p 340 time needed to capture and effect some repairs to two forts as well as need to build ships for use on lake champlain delayed amherst s forces further and prevented him from joining general wolfe at siege of quebec mclynn 2004 p
