single of 2011 in finland to promote album vartiainen embarked on a concert tour titled seili spanning from april 2010 to august 2011 and consisting of 170 shows background and composition thematically more polarized than its predecessor ihmisten edessa seili has been described as being based on contrasts as it deals with both darker and happier themes and combines elements of classical music with pop and schlager melodies with rock vartiainen has said overall inspiration for album came from imagery of movie blade runner and songs from 1980s she used in her programs during her figure skating career name of album symbolizes a trip to an unknown island an escape from normal life to world of music and content of album places during dramatical moments between 3 am and 5 am when a day ends a new one begins and people are as vartiainen has put it sensitive to new ideas due to either fatigue or intoxication vartiainen attributes dualistic nature of album to her professional relation with lyricists mariska and teemu brunila who vartiainen is also friends with saying mariska knows well vartiainen s darker more philosophical side in an interview with dome fi in march 2010 vartiainen said that while mariska represents dark and serious themes such as death brunila with his lyrical products goes towards light and that point in album is to reflect on life and death along with two thematical polarities album deals also with tricky relationships and hunger for fame as showcased by western sounding nettiin which starts with a banjo and a bass and is literally about naked pictures taken and publicized by an ex boyfriend and about line between privacy and publicity album introduces also more instruments than ihmisten edessa vartiainen starts album by playing piano in dark koti home second song seili is also dark themed song is about namesake island located in archipelago off coast of turku where leprotic and mentally ill patients were sent from 17th century onwards along with boards they could build their own coffins with third song and lead single en haluu kuolla tana yona in english i don t wanna die tonight goes on with theme though with an electronic dance beat that emphasizes will to live fifth song and third single missa muruseni on where my sweetheart is was written by mariska who got inspiration for song while reading indian erotic literature on her balcony on a hot summer s day song is a ballad where singer talks about being far away from her loved one and asks wind to blow to place where one s sweetheart is by november 2010 lyrics had even found their way to finnish obituaries and gravestones sixth dance influenced song and first promotional single duran duran is about discovering one s soulmate as lyrics wonder whether this is how it feels like when you find right one along with saying jenni can t escape this new feeling vartiainen entered new musical territories also by playing piano and kantele in song kiittamaton ungrateful which is written by vartiainen and paula vesala and deals with agony vartiainen suffered from while growing up during high school critical reception seili has received mixed to positive reviews from music critics most of reviewers have been appreciative of vocals and successful combination of synthpop and darker ballads but more or less critical with notable contrast between thumping pop song nettiin and rest of album and vartiainen s lack of peculiarity teemu fiilin of magazine rumba gave seili three out of five stars saying that seili follows pretty much schlager ish pattern of a poet girl s inflated electro pop he complimented en haluu kuolla tana yona as a brilliant pop song suitable to be sung by a then 27 year old jenni vartiainen who is enjoying her life due to accompaniment of more poetical dramatical and mature songs written by mariska fiilin considered nettiin a really epic fail that would be a lot of fun if performed by tea on kids top 20 he thought duran duran is also brilliant but considered vartiainen to be more talented with faster songs because she when singing melancholic songs lags kilometers behind singer chisu pop rock magazine stara said album is not as good at first hearing as vartiainen s debut ihmisten edessa but it gave album four out five stars magazine complimented aggregate of en haluu kuolla tana yona and beauty and elegance of duran duran stara was less harsh on reviewing inclusion of nettiin saying western themed sounds seem a bit odd but that song is good in its entirety helsingin sanomat gave song three out of five stars saying album is suitable but that vartiainen does not stand out at all with song selections and singing voice as chisu does mtv3 gave song four and a half stars out of five criticizing inclusion of nettiin for sake of consistency and saying none of songs are particularly catchy however mtv3 complimented kiittamaton duran duran and eiko kukaan voi meita pelastaa for their massive sounds and considered seili a brilliant summer album writing for rock magazine soundi antti gave seili three out of five stars saying songwriters teemu brunila and mariska and producer jukka immonen gain credibility for putting dark piano ballads and thumping pop songs into balance creating a coherent and compact entirety magazine said vartiainen s singing voice saves album though it regarded many of songs as hypocritical or even tasteless such as nettiin keskisuomalainen deemed album s rating as four stars out of five newspaper considered seili a splendid entirety that however lacks that one ingenious song that stands out from others saying also that record name of which comes from island where leprotic patients and mentally ill were sent from 17th century onwards is elaborate pop that deals with most fundamental questions in conclusion keskisuomalainen said that album is a successful combination of introverted ethereality light hearted pop and dramatical thunder chart performance upon its digital release in april 2010 seili debuted at number one on finnish albums chart album went gradually down to number seven in early august after which it vacillated between seven and four seili rose
