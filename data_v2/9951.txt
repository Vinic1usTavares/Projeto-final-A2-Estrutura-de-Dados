strange strabo s not saying a word about emesa claims have been made that emesa was founded by seleucus i nicator who established seleucid empire upon death of alexander great however according to henri seyrig emesa does not seem to have received any greek colony and authors complete silence makes one think that it did not increase its visibility under seleucid kings according to henri seyrig

devoid of a real urban existence according to maamoun abdulkarim occupation of citadel s tell does not confirm existence of a real urban center in plain before roman period and recent excavations have
