fourth fitna or great abbasid civil war resulted from conflict between brothers al amin and al ma mun over succession to throne of abbasid caliphate their father caliph harun al rashid had named al amin as first successor but had also named al ma mun as second with khurasan granted to him as an appanage later a third son al qasim had been designated as third successor after harun died in 809 al amin succeeded him in baghdad encouraged by baghdad court al amin began trying to subvert autonomous status of khurasan and al qasim was quickly sidelined in response al ma mun sought support of provincial elites of khurasan and made moves to assert his own autonomy as rift between two brothers and their respective camps widened al amin declared his own son musa as his heir and assembled a large army in 811 al amin s troops marched against khurasan but al ma mun s general tahir ibn husayn defeated them in battle of rayy and then invaded iraq and besieged baghdad itself city fell after a year al amin was executed and al ma mun became caliph al ma mun chose to remain in khurasan however rather than coming to capital this allowed power vacuum which civil war had fostered in caliphate s provinces to grow and several local rulers sprang up in jazira syria and egypt in addition pro khurasani policies followed by al ma mun s powerful chief minister al fadl ibn sahl and al ma mun s espousal of an alid succession in person of ali al alienated traditional baghdad elites who saw themselves increasingly marginalized consequently al ma mun s uncle ibrahim was proclaimed rival caliph at baghdad in 817 forcing al ma mun to intervene personally fadl ibn sahl was assassinated and al ma mun left khurasan for baghdad which he entered in 819 next years saw consolidation of al ma mun s authority and re incorporation of western provinces against local rebels a process not completed until pacification of egypt in 827 some local rebellions however notably that of khurramites dragged on for far longer into 830s historians have interpreted conflict variously in words of iranologist elton l daniel it has been regard as a conflict over succession between a rather incompetent besotted al amin and his shrewdly competent brother al ma mun as product of harem intrigues as an extension of personal rivalry between ministers al fadl b rabi and al fadl b sahl or as a struggle between arabs and persians for control of government background thumb right upright 1 2 map of muslim expansion and muslim world under umayyad and early abbasid caliphates origins of civil war lie in succession arrangements of harun al rashid as well as internal political dynamics of abbasid caliphate two main contenders muhammad al amin and abdallah al ma mun were born six months apart in ah 170 786 7 with al ma mun being elder it was al amin however who was named first heir in 792 while al ma mun followed in 799 a sequence which was influenced by their lines of descent and their political implications al amin had a solidly abbasid lineage being harun s son by herself descended from second abbasid caliph al mansur while al ma mun s mother was a persian concubine from in khurasan while al ma mun s origin was less prestigious than purely arab al amin his ties to khurasan and iranian dominated eastern provinces were an important factor in his choice as heir in contrast to exclusively arab ruled umayyad caliphate abbasid state was under heavy iranian and particularly khurasani influence abbasid revolution which brought abbasids to power originated in khurasan and abbasid dynasty relied heavily on khurasanis as military leaders and administrators many of original khurasani arab army that came west with abbasids were given estates in iraq and new abbasid capital baghdad and became an elite group known as abna al dawla sons of state dynasty khurasan retained a privileged position among caliphate s provinces and harun al rashid in particular was careful to cultivate his ties with iranian element of caliphate not least through his promotion of khurasani barmakid family to positions of power both al amin and al ma mun had been tutored in their youth by barmakids al amin by al fadl ibn yahya and al ma mun by ja far ibn yahya while al amin would distance himself from barmakids and become closely associated with abna aristocracy of baghdad al ma mun remained influenced by ja far and his associates in 802 harun and most powerful officials of abbasid government made pilgrimage to mecca where definitive succession arrangement was drawn up al amin would succeed harun in baghdad but al ma mun would remain al amin s heir and would additionally rule over an enlarged and practically independent khurasan a third son al qasim al mu tamin was also added as third heir and received responsibility over frontier areas with byzantine empire stipulations of agreement extensively recorded by historian al tabari may however have been distorted by later apologists of al ma mun especially as regards extent of autonomy granted to al ma mun s eastern viceroyalty almost immediately after it returned to baghdad in january 803 abbasid court witnessed abrupt fall of barmakid family from power on one hand this decision may reflect fact that barmakids may have become indeed too powerful for caliph s liking but its timing suggests that it was tied to succession issue as well with al amin siding with abna and al ma mun with barmakids and two camps becoming more estranged every day if al amin was to have a chance to succeed power of barmakids had to be broken indeed years after fall of barmakids saw an increasing centralization of administration and concomitant rise of influence of abna many of whom were now dispatched to take up positions as provincial governors and bring these provinces under closer control from baghdad this led to unrest in provinces especially khurasan where according to elton l daniel abbasid policies fluctuated between two extremes one governor would attempt to extract as much wealth as he could from province for benefit of iraq central government and not infrequently himself when people protested loudly enough such governors would be temporarily replaced by ones who would attend to local interests khurasani elites had a long standing rivalry with abna although latter now resided chiefly in what is now iraq they insisted on retaining control of khurasani affairs and demanded that province s revenues be sent west to supply their salaries something strongly resisted by local arab and iranian elites resulting tension was eased when al fadl ibn yahya universally praised as a model governor was appointed to khurasan in 793 but was re fanned in 796 when a member of abna ali ibn isa ibn mahan was placed in charge of province his harsh taxation measures provoked increasing unrest which expressed itself in kharijite uprisings and finally a rebellion by governor of samarkand rafi ibn al layth this uprising forced harun himself accompanied by al ma mun and powerful chamberlain hajib and chief minister al fadl ibn al rabi to travel to province in 808 al ma mun was sent ahead with part of army to marv while harun stayed at tus where he died on 24 march 809 civil war between al amin and al ma mun 809 813 upon harun s death al amin ascended throne in baghdad where his popularity was great while al ma mun remained at marv from where he planned to campaign against remaining rebels however al amin recalled army and treasury from east leaving al ma mun with little in way of military forces it was in this time that al ma mun came to rely upon his wazir former barmakid protege al fadl ibn sahl who began to implement a policy of conciliation and cooperation with local elites whose autonomy and privileges were guaranteed covenant of 802 however soon began to fall apart over baghdad s centralizing ambitions and dispute over status of khurasan abna led by ali ibn isa whom harun had imprisoned but who was now set free and appointed head of caliph s bodyguard were joined by other influential officials chief amongst them al fadl ibn al rabi in demanding that khurasan and its revenue return to direct control of central government even if that meant breaking stipulations of mecca agreement some modern scholars have tried to interpret conflict between two brothers as a confrontation between arab and iranian elements of caliphate represented by two contenders mothers it is true that iranian dominated east generally backed al ma mun but neither was al amin a conscious champion of arabism nor was support for al ma mun result of his iranian origin although his supporters did make propaganda among local population for son of their sister al ma mun enjoyed support of local elites of khurasan mainly because they saw in him a champion of their newly won autonomy and because he himself assiduously cultivated that support later during war prospect of his victory also offered khurasanis promise of a yet more privileged position in new regime however conflict was first and foremost a dynastic dispute with al amin attempting to institute a direct patrilineal succession in this he did othing but follow footsteps of his predecessors since al mansur who all had to struggle against claims of brothers or cousins harun al rashid himself was even imprisoned during brief reign of his elder brother al hadi given to indolence and lacking any political ability himself al amin entrusted this project to al fadl ibn al rabi who is generally portrayed as evil genious behind al amin and one of main instigators of conflict very quickly al amin moved to sideline youngest brother qasim initially qasim was removed him from his governorship of jazira but soon after he was stripped altogether of his place in succession and placed under guard at baghdad it was only because al ma mun resided far from caliph s immediate area of control that he escaped sharing this fate rift between two camps manifested itself in 810 when al amin added his own son musa to list of succession al amin then sent a delegation to marv asking al ma mun to return to baghdad after al ma mun fearing for his safety refused al amin began to interfere with his brother s domain he protested al ma mun s pardon to ibn al layth after his surrender and asked for tribute from governors of western provinces of khurasan as a sign of submission he then demanded of his brother cession of western regions of khurasan admission of caliphal tax and postal agents into province and forwarding of khurasan s revenue to baghdad al ma mun who could not rely on large military forces and whose position was consequently weak was at first inclined to accede to his brother s demands but al fadl ibn sahl dissuaded him from this course and encouraged him to seek support among native population of khurasan who also opposed control by caliphal court al ma mun who was already favourably regarded after excesses of ali ibn isa consciously set about to cultivate support of local population reducing taxes dispensing justice in person conceding privileges to native princes and evoking episodes from beginnings of abbasid movement in province he now became a political magnet for iranian sympathisers el hibri refused to cede his province or return to baghdad and began to gather around him those dissatisfied with baghdad s centralizing policies or who had simply been left out of share of spoils and power after abbasid revolution under influence of their respective chief ministers al amin and al ma mun took steps that further polarized political climate and made breach irreparable after al ma mun symbolically removed al amin s name from his coins and from friday prayer in november 810 al amin removed al ma mun and al mu tamin from succession and nominated his own sons musa and abdallah instead al ma mun replied by declaring himself imam a religious title which shied of directly challenging caliph but nevertheless implied independent authority as well as hearkening back to early days of hashimiyya movement which had carried abbasids to power despite reservations of some of his senior ministers and governors two months later in january 811 al amin formally began civil war when he appointed ali ibn isa governor of khurasan placed him at head of an unusually large army of 40 000 men drawn from abna and sent him to depose al ma mun when ali ibn isa set out for khurasan he reportedly took along a set of silver chains with which to bind al ma mun and carry him back to baghdad news of ali s approach threw khurasan into panic and even al ma mun considered fleeing only military force available to him was a small army of some 4 000 5 000 men under tahir ibn al husayn tahir was sent to confront ali s advance but it was widely regarded as almost a suicide mission even by tahir s own father two armies met at rayy on western borders of khurasan and ensuing battle on 3 july 811 resulted in a crushing victory for khurasanis in which ali was killed and his army disintegrated on its flight west tahir s unexpected victory was decisive al ma mun s position was secured while his main opponents abna lost men prestige and their most dynamic leader tahir now advanced westwards defeated another abna army of 20 000 under abd al rahman ibn jabala after a series of hard fought engagements near hamadan and reached by winter al amin now desperately tried to bolster his forces by alliances with arab tribes notably banu shayban of jazira and qays of syria veteran abd al malik ibn salih was sent to syria to mobilize its troops along with ali ibn isa s son husayn however al amin s efforts failed due to long standing intertribal divisions between qaysis and syrians reluctance to get involved in civil war as well as unwillingness of abna to cooperate with arab tribes and to make political concessions to them these failed efforts to secure arab tribal support backfired on al amin as abna began to doubt whether their interests were best served by him in march 812 husayn ibn ali led a short lived coup against al amin in baghdad proclaiming al ma mun as rightful caliph until a counter coup led by other factions within abna restored al amin to throne fadl ibn al rabi however one of main instigators of war concluded that al amin s case was lost and resigned from his court offices at about same time al ma mun was officially proclaimed caliph while fadl ibn sahl acquired unique title of dhu l ri he of two signifying his control over both civil and military administration upright 1 2 thumb right map of iraq and surrounding regions in early ninth century in spring 812 tahir reinforced with more troops under harthama ibn a yan resumed his offensive he invaded khuzistan where he defeated and killed governor muhammad ibn yazid whereupon muhallabids of basra surrendered to him tahir also took kufa and al mada in advancing on baghdad from west while harthama closed in from east at same time al amin s authority crumbled as supporters of al ma mun took control of mosul egypt and hejaz while most of syria armenia and adharbayjan fell under control of local arab tribal leaders as tahir s army closed on baghdad rift between al amin and abna was solidified when desperate caliph turned to common people of city for help and gave them arms abna began deserting to tahir in droves and in august 812 when tahir s army appeared before city he established his quarters in suburb of traditionally an abna stronghold historian hugh n kennedy characterized subsequent siege of city as an episode almost without parallel in history of early islamic society and nearest early islamic history saw to an attempt at social revolution as baghdad s urban proletariat defended their city for over a year in a vicious urban guerrilla war indeed it was this revolutionary situation in city as much as famine and besiegers professional expertise that brought about its fall in september 813 tahir convinced some of richer citizens to cut pontoon bridges over tigris that connected city to outside world allowing al ma mun s men to occupy city s eastern suburbs al ma mun s troops then launched a final assault in which al amin was captured and executed at tahir s orders while trying to seek refuge with his old family friend harthama while al ma mun was probably not implicated in act it was politically convenient as it left him both de jure and de facto legitimate caliph dominance and reaction 813 819 nevertheless regicide soured al ma mun s victory tahir was soon transferred out of public eye to an unimportant post in raqqa but his deed lastingly tarnished prestige and image of abbasid dynasty according to elton daniel it shattered sacrosanct aura which had surrounded person of abbasid caliphs for first time an abbasid ruler had been humiliated and put to death by rebellious subjects as al ma mun remained in marv and made no signs of returning to caliphal capital a wave of arab antipathy towards al ma mun and his persian supporters came to fore in western regions of caliphate particularly in baghdad and surroundings which feared being degraded to a mere province this was furthered when new caliph entrusted governance of state to fadl ibn sahl who intended to permanently move muslim world s centre of power eastwards to khurasan where he and his circle could control reins of power to exclusion of other groups fadl was also responsible for side lining many other supporters of al ma mun thus when harthama ibn a yan went to marv to inform al ma mun of real situation in west sahlids turned caliph against him and he was executed on charges of treason in june 816 in response harthama s son hatim led a short lived revolt in armenia result of these policies was that revolts and local power struggles erupted across caliphate with only khurasan and frontier districts with byzantine empire exempt from this turmoil iraq in particular descended into near anarchy new governor of iraq fadl s brother al hasan ibn sahl soon lost support of abna local population s alienation from his regime was exploited by zaydi alids who on 26 january 815 rose in revolt at kufa led by former general abu l saraya al sirri revolt spread quickly through iraq region as various groups with old grievances against abbasids used opportunity to exact revenge thus at basra revolt was led by alid zayd a son of imam musa al kadhim who had been executed in 799 on harun al rashid s orders uprising came close to threatening baghdad itself and it was only through intervention of capable harthama that it was quelled with abu l saraya being captured and executed in october secondary pro alid movements also seized control of yemen under ibrahim al jazzar another son of musa al kadhim and including mecca where muhammad al a grandson of alid imam ja far al sadiq was proclaimed caliph in november 815 suppression of these revolts was entrusted to ali ibn isa s son hamdawayh with an army of abna hamdawayh was successful in subduing these provinces but then attempted unsuccessfully to secede from caliphate himself in 816 to bolster his flagging prestige al ma mun assumed title god s caliph taking note of widespread alid support in his western provinces al ma mun not only spared lives of various alid anti caliphs but on 24 march 817 also named alid ali ibn musa al rida a third son of musa al kadhim as his heir apparent and even changed official dynastic colour from abbasid black to alid green although seriousness of al ma mun s commitment to alid succession is uncertain there are suggestions that ali al rida was so old that he could hardly be expected to actually succeed al ma mun its impact was disastrous not only did it fail to produce any tangible popular support but also provoked an uproar among members of abbasid dynasty in baghdad hasan ibn sahl had already been forced to abandon city where various factional leaders now shared power and news of alid succession ruined his attempts at conciliation instead on 17 july 817 members of abbasid family in baghdad nominated a new caliph of their own harun al rashid s younger brother ibrahim ibrahim received broad backing from baghdad elites from abbasid princes like al ma mun s younger brother abu ishaq future caliph al mu tasim to old established members of bureaucracy like fadl ibn al rabi who returned to his office as hajib and leaders of abna as scholar mohamed rekaya commented in other words it was a revival of war between two camps baghdad and khurasan dormant since 813 thumb right upright 1 2 imam reza shrine erected over grave of ali ibn musa al rida ibrahim moved to secure control of iraq but although he captured kufa hasan ibn sahl who had made wasit his base of operations managed to get to basra first however governor of egypt abd al aziz al azdi recognized ibrahim as caliph in khurasan sahlids at first downplayed events at baghdad falsely informing al ma mun that ibrahim had merely been declared governor amir rather than caliph finally in december 817 ali al rida succeeded in revealing to al ma mun real situation in iraq and convinced him that turmoil in caliphate was far greater than sahlids presented it to be and that a reconciliation with baghdad was necessary al ma mun now resolved to assume personal control of his empire and on 22 january 818 he left marv and began a very slow journey west to baghdad fadl ibn sahl was murdered on 13 february probably on al ma mun s orders although rest of his family was spared a persecution like that which had befallen barmakids indeed hasan ibn sahl was for time being confirmed in his brother s position and al ma mun was betrothed to one of his daughters ali al rida also died during march on 5 september possibly of poison his burial place at now known as mashhad place of martyrdom was to become a major shi a pilgrimage site in meantime back in baghdad ibrahim faced desertions rebellions and conspiracies one of which involved his half brother al mansur hasan ibn sahl was able to use this turmoil and advance north capturing mada in as months passed discontent in baghdad grew ibrahim s supporters including fadl ibn al rabi began abandoning him and in april and july 819 there was a plot to take ibrahim captive and surrender him to al ma mun s forces narrowly escaping from this conspiracy ibrahim abandoned throne and went into hiding opening path for al ma mun to reclaim baghdad on 17 august 819 al ma mun entered baghdad without resistance and political turmoil quickly subsided al ma mun now set about to reconcile himself with opposition he rescinded alid succession restored black as dynastic colour sent hasan ibn sahl into retirement and recalled tahir from his exile in raqqa al ma mun did however retain title of imam which became part of standard caliphal titulature during 812 813 siege of baghdad tahir had established close ties with abna which now proved useful in smoothing their acceptance of al ma mun tahir was further rewarded with governorship of khurasan in september 821 and when he died in october 822 he was succeeded by his son talha for next fifty years tahirid line would provide governors of a vast eastern province centred on khurasan while also providing governors of baghdad securing city s loyalty to caliphal government even after capital was moved to samarra reunification and pacification of caliphate 820 837 at time al ma mun entered baghdad western provinces of caliphate had slipped away from effective abbasid control with local rulers claiming various degrees of autonomy from central government egypt had become divided between two bitterly hostile factions one under ubayd allah ibn al sari which had come to control fustat and south while his rival ali ibn abd al aziz al jarawi and his qaysi arabs controlled north of country around nile delta in addition alexandria was in hands of a group of andalusian exiles in northern syria and jazira traditionally dominant qays tribe had taken control led by abdallah ibn and nasr ibn shabath al ifriqiya had fallen under control of aghlabids while yemen was troubled by pro alid revolts perhaps most threatening rebellion of all was anti muslim khurramite movement which controlled large parts of adharbayjan and armenia to face these insurgencies al ma mun turned to another of tahir s sons abdallah ibn tahir to whom he entrusted command of his army ibn tahir first targeted nasr ibn shabath in northern syria and jazira nasr was willing to acknowledge al ma mun s authority but demanded concessions for his followers and remained hostile to abbasids persian officials so that he had to be browbeaten into submission by a show of force before his capital in 824 825 after securing his northern flank ibn tahir marched through syria into egypt there two rivals although not opposed in principle to al ma mun as caliph were eager to maintain status quo and had already repulsed an invasion in 824 under khalid ibn yazid ibn mazyad ibn tahir however managed to outmanoeuvre both so that ali al jarawi quickly went over to him leaving ubayd allah to submit and face deportation to baghdad in alexandria ibn tahir secured departure of andalusians who left city for byzantine island of crete which they conquered and transformed into a muslim emirate on his return to baghdad in 827 abdallah ibn tahir received a triumphal reception and was appointed governor of khurasan in 828 replacing talha his place in west was taken over by al ma mun s younger brother abu ishaq al mu tasim in yemen another alid revolt broke out in 822 under abd al rahman ibn ahmad but al ma mun managed to secure his surrender by negotiations elsewhere however process of consolidation was harder or failed completely aghlabid controlled ifriqiya was confirmed in its autonomous status effectively slipping entirely from abbasid control while in adharbayjan al ma mun s general isa ibn abi khalid re established control over various local muslim lords in cities but was unable to suppress khurramite revolt expeditions were sent against khurramites under ibn ali al azdi in 824 and muhammad ibn humayd al ta i in 827 829 but both failed before mountainous terrain and khurramites guerrilla tactics with ibn humayd losing his life as well it was not until accession of al mu tasim who employed his new military corps composed of turkish slave soldiers mawali or ghilman against khurramites that their rebellion was suppressed in 837 after years of hard campaigning despite restoration of caliphal authority in most provinces caliphate continued to be troubled by rebellions rest of al ma mun s reign saw a series of uprisings by zutt in lower iraq a three year revolt against oppressive taxation in egypt in 829 in which both christian copts and muslims participated as well as unsuccessful revolt of ali ibn hisham ibn humayd s successor as governor of armenia and adharbayjan aftermath and impact thumb right upright 1 2 caliph al ma mun left as depicted in 13th century madrid skylitzes manuscript seen receiving embassy of john grammarian in 829 sent by byzantine emperor theophilos depicted right long civil war shattered social and political order of early abbasid state and a new system began to emerge under al ma mun which would characterize middle period of abbasid caliphate most tangible change was in elites who supported new regime abna old arab families and members of abbasid dynasty itself lost their positions in administrative and military machinery and with them their influence and power provinces of caliphate were now grouped into larger units often controlled by a hereditary dynasty like tahirids in khurasan or samanids in transoxiana usually of iranian descent at same time however al ma mun tried to lessen his dependence on iranian element of his empire and counterbalanced them through creation of two new military corps his brother abu ishaq s turkish slaves and arab tribal army of byzantine frontier which was now reorganized and placed under command of al ma mun s son al abbas this system was further elaborated and acquired its definite characteristics in reign of abu ishaq al mu tasim who created a tightly controlled centralized state and expanded his turkish corps into an effective military force with which he waged campaigns against byzantines and internal rebellions alike turkish leaders came to political power as provincial governors while old arab and iranian elites were completely sidelined al ma mun s victory also had repercussions in abbasid official theological doctrine in 829 al ma mun adopted mu tazilism in an attempt reconcile doctrinal differences in islam and reduce social inequities at same time willingness of al ma mun and his successors to embrace non arab populations of caliphate especially in iranian east as well as to entrust governance of these provinces to local dynasties with considerable autonomy helped to end a long series of religious rebellions and reconciled these populations to islam rate of conversion during al ma mun s reign increased markedly and that was time when most of local princely families of iranian lands finally became muslims as el hibri comments in time this development represented a prelude to emergence of autonomous
