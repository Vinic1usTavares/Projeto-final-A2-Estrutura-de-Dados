thumb tromso satellite station 2013 tromso satellite station tss until 1988 known as tromso telemetry station is a satellite earth station located in tromso norway facility is owned by kongsberg satellite services ksat a joint venture between kongsberg group and norwegian space centre nsc in addition to hosting its own antennas serving thirty satellites tss acts as center point of ksat s operations and provides backbone services for high arctic svalbard satellite station svalsat and antarctic troll satellite station trollsat originally proposed in 1965 station was established by royal norwegian council for scientific and industrial research ntnf in 1967 in close cooperation with norwegian defence research establishment ndre and located adjacent to tromso geophysical observatory from its inception until 1974 it served low earth orbit leo satellites operated by european space research organization esro to a lesser extent it was also used by canadian space agency and national aeronautics and space administration nasa leo satellites norway s non membership in esro and later european space agency esa caused tromso to not become a ground station for landsat a gradual increase in operations occurred from 1982 such as for international cospas sarsat programme and european remote sensing satellite tss became part of nsc in 1990 although it was partially sold to swedish space corporation ssc in 1995 svalsat merged with tss in 2002 to form ksat history establishment and use by esro first proposals for a telemetry station in tromso were made in early 1964 concept was to build a real time telemetry station which would allow for simultaneous observations of ionosphere from both satellites and sounding rockets idea was backed by norway s space research committee ideas for a real time telemetry station also arose in esro and ntnf included project in its five year space program in 1965 similar proposals were made in northern sweden and a race started between norwegian and swedish interests to gain esro s support for a station norway had budgetary limitations prohibiting a full scale station and instead support was gained from united states and canada project was also backed by ndre rodberg 16 choice of tromso as a location for a telemetry stations was in part tied to tromso geophysical observatory which had been located in tromso since 1928 and planned university of tromso 374 canadian space agency was at time working on alouette 2 program and were seen by ndre as a natural cooperation partner nasa s international satellite for ionospheric studies was also being designed and nasa therefore decided to supply equipment for a telemetry station in tromso to be operational by august 1966 rodberg 17 parallel to ndre s work ntnf was working with esro to gain support for a telemetry station there was a degree of urgency as esro wanted facility completed by 1967 in time for launch of spacecraft esro 2 ntnf and esro were also working on establishment of kongsfjord telemetry station in ny alesund agreement to build station was approved by parliament of norway in mid 1966 part of reason for norwegian support was opportunity of training norwegians in pulse code modulation and digital computing for ndre station was a chance to apply its latest minicomputer simulation for automatic machinery sam a major planning issue was need for a minicomputer at station ndre argued that it was fully capable of delivering such a system but ntnf instead wanted to minimize risk by buying pdp 8 from digital equipment corporation in united states however ndre was awarded contract in part because of ntnf s obligation to support norwegian technology and in part because ndre agreed to purchase a suitable foreign computer if they could not successfully manufacture one themselves 260 a new minicomputer sam 2 was built at ndre and completed in april 1967 it was first computer built in europe and among first three in world which used integrated circuits 29 sam 2 was so successful that developers established norsk data to commercialize technology wormdal 37 thumb esro 2b one of early users of tss contract with esro resulted in tss providing telemetry for esro ia esro ib esro 2b heos 1 heos 2 td 1a and esro 4 all of which had low earth orbits rodberg 33 two telemetry stations used a large portion of norwegian space budget but became platforms which allowed for development of technology rodberg 18 tromso satellite station worked well in tandem with andoya rocket range and became an international center for study of auroral zone rodberg 27 university of tromso was established in 1968 and started teaching in 1972 same year it took over geophysical observatory and cosmic geophysics became one of university s fields of excellence rodberg 29 original contract with esro lasted until 1 july 1974 when their low earth orbit program terminated ntnf proposed closing tromso telemetry station as remaining customers did not provide sufficient revenue to keep operations viable norway also declined to join european space agency esa which resulted in little hope in esa choosing to cooperate with a norwegian earth station ntnf also looked into outright selling station to esa but offer was turned down kongsfjord telemetry station was closed in 1974 330 commercialization in 1973 ntnf started planning to use station for downloading from nasa s landsat program sufficient funding from government was secured in mid 1976 after a successful lobby operation which emphasized possibility of environmental observation in norway s territorial waters 7 5 million norwegian krone nok was granted for upgrades in 1977 norway entered negotiations with us but soon esa and nasa started discussions regarding two european telemetry stations for landsat to serve all esa members esa and sweden pushed for sweden to be location of esa s northern telemetry station and tromso was discarded because of norway s decision to not join esa rodberg 34 norway expanded its exclusive economic zone to in 1977 increasing country s land and sea area by more than one million square kilometers 400 000 sq mi because of reserves of fish and oil it became imperative for norwegian government to conduct surveillance ntnf therefore commenced work to establish an earth station for nasa s seasat which was approved by parliament in early 1977 a processing computer was developed as a cooperation between norwegian institute of technology ndre ntnf and norsk data which was tailored to analyze seasat s synthetic aperture radar sar and named computer of experimental sar seasat a failed after 104 days and tromso had by that time been used for telemetry for two minutes rodberg 35 tss did not became operational again until 1982 when international cospas sarsat programme made use of station ministry of trade and industry took a renewed interest in satellite station in early in 1980s and proposed in 1982 that norway join esa s european remote sensing satellite ers program rodberg 38 this started process of norway becoming a full member of esa in 1987 telemetry station received investments of nok 100 million during 1980s and was organized as a foundation in 1984 rodberg 48 it took name tromso satellite station in 1988 part of goal of project was to create technical spin offs one successful company was spacetec which had 45 employees at time it was bought by kongsberg defence aerospace in 1994 by then it had become a global manufacturer of earth observation ground stations rodberg 51 norwegian space centre was established as a foundation on 5 july 1987 under protection of ministry of trade and industry rodberg 41 it immediately took over andoya rocket range and tss followed suit in 1990 tss was upgraded in 1991 to be able to operate with ers 1 in 1995 established a subsidiary norwegian space centre property to own facilities in tromso and longyearbyen rodberg 42 same year tss was converted to a limited company of which half was sold to swedish space corporation ssc aim was that tss would operate as a fully commercial enterprise its first major contract was with canadian radarsat after rolf skar was appointed director of nsc plans were launched to try to win ground station contract for nasa s planned earth observing system eos nasa was considering locating ground station in greenland at mcmurdo station in antarctica or at in sweden skar invited a nasa delegation to visit svalbard wormdal 2011 38 and from 1996 nsc and nasa started negotiating a contract to establish a ground station at longyearbyen wormdal 2011 39 first satellite to use svalsat was landsat 7 which was launched on 15 april 1999 wormdal 2011 41 nsc bought ssc s ownership in tss and lockheed martin s ownership in svalsat in 2001 on 1 february 2002 nsc and kongsberg spacetec merged their interests in satellite technology and operations into kongsberg satellite station which became sole owner of both svalsat and tss legally kongsberg satellite services is a continuation of operating company of tss ksat opened troll satellite station in 2007 operations tss is owned and operated by kongsberg satellite services ksat which is again equally owned by kongsberg defence and aerospace and norwegian space centre latter which is an agency of ministry of trade and industry ksat is not tied to a particular operator of satellites and antennas communicate with multiple satellites thus reducing costs compared to dedicated ground stations for a typical satellite data is delivered to end customer no more than thirty minutes after downloading site is only able to communicate with leo satellites in ten of their fourteen orbits unlike svalsat and trollsat which can communicate in all orbits all three stations are interconnected and communicate with tromso network operations center which is part of tss complex this allows for redundancy as tss svalsat and trollsat can be used to communicate with all satellites connected to system operation center is responsible for backup scheduling and conflict resolution in addition to network planning customer support and ground station control facilities use interoperability and shared ground services such as a common protocol for communication and similar design of antennas to increase flexibility and reduce costs and risk antennas at tss serve more than thirty missions and contain both a multi frequency uplink and l s and x band downlink in addition there are customer owned reception telemetry tracking and control systems tss acts as a local user terminal for cospas sarsat system used for search and rescue by using a combination of svalsat and trollsat customers can download data twice per orbit twenty six times per day with only a forty minute maximum delay these are only two ground stations able to communicate with all orbits of leo satellites tromso is connected to svalsat via svalbard undersea cable system references bibliography
