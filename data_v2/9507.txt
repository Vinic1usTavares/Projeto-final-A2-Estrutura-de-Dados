battle of long khanh 6 7 june 1971 was fought during vietnam war between elements of 1st australian task force 1 atf and viet cong and north vietnamese army during operation overlord fighting saw australian infantry from 3rd battalion royal australian regiment 3 rar attack a heavily fortified communist base camp in long khanh province while centurion tanks providing close support crushed many bunkers and their occupants regardless viet cong fought hard to delay australian advance and although bunker system was subsequently captured along with a second system further south australians suffered a number of casualties and loss of a uh 1 iroquois helicopter with australians unable to concentrate sufficient combat power to achieve a decisive result bulk of viet cong and north vietnamese force successfully withdrew intact although they probably sustained heavy casualties in process background as a consequence of overall allied strategy of vietnamization and with australian government keen to reduce its own commitment to war 8 rar was not replaced at end of its tour of duty in december 1970 1 atf was again reduced to just two infantry battalions albeit with significant armour artillery and aviation support remaining australian area of operations ao remained same however with reduction in forces only adding further to burden on remaining battalions regardless following a sustained effort by 1 atf in phuoc tuy province between september 1969 and april 1970 bulk of communist forces had become inactive and had left province to recuperate accordingly australians shifted focus turning their attention to denying viet cong chance to resupply by close ambushing around villages and towns such as dat do and hoa long although not always successful such operations yielded significant results and by end of 1970 south vietnamese forces were increasingly responsible for security of major population centres indeed major battles of earlier years were now seen as a thing of past in phuoc tuy however in may 1971 following a request from brigadier bruce mcdonald task force commander australian ao was extended a further north across border into long khanh province several reconnaissance patrols from special air service regiment sasr were subsequently inserted in vicinity of courtenay rubber plantation and later on other side of route 2 these patrols were highly successful detecting presence of a substantial communist force while a number of viet cong were also killed prelude intelligence reports in june in conjunction with invaluable information gathered by sasr located d445 vc battalion and 3 33 nva regiment east of route 2 along border between phuoc tuy and long khanh in an area north of australian base at nui dat these reports indicated that communists were attempting to disrupt continuing pacification program and were also using area to rest retrain and refit in response 1 atf commander mcdonald launched a brigade sized search and clear operation known as operation overlord named after d day landings during allied invasion of normandy in 1944 operation was scheduled to begin on same day 27 years later notably there was some trepidation among australian sub unit commanders with use of this name for operational security reasons as it was felt that it might telegraph their intentions concept of operations called for a significant blocking force to be inserted with 4 rar nz anzac deployed along line of suoi ran river a squadron 3rd cavalry regiment to their west and 2 8th battalion 3rd us cavalry regiment to north east meanwhile 3 rar under command of lieutenant colonel peter scott and centurion tanks from c squadron 1st armoured regiment were tasked with driving viet cong and north vietnamese into these positions a number of fire support bases would be established with a field battery and 104 field battery royal australian artillery providing indirect fire support in conjunction with american gunners while 3 rar would search its ao belatedly designated as ao gwenda with three rifle companies a b and c while d company would be held in reserve plan envisioned movement by road of both troops and equipment using route 2 as well as air insertion terrain in new ao was thickly wooded with some areas of secondary growth beneath high canopy as well as numerous water courses spurs and re entrants battle operation commenced on 5 june with insertion of blocking forces consisting of australian new zealand and us troops followed by aerial insertion of 3 rar landing zone lz was clear of large trees to about and was secured by apcs from a squadron as a company landed it was suddenly engaged by intense fire which also targeted unsecured b company lz to south west firing eased after a few minutes however thereby allowing insertion of remaining companies australians subsequently began patrolling and it soon became apparent that they had been dropped within of an extensive bunker system signs of a strong viet cong and north vietnamese presence were detected almost as soon as 3 rar began its sweep while blocking elements also had a number of sightings and a few contacts with small parties moving north possibly alerted by allied air and road movements communists seemed to be avoiding open combat late on afternoon of 6 june 5 platoon b company located what was thought to be main communist position however with nightfall approaching it was decided not to press attack that night during evening a few shots were exchanged between australians and viet cong and australian platoon subsequently withdrew into a night harbour at 06 00 artillery commenced bombarding position and following a half hour of preparation 5 platoon resumed its advance expecting viet cong and north vietnamese to have vacated position during night as they had done numerous times in past however after having proceeded only australians came under heavy fire from front and both flanks suffering several casualties in initial volleys it soon became apparent that platoon was pinned down on edge of a strongly defended and well concealed bunker system with platoon commander calling for assistance from helicopter gunships as well as indirect mortar fire rather than risking further casualties by withdrawing moving to support platoon in contact scott ordered d company to conduct an assault against flank and rear of bunker complex mounted in apcs with tanks in support two troops of centurions spearheaded assault through jungle from north and they soon began receiving heavy small arms fire and rocket propelled grenades one of which subsequently suffered external damage realising that bunker system was larger than previously estimated tanks were forced to halt while infantry were brought up to begin assault meanwhile 5 platoon was in dire straits and was beginning to run low of ammunition while a number of its m60 machine guns were also beginning to fail because of prolonged firing moving to outflank heavily outnumbered australians viet cong were observed emerging from their bunkers indeed only heavy indirect fire and effective suppressing fire from helicopter gunships prevented them from being overrun attempting to gain a better position to direct fire b company forward observer lieutenant ian mathers moved forward to 5 platoon and was killed almost immediately however by 09 15 remainder of b company was able to link up with beleaguered platoon and after an aerial resupply of ammunition stabilised situation temporarily at 11 00 however a second attempt to resupply b company resulted in an australian iroquois helicopter being shot down by heavy ground fire and exploding on impact two crew members were killed and another two injured while another soldier was injured on ground with ammunition exploding among burning wreckage a number of australians rushed to aid injured scrambling through debris and removing unexploded ammunition and pulling survivors to safety subsequently another winch point was established to rear of australian positions for casualty evacuation and resupply by mid afternoon d company had finally moved into position and commenced an assault pushing through bunker system from north east with centurion tanks in close support crushing many bunkers and their occupants with their tracks progress of australian assault was slowed by thick vegetation and size of position even as resistance slackened and volume of fire diminished indeed bunker system was later found to cover nearly a square kilometre and was wider than front of assaulting company painstakingly australians searched each bunker systematically with action now over d company and tanks subsequently linked up with b company and established a night defensive position during final assault c company located to south had uncovered a second bunker system which was subsequently captured by australians after being hastily abandoned more than 16 000 rounds of m60 ammunition had been fired during fighting along with 6 000 rounds of m16 ammunition artillery had fired over 1 453 rounds of 105 mm and 200 rounds of 155 mm high explosive in support over next six days australian pioneer and engineer demolition teams proceeded to destroy remaining bunkers aftermath despite significantly underestimating size of position they faced australians had succeeded in pushing d445 vc battalion and 3 33 nva regiment out of a valuable base area intended for long term use regardless there were few other tangible results to show for casualties they had incurred as although numerous blood trails and body parts scattered around battlefield indicated that communist casualties had been heavy majority of their dead had either been removed from battlefield or were entombed in bunkers that had been crushed by australian tanks battle had cost australians three killed and six wounded while only five viet cong bodies were recovered viet cong and north vietnamese had defended strongly in order to allow an orderly evacuation of personnel and stores and with australians unable to concentrate sufficient combat power rapidly enough to ensure a decisive result they were largely able to achieve this objective unfazed by loss of their base camps bulk of communist force remained intact and later carried out a highly successful ambush by 274 vc main force regiment on 12 june seven australians were killed and three wounded from hq 1 atf defence and employment platoon in this subsequent action with bulk of casualties occurring when an rpg 7 exploded on a box of claymores sitting atop an m113 armoured personnel carrier igniting them with catastrophic consequences operations in long khanh continued however and australians established a number of ambushes on possible withdrawal routes although little contact subsequently occurred operation overlord finally ended on 14 june and 1 atf returned to nui dat overall despite heavy contact experienced early on it had yielded little for australians although neither d445 or 33 nva regiment were encountered in phuoc tuy again overlord was one of larger task force operations of war while it was also last joint us australian battalion sized operation indeed although fighting continued australian operations began to wind down on 18 august 1971 prime minister william mcmahon announced that 1 atf would cease operations in october commencing a phased withdrawal ultimately last australian forces were withdrawn from vietnam by 1973 notes footnotes citations references further reading category conflicts in
