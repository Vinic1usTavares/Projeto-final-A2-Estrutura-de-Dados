displaytitle mythology of carnivale carnivale is an american television series set in united states during great depression series traces disparate storylines of a young carnival worker named ben hawkins and brother justin crowe a preacher in california overarching story is built around a good and evil theme which serves as a human scaled metaphor within a complex structure of myth and allegory samson carnival s dwarf manager sets up show s mythology with a prologue in pilot episode talking of a creature of light and a creature of darkness being born to each generation preparing for a final battle most mythological elements in carnivale relate to so called avatars or creatures of light and darkness fictional human like beings with supernatural powers who embody good and evil in its first season carnivale does not reveal its characters as avatars beyond insinuation and makes nature of suggested avatars a central question by second season it is established that ben is a creature of light and brother justin a creature of darkness other than through characters show s good and evil theme manifests in series contemporary religion christian military order knights templar tarot divination and in historical events like and humankind s first nuclear test show creator daniel knauf did not respond to questions about mythology but did provide hints about mythological structure to online fandom both during and after two season run of carnivale nevertheless many of intended clues remained unnoticed by viewers knauf left fans a production summary of carnivale s first season two years after cancellation this so called pitch document originally written to give hbo and knauf s co writers an overview of intended storyline backed up and expanded upon assumed mythological rules avatars term avatar also spelled avatara originates in hindu mythology where it most commonly refers to incarnation bodily manifestation of a higher being or supreme being on earth carnivale s story never clearly establishes meaning of this term yet hbo and writers used term interchangeably with creatures of light and darkness of series opening monologue series portrays avatars as human like beings with supernatural powers who embody good and evil and whose constant and age long struggle serves to explain dark ages and ages of enlightenment in humanity s history in real world carnivale represents this avataric duality as light and dark in several instances surnames of main characters ben hawkins and justin crowe suggest a symbolic link to hawks and crows winged creatures of light and dark last two tarot cards seen in carnivale opening title sequence carnivales opening title sequence are sun and moon standing for god and devil by same token show s title card and logo of carnival depict a sun placed opposite a moon show creator daniel knauf designed this logo characteristics characters ben hawkins and brother justin crowe are revealed to be avatars through usage of their supernatural powers however viewers did not find it immediately apparent whether a suspected avatar served as good or evil series gave clues such as depicting creatures of darkness with coal black eyes according to daniel knauf creatures of light have an invisible aura an avatar s nature is determined by type and application of his powers as pitch document states avatars draw their talents and powers from same pool these abilities may vary in type and strength and include but are not limited to manipulation and transfer of life force spiritual healings telekinesis and telepathy

reviewers were still unsure about main characters avataric nature by end of first season when ben s good nature and justin s dark heritage became clearer in season 2 reviewers began to describe carnivale s underlying message as essentially opposite of spiritual belief fatalism daniel knauf disputed any theory of determinism and repeatedly pointed to characters free will to overcome their destiny free choice allows story to portray avatars as deliberately not making use of their powers or as acting contrary to their nature an avatar would however still have to put consistent effort into not lapsing back into his defined moral behavior pitch document described avatars as sharing ability to envision past present and future both literally and symbolically accessing this plane of pure truth is given as an avatar s birthright and can be improved through study and practice avatars can manipulate and transmit resulting visions through dreams to others as far as established only creatures of darkness suffer physical weakness or pain when their opposite makes use of his powers avatars can sense existence of their moral opponent but are unable to detect or identify them outside of close physical proximity they can however easily detect and locate an avatar of like kind over great distances with great accuracy these abilities contribute to convergence of two storylines in carnivale terms and order of succession daniel knauf overlaid avatars of fictional universe with an elaborate order of succession by blood similar to ascent of royal families descriptors royals king and prince are replaced in series with vectori prophet and prince female royals like queens and princesses do not have a fictional counterpart and are instead replaced with concepts of alpha omega and usher these wild card avatars have special rules in addition to or replacing normal ones reviewers rarely focused on significance of mentioned avataric terms and their implied characteristics in story despite detailed explanations by knauf and later public availability of carnivale s pitch document setting out complex mythological structure first prophet in mythology of carnivale is alpha this creature is never mentioned in series but knauf described her as a female who lived before flood and whose story was lost with destruction of royal library of alexandria alpha spawned first pair of avatara manifestations of some higher power or house one is light and other dark a creature of light and a creature of darkness have been born to each generation since and unlike alpha they have always been male avataric blood travels within families forming a dynasty first born son of an avatar receives a so called mantle at birth that manifests him as an avatar of a new generation whether

children as well as their respective offspring are called vectori beings with avataric blood who are not themselves avatara and who thus become generationally further removed from an avatar in bloodline while vectori cannot become avatara as that mantle is only conveyed upon birth they can still exhibit some minor powers and often show signs of insanity based on daniel knauf s note on yahoo

vlad impaler brother justin ben hawkins belyakov hilton scudder and henry scudder have in common pitch document stated if an avatar was dedicated to developing and mastering his power he could direct it with precision of a scalpel such was case with many of prophets with buddha jesus and mohammed with caligula and vlad dracul in this early plot summary rasputin and borgias were avatars as well but like other avatars in carnivale none of these historical figures were explicitly revealed as such on show tattooed man and tree 180px thumb right storyboard sketch of tattooed man a man with a tattooed tree on his chest and back is introduced in opening minutes of carnivale s pilot episode and appears in many other avataric visions and dreams in ben s and brother justin s common recurring dreams chasing henry scudder in a cornfield in ben s like visions in sofie s visions of rape of her mother and in an extended vision of brother justin foreshadowing his dark future ben encounters a little boy with a similar tree painted to his chest and back late in season 1 brother justin finds this tree grown on a hill early in season 2 which prompts him to get his chest and back tattooed accordingly tree is also depicted in show s gospel of matthias book in a painting at templar hall in loving new mexico and on many images in room of templar chaplain kerrigan management and wilfred talbot smith imply tree s significance for resolution of carnivale show creator daniel knauf stated that tree in carnivale is iconic tree of knowledge of good and evil in garden of eden its implied meaning and power prompted him to place it on tattooed man s chest because this is where you will build your empire this is what it all boils down and it just had a certain power played by don swayze tattooed man is often depicted without a focus on his face although a few frames in pilot episode show him played by clancy brown brother justin knauf confirmed tattooed man as spiritual representation of usher of destruction historical and cultural allusions dust bowl story of carnivale takes place in mid 1930s during worst of great depression a time of massive social and political upheaval unemployment rates were high and european fascism was on rise in years leading up to second world war people in great plains suffered from effects of dust bowl farmers often not only ran into debt and lost their properties but also risked their health dust pneumonia was a common cause of death carnivale is a retrospective interpretation of these times okie ben loses his mother and his farm to dust when a carnival picks him up while carnival travels throughout southwestern united states california preacher brother justin tends to needs of dust bowl refugees who slowly become his biggest supporters although carnivale replaces real sociological scientific reasons for drought conditions with fantasy elements and presence of devil it still addresses dust bowl situation repeatedly samson s catch phrases are variations of let s shake some dust episode black blizzard focuses on ben and carnival coping with a major dust storm rain only occurs twice in show first occurrence is when ben and sofie copulate writers wanted to highlight that avataric sex affects heavens second is when brother justin forcibly takes boon from henry scudder in episode cheyenne wy list of carny lingo at hbo com retrieved 2007 10 07 religion a major part of carnivale s story is religion samson s prologue in pilot episode is based on a few introduction paragraphs on pitch document s cover sheet that were initially not planned to be performed but whereas samson s prologue only shortly mentions genesis creation narrative before introducing fictional mythology original segment put more emphasis on battle between god and satan before beginning after great celestial war that rocked very foundation of heaven and hell god and satan established an uneasy truce never again would they face each other in direct confrontation so god created earth inhabiting it with crafty ape he called man and henceforth to each generation was born a creature of light and a creature of darkness and they would gather to them men of ilk nature and thus by proxy carry on war between good and evil show creator daniel knauf believed carnivales religious aspects stemmed from epic of good and evil as a major fabric of 1930s while executive producer ronald d moore regarded religion as a way to express struggle of good versus evil faith and nature of humanity neither audience nor actors were given advice on how to interpret show s biblical imagery clancy brown actor who portrayed brother justin did not know whether his character was creature of light or darkness during first season he however thought that visions made brother justin believe to be on a righteous mission of god until late in first season compared to brother justin brown stated he practiced religion in moderate ways daniel knauf felt that brother justin shares patterns with certain religious leaders who were often persecuted for their delusional visions historical figures like father coughlin aimee semple mcpherson and brigham young served as inspiration although writers refrained from re telling their particular stories daniel knauf originally thought of making brother justin a protestant minister but when producers needed to decide on a specific religious affiliation knauf contested their plans to make him a catholic priest knauf a catholic himself settled on methodist denomination which he perceived as significantly less cliched suspicious or controversial when asked whether god had influenced him to write story knauf replied no carnivale relies on other religious symbols and parallels for its mythology national shrine of little flower funded by father coughlin in 1930s was an inspiration for temple in brother justin s vision in episode los moscos this vision foreshadows world that justin will potentially build as he comes to power as a radio preacher producers planned to use radio towers instead of regular steeples for temple design also incorporated eastern european domes and western european cathedrals in same vision tattooed man appears near a tree that resembles iconic tree of knowledge of good and evil and implies that justin is usher according to knauf usher represents a timeless character who shows up in all different cultures and who is there to usher in armageddon as harbinger of end times knights templar thumb 130px knights templar symbol in carnivale carnivale introduces

backstory that was left untold due to cancellation pitch document described fictional order then simply called order templar as a fraternity of fellow travelers that was once charged by roman catholic

deception disillusionment sun success joy creation of sun and moon by michelangelo reception interpretation and legacy executive producer ronald d moore was confident that carnivale was one of most complicated shows on television while show creator daniel knauf admitted that you may not understand everything that goes on but it does make a certain sense in stating that carnivale was meant to be a demanding show with a lot of subtext knauf refrained from giving explicit clues he did not wish his intent as an author to supersede viewer s interpretation interpretations during run of carnivale reviewers of first three episodes interpreted carnivale s story as being full of myth and allegory show was seen as more than just a human scaled metaphor of good and evil with power of spirits as one of show s strongest elements some reviewers were deeply confused and described almost everything as mysterious characters and their powers and abilities characters and scenarios within visions whole carnival wondering how it all fit together visions of two main characters were shortly addressed distinguishing between violent and benign visions but parallels between visions and beings of good and evil were not necessarily drawn characters stories were described as unfolding in zig zagging starts moving back and forth in time and space dropping oblique clues along way carnivale s central premise was considered cloudy unconventional and filled with convoluted symbolic interpretations of historical events after daniel knauf had told tv critics that he regarded 1930s as last great age of magic being ended by an atomic bomb to herald age of reason many reviews quoted and commented on samson s prologue to explain both apocalyptic premise and mythology of show some reviews asserted that good and evil creatures described in prologue were ben and justin preparing for a final battle still many reviews were reluctant to state who of main characters was good and who was evil aware that it might take some time until this question was answered for sure ben and his healing powers led most reviewers to believe that he was good creature and that justin was a demon or at least a dangerous zealot who received instructions from either god or satan some reviews described question of ben s parentage as one of big puzzles and show s driving mystery but refrained from defining further details of series lack of revelation of characters roles was apparent by end of first season although critics expected sofie to gain significance later in story dvd reviews for season 1 and previews for season 2 premiere had advantage of retrospective on first season and some reviewers continued to consider show s mythology convoluted circuitous peek a boo and silly significance of prologue was emphasized again while previous reviewers character descriptions good versus evil theme and assumed story merge were generally repeated good nature of ben and evil nature of brother justin seemed clearer to most reviewers with many bizarre coincidences that seem to imply a deeper and more sinister connection between two main characters visions were summarized as disturbing and grotesque dreams as cryptic and mysterious and abilities as unexplainable henry scudder was noted to be connected to everything and everyone and it was considered ben s job to piece together mystery of his own past events of early season 2 were said to mark a shift in story from mystery to journey with ben accepting and exploring his powers while brother justin was seen completely embracing his evil nature reviewers regarded sofie s turn in final episode as an unexpected new threat in story reception and analysis of themes carnivale was often compared to david lynch s 1990s mystery tv series twin peaks and john steinbeck s 1939 novel grapes of wrath matt roush of tv guide called carnivale perfect show for those who thought twin peaks was too accessible whereas show reminded salon com s heather havrilesky of disappointment you feel as a kid when you come to last few pages of grapes of wrath she argued that a surreal twin peaks style hardly bears repeating especially if it avoid s hugging and learning of mainstream television by serving up such a steady diet of anguish and dashed hopes that viewers refuse to take risk of making an emotional connection carnivale as australian stated seems to have been conceived in essentially literary terms which can sometimes work on page but is deadly on large screen let alone a small one it s almost like a biblical injunction against pretension on television a reviewer admitted his temptation to dismiss first season of carnivale as too artsy and esoteric because his lack of involvement prevented him from understanding what heck was going on which can be a problem for a dramatic television series tv zone however considered carnivale a series like no other and fact that it is so open to interpretation surprisingly proves to be one of its greatest strengths carnivale was lauded for bringing hopelessness of great depression to life and for being among first tv shows to show unmitigated pain and disappointment but reviewers were not confident that viewers would find slowly unfolding sadness appealing over long or would have patience or endurance to find out meaning of show fate and legacy of mythological storytelling of carnivale viewership did drop significantly in season 2 and carnivale was cancelled in 2005 after two of six planned seasons in a post cancellation interview daniel knauf was positive that someone would let him finish his story someday if not as a television series then possibly as a series of features or graphic novels knauf approached marvel comics to continue future carnivale storyline that he had kept to himself they seemed interested but hbo who own show and characters would not confer their rights during 2007 writers guild of america strike knauf stated that an idiosyncratic show like carnivale would never be greenlit today and claimed that present day television included a high percentage of talking heads with vast majority of television writers not being visual storytellers enjoying his creative freedom as graphic storyteller he has considered directing his efforts away from television series creation meanwhile mythology of carnivale remains in public conscience in 2008 alessandra stanley of australian newspaper age remembered carnivale as a smart ambitious series that move s unusual characters around an unfamiliar setting imaginatively while a v club called show a fantastically rich series with a frustratingly dense mythology references category carnivale carnivale category fictional avatars
