genetics is a branch of biology concerned with study of genes genetic variation and heredity in organisms hartl d jones e 2005 though heredity had been observed for millennia gregor mendel a scientist and augustinian friar working in 19th century was first to study genetics scientifically mendel studied trait inheritance patterns in way traits are handed down from parents to offspring he observed that organisms pea plants inherit traits by way of discrete units of inheritance this term still used today is a somewhat ambiguous definition of what is referred to as a gene trait inheritance and molecular inheritance mechanisms of genes are still primary principles of genetics in 21st century but modern genetics has expanded beyond inheritance to studying function and behavior of genes gene structure and function variation and distribution are studied within context of cell organism e g dominance and within context of a population genetics has given rise to a number of subfields including epigenetics and population genetics organisms studied within broad field span domains of life archaea bacteria and eukarya genetic processes work in combination with an organism s environment and experiences to influence development and behavior often referred to as nature versus nurture intracellular or extracellular environment of a living cell or organism may switch gene transcription on or off a classic example is two seeds of genetically identical corn one placed in a temperate climate and one in an arid climate lacking sufficient waterfall or rain while average height of two corn stalks may be genetically determined to be equal one in arid climate only grows to half height of one in temperate climate due to lack of water and nutrients in its environment etymology word genetics stems from ancient greek meaning genitive generative which in turn derives from meaning origin history observation that living things inherit traits from their parents has been used since prehistoric times to improve crop plants and animals through selective breeding modern science of genetics seeking to understand this process began with work of augustinian friar gregor mendel in mid 19th century prior to mendel imre a hungarian noble who lived in koszeg before mendel was first who used word genetics he described several rules of genetic inheritance in his work genetic law of nature die der natur 1819 his second law is same as what mendel published in his third law he developed basic principles of mutation he can be considered a forerunner of hugo de vries thumb blending inheritance leads to averaging out of every characteristic which as engineer fleeming jenkin pointed out makes evolution by natural selection impossible other theories of inheritance preceded mendel s work a popular theory during 19th century and implied by charles darwin s 1859 on origin of species was blending inheritance idea that individuals inherit a smooth blend of traits from their parents mendel s work provided examples where traits were definitely not blended after hybridization showing that traits are produced by combinations of distinct genes rather than a continuous blend blending of traits in progeny is now explained by action of multiple genes with quantitative effects another theory that had some support at that time was inheritance of acquired characteristics belief that individuals inherit traits strengthened by their parents this theory commonly associated with jean baptiste lamarck is now known to be wrong experiences of individuals do not affect genes they pass to their children lamarck j b 2008 in encyclopaedia britannica retrieved from encyclopaedia britannica online on 16 march 2008 although evidence in field of epigenetics has revived some aspects of lamarck s theory other theories included pangenesis of charles darwin which had both acquired and inherited aspects and francis galton s reformulation of pangenesis as both particulate and inherited peter j bowler mendelian revolution emergency of concepts in modern science and society baltimore johns hopkins university press 1989 chapters 2 3 mendelian and classical genetics thumb morgan s observation of sex linked inheritance of a mutation causing white eyes in drosophila led him to hypothesis that genes are located upon chromosomes modern genetics started with mendel s studies of nature of inheritance in plants in his paper versuche uber experiments on plant hybridization presented in 1865 to verein society for research in nature in brunn mendel traced inheritance patterns of certain traits in pea plants and described them mathematically although this pattern of inheritance could only be observed for a few traits mendel s work suggested that heredity was particulate not acquired and that inheritance patterns of many traits could be explained through simple rules and ratios importance of mendel s work did not gain wide understanding until 1900 after his death when hugo de vries and other scientists rediscovered his research william bateson a proponent of mendel s work coined word genetics in n oxford english dictionary 3rd ed note that letter was to an adam sedgwick a zoologist and reader in animal morphology at trinity college cambridge adjective genetic derived from greek word genesis genesis origin predates noun and was first used in a biological sense in adj oxford english dictionary 3rd ed bateson both acted as a mentor and was aided significantly by work of other scientists from newnham college at cambridge specifically work of becky saunders nora darwin barlow and muriel onslow bateson popularized usage of word genetics to describe study of inheritance in his inaugural address to third international conference on plant hybridization in london in 1906 initially titled international conference on hybridisation and plant breeding title was changed as a result of bateson s speech see after rediscovery of mendel s work scientists tried to determine which molecules in cell were responsible for inheritance in 1911 thomas hunt morgan argued that genes are on chromosomes based on observations of a sex linked white eye mutation in fruit flies in 1913 his student alfred sturtevant used phenomenon of genetic linkage to show that genes are arranged linearly on chromosome molecular genetics thumb upright 0 6 dna molecular basis for biological inheritance each strand of dna is a chain of nucleotides matching each other in center to form what look like rungs on a twisted ladder although genes were known to exist on chromosomes chromosomes are composed of both protein and dna and scientists did not know which of two is responsible for inheritance in 1928 frederick griffith discovered phenomenon of transformation see griffith s experiment dead bacteria could transfer genetic material to transform other still living bacteria sixteen years later in 1944 avery macleod mccarty experiment identified dna as molecule responsible for transformation reprint role of nucleus as repository of genetic information in eukaryotes had been established by in 1943 in his work on single celled alga cell and molecular biology khanna i k international pvt ltd 2008 p 221 hershey chase experiment in 1952 confirmed that dna rather than protein is genetic material of viruses that infect bacteria providing further evidence that dna is molecule responsible for inheritance james watson and francis crick determined structure of dna in 1953 using x ray crystallography work of rosalind franklin and maurice wilkins that indicated dna has a helical structure i e shaped like a corkscrew their double helix model had two strands of dna with nucleotides pointing inward each matching a complementary nucleotide on other strand to form what look like rungs on a twisted ladder this structure showed that genetic information exists in sequence of nucleotides on each strand of dna structure also suggested a simple method for replication if strands are separated new partner strands can be reconstructed for each based on sequence of old strand this property is what gives dna its semi conservative nature where one strand of new dna is from an original parent strand although structure of dna showed how inheritance works it was still not known how dna influences behavior of cells in following years scientists tried to understand how dna controls process of protein production it was discovered that cell uses dna as a template to create matching messenger rna molecules with nucleotides very similar to dna nucleotide sequence of a messenger rna is used to create an amino acid sequence in protein this translation between nucleotide sequences and amino acid sequences is known as genetic code with newfound molecular understanding of inheritance came an explosion of research a notable theory arose from tomoko ohta in 1973 with her amendment to neutral theory of molecular evolution through publishing nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution in this theory ohta stressed importance of natural selection and environment to rate at which genetic evolution occurs one important development was chain termination dna sequencing in 1977 by frederick sanger this technology allows scientists to read nucleotide sequence of a dna molecule in 1983 kary banks mullis developed polymerase chain reaction providing a quick way to isolate and amplify a specific section of dna from a mixture efforts of human genome project department of energy nih and parallel private efforts by genomics led to sequencing of human genome in 2003 features of inheritance discrete inheritance and mendel s laws right thumb a punnett square depicting a cross between two pea plants heterozygous for purple b and white b blossoms at its most fundamental level inheritance in organisms occurs by passing discrete heritable units called genes from parents to offspring this property was first observed by gregor mendel who studied segregation of heritable traits in pea plants in his experiments studying trait for flower color mendel observed that flowers of each pea plant were either purple or white but never an intermediate between two colors these different discrete versions of same gene are called alleles in case of pea which is a diploid species each individual plant has two copies of each gene one copy inherited from each parent many species including humans have this pattern of inheritance diploid organisms with two copies of same allele of a given gene are called homozygous at that gene locus while organisms with two different alleles of a given gene are called heterozygous set of alleles for a given organism is called its genotype while observable traits of organism are called its phenotype when organisms are heterozygous at a gene often one allele is called dominant as its qualities dominate phenotype of organism while other allele is called recessive as its qualities recede and are not observed some alleles do not have complete dominance and instead have incomplete dominance by expressing an intermediate phenotype or by expressing both alleles at once when a pair of organisms reproduce sexually their offspring randomly inherit one of two alleles from each parent these observations of discrete inheritance and segregation of alleles are collectively known as mendel s first law or law of segregation notation and diagrams thumb left upright 1 1 genetic pedigree charts help track inheritance patterns of traits geneticists use diagrams and symbols to describe inheritance a gene is represented by one or a few letters often a symbol is used to mark usual non mutant allele for a gene in fertilization and breeding experiments and especially when discussing mendel s laws parents are referred to as p generation and offspring as f1 first filial generation when f1 offspring mate with each other offspring are called f2 second filial generation one of common diagrams used to predict result of cross breeding is punnett square when studying human genetic diseases geneticists often use pedigree charts to represent inheritance of traits these charts map inheritance of a trait in a family tree multiple gene interactions thumb right human height is a trait with complex genetic causes francis galton s data from 1889 shows relationship between offspring height as a function of mean parent height organisms have thousands of genes and in sexually reproducing organisms these genes generally assort independently of each other this means that inheritance of an allele for yellow or green pea color is unrelated to inheritance of alleles for white or purple flowers this phenomenon known as mendel s second law or law of independent assortment means that alleles of different genes get shuffled between parents to form offspring with many different combinations some genes do not assort independently demonstrating genetic linkage a topic discussed later in this article often different genes can interact in a way that influences same trait in blue eyed mary omphalodes verna for example there exists a gene with alleles that determine color of flowers blue or magenta another gene however controls whether flowers have color at all or are white when a plant has two copies of this white allele its flowers are white regardless of whether first gene has blue or magenta alleles this interaction between genes is called with second gene epistatic to first many traits are not discrete features e g purple or white flowers but are instead continuous features e g human height and skin color these complex traits are products of many genes influence of these genes is mediated to varying degrees by environment an organism has experienced degree to which an organism s genes contribute to a complex trait is called heritability measurement of heritability of a trait is relative in a more variable environment environment has a bigger influence on total variation of trait for example human height is a trait with complex causes it has a heritability of 89 in united states in nigeria however where people experience a more variable access to good nutrition and health care height has a heritability of only 62 molecular basis for inheritance dna and chromosomes thumb right molecular structure of dna bases pair through arrangement of hydrogen bonding between strands molecular basis for genes is deoxyribonucleic acid dna dna is composed of a chain of nucleotides of which there are four types adenine a cytosine c guanine g and thymine t genetic information exists in sequence of these nucleotides and genes exist as stretches of sequence along dna chain viruses are only exception to this rule sometimes viruses use very similar molecule rna instead of dna as their genetic material viruses cannot reproduce without a host and are unaffected by many genetic processes so tend not to be considered living organisms dna normally exists as a double stranded molecule coiled into shape of a double helix each nucleotide in dna preferentially pairs with its partner nucleotide on opposite strand a pairs with t and c pairs with g thus in its two stranded form each strand effectively contains all necessary information redundant with its partner strand this structure of dna is physical basis for inheritance dna replication duplicates genetic information by splitting strands and using each strand as a template for synthesis of a new partner strand genes are arranged linearly along long chains of dna base pair sequences in bacteria each cell usually contains a single circular while eukaryotic organisms such as plants and animals have their dna arranged in multiple linear chromosomes these dna strands are often extremely long largest human chromosome for example is about 247 million base pairs in length dna of a chromosome is associated with structural proteins that organize compact and control access to dna forming a material called chromatin in eukaryotes chromatin is usually composed of nucleosomes segments of dna wound around cores of histone proteins alberts et al 2002 ii 4 dna and chromosomes chromosomal dna and its packaging in chromatin fiber full set of hereditary material in an organism usually combined dna sequences of all chromosomes is called genome while haploid organisms have only one copy of each chromosome most animals and many plants are diploid containing two of each chromosome and thus two copies of every gene two alleles for a gene are located on identical loci of two homologous chromosomes each allele inherited from a different parent thumb left walther flemming s 1882 diagram of eukaryotic cell division chromosomes are copied condensed and organized then as cell divides chromosome copies separate into daughter cells many species have so called sex chromosomes that determine gender of each organism in humans and many other animals y chromosome contains gene that triggers development of specifically male characteristics in evolution this chromosome has lost most of its content and also most of its genes while x chromosome is similar to other chromosomes and contains many genes x and y chromosomes form a strongly heterogeneous pair reproduction when cells divide their full genome is copied and each daughter cell inherits one copy this process called mitosis is simplest form of reproduction and is basis for asexual reproduction asexual reproduction can also occur in multicellular organisms producing offspring that inherit their genome from a single parent offspring that are genetically identical to their parents are called clones eukaryotic organisms often use sexual reproduction to generate offspring that contain a mixture of genetic material inherited from two different parents process of sexual reproduction alternates between forms that contain single copies of genome haploid and double copies diploid haploid cells fuse and combine genetic material to create a diploid cell with paired chromosomes diploid organisms form by dividing without replicating their dna to create daughter cells that randomly inherit one of each pair of chromosomes most animals and many plants are diploid for most of their lifespan with haploid form reduced to single cell gametes such as sperm or eggs although they do not use haploid diploid method of sexual reproduction bacteria have many methods of acquiring new genetic information some bacteria can undergo conjugation transferring a small circular piece of dna to another bacterium bacteria can also take up raw dna fragments found in environment and integrate them into their genomes a phenomenon known as transformation these processes result in horizontal gene transfer transmitting fragments of genetic information between organisms that would be otherwise unrelated recombination and genetic linkage thumb right thomas hunt morgan s 1916 illustration of a double crossover between chromosomes diploid nature of chromosomes allows for genes on different chromosomes to assort independently or be separated from their homologous pair during sexual reproduction wherein haploid gametes are formed in this way new combinations of genes can occur in offspring of a mating pair genes on same chromosome would theoretically never recombine however they do via cellular process of chromosomal crossover during crossover chromosomes exchange stretches of dna effectively shuffling gene alleles between chromosomes this process of chromosomal crossover generally occurs during meiosis a series of cell divisions that creates haploid cells first cytological demonstration of crossing over was performed by harriet creighton and barbara mcclintock in 1931 their research and experiments on corn provided cytological evidence for genetic theory that linked genes on paired chromosomes do in fact exchange places from one homolog to other probability of chromosomal crossover occurring between two given points on chromosome is related to distance between points for an arbitrarily long distance probability of crossover is high enough that inheritance of genes is effectively uncorrelated for genes that are closer together however lower probability of crossover means that genes demonstrate genetic linkage alleles for two genes tend to be inherited together amounts of linkage between a series of genes can be combined to form a linear linkage map that roughly describes arrangement of genes along chromosome gene expression genetic code thumb left genetic code using a triplet code dna through a messenger rna intermediary specifies a protein genes generally express their functional effect through production of proteins which are complex molecules responsible for most functions in cell proteins are made up of one or more polypeptide chains each of which is composed of a sequence of amino acids and dna sequence of a gene through an rna intermediate is used to produce a specific amino acid sequence this process begins with production of an rna molecule with a sequence matching gene s dna sequence a process called transcription this messenger rna molecule is then used to produce a corresponding amino acid sequence through a process called translation each group of three nucleotides in sequence called a codon corresponds either to one of twenty possible amino acids in a protein or an instruction to end amino acid sequence this correspondence is called genetic code flow of information is unidirectional information is transferred from nucleotide sequences into amino acid sequence of proteins but it never transfers from protein back into sequence of dna a phenomenon francis crick called central dogma of molecular biology specific sequence of amino acids results in a unique three dimensional structure for that protein and three dimensional structures of proteins are related to their functions alberts et al 2002 i 3 proteins shape and structure of et al 2002 i 3 proteins protein function some are simple structural molecules like fibers formed by protein collagen proteins can bind to other proteins and simple molecules sometimes acting as enzymes by facilitating chemical reactions within bound molecules without changing structure of protein itself protein structure is dynamic protein hemoglobin bends into slightly different forms as it facilitates capture transport and release of oxygen molecules within mammalian blood a single nucleotide difference within dna can cause a change in amino acid sequence of a protein because protein structures are result of their amino acid sequences some changes can dramatically change properties of a protein by destabilizing structure or changing surface of protein in a way that changes its interaction with other proteins and molecules for example sickle cell anemia is a human genetic disease that results from a single base difference within coding region for b section of hemoglobin causing a single amino acid change that changes hemoglobin s physical properties sickle cell versions of hemoglobin stick to themselves stacking to form fibers that distort shape of red blood cells carrying protein these sickle shaped cells no longer flow smoothly through blood vessels having a tendency to clog or degrade causing medical problems associated with this disease some dna sequences are transcribed into rna but are not translated into protein products such rna molecules are called non coding rna in some cases these products fold into structures which are involved in critical cell functions e g ribosomal rna and transfer rna rna can also have regulatory effects through hybridization interactions with other rna molecules e g microrna nature and nurture thumb upright siamese cats have a temperature sensitive pigment production mutation although genes contain all information an organism uses to function environment plays an important role in determining ultimate phenotypes an organism displays phrase nature and nurture refers to this complementary relationship phenotype of an organism depends on interaction of genes and environment an interesting example is coat coloration of siamese cat in this case body temperature of cat plays role of environment cat s genes code for dark hair thus hair producing cells in cat make cellular proteins resulting in dark hair but these dark hair producing proteins are sensitive to temperature i e have a mutation causing temperature sensitivity and in higher temperature environments failing to produce dark hair pigment in areas where cat has a higher body temperature in a low temperature environment however protein s structure is stable and produces dark hair pigment normally protein remains functional in areas of skin that are as its legs ears tail and cat has dark hair at its extremities environment plays a major role in effects of human genetic disease phenylketonuria mutation that causes phenylketonuria disrupts ability of body to break down amino acid phenylalanine causing a toxic build up of an intermediate molecule that in turn causes severe symptoms of progressive intellectual disability and seizures however if someone with phenylketonuria mutation follows a strict diet that avoids this amino acid they remain normal and healthy a common method for determining how genes and environment nature and nurture contribute to a phenotype involves studying identical and fraternal twins or other siblings of multiple births for example identical siblings are genetically same since they come from same meanwhile fraternal twins are as genetically different from one another as normal siblings by comparing how often a certain disorder occurs in a pair of identical twins to how often it occurs in a pair of fraternal twins scientists can determine whether that disorder is caused by genetic or postnatal environmental factors one famous example involved study of quadruplets who were identical quadruplets all diagnosed with schizophrenia however such tests cannot separate genetic factors from environmental factors affecting fetal development gene regulation genome of a given organism contains thousands of genes but not all these genes need to be active at any given moment a gene is expressed when it is being transcribed into mrna and there exist many cellular methods of controlling expression of genes such that proteins are produced only when needed by cell transcription factors are regulatory proteins that bind to dna either promoting or inhibiting transcription of a gene within genome of escherichia coli bacteria for example there exists a series of genes necessary for synthesis of amino acid tryptophan however when tryptophan is already available to cell these genes for tryptophan synthesis are no longer needed presence of tryptophan directly affects activity of genes tryptophan molecules bind to tryptophan repressor a transcription factor changing repressor s structure such that repressor binds to genes tryptophan repressor blocks transcription and expression of genes thereby creating negative feedback regulation of tryptophan synthesis process alberts et al 2002 ii 3 control of gene expression tryptophan repressor is a simple switch that turns genes on and off in bacteria thumb upright left transcription factors bind to dna influencing transcription of associated genes differences in gene expression are especially clear within multicellular organisms where cells all contain same genome but have very different structures and behaviors due to expression of different sets of genes all cells in a multicellular organism derive from a single cell differentiating into variant cell types in response to external and intercellular signals and gradually establishing different patterns of gene expression to create different behaviors as no single gene is responsible for development of structures within multicellular organisms these patterns arise from complex interactions between many cells within eukaryotes there exist structural features of chromatin that influence transcription of genes often in form of modifications to dna and chromatin that are stably inherited by daughter cells these features are called epigenetic because they exist on top of dna sequence and retain inheritance from one cell generation to next because of epigenetic features different cell types grown within same medium can retain very different properties although epigenetic features are generally dynamic over course of development some like phenomenon of have multigenerational inheritance and exist as rare exceptions to general rule of dna as basis for inheritance genetic change mutations thumb upright gene duplication allows diversification by providing redundancy one gene can mutate and lose its original function without harming organism during process of dna replication errors occasionally occur in polymerization of second strand these errors called mutations can affect phenotype of an organism especially if they occur within protein coding sequence of a gene error rates are usually very low 1 error in every 10 100 million bases due to proofreading ability of dna polymerases processes that increase rate of changes in dna are called mutagenic mutagenic chemicals promote errors in dna replication often by interfering with structure of base pairing while uv radiation induces mutations by causing damage to dna structure chemical damage to dna occurs naturally as well and cells use dna repair mechanisms to repair mismatches and breaks repair does not however always restore original sequence in organisms that use chromosomal crossover to exchange dna and recombine genes errors in alignment during meiosis can also cause mutations errors in crossover are especially likely when similar sequences cause partner chromosomes to adopt a mistaken alignment this makes some regions in genomes more prone to mutating in this way these errors create large structural changes in dna inversions deletions of entire accidental exchange of whole parts of sequences between different chromosomes chromosomal translocation thumb this is a diagram showing mutations in an rna sequence figure 1 is a normal rna sequence consisting of 4 codons figure 2 shows a missense single point non silent mutation figures 3 and 4 both show frameshift mutations which is why they are grouped together figure 3 shows a deletion of second base pair in second codon figure 4 shows an insertion in third base pair of second codon figure 5 shows a repeat expansion where an entire codon is duplicated natural selection and evolution mutations alter an organism s genotype and occasionally this causes different phenotypes to appear most mutations have little effect on an organism s phenotype health or reproductive fitness mutations that do have an effect are usually detrimental but occasionally some can be beneficial studies in fly drosophila melanogaster suggest that if a mutation changes a protein produced by a gene about 70 percent of these mutations will be harmful with remainder being either neutral or weakly beneficial thumb left an evolutionary tree of eukaryotic organisms constructed by comparison of several orthologous gene sequences population genetics studies distribution of genetic differences within populations and how these distributions change over time changes in frequency of an allele in a population are mainly influenced by natural selection where a given allele provides a selective or reproductive advantage to organism as well as other factors such as mutation genetic drift genetic hitchhiking artificial selection and migration over many generations genomes of organisms can change significantly resulting in evolution in process called adaptation selection for beneficial mutations can cause a species to evolve into forms better able to survive in their environment earlier related ideas were acknowledged in new species are formed through process of speciation often caused by geographical separations that prevent populations from exchanging genes with each other by comparing homology between different species genomes it is possible to calculate evolutionary distance between them and when they may have diverged genetic comparisons are generally considered a more accurate method of characterizing relatedness between species than comparison of phenotypic characteristics evolutionary distances between species can be used to form evolutionary trees these trees represent common descent and divergence of species over time although they do not show transfer of genetic material between unrelated species known as horizontal gene transfer and most common in bacteria model organisms thumb right common fruit fly drosophila melanogaster is a popular model organism in genetics research although geneticists originally studied inheritance in a wide range of organisms researchers began to specialize in studying genetics of a particular subset of organisms fact that significant research already existed for a given organism would encourage new researchers to choose it for further study and so eventually a few model organisms became basis for most genetics research common research topics in model organism genetics include study of gene regulation and involvement of genes in development and cancer organisms were chosen in part for convenience short generation times and easy genetic manipulation made some organisms popular genetics research tools widely used model organisms include gut bacterium escherichia coli plant arabidopsis thaliana baker s yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae nematode caenorhabditis elegans common fruit fly drosophila melanogaster and common house mouse mus musculus medicine alt thumb schematic relationship between biochemistry genetics and molecular biology medical genetics seeks to understand how genetic variation relates to human health and disease when searching for an unknown gene that may be involved in a disease researchers commonly use genetic linkage and genetic pedigree charts to find location on genome associated with disease at population level researchers take advantage of mendelian randomization to look for locations in genome that are associated with diseases a method especially useful for traits not clearly defined by a single gene once a candidate gene is found further research is often done on corresponding or homologous genes of model organisms in addition to studying genetic diseases increased availability of genotyping methods has led to field of study of how genotype can affect drug responses individuals differ in their inherited tendency to develop cancer and cancer is a genetic disease chapter 18 cancer genetics process of cancer development in body is a combination of events mutations occasionally occur within cells in body as they divide although these mutations will not be inherited by any offspring they can affect behavior of cells sometimes causing them to grow and divide more frequently there are biological mechanisms that attempt to stop this process signals are given to inappropriately dividing cells that should trigger cell death but sometimes additional mutations occur that cause cells to ignore these messages an internal process of natural selection occurs within body and eventually mutations accumulate within cells to promote their own growth creating a cancerous tumor that grows and invades various tissues of body normally a cell divides only in response to signals called growth factors and stops growing once in contact with surrounding cells and in response to growth inhibitory signals it usually then divides a limited number of times and dies staying within epithelium where it is unable to migrate to other organs to become a cancer cell a cell has to accumulate mutations in a number of genes three to seven a cancer cell can divide without growth factor and ignores inhibitory signals also it is immortal and can grow indefinitely even after it makes contact with neighboring cells it may escape from epithelium and ultimately from primary tumor then escaped cell can cross endothelium of a blood vessel and get transported by bloodstream to colonize a new organ forming deadly metastasis although there are some genetic predispositions in a small fraction of cancers major fraction is due to a set of new genetic mutations that originally appear and accumulate in one or a small number of cells that will divide to form tumor and are not transmitted to progeny somatic mutations most frequent mutations are a loss of function of p53 protein a tumor suppressor or in p53 pathway and gain of function mutations in ras proteins or in other oncogenes research methods thumb right upright 0 8 colonies of e coli produced by cellular cloning a similar methodology is often used in molecular cloning dna can be manipulated in laboratory restriction enzymes are commonly used enzymes that cut dna at specific sequences producing predictable fragments of dna lodish et al 2000 chapter 7 7 1 dna cloning with plasmid vectors dna fragments can be visualized through use of gel electrophoresis which separates fragments according to their length use of ligation enzymes allows dna fragments to be connected by binding ligating fragments of dna together from different sources researchers can create recombinant dna dna often associated with genetically modified organisms recombinant dna is commonly used in context of plasmids short circular dna molecules with a few genes on them in process known as molecular cloning researchers can amplify dna fragments by inserting plasmids into bacteria and then culturing them on plates of agar to isolate clones of bacteria cells cloning can also refer to various means of creating cloned clonal organisms dna can also be amplified using a procedure called polymerase chain reaction pcr lodish et al 2000 chapter 7 7 7 polymerase chain reaction an alternative to cloning by using specific short sequences of dna pcr can isolate and exponentially amplify a targeted region of dna because it can amplify from extremely small amounts of dna pcr is also often used to detect presence of specific dna sequences dna sequencing and genomics dna sequencing one of most fundamental technologies developed to study genetics allows researchers to determine sequence of nucleotides in dna fragments technique of chain termination sequencing developed in 1977 by a team led by frederick sanger is still routinely used to sequence dna fragments using this technology researchers have been able to study molecular sequences associated with many human diseases as sequencing has become less expensive researchers have sequenced genomes of many organisms using a process called genome assembly which utilizes computational tools to stitch together sequences from many different fragments brown 2002 section 2 chapter 6 6 2 assembly of a contiguous dna sequence these technologies were used to sequence human genome in human genome project completed in 2003 new high throughput sequencing technologies are dramatically lowering cost of dna sequencing with many researchers hoping to bring cost of a human genome down to a thousand dollars next generation sequencing or high throughput sequencing came about due to ever increasing demand for low cost sequencing these sequencing technologies allow production of potentially millions of sequences concurrently large amount of sequence data available has created field of genomics research that uses computational tools to search for and analyze patterns in full genomes of organisms genomics can also be considered a subfield of bioinformatics which uses computational approaches to analyze large sets of biological data a common problem to these fields of research is how to manage and share data that deals with human subject and personally identifiable information see also genomics data sharing society and culture on 19 march 2015 a group of leading biologists urged a worldwide ban on clinical use of methods particularly use of crispr and zinc finger to edit human genome in a way that can be inherited in april 2015 chinese researchers reported results of basic research to edit dna of non viable human embryos using crispr see also bacterial genome size of animal genetic resources eugenics embryology evolution genetic disorder genetic diversity genetic
