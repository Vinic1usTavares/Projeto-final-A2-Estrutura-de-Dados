dusky dolphin lagenorhynchus obscurus is a dolphin found in coastal waters in southern hemisphere its specific epithet is latin for dark or dim it is very closely genetically related to pacific white sided dolphin but current scientific consensus holds they are distinct species dolphin s range is patchy with major populations around south america southwestern africa new zealand and various oceanic islands with some sightings around southern australia and tasmania dusky dolphin prefers cool currents and inshore waters but can also be found offshore it feeds on a variety of fish and squid species and has flexible hunting tactics dusky dolphin is known for its remarkable acrobatics having a number of aerial behaviours status of dolphin is unknown but it has been commonly caught in gill nets taxonomy thumb 200px left dusky dolphin drawings in plate 5 of mammalogy section in mammalogy and ornithology 1858 it is commonly thought that dusky dolphin was first described by john edward gray in 1828 from stuffed skin and a single skull shipped from cape of good hope to british museum gray first described species as delphinus obscurus with subgenus grampus in his 1828 zoologica gray reported that animal was captured around cape of good hope by a captain often heaviside and sent to british museum though royal college of surgeons in 1827 however gray later wrote that a similar dolphin was described as delphinus supercilious by french surgeons and naturalists rene primevere lesson and prosper garnot from a specimen collected off coast of tasmania two years before his own classification gray classified d supercilious as a junior synonym of his d obscurus and credited lesson and garnot 1826 for their original description meanwhile charles darwin also described what turned out to be this species as delphinus from a specimen harpooned off argentina in 1838 dusky dolphin was reclassified as obscurus in 1885 by british naturalist william henry flower before gaining its current binomial name lagenorhynchus obscurus from american biologist frederick w true in 1889 genetics dusky dolphin and pacific white sided dolphin are considered phylogenetically related species some researchers have suggested they are same species but morphological and life history evidence shows otherwise two sister species diverged at around 1 9 3 0 million years ago recent analysis of mitochondrial cytochrome b gene indicates that genus lagenorhynchus as traditionally conceived is not a natural monophyletic group another study finds that dusky and pacific white sided dolphin form sister group to expanded genus cephalorhynchus if this placement is accurate a new genus name will need to be coined to accommodate these two species dusky dolphins from argentina and southwest africa separated 2000 generations ago from an ancestral atlantic population and subsequently diverged without much gene flow most populations have low genetic diversity with peruvian population being an exception possible hybrids of dusky dolphins have been described with a long beaked common dolphin and a southern right whale dolphin there are four subspecies classified lagenorhynchus obscurus

right whale dolphins and pilot whales off southwestern africa vocalisations and echolocation in general three different types of sounds are produced by dolphins and other toothed whales these are click trains which are made of numerous individual clicks usually broadband signals that change from low value to high value quickly burst pulses which are individual clicks with high repetition and can be heard by humans only as a buzzing sound and whistles which are signals that are pure tones and whose frequency varies depending on time dusky dolphins produce all three sounds but most commonly

dolphin foraging and predation thumb 250px left dusky dolphins dusky dolphins prey on a variety of fish and squid species common fish species eaten include anchovies lantern fish pilchards sculpins hakes horse mackerel hoki and red cod they are generally coordinated hunters their very flexible foraging strategies can change depending on environment in certain parts of new zealand where deep oceanic waters meet shore dusky dolphins forage in deep scattering layers at night they arrive at hunting site individually but form groups when in layer dolphins use their echolocation to detect and isolate an individual prey groups of foraging dolphins tend to increase when layer is near surface and decrease when it descends when hunting in shallower waters in new zealand and argentina dusky

reproduction dusky dolphins live in a fission fusion society with most group size increases occurring during foraging and decreases in group sizes occurring during resting and traveling in golfo san jose off valdes peninsula dolphins commonly switch between small traveling groups and large sociosexual groups and encounter a variety of associates studies of dolphins off kaikoura new zealand showed dolphins normally live in large groups that split into smaller subgroups these subgroups are composed of mating adults mating groups mothers with calves nursery groups and nonbreeding adults dusky dolphins have a promiscuous mating system in which both males and females mate with multiple partners mating groups are generally made of around 10 males and a single female these mating groups can be found in both shallow and deep water but more often gather near shore markowitz t m markowitz w j and morton l m mating habits of new zealand dusky dolphins pp 151 76 in wursig b and wursig m editors

females unlike male bottlenose dolphins male dusky dolphins cannot monopolise females time when female dusky dolphins first reproduce varies between regions new zealand dolphins first reproduce at about seven to years with possibly six to seven years for argentine dolphins a study of dusky dolphins off coast of peru showed reproductive cycle lasts around 28 6 months with mother dolphins pregnant for 12 9 months lactating for a further 12 months and resting for 3 7 months before cycle begins again during copulation females tend to be on top as with all species where females mate with multiple partners male dusky dolphins have large testicles for sperm competition dusky dolphins sometimes engage in sexual behaviour for reasons other than reproduction perhaps for greeting communication or strengthening social bonds homosexual behaviour between males has been observed dolphins having sex for social reasons tend to be more relaxed females with calves tend to gather in nursery groups in shallow water nursery groups likely provide mothers and calves more time to rest which is important for both while behaviours of nursery groups vary by month resting is predominant behaviour during most months weir j deutsch s and pearson h c dusky dolphin calf rearing pp 177 94 in wursig b and wursig m editors dusky dolphin master acrobat off different shores academic press 2010 formation of nursery groups in shallow waters also allows members to hunt prey species that inhabit in these waters both adults and calves have been observed to chase and catch fish and adults may be teaching calves how to hunt in contrast to shallower waters hunting in deep water at night may be too dangerous for calves calves are particularly vulnerable to predators like killer whales and use of shallow water by nursery groups may be a way to avoid predation nursery groups tend to avoid mating groups adult males in these groups will aggressively herd and chase females they can separate calves from their mothers and harass them as well calves may also become even more vulnerable to predators as they become exhausted and disoriented mother dolphins may look after calves that are not

perform head over tail leaps which have been called most acrobatic of displays a headfirst re entry is performed when a dolphin leaps entirely out of water and positions its back in a curve while it flips tail to land back in water head first humping is similar except snout and tail remain in water when dolphin is arch leaps head over tail leaps backslaps headslaps tailslaps and spins are often done over and over again young dusky dolphins apparently are not born with ability to perform leaps and must learn to master each one calves appear to learn leaps in this order noisy leaps head first

with currently available estimates of abundance and removals subpopulation off peru has probably been overexploited but present data do not allow estimation of present decline dusky dolphins may fall victim to small cetacean fisheries of peru and chile expansion of these fisheries could have started in peru when anchoveta fishery collapsed in 1972 dolphins have also been caught in gill nets in new
