traumatic brain injury tbi also known as intracranial injury occurs when an external force injures brain tbi can be classified based on severity mechanism closed or penetrating head injury or other features e g occurring in a specific location or over a widespread area head injury is a broader category that may involve damage to other structures such as scalp and skull tbi can result in physical cognitive social emotional and behavioral symptoms and outcome can range from complete recovery to permanent disability or death causes include falls vehicle collisions and violence brain trauma occurs as a consequence of a sudden acceleration or deceleration within cranium or by a complex combination of both movement and sudden impact in addition to damage caused at moment of injury a variety of events following injury may result in further injury these processes include alterations in cerebral blood flow and pressure within skull some of imaging techniques used for diagnosis include computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging prevention measures include use of seat belts and helmets not drinking and driving fall prevention efforts in older adults and safety measures for children depending on injury treatment required may be minimal or may include interventions such as medications emergency surgery or surgery years later physical therapy speech therapy recreation therapy occupational therapy and vision therapy may be employed for rehabilitation counseling supported employment and community support services may also be useful tbi is a major cause of death and disability worldwide especially in children and young adults males sustain traumatic brain injuries more frequently than do females 20th century saw developments in diagnosis and treatment that decreased death rates and improved outcomes classification traumatic brain injury is defined as damage to brain resulting from external mechanical force such as rapid acceleration or deceleration impact blast waves or penetration by a projectile brain function is temporarily or permanently impaired and structural damage may or may not be detectable with current technology tbi is one of two subsets of acquired brain injury brain damage that occur after birth other subset is non traumatic brain injury which does not involve external mechanical force examples include stroke and infection all traumatic brain injuries are head injuries but latter term may also refer to injury to other parts of head however terms head injury and brain injury are often used interchangeably similarly brain injuries fall under classification of central nervous system et al 2007 p 16 and neurotrauma in neuropsychology research literature in general term traumatic brain injury is used to refer to non penetrating traumatic brain injuries tbi is usually classified based on severity anatomical features of injury and mechanism causative forces mechanism related classification divides tbi into closed and penetrating head injury a closed also called or blunt injury occurs when brain is not exposed a penetrating or open head injury occurs when an object pierces skull and breaches dura mater outermost membrane surrounding brain severity severity of traumatic brain injury gcs pta loc mild 13 15 1 day 0 30 minutes moderate 9 12 1 to 30 min to 24 hours severe 3 8 7 days 24 hours brain injuries can be classified into mild moderate and severe categories glasgow coma scale gcs most commonly used system for classifying tbi severity grades a person s level of consciousness on a scale of 3 15 based on verbal motor and eye opening reactions to stimuli marion 1999 p 4 in general it is agreed that a tbi with a gcs of 13 or above is mild 9 12 is moderate and 8 or below is severe similar systems exist for young children however gcs grading system has limited ability to predict outcomes because of this other classification systems such as one shown in table are also used to help determine severity a current model developed by department of defense and department of veterans affairs uses all three criteria of gcs after resuscitation duration of post traumatic amnesia pta and loss of consciousness loc it also has been proposed to use changes that are visible on neuroimaging such as swelling focal lesions or diffuse injury as method of classification grading scales also exist to classify severity of mild tbi commonly called concussion these use duration of loc pta and other concussion symptoms pathological features right thumb ct scan spread of subdural hematoma single arrows midline shift double arrows systems also exist to classify tbi by its pathological features lesions can be extra axial occurring within skull but outside of brain or intra axial occurring within brain tissue damage from tbi can be focal or diffuse confined to specific areas or distributed in a more general manner respectively however it is common for both types of injury to exist in a given case diffuse injury manifests with little apparent damage in neuroimaging studies but lesions can be seen with microscopy techniques post mortem granacher 2007 p 32 and in early 2000s researchers discovered that diffusion tensor imaging dti a way of processing mri images that shows white matter tracts was an effective tool for displaying extent of diffuse axonal injury types of injuries considered diffuse include edema swelling and diffuse axonal injury which is widespread damage to axons including white matter tracts and projections to cortex types of injuries considered diffuse include concussion and diffuse axonal injury widespread damage to axons in areas including white matter and cerebral hemispheres focal injuries often produce symptoms related to functions of damaged area research shows that most common areas to have focal lesions in non penetrating traumatic brain injury are orbitofrontal cortex lower surface of frontal lobes and anterior temporal lobes areas that are involved in social behavior emotion regulation olfaction and decision making hence common social emotional and judgment deficits following moderate severe tbi symptoms such as hemiparesis or aphasia can also occur when less commonly affected areas such as motor or language areas are respectively damaged one type of focal injury cerebral laceration occurs when tissue is cut or torn such tearing is common in orbitofrontal cortex in particular because of bony protrusions on interior skull ridge above eyes in a similar injury cerebral contusion bruising of brain tissue blood is mixed among tissue in contrast intracranial hemorrhage involves bleeding that is not mixed with tissue hematomas also focal lesions are collections of blood in or around brain that can result from hemorrhage intracerebral hemorrhage with bleeding in brain tissue itself is an intra axial lesion extra axial lesions include epidural hematoma subdural hematoma subarachnoid hemorrhage and intraventricular hemorrhage epidural hematoma involves bleeding into area between skull and dura mater outermost of three membranes surrounding brain in subdural hematoma bleeding occurs between dura and arachnoid mater subarachnoid hemorrhage involves bleeding into space between arachnoid membrane and pia mater intraventricular hemorrhage occurs when there is bleeding in ventricles signs and symptoms thumb unequal pupil size is potentially a sign of a serious brain injury symptoms are dependent on type of tbi diffuse or focal and part of brain that is affected unconsciousness tends to last longer for people with injuries on left side of brain than for those with injuries on right symptoms are also dependent on injury s severity with mild tbi patient may remain conscious or may lose consciousness for a few seconds or minutes other symptoms of mild tbi include headache vomiting nausea lack of motor coordination dizziness difficulty balancing lightheadedness blurred vision or tired eyes ringing in ears bad taste in mouth fatigue or lethargy and changes in sleep patterns cognitive and emotional symptoms include behavioral or mood changes confusion and trouble with memory concentration attention or thinking mild tbi symptoms may also be present in moderate and severe injuries a person with a moderate or severe tbi may have a headache that does not go away repeated vomiting or nausea convulsions an inability to awaken dilation of one or both pupils slurred speech aphasia word finding difficulties dysarthria muscle weakness that causes disordered speech weakness or numbness in limbs loss of coordination confusion restlessness or agitation common long term symptoms of moderate to severe tbi are changes in appropriate social behavior deficits in social judgment and cognitive changes especially problems with sustained attention processing speed and executive functioning alexithymia a deficiency in identifying understanding processing and describing emotions occurs in 60 9 of individuals with tbi cognitive and social deficits have long term consequences for daily lives of people with moderate to severe tbi but can be improved with appropriate rehabilitation when pressure within skull intracranial pressure abbreviated icp rises too high it can be deadly signs of increased icp include decreasing level of consciousness paralysis or weakness on one side of body and a blown pupil one that fails to constrict in response to light or is slow to do so cushing s triad a slow heart rate with high blood pressure and respiratory depression is a classic manifestation of significantly raised icp unequal pupil size is another sign of serious tbi abnormal posturing a characteristic positioning of limbs caused by severe diffuse injury or high icp is an ominous sign small children with moderate to severe tbi may have some of these symptoms but have difficulty communicating them other signs seen in young children include persistent crying inability to be consoled listlessness refusal to nurse or eat and irritability causes most common causes of tbi in u s include violence transportation accidents construction and sports motor bikes are major causes increasing in significance in developing countries as other causes reduce estimates that between 1 6 and 3 8 million traumatic brain injuries each year are a result of sports and recreation activities in us in children aged two to four falls are most common cause of tbi while in older children traffic accidents compete with falls for this position granacher 2007 p 16 tbi is third most common injury to result from child abuse abuse causes 19 of cases of pediatric brain trauma and death rate is higher among these cases although men are twice as likely to have a tbi domestic violence is another cause of tbi as are work related and industrial accidents firearms and blast injuries from explosions are other causes of tbi which is leading cause of death and disability in war zones according to representative bill pascrell democrat nj tbi is signature injury of wars in iraq and afghanistan there is a promising technology called activation database guided

intensity and duration of forces all contribute to characteristics and severity tbi forces that may contribute to tbi include angular rotational shear and translational forces even in absence of an impact significant acceleration or deceleration of head can cause tbi however in most cases a combination of impact and acceleration is probably to blame forces involving head striking or being struck by something termed contact or impact loading are cause of most focal injuries and movement of brain within skull termed or inertial loading usually causes diffuse injuries violent shaking of an infant that causes shaken baby syndrome commonly manifests as diffuse injury in impact loading force sends shock waves through skull and brain resulting in tissue damage shock waves caused by penetrating injuries can also destroy tissue along path of a projectile compounding damage caused by missile itself damage may occur directly under site of impact or it may occur on side opposite impact coup and contrecoup injury respectively when a moving object impacts stationary head coup injuries are typical while contrecoup injuries are usually produced when moving head strikes a stationary object primary and secondary injury thumb right mri scan showing damage due to brain herniation after tbi a large percentage of people killed by brain trauma do not die right away but rather days to weeks after event rather than improving after being hospitalized some 40 of tbi patients deteriorate primary brain injury damage that occurs at moment of trauma when tissues and blood vessels are stretched compressed and torn is not adequate to explain this deterioration rather it is caused by secondary injury a complex set of cellular processes and biochemical cascades that occur in minutes to days following trauma these secondary processes can dramatically worsen damage caused by primary injury and account for greatest number of tbi deaths occurring in hospitals secondary injury events include damage to blood brain barrier release of factors that cause inflammation free radical overload excessive release of neurotransmitter glutamate excitotoxicity influx of calcium and sodium ions into neurons and dysfunction of mitochondria injured axons in brain s white matter may separate from their cell bodies as a result of secondary injury potentially killing those neurons other factors in secondary injury are changes in blood flow to brain ischemia insufficient blood flow cerebral hypoxia insufficient oxygen in brain cerebral edema swelling of brain and raised intracranial pressure pressure within skull intracranial pressure may rise due to swelling or a mass effect from a lesion such as a hemorrhage as a result cerebral perfusion pressure pressure of blood flow in brain is reduced ischemia results when pressure within skull rises too high it can cause brain death or herniation in which parts of brain are squeezed by structures in skull a particularly weak part of skull that is vulnerable to damage causing is pterion deep in which lies middle meningeal artery which is easily damaged in fractures of pterion since pterion is so weak this type of injury can easily occur and can be secondary due to trauma to other parts of skull where impact forces spreads to pterion diagnosis left thumb ct scan showing epidural hematoma arrow diagnosis is suspected based on lesion circumstances and clinical evidence most prominently a neurological examination for example checking whether pupils constrict normally in response to light and assigning a glasgow coma score neuroimaging helps in determining diagnosis and prognosis and in deciding what treatments to give dsm 5 can be utilized to diagnose tbi and its psychiatric sequelae preferred radiologic test in emergency setting is computed tomography ct it is quick accurate and widely available follow up ct scans may be performed later to determine whether injury has progressed magnetic resonance imaging mri can show more detail than ct and can add information about expected outcome in long term it is more useful than ct for detecting injury characteristics such as diffuse axonal injury in longer term however mri is not used in emergency setting for reasons including its relative inefficacy in detecting bleeds and fractures its lengthy acquisition of images inaccessibility of patient in machine and its incompatibility with metal items used in emergency care a variant of mri since 2012 is high definition fiber tracking other techniques may be used to confirm a particular diagnosis x rays are still used for head trauma but evidence suggests they are not useful head injuries are either so mild that they do not need imaging or severe enough to merit more accurate ct angiography may be used to detect blood vessel pathology when risk factors such as penetrating head trauma are involved functional imaging can measure cerebral blood flow or metabolism inferring neuronal activity in specific regions and potentially helping to predict outcome electroencephalography and transcranial doppler may also be used most sensitive physical measure to date is quantitative eeg which has documented an 80 to 100 ability in discriminating between normal and traumatic brain injured subjects neuropsychological assessment can be performed to evaluate long term cognitive sequelae and to aid in planning of rehabilitation instruments range from short measures of general mental functioning to complete batteries formed of different domain specific tests prevention right thumb protective sports equipment such as helmets can help to protect athletes from head injury since a major cause of tbi are vehicle accidents their prevention or amelioration of their consequences can both reduce incidence and gravity of tbi in accidents damage can be reduced by use of seat belts child safety seats and motorcycle helmets and presence of roll bars and airbags education programs exist to lower number of crashes in addition changes to public policy and safety laws can be made these include speed limits seat belt and helmet laws and road engineering practices changes to common practices in sports have also been discussed an increase in use of helmets could reduce incidence of tbi due to possibility that repeatedly heading a ball practicing soccer could cause cumulative brain injury idea of introducing protective headgear for players has been proposed improved equipment design can enhance safety softer baseballs reduce head injury risk rules against dangerous types of contact such as spear tackling in american football when one player tackles another head first may also reduce head injury rates falls can be avoided by installing grab bars in bathrooms and handrails on stairways removing tripping hazards such as throw rugs or installing window guards and safety gates at top and bottom of stairs around young children playgrounds with shock absorbing surfaces such as mulch or sand also prevent head injuries child abuse prevention is another tactic programs exist to prevent shaken baby syndrome by educating about dangers of shaking children gun safety including keeping guns unloaded and locked is another preventative measure studies on effect of laws that aim to control access to guns in united states have been insufficient to determine their effectiveness preventing number of deaths or injuries recent clinical and laboratory research by neurosurgeon julian m d and his colleagues from west virginia university has resulted in papers showing that dietary supplementation with omega 3 dha offers protection against biochemical brain damage that occurs after a traumatic injury rats given dha prior to induced brain injuries suffered smaller increases in two key markers for brain damage app and caspase 3 as compared with rats given no dha potential for dha to provide prophylactic benefit to brain against traumatic injury appears promising and requires further investigation essential concept of daily dietary supplementation with dha so that those at significant risk may be preloaded to provide protection against acute effects of tbi has tremendous public health implications furthermore acetylcysteine has been confirmed in a recent double blind placebo controlled trial conducted by us military to reduce effects of blast induced mild traumatic brain and neurological injury in soldiers multiple animal studies have also demonstrated its efficacy in reducing damage associated with moderate traumatic brain or spinal injury and also ischemia induced brain injury in particular it has been demonstrated through multiple studies to significantly reduce neuronal losses and to improve cognitive and neurological outcomes associated with these traumatic events acetylcysteine has been safely used to treat paracetamol overdose for over forty years and is extensively used in emergency medicine treatment it is important to begin emergency treatment within so called golden hour following injury kluger jeffrey dealing with brain injuries time magazine april 6 2009 p 57 online http www time com time magazine article 0 00 html accessed may 1 2009 people with moderate to severe injuries are likely to receive treatment in an intensive care unit followed by a neurosurgical ward treatment depends on recovery stage of patient in acute stage primary aim is to stabilize patient and focus on preventing further injury this is done because initial damage caused by trauma cannot be reversed rehabilitation is main treatment for subacute and chronic stages of recovery international clinical guidelines have been proposed with aim of guiding decisions in tbi treatment as defined by an authoritative examination of current evidence acute stage acid within three hours of a head injury decreases risk of death certain facilities are equipped to handle tbi better than others initial measures include transporting patients to an appropriate treatment center both during transport and in hospital primary concerns are ensuring proper oxygen supply maintaining adequate blood flow to brain and controlling raised intracranial pressure icp since high icp deprives brain of badly needed blood flow and can cause deadly brain herniation other methods to prevent damage include management of other injuries and prevention of seizures some data supports use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy to improve outcomes neuroimaging is helpful but not flawless in detecting raised icp a more accurate way to measure icp is to place a catheter into a ventricle of brain which has added benefit of allowing cerebrospinal fluid to drain releasing pressure in skull treatment of raised icp may be as simple as tilting person s bed and straightening head to promote blood flow through veins of neck sedatives analgesics and paralytic agents are often used hypertonic saline can improve icp by reducing amount of cerebral water swelling though it is used with caution to avoid electrolyte imbalances or heart failure mannitol an osmotic diuretic appears to be equally effective at reducing icp some concerns however have been raised regarding some of studies performed diuretics drugs that increase urine output to reduce excessive fluid in system may be used to treat high intracranial pressures but may cause insufficient blood volume hyperventilation larger and or faster breaths reduces carbon dioxide levels and causes blood vessels to constrict this decreases blood flow to brain and reduces icp but it potentially causes ischemia and is therefore used only in short term giving corticosteroids is associated with an increased risk of death and so their routine use is not recommended endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation may be used to ensure proper oxygen supply and provide a secure airway hypotension low blood pressure which has a devastating outcome in tbi can be prevented by giving intravenous fluids to maintain a normal blood pressure failing to maintain blood pressure can result in inadequate blood flow to brain blood pressure may be kept at an artificially high level under controlled conditions by infusion of norepinephrine or similar drugs this helps maintain cerebral perfusion body temperature is carefully regulated because increased temperature raises brain s metabolic needs potentially depriving it of nutrients seizures are common while they can be treated with benzodiazepines these drugs are used carefully because they can depress breathing and lower blood pressure people with tbi are more susceptible to side effects and may react adversely to some medications during treatment monitoring continues for signs of deterioration such as a decreasing level of consciousness traumatic brain injury may cause a range of serious coincidental complications that include cardiac arrhythmias and neurogenic pulmonary edema these conditions must be adequately treated and stabilised as part of core care surgery can be performed on mass lesions or to eliminate objects that have penetrated brain mass lesions such as contusions or hematomas causing a significant mass effect shift of intracranial structures are considered emergencies and are removed surgically for intracranial hematomas collected blood may be removed using suction or forceps or it may be floated off with water surgeons look for hemorrhaging blood vessels and seek to control bleeding in penetrating brain injury damaged tissue is surgically and craniotomy may be needed craniotomy in which part of skull is removed may be needed to remove pieces of fractured skull or objects embedded in brain decompressive craniectomy dc is performed routinely in very short period following tbi during operations to treat hematomas part of skull is removed temporarily primary dc dc performed hours or days after tbi in order to control high intracranial pressures secondary dc has not been shown to improve outcome in some trials and may be associated with severe side effects chronic stage right thumb physical therapy will commonly include muscle strength exercise once medically stable people may be transferred to a subacute rehabilitation unit of medical center or to an independent rehabilitation hospital rehabilitation aims to improve independent functioning at home and in society and to help adapt to disabilities rehabilitation has demonstrated its general effectiveness when conducted by a team of health professionals who specialize in head trauma as for any person with neurologic deficits a multidisciplinary approach is key to optimizing outcome physiatrists or neurologists are likely to be key medical staff involved but depending on person doctors of other medical specialties may also be helpful allied health professions such as physiotherapy speech and language therapy cognitive rehabilitation therapy and occupational therapy will be essential to assess function and design rehabilitation activities for each person treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms such as emotional distress and clinical depression may involve mental health professionals such as therapists psychologists and psychiatrists while neuropsychologists can help to evaluate and manage cognitive deficits after discharge from inpatient rehabilitation treatment unit care may be given on an outpatient basis community based rehabilitation will be required for a high proportion of people including vocational rehabilitation this supportive employment matches job demands to worker s abilities people with tbi who cannot live independently or with family may require care in supported living facilities such as group homes respite care including day centers and leisure facilities for disabled offers time off for caregivers and activities for people with tbi pharmacological treatment can help to manage psychiatric or behavioral problems medication is also used to control post traumatic epilepsy however preventive use of anti epileptics is not recommended in those cases where person is bedridden due to a reduction of consciousness has to remain in a wheelchair because of mobility problems or has any other problem heavily impacting self caring capacities caregiving and nursing are critical most effective research documented intervention approach is activation database guided eeg biofeedback approach which has shown significant improvements in memory abilities of tbi subject that are far superior than traditional approaches strategies computers medication intervention gains of 2 61 standard deviations have been documented tbi s auditory memory ability was superior to control group after treatment prognosis prognosis worsens with severity of injury most tbis are mild and do not cause permanent or long term disability however all severity levels of tbi have potential to cause significant long lasting disability permanent disability is thought to occur in 10 of mild injuries 66 of moderate injuries and 100 of severe injuries most mild tbi is completely resolved within three weeks almost all people with mild tbi are able to live independently and return to jobs they had before injury although a small portion have mild cognitive and social impairments over 90 of people with moderate tbi are able to live independently although some require assistance in areas such as physical abilities employment and financial managing most people with severe closed head injury either die or recover enough to live independently middle ground is less common coma as it is closely related to severity is a strong predictor of poor outcome prognosis differs depending on severity and location of lesion and access to immediate specialised acute management subarachnoid hemorrhage approximately doubles mortality subdural hematoma is associated with worse outcome and increased mortality while people with epidural hematoma are expected to have a good outcome if they receive surgery quickly diffuse axonal injury may be associated with coma when severe and poor outcome following acute stage prognosis is strongly influenced by patient s involvement in activity that promote recovery which for most patients requires access to a specialised intensive rehabilitation service functional independence measure is a way to track progress and degree of independence throughout rehabilitation medical complications are associated with a bad prognosis examples of such complications include hypotension low blood pressure hypoxia low blood oxygen saturation lower cerebral perfusion pressures and longer times spent with high intracranial pressures patient characteristics also influence prognosis examples of factors thought to worsen it include abuse of substances such as illicit drugs and alcohol and age over sixty or under two years in children younger age at time of injury may be associated with a slower recovery of some abilities other influences that may affect recovery include pre injury intellectual ability coping strategies personality traits family environment social support systems and financial circumstances life satisfaction has been known to decrease for individuals with tbi immediately following trauma but evidence has shown that life roles age and depressive symptoms influence trajectory of life satisfaction as time passes complications thumb relative risk of post traumatic seizures increases with severity of traumatic brain injury thumb a ct of head years after a traumatic brain injury showing an empty space where damage occurred marked by arrow improvement of neurological function usually occurs for two or more years after trauma for many years it was believed that recovery was fastest during first six months but there is no evidence to support this it may be related to services commonly being withdrawn after this period rather than any physiological limitation to further progress children recover better in immediate time frame and improve for longer periods complications are distinct medical problems that may arise as a result of tbi results of traumatic brain injury vary widely in type and duration they include physical cognitive emotional and behavioral complications tbi can cause prolonged or permanent effects on consciousness such as coma brain death persistent vegetative state in which patients are unable to achieve a state of alertness to interact with their surroundings and minimally conscious state in which patients show minimal signs of being aware of self or environment lying still for long periods can cause complications including pressure sores pneumonia or other infections progressive multiple organ failure and deep venous thrombosis which can cause pulmonary embolism infections that can follow skull fractures and penetrating injuries include meningitis and abscesses complications involving blood vessels include vasospasm in which vessels constrict and restrict blood flow formation of aneurysms in which side of a vessel weakens and balloons out and stroke movement disorders that may develop after tbi include tremor ataxia uncoordinated muscle movements myoclonus shock like contractions of muscles and loss of movement range and control in particular with a loss of movement repertoire risk of post traumatic seizures increases with severity of trauma image at right and is particularly elevated with certain types of brain trauma such as cerebral contusions or hematomas people with early seizures those occurring within a week of injury have an increased risk of post traumatic epilepsy recurrent seizures occurring more than a week after initial trauma people may lose or experience altered vision hearing or smell hormonal disturbances may occur secondary to hypopituitarism occurring immediately or years after injury in 10 to 15 of tbi patients development of diabetes insipidus or an electrolyte abnormality acutely after injury indicate need for work up signs and symptoms of hypopituitarism may develop and be screened for in adults with moderate tbi and in mild tbi with imaging abnormalities children with moderate to severe head injury may also develop hypopituitarism screening should take place 3 to 6 months and 12 months after injury but problems may occur more remotely cognitive deficits that can follow tbi include impaired attention disrupted insight judgement and thought reduced processing speed distractibility and deficits in executive functions such as abstract reasoning planning problem solving and multitasking memory loss most common cognitive impairment among head injured people occurs in 20 79 of people with closed head trauma depending on severity people who have suffered tbi may also have difficulty with understanding or producing spoken or written language or with more subtle aspects of communication such as body language post concussion syndrome a set of lasting symptoms experienced after mild tbi can include physical cognitive emotional and behavioral problems such as headaches dizziness difficulty concentrating and depression multiple tbis may have a cumulative effect a young person who receives a second concussion before symptoms from another one have healed may be at risk for developing a very rare but deadly condition called second impact syndrome in which brain swells catastrophically after even a mild blow with debilitating or deadly results about one in five career boxers is affected by chronic traumatic brain injury ctbi which causes cognitive behavioral and physical impairments dementia pugilistica severe form of ctbi affects primarily career boxers years after a boxing career it commonly manifests as dementia memory problems and parkinsonism tremors and lack of coordination tbi may cause emotional social or behavioral problems and changes in personality these may include emotional instability depression anxiety mania apathy irritability problems with social judgment and impaired conversational skills tbi appears to predispose survivors to psychiatric disorders including obsessive compulsive disorder substance abuse dysthymia clinical depression bipolar disorder and anxiety disorders in patients who have depression after tbi suicidal ideation is not uncommon suicide rate among these persons is increased 2 to 3 fold social and behavioral symptoms that can follow tbi include disinhibition inability to control anger impulsiveness lack of initiative inappropriate sexual activity and social withdrawal and changes in personality tbi also has a substantial impact on functioning of family systems caregiving family members and tbi survivors often significantly alter their familial roles and responsibilities following injury creating significant change and strain on a family system typical challenges identified by families recovering from tbi include frustration and impatience with one another loss of former lives and relationships difficulty setting reasonable goals inability to effectively solve problems as a family increased level of stress and household tension changes in emotional dynamics and overwhelming desire to return to pre injury status in addition families may exhibit less effective functioning in areas including coping problem solving and communication and counseling models have been demonstrated to be effective in minimizing family disruption epidemiology thumb causes of tbi fatalities in us tbi is a leading cause of death and disability around globe and presents a major worldwide social economic and health problem it is number one cause of coma it plays leading role in disability due to trauma and is leading cause of brain damage in children and young adults in europe it is responsible for more years of disability than any other cause it also plays a significant role in half of trauma deaths findings on frequency of each level of severity vary based on definitions and methods used in studies a world health organization study estimated that between 70 and 90 of head injuries that receive treatment are mild and a us study found that moderate and severe injuries each account for 10 of tbis with rest mild incidence of tbi varies by age gender region and other factors findings of incidence and prevalence in epidemiological studies vary based on such factors as which grades of severity are included whether deaths are included whether study is restricted to hospitalized people and study s location annual incidence of mild tbi is difficult to determine but may be 100 600 people per 100 000 mortality in us case fatality rate is estimated to be 21 by 30 days after tbi a study on iraq war soldiers found that severe tbi carries a mortality of 30 50 deaths have declined due to improved treatments and systems for managing trauma in societies wealthy enough to provide modern emergency and neurosurgical services fraction of those who die after being hospitalized with tbi fell from almost half in 1970s to about a quarter at beginning of 21st century this decline in mortality has led to a concomitant increase in number of people living with disabilities that result from tbi biological clinical and demographic factors contribute to likelihood that an injury will be fatal in addition outcome depends heavily on cause of head injury in us patients with fall related tbis have an 89 survival rate while only 9 of patients with firearm related tbis survive in us firearms are most common cause of fatal tbi followed by vehicle accidents and then falls of deaths from firearms 75 are considered to be suicides incidence of tbi is increasing globally due largely to an increase in motor vehicle use in low and middle income countries in developing countries automobile use has increased faster than safety infrastructure could be introduced in contrast vehicle safety laws have decreased rates of tbi in high income countries which have seen decreases in traffic related tbi since 1970s each year in united states about two million people suffer a tbi approximately 675 000 injuries are seen in emergency department kindermann d mutter r pines jm emergency department transfers to acute care facilities 2009 statistical brief 155 agency for healthcare research and quality may 2013 and about 500 000 patients are hospitalized yearly incidence of tbi is estimated at 180 250 per 100 000 people in us 281 per 100 000 in france 361 per 100 000 in south africa 322 per 100 000 in australia and 430 per 100 000 in england in european union yearly aggregate incidence of tbi hospitalizations and fatalities is estimated at 235 per 100 000 demographics tbi is present in 85 of traumatically injured children either alone or with other injuries greatest number of tbis occur in people aged 15 24 because tbi is more common in young people its costs to society are high due to loss of productive years to death and disability age groups most at risk for tbi are children ages five to nine and adults over age 80 and highest rates of death and hospitalization due to tbi are in people over age 65 incidence of fall related tbi in first world countries is increasing as population ages thus median age of people with head injuries has increased regardless of age tbi rates are higher in males men suffer twice as many tbis as women do and have a fourfold risk of fatal head injury and males account for two thirds of childhood and adolescent head trauma however when matched for severity of injury women appear to fare more poorly than men socioeconomic status also appears to affect tbi rates people with lower levels of education and employment and lower socioeconomic status are at greater risk approximately half of those incarcerated in prisons and jails in united states have had a tbis history right thumb edwin smith papyrus head injury is present in ancient myths that may date back before recorded history boake and diller 2005 p 3 skulls found in battleground graves with holes drilled over fracture lines suggest that trepanation may have been used to treat tbi in ancient times granacher 2007 p 1 ancient mesopotamians knew of head injury and some of its effects including seizures paralysis and loss of sight hearing or speech edwin smith papyrus written around 1650 1550 bc describes various head injuries and symptoms and classifies them based on their presentation and tractability ancient greek physicians including hippocrates understood brain to be center of thought probably due to their experience with head trauma medieval and renaissance surgeons continued practice of trepanation for head injury in middle ages physicians further described head injury symptoms and term concussion became more widespread concussion symptoms were first described systematically in 16th century by da carpi it was first suggested in 18th century that intracranial pressure rather than skull damage was cause of pathology after tbi this hypothesis was confirmed around end of 19th century and opening skull to relieve pressure was then proposed as a treatment in 19th century it was noted that tbi is related to development of psychosis at that time a debate arose around whether post concussion syndrome was due to a disturbance of brain tissue or psychological factors debate continues today left thumb upright phineas gage with iron that entered his left cheek and emerged at top of his head perhaps first reported case of personality change after brain injury is that of phineas gage who survived an accident in which a large iron rod was driven through his head destroying one or both of his frontal lobes numerous cases of personality change after brain injury have been reported since 20th century saw advancement of technologies that improved treatment and diagnosis such as development of imaging tools including ct and mri and in 21st century diffusion tensor imaging dti introduction of intracranial pressure monitoring in 1950s has been credited with beginning modern era of head injury marion 1999 p 3 until 20th century mortality rate of tbi was high and rehabilitation was uncommon improvements in care made during world war i reduced death rate and made rehabilitation possible facilities dedicated to tbi rehabilitation were probably first established during world war i explosives used in world war i caused many blast injuries large number of tbis that resulted allowed researchers to learn about localization of brain functions blast related injuries are now common problems in returning veterans from iraq afghanistan research shows that symptoms of such tbis are largely same as those of tbis involving a physical blow to head in 1970s awareness of tbi as a public health problem grew boake and diller 2005 p 8 and a great deal of progress has been made since then in brain trauma research such as discovery of primary and secondary brain injury 1990s saw development and dissemination of standardized guidelines for treatment of tbi with protocols for a range of issues such as drugs and management of intracranial pressure research since early 1990s has improved tbi survival that decade was known as decade of brain for advances made in brain research research directions medications no medication is approved to halt progression of initial injury to secondary injury variety of pathological events presents opportunities to find treatments that interfere with damage processes neuroprotection methods to decrease secondary injury have been subject of interest follows tbi however trials to test agents that could halt these cellular mechanisms have met largely with failure for example interest existed in cooling injured brain however a 2014 cochrane review did not find enough evidence to see if it was useful or not maintaining a normal temperature in immediate period after a tbi appeared useful one review found a lower than normal temperature was useful in adults but not children while two other reviews found it did not appear to be useful in addition drugs such as nmda receptor antagonists to halt neurochemical cascades such as excitotoxicity showed promise in animal trials but failed in clinical trials these failures could be due to factors including faults in trials design or in insufficiency of a single agent to prevent array of injury processes involved in secondary injury other topics of research have included investigations into mannitol dexamethasone progesterone xenon barbiturates magnesium calcium channel blockers g agonists ethanol nmda antagonists caffeine procedures in addition to traditional imaging modalities there are several devices that help to monitor brain injury and facilitate research allows ongoing sampling of extracellular fluid for analysis of metabolites that might indicate ischemia or brain metabolism such as glucose glycerol and glutamate intraparenchymal brain tissue oxygen monitoring systems either or pto are used routinely in care in us a non invasive model called is in development research is also planned to clarify factors correlated to outcome in tbi and to determine in which cases it is best to perform ct scans and surgical procedures hyperbaric oxygen therapy hbo has been evaluated as an add on treatment following tbi findings of a 2012 cochrane systematic review does not justify routine use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy to treat people recovering from a traumatic brain injury this review also reported that only a small number of randomized controlled trials had been conducted at time of review many of which had methodological problems and poor reporting hbo for tbi is controversial with further evidence required to determine if it has a role psychological as of 2010 use of predictive visual tracking measurement to identify mild traumatic brain injury was being studied in visual tracking tests a head mounted display unit with eye tracking capability shows an object moving in a regular pattern people without brain injury are able to track moving object with smooth pursuit eye movements and correct trajectory test requires both attention and working memory which are difficult functions for people with mild traumatic brain injury question being studied is whether results for people with brain injury will show visual tracking gaze errors relative to moving target monitoring pressure pressure reactivity index is an emerging technology which correlates intracranial pressure with arterial blood pressure to
