wipeout 2097 stylised wipe out 2097 released as wipeout xl in north america is a futuristic racing game developed and published by psygnosis it is second installment released in wipeout series and direct sequel of original game released previous year it was originally released in 1996 for playstation and in 1997 for microsoft windows and sega saturn it was later ported by digital images to amiga in 1999 and by to mac os in 2002 whereas original game introduced anti gravity racing league in 2052 wipeout 2097 is set over four decades later and introduces player to much faster more competitive and more dangerous f5000 ag racing league game introduced a new damage interface and new weapons and tracks sega saturn version supported analogue control by using its 3d control pad whereas playstation version supported analogue control only through using optional twist controller wipeout 2097 received critical acclaim upon release reviewers praised game for its dramatic improvements to controls graphics and gameplay of original wipeout ign ranked game as 13th best playstation game of all time in 2002 gameplay thumb left gameplay from sega saturn version 250px gameplay does not differ much from previous title aside from different circuits and new weapons fundamental aspects were kept pilots race each other or computer controlled a i opponents to finish in highest position possible though crafts move at very high straight line speeds wipeout takes its inspiration from formula 1 breakthroughs by aspiring for even greater turning speeds using formula 1 parallel rather than using aerodynamics to increase wheel grip by down force for faster turning speeds wipeout uses a fictionalised method of air braking for ever greater turning force just moving a craft left or right alone is very responsive but by applying an air brake in direction of movement players zip around very tight turns at near top speed including those greater than 90 degrees by applying an air brake turn starts out gradually but as it continues change in direction increases sharply where necessary player may also use dual air brakes for rapid deceleration typically used if pilot has flown off racing line in tight corners and needs to steady player can also take on damage from enemy fire and be blown up but ship can be recharged to health at pit stop in exchange for a precious few seconds of race aside from usual tactical aspects of racing wipeout 2097 unlike its predecessor offered chance to eliminate other drivers from competition by destroying their craft with weapons each craft has a shield energy quota and when this quota reaches zero either from damage sustained from weapon attacks or impact from other craft or edges of circuit craft blows up craft also blows up if time limit is reached though this only applies to human players biggest weapon introduced in 2097 was quake disruptor which has been a series hallmark ever since this weapon causes a quake to whip up track sending opponent craft into air and smashing back down aim of game remains same from its predecessor complete increasingly difficult challenges to move on to next race difficulty level is changed by increasing top speed of craft through four different classes vector venom rapier and phantom number of laps needed to complete a race also increased with each new class victory in challenge modes is game s ultimate accomplishment these modes are similar to a championship where players have to race every track to become champion however rather than tallying up points challenge mode takes a very single player centric approach by only allowing progress to next track by coming in first on current track players can lose mode by losing all three lives which are lost by finishing a race in worse than third position by winning all races player is crowned champion and given access to faster modes new tracks and ultimately piranha craft development as with first installment wipeout 2097 was developed by liverpudlian developer psygnosis and promotional art was designed by sheffield based designers republic development cycle ran for seven months to cater for increase in wipeout players an easier learning curve was introduced whilst keeping difficulty at top end for experienced gamers game was originally intended as a tracks add on for original wipeout no sequel had been planned but andy satterthwaite who worked on ms dos version of original was asked by psygnosis to apply for role internal producer he did and during interview asked to do a sequel to wipeout but instead ended up developing extra tracks add on was titled wipeout 2097 because psygnosis did not want to give impression that it was a full sequel in united states it went by name of wipeout xl because it was felt that american players would not understand concept of game being set a century in future american title was originally to be wipeout xs for excess but it was pointed out that xs could also stand for extra small satterthwaite ended up with a team of two coders two of whom were new six artists and nick burcombe game s look was influenced by japanese culture because team had worked with designers republic nicky westcott was lead artist and her team built on original vehicle designs she also worked with designers and coders on tracks custom tools were created in softimage to develop tracks which were tweaked and team played each other s tracks to obtain feedback during process satterthwaite realised that he could do more than tracks add on he was tasked with producing work on tracks began in january 1996 and plan was to select eight tracks out of twenty designed and built in a month their skinning was expected to be complete by june with game anticipated for release in october despite work involved satterthwaite had three uninvolved coders collision code from original wipeout was also completely overhauled burcombe wanted to improve on original s ship handling and introduce a new weapon which led to new power up ideas westcott said that it was a collaboration between areas because of strict deadline gameplay change that had most interest was what happened to ships that hit track edges that ships stopped immediately in original game was considered too harsh it was desired that ships scraped edges instead and this took longer than expected to develop ghost vehicles were only featured in european version because atari had a patent on them from hard drivin in united states team wanted to make it possible to win races in any ship and a challenge was to make them all feel different and to still have their worth months of work rebalancing artificial intelligence was undertaken to ensure all vehicle and track settings were a challenge sony wanted a link up feature which proved difficult due to syncing issues and frame rate differences between pal and ntsc much extra content such as harder tracks and a prototype ship was added because according to westcott team were both enthusiastic and stressed and described their development as a period of great energy and immense exhaustion at same time an entire united kingdom nightclub tour was initiated in conjunction with red bull energy drink which was featured prominently throughout game before drink actually gained popularity in american market game was first unveiled
