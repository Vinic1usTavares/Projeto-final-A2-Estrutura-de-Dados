immediately making a sequel to alien having full support of 20th century fox president alan ladd jr however that year ladd left amid fox s transition to new owners marc rich and marvin davis and new studio management had no interest in sequel giler accused new president norman levy of being one that held back film s production levy would later declare that it was a movie i wanted to make but he felt another alien would prove too costly in meantime giler and partners walter hill and gordon carroll sued fox regarding disbursement of alien profits by time lawsuit was settled in 1983 fox had new executives that got interested in continuing alien giler pitched project to one of executives as a cross between hill s southern comfort and magnificent seven while producers and development executive larry wilson sought a writer for alien ii wilson came across james cameron s screenplay for terminator and passed script to giler feeling cameron was right for job giler then approached cameron who was completing pre production of terminator a fan of original alien cameron was interested in crafting a sequel and entered a self imposed seclusion to brainstorm a concept for alien ii after four days cameron produced an initial 45 page treatment although fox management put film on hiatus as some disliked pitch and they felt that alien had not generated enough profit to warrant a sequel a scheduling conflict with actor arnold schwarzenegger caused filming of terminator to be delayed by nine months as schwarzenegger was filming conan destroyer allowing cameron additional time to write a script for aliens while filming terminator cameron wrote 90 pages for aliens and although script was not finished fox s new president larry gordon was impressed and told him that if terminator was a success he would be able to direct aliens 57 years later continuing story superior firepower alien anthology blu ray cameron even declared that he spent production of terminator thinking on which elements of that film could make a good dry run for alien sequel following success of terminator cameron and producing partner gale anne hurd were given approval to direct and produce sequel to alien scheduled for a 1986 release cameron was enticed by opportunity to create a new world and opted not to follow same formula as alien but to create a worthy combat sequel focusing more on terror less on horror sigourney weaver who played ripley in alien had doubts about project but after meeting cameron she expressed interest in revisiting her character 20th century fox however refused to sign a contract with weaver over a payment dispute and asked cameron to write a story excluding ripley he refused on grounds that fox had indicated that weaver had signed on when he began writing script with cameron s persistence fox signed contract and weaver obtained a salary of a sum 30 times what she was paid for first film and equivalent to in present day terms weaver nicknamed her role in alien sequel referring to john rambo of rambo series and stated that she approached role as akin to titular role in henry v or women warriors in chinese classical literature cameron drew inspiration for aliens story from vietnam war a situation in which a technologically superior force was mired in a hostile foreign environment their training and technology are inappropriate for specifics and that can be seen as analogous to inability of superior american firepower to conquer unseen enemy in vietnam a lot of firepower and very little wisdom and it didn t work shay don aliens vol 27 attitude of colonial marines was influenced by vietnam war they are portrayed as cocky and confident of their inevitable victory but when they find themselves facing a technologically inferior but more determined enemy outcome is not what they expect cameron listed robert a heinlein s novel starship troopers as a major influence that led to incorporation of various themes and phrases such as terms drop and bug hunt as well as cargo loader exoskeleton casting thumb upright carrie henn in 2008 aliens is her only credited acting role as she opted not to pursue an acting career cameron opted to hire actors who had or could imitate american accents after over 3 000 individuals in united kingdom were unsuccessfully auditioned american actors were chosen instead including three who had previously worked with cameron on terminator lance henriksen bill paxton and michael biehn actors who played marines were asked to read robert a heinlein s novel starship troopers and undergo military training which included running lifting weights learning salutes marches deployments and maneuvers for two weeks cameron wanted marines to train together so that they would form bonds that would show on screen sigourney weaver william hope and paul reiser were absent from training because of other obligations but cameron felt that this suited their characters as outsiders in film weaver reprised her role from alien biehn was hastily cast a week after filming had commenced and thus was not present for military training that other actors playing marines went through james remar was originally cast as hicks but left project over creative differences with cameron in an interview on episode 128 of sidebar podcast remar stated that he was replaced due to being fired after he was arrested for drug possession only a few shots of him remain in film which is where team first enters alien hive only his back is seen this was because those sequences were too expensive to re shoot according to casting director newt was most difficult role to cast school children were auditioned but many of them had acted in commercials and were accustomed to smiling after saying their lines henn from atwater

battle casting and characterization superior firepower she received a saturn award for best performance by a younger actor but chose not to pursue an acting career and became a teacher matthews attributed his casting to his military experience filming thumb left producing team behind aliens james cameron and gale anne hurd aliens was filmed over ten months on a budget of at pinewood studios in england cameron bound by a low budget and a deadline found it difficult to adjust to what paxton called indentured working practices of british crew such as tea breaks that brought production to a halt many of crew had worked on alien and were fiercely loyal to ridley scott and they believed 31 year old cameron was too young and inexperienced to direct in response he arranged a screening of terminator which had not yet been released in uk but many of crew did not attend this time it s war pinewood studios 1985 superior firepower they also mocked producer gale anne hurd insisting that she was only receiving producer credit because she was married to cameron cameron clashed with original director of photography dick bush when bush started production saying schedule couldn t be met and when he insisted on lighting alien nest set brightly cameron insisted on a dark foreboding nest relying on lights from marines armor after bush was fired crew walked out hurd managed to coax team back to work and adrian biddle was hired as bush s replacement some scenes of alien nest were shot at decommissioned acton lane power station in acton london crew thought it was a perfect place to film because of its grilled walkways and numerous corridors but had to spend money to remove asbestos from station atmosphere processor set was not dismantled after filming and was reused in 1989 as axis chemicals set for batman 1989 music music composer james horner felt he was not given enough time to create a musical score horner arrived in england and expected film to be completed and to write score in six weeks which he thought was a sufficient amount of time horner however discovered that filming and editing were still taking place and he was unable to view film he visited sets and editing rooms for three weeks and found that editor ray lovejoy was barely keeping up with workload for reasons of time restrictions horner believed cameron was preoccupied with sound effects citing that cameron spent two days with sound engineer creating sounds for pulse rifles he also complained that he was given an outdated recording studio score was recorded with london symphony orchestra at abbey road studios a then 30 year old studio that was barely able to patch in synthesizers or use electronic equipment that horner required final countdown music editing and sound superior firepower six weeks from theatrical release no dubbing had taken place and score had not been written as horner was unable to view completed film final cue for scene in which ripley battles alien queen was written overnight cameron completely reworked scene leaving horner to rewrite music as gale hurd did not have much music production experience she and cameron denied horner s request to push film back four weeks so he could finish score horner felt that given more time he could get score to 100 of his satisfaction rather than 80 he estimated he had been able to achieve score was recorded in roughly four days despite his troubles horner received an academy award nomination his first for best original score horner stated that tensions between himself and cameron were so high during post production that he assumed they would never work together again horner believed that cameron s film schedules were too short and stressful two parted ways until 1997 when cameron impressed with horner s score for braveheart asked him to compose score for titanic design thumb right ah 1 cobra used in vietnam served as inspiration for design of dropship early concept art was created by syd mead who had previously worked on blade runner 2010 and tron one of original designs for spaceship sulaco was spherical but it was redesigned as ship would be out of frame due to film s aspect ratio cameron showed mead his own concept art and final result was described as rocket gun that carries stuff concept artists were asked to incorporate subliminal acknowledgments to vietnam war which included designing dropship as a combination of a f 4 phantom ii and ah 1 cobra building better worlds from concept to construction superior firepower thumb left armored personnel carrier apc was built upon chassis of a hunslet att 77 aircraft towing tractor british airways was re equipping several of its aircraft tug tractors and crew managed to purchase a 635 hp hunslet att 77 tug to use as armored personnel

came from a boeing 707 lockers helicopter engines and vending machines were used as set elements in opening hypersleep scene production designer peter lamont was asked to reduce cost of several scenes including not yet filmed colonial marine hypersleep sequence gale hurd wanted to cut scene altogether but lamont and cameron felt it was important to sequence of film to save on cost only four hypersleep chambers were created and a mirror was used to create illusion that there were twelve in scene instead of using hydraulics chambers were opened and closed by wires operated by puppeteers weapons used by colonial marines were based on fully functional weapons british armorers used guns they found to be most reliable when firing blanks and those which looked futuristic pulse rifles were created from a thompson smg with an attached of a franchi spas 12 shotgun and a remington 12 gauge model receiver with barrel smart guns carried by vasquez and drake were based on german mg 42 machine

three feet wide filming miniatures was difficult because of weather wind would blow over props however it proved helpful to give effect of weather on planet cameron used these miniatures and several effects to make scenes look larger than they really were including rear projection mirrors beam splitters camera splits and foreground miniatures due to budget limits cameron said he had to pay for robotic arm used to cut into ripley s shuttle in opening scene 36 things we learned from aliens commentary film school rejects practical effects supervisor john richardson who won a special effects oscar for his part in film declared his biggest challenge was creating forklift power loader exoskeletons which required only three months of work and had cameron complaining about visual details

stunt man standing behind it would move arms and legs alien suits were made more flexible and durable than ones used in alien to expand on creatures movements and allow them to crawl and jump dancers gymnasts and stunt men were hired to portray aliens various mannequins also were created to make aliens that stood in inhuman poses and could have their bodies exploded to simulate gunshot wounds stan winston s team created fully articulated facehuggers that could move their fingers these were moved by wires hidden on scenery or actors clothing one that walked towards ripley had a mechanism akin to a pull toy with pulleys that moved fingers and its jump combined three models shot separately walking facehugger a stationary model dangling on a table leg and another model being pulled towards

alien anthology before receiving a stand alone release following year fox released 30th anniversary blu ray of movie on september 13 2016 interpretation and analysis philosopher stephen mulhall has remarked that four alien films represent an artistic rendering of difficulties faced by woman s voice to have itself heard in a masculinist society because ripley continually encounters males who try to silence her and to force her to submit to their desires mulhall sees this depicted in several events in aliens particularly inquest scene in which ripley s explanation for deaths and destruction of nostromo as well as her attempts to warn board members of alien danger are met with officious disdain however mulhall believes that ripley s relationship with hicks illustrates that aliens is devoted to possibility of modes of masculinity that seek not to stifle but rather to accommodate female voice and modes of femininity that can acknowledge and incorporate something more or other of masculinity than our worst nightmares of it stephen mulhall in space no one can hear you scream acknowledging human voice in alien universe in film as philosophy essays on cinema after wittgenstein

macmillan page 46 android character bishop has been subject of literary and philosophical analysis as a high profile fictional android conforming to science fiction author isaac asimov s three laws of robotics and as a model of a compliant potentially self aware machine his portrayal has been studied by writers for university of texas press for its implications relating to how humans deal with presence of an other as ripley treats them with fear and suspicion after android ash tried to kill her in original alien movie and a form of hi tech racism and android apartheid is present throughout
