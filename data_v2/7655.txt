hurricane sandra was latest forming major hurricane in northeastern pacific basin strongest november pacific hurricane on record and record eleventh major hurricane of 2015 pacific hurricane season originating from a tropical wave sandra was first classified as a tropical depression on november 23 well south of mexico environmental conditions including high sea surface temperatures and low wind shear were highly conducive to intensification and storm quickly organized a small central dense overcast developed atop storm and sandra reached hurricane status early on november 25 after consolidation of an eye sandra reached its peak intensity as a category 4 hurricane on saffir simpson hurricane wind scale with winds of 150 mph 240 km h and a pressure of 934 mbar hpa 27 58 inhg early on november 26 this made sandra strongest november hurricane on record in northeastern pacific thereafter increasing shear degraded hurricane s structure and weakening ensued rapid weakening took place on november 27 and sandra s circulation became devoid of convection as it diminished to a tropical storm that evening cyclone degenerated into a remnant low soon thereafter and ultimately dissipated just off coast of sinaloa mexico on november 29 as precursor to sandra traversed central america it produced unseasonably heavy rainfall that triggered flooding and landslides four people died in various incidents related to system three in el salvador and one in honduras initially expecting a landfalling storm officials in northwestern mexico prepared equipment for power outages closed schools and evacuated 180 residents sandra s effects largely consisted of light to moderate rainfall some traffic accidents and landslides resulted from this though overall impacts were limited meteorological history on november 6 2015 a tropical wave emerged off west coast of africa into atlantic ocean only sporadic convection shower and thunderstorm activity accompanied system as it traveled west for next ten days as it reached southwestern caribbean sea on november 17 westerly winds associated with intertropical convergence zone spurred development of an area of low pressure and extensive convection forecasters at national hurricane center nhc noted potential for system to develop into a tropical cyclone however persistent wind shear inhibited this system from consolidating before it reached central america system emerged over pacific ocean near nicaragua on november 21 once back over water convection blossomed near low s center convection remained largely disorganized over following two days as system progressed westward in response to a subtropical ridge to north a tehuantepec gap wind event in conjunction with horizontal wind shear spurred development of a vortex within disturbance and a well defined low formed by 12 00 utc on november 23 six hours later low acquired sufficient convective organization including elongated banding features to north to be classified tropical depression twenty two e at this time depression was situated 435 mi 705 km south southwest of acapulco mexico aided by high sea surface temperatures of ample ocean heat content and low wind shear small system quickly intensified into a tropical storm at which time nhc assigned it name sandra and developed a central dense overcast a prominent banding feature with cloud tops below and frequent lightning formed north of circulation on november 24 by 18 00 utc a wide eye became apparent signaling onset of rapid intensification thumb right an intensifying tropical storm sandra on november 24 throughout november 25 sandra dramatically strengthened as deep convection blossomed around a tightening and clearing eye system achieved hurricane status by 06 00 utc and major hurricane status category 3 or higher on saffir simpson hurricane wind scale by 00 00 utc on november 26 prominent outflow became established atop cyclone and further aided intensification throughout strengthening phase a mid to upper level trough near west coast of north america created a weakness in subtropical ridge prompting sandra to turn north around western edge of high sandra reached its peak intensity as a high end category 4 hurricane around 06 00 utc on november 26 with maximum sustained winds of 150 mph 240 km h and a barometric pressure of 934 mbar hpa 27 58 inhg by this time hurricane s eye shrunk to less than 6 mi 10 km in diameter within hours however increasing wind shear began to impact circulation and caused convection to become asymmetric concurrently system started a turn northeast toward mainland mexico as it rounded ridge steadily increasing wind shear gradually unraveled sandra during latter part of november 26 and into november 27 storm s outflow though prominent to north became restricted on southern side sandra briefly regained organization around 00 00 utc on november 27 with its eye becoming redefined however persistent shear prevailed and system weakened below major hurricane status by 06 00 utc hurricane rapidly deteriorated throughout november 27 as convection became displaced to northeast of circulation low level circulation soon decoupled from mid to upper level circulations and sandra degraded to a tropical storm by 00 00 utc on november 28 convectively devoid low level circulation abruptly turned northwest in response to a shallow ridge failing to redevelop convection atop its center sandra degenerated into a remnant low by 06 00 utc sustained winds dropped below gale force by 18 00 utc intense thunderstorm activity did blossom to northeast of center late on november 28 prompting storm to resume a northeasterly course sandra s remnants eventually succumbed to strong shear and opened up into a trough roughly 60 mi 95 km southwest of culiacan mexico late on november 29 records reaching tropical storm status on november 24 sandra was fourth latest forming tropical storm in northeastern pacific basin since reliable records began upon becoming a hurricane at 06 00 utc on november 25 sandra was second latest such storm on record in northeastern pacific only hurricane winnie of 1983 only december hurricane on record in basin formed later this also marked record tying 16th hurricane to form in pacific north of equator and east of international dateline this record is shared with 1990 1992 and 2014 when it further became a major hurricane at 00 00 utc on november 26 sandra was latest forming such storm in northeastern pacific basin on record it surpassed previous record set by hurricane kenneth in 2011 by nearly four days sandra was also ninth major hurricane in northeastern pacific proper and eleventh east of dateline both setting a record for most in a single season sandra s peak intensity with winds of 150 mph 240 km h and pressure of 934 mbar hpa 27 58 inhg ranked it as strongest november hurricane on record in northeastern pacific surpassing hurricane kenneth s 145 mph 230 km h and 940 mbar hpa 27 76 inhg on a global scale sandra was 30th major hurricane and record shattering 25th category 4 or 5 storm of 2015 previous records were 23 and 18 respectively occurring in both 1997 and 2004 preparations and impact thumb right hurricane sandra succumbing to strong wind shear on november 27 note part of low level circulation exposed on west side of central dense overcast precursor to sandra produced unseasonably heavy rains across parts of central america leading to flooding in nicaragua flooding affected 55 homes and destroyed 1 primarily in managua a total of 56 families required evacuation local officials blamed flooding on trash clogged drains five people were injured in nueva segovia department when an ambulance crashed on a foggy rain slicked road a landslide in honduras destroyed a home killing a 25 day old baby and injuring four others in nueva el salvador two people drowned after being swept away by swollen el river flooding in killed one person and inundated homes in jiquilisco prompting evacuation of 14 families moisture from sandra streamed northward into southern plains and lower mississippi river valley and contributed to widespread rainfall and flooding heavy rains affected portions of texas oklahoma arkansas mississippi and tennessee dallas fort worth metroplex received of rain on november 27 their wettest november day on record this total contributed to breaking city s wettest year on record mexico on november 26 government of mexico issued a tropical storm watch for baja california sur between todos los santos and los this was discontinued less than 24 hours later state council of civil protection of baja california sur opened four shelters in both cabo san lucas and san jose del cabo school officials cancelled classes for november 27 in la paz federal electricity commission deployed 96 trucks to handle potential power outages on november 27 a tropical storm warning was raised for mainland mexico between and san blas as well as islas marias warning was discontinued following day as sandra rapidly dissipated alerts were raised across portions of sinaloa and nayarit in advance of hurricane port of mazatlan suspended operations on november 28 and public shelters were opened in city water pumps generators and relief crews were mobilized at port about 180 people from small community of boca nayarit evacuated inland storm also prompted delay of annual maraton pacifico on november 27 sandra produced wind gusts up to 40 mph 65 km h on socorro island as storm moved 115 mi 185 km southeast of island effects from sandra were minor and limited due to its dissipation offshore rainfall was limited to in most areas and largely considered beneficial in contrast to predictions of of rain across baja california sur only fell in san jose del cabo while other areas of los cabos municipality received a trace to no accumulation wet roads in cabo san lucas resulted in two accidents that left three people injured in chihuahua minor landslides damaged roads see also other storms named sandra list of category 4 pacific hurricanes timeline of 2015 pacific hurricane season notes references external links national
