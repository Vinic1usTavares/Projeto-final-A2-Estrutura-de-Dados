and it was never intended that they last more than five years it is remarkable that two ss john w brown and ss jeremiah o brien have not only survived seventy plus years of service but that they are in like new condition and are open to public as museums british needed a way to replace ships lost to german u boats but did not have resources to build them in 1939 they asked united states to help solve problem bringing a ship design that they wanted built design was modified to fit american production methods and five new shipyards were built to give shipbuilding industry capacity these ships were called ocean ships with each ship s name starting with ocean united states needed more ships as war approached ocean design was revised and simplified to allow mass production this new design was basis for liberty ship on december 7 1941 japan attacked military bases at hawaii guam and a few days later philippines liberty ships carried weapons ammunition food tools hardware vehicles and other things for war effort they could also be equipped to carry a large number of troops by rigging bunks in holds similar to those used by armed guard liberty ships began taking troops and materials

receiving dawn weather report that reported that air cover would not launch until poor weather cleared crews began their wait for inevitable arrival of japanese aircraft attack at about 0815 hours first kamikaze appeared on american ships radar and orders were immediately given for convoy to begin evasive manoeuvring through holes in clouds japanese pilots sighted large american force as it steamed through calm seas south of cebu and bohol islands japanese aircraft were three a6m zero fighters of 201st air group which had taken off from cebu at and were led by lt masami hoshino xing ye

japanese pilot had no intention of pulling out of his steep dive at 1020 despite damage to his aircraft he crashed between burke s 2 and 3 cargo holds a brief flash of fire was visible to most of ships in convoy and for several seconds only smoke could be seen billowing from her hold a few seconds later a huge pillar of fire shot out of burke s cargo hold followed by an immense cloud of white smoke within seconds all eyes were drawn to burke where an enormous fireball erupted as her entire cargo of munitions detonated instantly destroying ship and killing her crew of 40 merchant marine sailors and 28 or 29 armed guards for several seconds burke was not visible under an enormous mushroom cloud of smoke fire and explosions several ships nearby were damaged by force of blast and flying fragments shock wave rocked entire convoy and several ships reported that they had been torpedoed a us army fs type ship just aft of burke was severely damaged by blast sinking before it could be identified as cloud of smoke cleared nearby ships closed on burke s former position to search for survivors it was soon clear that burke and all men aboard her were gone combat air patrol arrived at 1213 after weather cleared providing air cover for next three hours japanese attack that morning was just beginning of a two day series of attacks on convoy costing several more ships and hundreds of lives in spite of near constant attacks force reached its destination at december 30 with much needed materials for mindoro invasion today ss john burke s fragments lie below surface in vicinity of 11
