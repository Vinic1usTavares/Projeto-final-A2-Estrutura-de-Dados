benzylpiperazine bzp is a recreational drug with and stimulant properties effects produced by bzp are comparable to those produced by amphetamine adverse effects have been reported following its use including acute psychosis renal toxicity and seizures no deaths have been reported following a sole ingestion of bzp although there have been at least two deaths from combination of bzp and mdma its sale is banned in several countries including australia canada new zealand united states republic of ireland united kingdom bulgaria romania and other parts of europe history development history it is often claimed that bzp was originally synthesized as a potential anti parasitic agent for use in farm animals however there are some references to bzp in medical literature that predate interest in piperazines as antihelminthics even so majority of early work with piperazines were investigations into their potential use as antihelminthics with earliest clinical trials in literature relating to piperazine being articles in british medical journal in 1950s it was discovered that bzp had side effects and was largely abandoned as a worm treatment it next appears in literature in 1970s when it was investigated as a potential antidepressant medication but rejected when research reported that bzp had amphetamine like effects and was liable to abuse study suggested that bzp should be placed under statutory control similar to those regulating use of amphetamine recreational history in early 1990s united states drug enforcement administration noted drug was being used recreationally in california it also reported that bzp was being used as an adulterant in illicit drugs not long after there was an explosion in drug s use worldwide a situation which was soon followed by legislative control in many countries since 1999 benzylpiperazine use grew sharply in new zealand due to an initial complete lack of regulation new zealand government attempted to ban product as of 18 december 2007 but necessary second reading of bill did not happen in time for law to be passed it was so widely used that an estimated 5 million pills were sold in new zealand in 2007 piperazine based stimulants began to appear in europe in 2000 but remained virtually unavailable in rest of world until recently in early 2006 pills containing active ingredients bzp and tfmpp began to appear in city of vancouver british columbia canada where they first gained popularity with late night party goers as a purported safer alternative to many of illicit street drugs commonly available there in 2007 piperazine based party pill formulations started to become widely available nationwide which has caused concern with local authorities such as health canada and subsequently bzp has gained much media attention in 2008 in united states it is still used as an adulterant in ecstasy mimic tablets production and distribution thumb 200px a selection of products containing bzp bzp is a piperazine derivative which comes as either hydrochloride salt or a free base hydrochloride salt is a white solid while base form is a slightly yellowish green liquid bzp base is corrosive and causes burns in countries where its purchase is legal bzp products are often produced in small specialist laboratories raw materials can be purchased from various chemical supply agencies and formed into tablets or capsules using relatively cheap production techniques resulting product can be marketed at extremely high markup so end user prices can be as high as 300 times bulk cost of raw ingredients bzp is often marketed ostensibly as a dietary supplement to avoid meeting stricter laws that apply to medicines and drugs despite fact that bzp has no dietary value as of late 2005 misuse of drugs act ensured it can no longer be classified or marketed as a dietary supplement in new zealand some retailers claim that bzp is a natural product describing it as a pepper extract or herbal high when in fact drug is entirely synthetic and has not been found to occur naturally pharmacodynamics bzp has been shown to have a mixed mechanism of action acting on and dopaminergic receptor systems in a similar fashion to mdma bzp has amphetamine like actions on serotonin reuptake transporter which increase serotonin concentrations in extracellular fluids surrounding cell and thereby increasing activation of surrounding serotonin receptors bzp has a lower potency effect on noradrenaline reuptake transporter and dopamine reuptake transporter bzp has a high affinity action at alpha2 it is an antagonist at receptor like which inhibits negative feedback causing an increase in released noradrenaline bzp also acts as a non selective serotonin receptor agonist on a wide variety of serotonin receptors binding to receptors may explain its mild hallucinogenic effects at high doses while partial agonist or antagonist effects at receptors may explain some of peripheral side effects as this receptor is expressed very densely in gut and binding to receptors may explain common side effect of headaches as this receptor is known to be involved in development of migraine headaches effects thumb right typical pupil dilation effects of bzp are largely similar to amphetamines with one study finding that former amphetamine addicts were unable to distinguish between dextroamphetamine and bzp administered intravenously a 2005 study has shown that mixtures of bzp with other piperazine drugs such as tfmpp share certain traits with mdma subjective effects upon ingestion of between 50 mg and 200 mg of bzp user may experience any or all of following initial effects feelings of euphoria wonder amazement well being energy and elation rapid mood elevation enhanced sociability enhanced appreciation of music increased desire to move also slight increase in stereotypy skin tingling decreased appetite repetitive thought patterns actual and perceived changes in body temperature mild jaw clenching bruxism increased heart rate dilation of pupils see photo nausea flushing mild xerostomia dry mouth slight urinary incontinence often described as leaking a small amount of urine after urinating not due to loss of bladder control later effects mild headache nausea hangover like symptoms common with high doses fatigue indigestion similar to acid indigestion heartburn increased hunger and sometimes thirst insomnia confusion depression particularly with frequent heavy use tolerance research into bzp s tolerance is sparse anecdotal evidence from online sources claim tolerance to central action of bzp will develop quickly due to tiredness associated with body s recovery from stimulants such as bzp it is uncommon for users to be able to sustain a week long intake toxic effects right thumb an impure ecstasy tablet seized by law enforcement in united states containing bzp methamphetamine and caffeine as with most stimulants there appear to be significant side effects associated with bzp use bzp reportedly produces insomnia and a mild to severe hangover after drug effect wears off however some manufacturers in new zealand have started including recovery pills which contain 5 htp and vitamins which allegedly ease these hangovers major side effects include dilated pupils blurred vision dryness of mouth extreme alertness pruritus confusion agitation tremor extrapyramidal symptoms dystonia akathisia headache dizziness anxiety insomnia vomiting chest pain hallucinations paresthesia tachycardia hypertension palpitations collapse hyperventilation sweating hyperthermia and problems with urine retention more severe toxic effects include psychosis or adverse psychiatric events renal toxicity respiratory failure hyperthermia serotonin syndrome rhabdomyolysis and seizure blood benzylpiperazine concentrations have been measured either to confirm clinical intoxication or as part of a medicolegal death investigation christchurch study majority of toxic effects information came from a study conducted between 1 april 2005 to 1 september 2005 study recorded all presentations associated with party pill use at emergency department of christchurch hospital new zealand by recording them on a prospective data collection form aim was to study patterns of human toxicity related to use of benzylpiperazine based party pills 61 patients presented on 80 occasions patients with mild to moderate toxicity experienced symptoms such as insomnia anxiety nausea vomiting palpitations dystonia and urinary retention significantly fourteen toxic seizures were recorded with two patients suffering life threatening toxicity with status epilepticus and severe respiratory and metabolic acidosis it was concluded that bzp appears to induce toxic seizures in neurologically normal subjects results of this study and others like it showed that bzp can cause unpredictable and serious toxicity in some individuals but data and dosage collection were reliant on self reporting by drug users which may result in under reporting or over reporting and there were complicating factors like frequent presence of alcohol and other drugs risk of fatality a retrospective study carried out at an auckland emergency department found that bzp presentations only made a minor contribution to their overdose database with most cases not producing any significant toxicity several cases where bzp individually or combined with alcohol or other medicines or illicit drugs resulting in complications exist one such example is well publicised case of a combination of bzp and mdma by a 23 year old from greymouth new zealand ben rodham a dj ingested a combination of bzp and mdma in february 2007 which nearly resulted in his death rodham was put into an induced coma in an effort to prevent him from dying he later recovered in a case in zurich in 2001 a 23 year old who had taken bzp and ecstasy mdma died from a massive cerebral edema 57 hours after hospital admission addictive effects one in every 45 2 2 last year users of bzp in new zealand is classed as dependent upon it although 97 9 of users said that it would not be difficult to stop using legal party pills and 45 2 of people who reported using both bzp and illegal drugs such as methamphetamine reported that they used bzp so that they did not have to use methamphetamine which was perceived as more harmful still most of people who use bzp even though they say it is quite easy to stop do not want to and continue to use drug feeling that it helps them to reach higher levels of mood sociability and energy studies undertaken on animals have indicated that bzp can substitute for methamphetamine in addicted rats although it is one tenth as potent and produces correspondingly weaker addictive effects legal issues drug was classified as a schedule i controlled substance in united states in 2002 following a report by dea which incorrectly stated that bzp was 10 to 20 times more potent than amphetamine when in fact bzp is ten times less potent than bzp is banned in all australian states victoria last state in which it was legal changed its classification on 1 september 2006 this is date bzp and piperazine analogs become illegal in federal schedules which are now enacted by all australian states and territories bzp is also a banned substance in japan along with tfmpp both australia and japan admit that their scheduling decisions were made primarily in response to schedule 1 classification given to bzp in us although some instances of bzp use had been reported by law enforcement authorities in both countries bzp is also banned in greece poland italy ireland malta estonia denmark and sweden in canada benzylpiperazine and salts of benzylpiperazine are classified as schedule iii controlled substances under controlled drugs and substances act piperazine and salts of piperazine are classified as prescription only medicines in uk any products containing salts of piperazine would be under medicines 8 of medicines act 1968 schedule 3 si medicines for human use marketing etc regulations 1994 and consequently anyone manufacturing and supplying it legally must hold relevant licenses to do so bzp is not a salt of piperazine but of bzp products as containing piperazine blend resulted in some prosecutions of suppliers in uk by medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency although none were successful in may 2009 home office announced plans to ban bzp and launched a consultation on proposal in october 2009 it was announced that from 23 december 2009 bzp and related piperazines would be class c drugs under misuse of drugs act bzp is not controlled under any un convention so compounds themselves are legal throughout most of world although in most countries their use is restricted to pharmaceutical manufacturing and recreational use is unknown benzylpiperazine is however to be subject of a european monitoring centre for drugs and drug addiction emcdda risk assessment results of which may determine what if any control will placed on bzp throughout european union risk assessment comes about as result of a joint emcdda report which concluded that bzp needs to be looked at in more detail results were published in june 2007 report concluded that use of bzp can lead to medical problems even if long effects are still unknown taking this concession as a basis european commission has decided to ask council to place bzp under control of un convention on psychotropic substances on 4 march 2008 eu requested countries to place bzp under control within a year and france complied in may 2008 based on recommendation of new zealand government has passed legislation which placed bzp along with other piperazine derivatives tfmpp pfpp and mbzp into class c of new zealand misuse of drugs act 1975 a ban was intended to come into effect in new zealand on 18 december 2007 but law change did not go through until following year and sale of bzp and other listed piperazines became illegal in new zealand as of 1 april 2008 an amnesty for possession and usage of these drugs was in effect until october 2008 at which point they became completely illegal chemical derivatives pharmaceuticals antidepressant antipsychotic antihistamine gastrointestinal agent nootropic imatinib anticancer agent antihistamine antidepressant agent
