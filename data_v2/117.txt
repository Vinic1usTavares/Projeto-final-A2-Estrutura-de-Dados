appearance of actor mark valley media outlets speculated that because valley and torv married over holiday break his departure would eliminate any chances of marriage conflicting with show co creator roberto orci called scott s final scene a truly satisfactory conclusion to his story creation of monster took series special effects crew approximately eleven days to implement they created molds of guest actor neal huff s head and back giving him creature eye contact lenses and covering back foam mold with eight different dentures were made of huff s mouth to depict character gradually losing his teeth anything from simple teeth that match his own to wiggling teeth that he can start to loosen up to ones where he s already started to lose a tooth explained special effects makeup crewman stephen kelley each appliance took about a day to create final version of creature kelley noted was very exaggerated he s got big giant quills coming off it like a porcupine and it s also got six nipples on it which is part of us trying to investigate what this creature actually it is andrew orloff creative director and visual effects supervisor of zoic studios considered creature one of most challenging effects his company helped make for season he explained that this and other designed monsters are really super fantastical they re really out there anatomy and biology of them is so wild and crazy that it really takes a lot to make it look real in scene and make it a part of actors are reacting to these things to get audience to believe in it is kind of biggest challenge we ve faced on show so far during filming cast and crew referred to monster as a were or lance reddick commented on set when i first got here tonight i was expecting zombies to come up out of ground and actual creature looks so bizarre i mean it really looks like something i wouldn t want to be caught in woods with crew spent over a week collecting and placing plane wreckage together according to set

fringes producers answered questions from audience when asked in an interview if giant germ from bound was grossest thing of season executive producer jeff pinkner replied that huge porcupine man on airplane from transformation was more shocking it was so unexpected at time transformation aired joshua jackson considered it series best episode john noble called it grotesque and possibly one of more gruesome ones we ve done analysis and legacy right thumb 180px allusions to island of doctor moreau authored by h g wells pictured have been perceived in episode in her 2011 book into looking glass exploring worlds of fringe author sarah clarke stuart observed that two unrelated fringe characters conrad moreau of transformation and moreau brad dourif of day we died are allusions to h g wells 1896 novel island of doctor moreau both are scientifically inspired men with questionable integrity while wells doctor moreau is an unethical researcher who fell under spell of research in a vein similar to walter like pilot episode transformation begins on passenger section of an airplane in flight actor mark valley was asked how episode differed from pilot leading him to joke that it s a completely different airline this time his character john scott was first seen in an episode about a plane disaster accordingly ign expressed it made sense thematically to have his last appearance be in an episode about a similar type of disaster los angeles times viewed flight number of 718 and its subsequent crash as a nod to co creator j j abrams other series lost episode also had an influence on series fourth season which featured parallel stories to those that occurred in earlier episodes season s sixteenth episode nothing as it seems centers around designer virus that had caused marshall bowman to transform but this time he does so in airport after his plane has safely landed peter recognizes case from his own timeline as seen in events of transformation and helps

gave episode a positive review opining that it hit perfect tone for fringe and had right mixture of science fiction dark comedy crime story and melodrama hanson was however disappointed with closure of olivia john scott storyline as he hoped that she doesn t carry this torch too long because he preferred flirty olivia ramsey isler of ign gave episode 9 0 10 an indication of an amazing installment he was pleased with absence of sanford harris and enjoyed brilliantly written and directed undercover sting operation particularly because peter was properly utilized as olivia s wingman isler also criticized monster s special effects and believed there were still unanswered questions concerning scott s storyline writing for a v club noel murray thought it was best freak meet of series thus far as well as one of its best episodes which he would eagerly show to fringe doubters as evidence that series has found its legs he consequently graded episode an a further attributing success of episode to top tier writers orci and whedon and skilled director brad anderson murray wrote i wouldn t say that transformation broke any new ground if anything it pretty much every previous fringe element bio weapons sales telepathic communication massive dynamics airplane crashes etc but did so in a way that was energetic tense and even a little emotional sfscope columnist sarah stegall had difficulty suspend ing her disbelief with science behind bowman s rapid transformation though she thought it was sweet that scott s proposal echo ed real life recent marriage between anna torv and mark valley stegall was pleased that series could now move onto another storyline references works cited external links transformation at fox category 2009 american television episodes category fringe season 1
