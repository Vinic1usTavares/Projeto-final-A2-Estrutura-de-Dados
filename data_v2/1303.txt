months adding fuel to an already volatile atmosphere in city of bjelovar where ambushed unit was originally based this tension erupted a week later with blockade and capture of yugoslav people s army jna barracks in bjelovar during a commemoration service held two years later a landmine exploded killing three and wounding others croatian authorities declared incident to be a terrorist attack and it contributed to croatian government s decision to launch operation medak pocket next day background in 1990 ethnic tensions between serbs and croats worsened after electoral defeat of government of socialist republic of croatia by croatian democratic union hdz yugoslav people s army jna confiscated croatia s territorial defence to weapons to minimize resistance on 17 august tensions escalated into an open revolt of croatian serbs centred on predominantly serb populated areas of dalmatian hinterland around knin approximately north east of split parts of lika kordun banovina and eastern croatia in january 1991 serbia supported by montenegro and serbia s provinces of vojvodina and kosovo unsuccessfully tried to obtain yugoslav presidency s approval for a jna operation to disarm croatian security forces request was denied and a bloodless skirmish between serb insurgents and croatian special police in march prompted jna itself to ask federal presidency to give it wartime authority and declare a state of emergency even though request was backed by serbia and its allies jna request was refused on 15 march serbian president slobodan milosevic preferring a campaign to expand serbia rather than to preserve yugoslavia with croatia as a federal unit publicly threatened to replace jna with a serbian army and declared that he no longer recognized authority of federal presidency threat caused jna to abandon plans to preserve yugoslavia in favour of expansion of serbia as jna came under milosevic s control by end of march conflict had escalated with first fatalities in early april leaders of serb revolt in croatia declared their intention to amalgamate areas under their control with serbia these were viewed by government of croatia as breakaway regions at beginning of 1991 croatia had no regular army to bolster its defence croatia doubled its police numbers to about 20 000 most effective part of croatian police force was 3 000 strong special police comprising twelve battalions organised along military lines there were also 9 000 10 000 regionally organised reserve police in 16 battalions and 10 companies but they lacked weapons in response to deteriorating situation croatian government established croatian national guard zng in may by expanding special police battalions into four all professional guards brigades under ministry of defence control and commanded by retired jna general martin spegelj four guards brigades comprised approximately 8 000 troops reserve police also expanded to 40 000 was attached to zng and reorganised into 19 brigades and 14 independent battalions guards brigades were only units of zng that were fully equipped with small arms throughout zng there was a lack of heavier weapons and there was poor command and control structure above brigade level shortage of heavy weapons was so severe that zng resorted to using world war ii weapons taken from museums and film studios at time croatian weapon stockpile consisted of 30 000 small arms purchased abroad and 15 000 previously owned by police to replace personnel lost to guards brigades a new 10 000 strong special police was established prelude following first skirmish in pakrac in march a predominantly serb populated area east of town straddling pakrac bucje pozega road remained generally beyond control of croatian authorities in early july insurrection spread to entire area between towns of pakrac and pozega and north to northern slopes of papuk and bilogora this development threatened to interdict croatian use of varazdin osijek road as it was within range of croatian serb artillery near slatina after serb rebels declared serbian autonomous oblast of western slavonia sao western slavonia and expanded territory under their control to include town of okucani most significant transport route between zagreb and slavonia zagreb belgrade motorway between novska and nova gradiska was severed sao western slavonia comprised no major settlements in order to address this deficiency croatian serb forces launched an offensive early on 19 august objectives of offensive were to capture towns of grubisno polje daruvar pakrac and lipik and consolidate territory of sao western slavonia offensive failed after arrival of croatian reinforcements from zagreb and bjelovar but line of control remained in close proximity to four towns timeline on 2 september zng deployed a company 1st battalion 105th infantry brigade to pakrac in order to reinforce police defences in area violence in western slavonia flared up once more on 3 4 september when croatian serb forces attacked villages of and south of slatina killing two policemen and 21 civilians on 8 september a company s reconnaissance platoon was tasked with using a gun truck and scouting area around village of kusonje platoon encountered no resistance before it reached village where it was ambushed by croatian serb troops platoon s gun truck was disabled and zng troops abandoned it and took shelter in a nearby house when it learned of ambush zng deployed a force to extract reconnaissance platoon relief force consisted of rest of a company supported by omega special police unit reserve police and zng reinforcements from virovitica reinforcements were unable to reach embattled reconnaissance platoon which was running low on ammunition stalemate continued until morning of 9 september when croatian serb forces used explosives to demolish a portion of house in which reconnaissance platoon had sought cover eleven members of reconnaissance platoon had been killed during fighting and remaining seven had run out of ammunition they surrendered to croatian serb forces which had surrounded house and were then killed by their captors aftermath as force which was sent to reinforce and extract reconnaissance platoon took further casualties total croatian losses in fighting and its immediate aftermath amounted to 20 killed fate of reconnaissance platoon was not immediately known to croatian authorities or relatives of troops for months adding fuel to an already volatile atmosphere in city of bjelovar where 105th brigade was originally based this tension erupted a week later with blockade and capture of jna barracks in bjelovar jna denied it had any knowledge on fate of croatian soldiers details of their deaths became known in december 1991 croatian
