that it featured all kinds of silly but in a very winning way rabin enjoyed all plots featured here and praised will forte s role as jenna s boyfriend and impersonator emily exton from entertainment weekly wrote that peacock storyline felt too silly and that forte was too underused as paul nonetheless said that despite not being greatest 30 rock episode of all time there were still some hilarious lines ign contributor robert canning liked grizz s dilemma plot commenting that grizz not trying to hurt tracy s feelings while tracy tried to keep dot com away from grizz s bride to be offered up some inspired lunacy his only complaint about argus was jack s plot as he deemed it disappointing a review in tv guide by adam mersel said fey and gang live up to challenge and produce argus a hilarious quite snotty episode that holds up to any comedy around meredith blake writing for los angeles times was positive towards episode reasoning that writing is just so deliciously absurd that i can t help but giggle whole way through and that plots featured here were sublimely inconsequential not a whole lot happened but it was all very funny nick catucci from new york magazine who did not enjoy two other stories appreciated jenna s explaining that by having character date one of her own impersonator was outrageous and funny without relying on any cheap insults to sean gandert from paste magazine reported that argus was an episode that took us back to show s roots explaining that recapturing old tone also worked to recapture old joke writing expertise it wasn t 100 consistent but there were so many good one liners to counterbalance misfires that it didn t even matter this is 30 rock way it should be houston press daniel carlson wrote that grizz s wedding story was pure filler but everything on show s kind of filler for wackiness so it mostly worked carlson wrote that best part from argus came with forte s paul as jenna s boyfriend and impersonator bob sassone of aol s tv squad did not respond well to episode observing that argus would go down 30 rock history as one of worst episodes of series one of problems he had was that jack character bonded with peacock for entire episode as i ve said before i hate episodes where jack is out of control or acting goofy or involved in some lame pursuit and this one of more lame pursuits references external links category
