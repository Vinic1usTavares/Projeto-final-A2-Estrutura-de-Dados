exceptional performances from its cast metacritic which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from film critics gave film a rating score of 79 based on 36 reviews indicating generally favorable reviews john anderson of variety said to simply call it harrowing or unsparing doesn t quite cut it having felt that film is courageous and uncompromising a shaken cocktail of debasement and elation despair and hope anderson cited carey s performance as pitch perfect and patton s role as ms blu rain as disarming owen gleiberman of entertainment weekly praised carey s performance describing it as having been an authentically deglammed compassion and praised film for capturing how a lost girl rouses herself from dead and for daniels showing unflinching courage as a filmmaker by going this deep into pathologies that may still linger in closets of some impoverished inner city lives gleiberman described film as being a movie that makes you think there but for grace of god go i it s a potent and moving experience because by end you feel you ve witnessed nothing less than birth of a soul and felt that final scene of revelation between sidibe s and mo nique s characters was strong enough to be able to leave viewers tearful shaken and dazed with pity and terror he identifies how daniels uses one of rich scenes created by fletcher to position mo nique in a painful confrontation with sidibe that results in a masterful and thought provoking performance that delivers final push needed by sidibe more precious tries to get away from her mother more she s pulled back roger ebert of chicago sun times praised mo nique and sidibe s performances ebert described mo nique s performance as being frighteningly convincing and felt that film is a tribute to sidibe s ability to engage our empathy because she completely creates precious character he noted that carey and patton are equal with sidibe in screen impact ebert praised daniels because rather than casting actors for their names he was able to see beneath surface and trust that they had within emotional resources to play these women and he was right betsey sharkey of los angeles times describes film as being a rough cut diamond a rare blend of pure entertainment and dark social commentary it is a shockingly raw surprisingly irreverent and absolutely unforgettable story claudia puig of usa today says that while there are melodramatic moments in film cast gives remarkable performances to show audiences film s inspiring message peter travers of rolling stone called mo nique dynamite a performance that tears at your heart mary pols of time praised film s fantasy sequences for being able to show audience a joyous wizard of oz energy that is able to open door into precious s mind in a way even author sapphire couldn t pols felt that while not implying that film has a lack of compelling emotional material but that film s few weak moments are ones that dovetail with typical inspirational stories marshall fine of huffington post praised film as being a film that doesn t shy away from depths to which human beings can sink but it also shows strength and resilience of which we are capable even at our lowest moments scott mendelson also of huffington post felt that when you put glaring issues aside film still works as a potent character study and a glimpse inside a world we d rather pretend does not exist in america but while film succeeds as a powerful acting treat and a potent character study there are some major narrative issues that prevent film from being an accidental masterpiece mendelson described film as being an acting powerhouse based on its many emotional themes critic jack mathews wrote without being familiar with source material you really have no idea how much work went into adaptation or how well it was done precious based on novel push by sapphire first time screenwriter geoffrey fletcher did yeoman s work turning sapphire s graphic idiomatic novel into a coherent and inspiring story about journey of an abused harlem teenager erin aubry kaplan writes on salon com that question posed by film is how to assess hopeless story of a ghetto teen in age of obama she goes on to say that precious proves you don t always have to choose between artistic and commercial success film s first opening weekend was record breaking it s a sign how much we needed to tell this story and perhaps how many stories there are left to tell a o scott identifies script s precise use of force and adept use of language including a memorable line created by fletcher for adaptation a risky remarkable film adaptation written by geoffrey fletcher facts of precious s life are also laid out with unsparing force though not in overly graphic detail but just as push achieves an eloquence that makes it far more than a fictional diary of extreme dysfunction so too does precious avoid traps of well meaning preachy lower depths realism it howls and stammers but it also sings inarticulate and emotionally shut down her massive body at once a prison and a hiding place precious is also perceptive and shrewd possessed of talents visible only to those who bother to look at its plainest and most persuasive her story is that of a writer discovering a voice these people talked like tv stations i didn t even watch she remarks of ms rain and her lover kimberly russell displaying her awakening literary intelligence even as she marvels at discovery of her ignorance conversely reflecting transformation from script to screen dana stevens of slate disagrees with gleiberman s suggestion that film makes you think and argues that film s eagerness to drag audience through lower depths of human experience leaves little space for independent conclusions stevens noted that while film is about improvement and self actualization it wields an awfully large cudgel in contrast to scott s view of balance unsparing force though not in overly graphic detail perhaps sharing mathews view regarding daunting challenge of adapting harsh story of push stevens observes that daniels and fletcher no doubt intended for their film to lend a voice to kind of protagonist too often excluded from american movie screens a poor black overweight single mother from inner city precious has also received some negative responses from critics writing for new york press armond white compared film to landmark but controversial birth of a nation 1915 as demeaning idea of black american life calling it an orgy of prurience and con job of year armond white pride and precious in new york press november 4 2009 page found december 30 2010 he further characterized source novel as a relic of 1990s identity politics and noted film casts light skinned actors as kind and dark skinned actors as terrors in two separate articles writers for new york times cited white s article as most powerful negative review of precious adding that in a recent interview he had remarked that film s popularity is a result of fact that black pathology sells courtland milloy of washington post said precious was a film of prurient interest that has about as much redeeming social value as a porn flick david edelstein of new york magazine commented that while film has elements that are powerful and shocking he felt movie was programmed and that film had its own study guide keith uhlich of time out new york felt that film did not live up to its long hype and felt that it was bewildering to discover film s praise at sundance film festival because uhlich characterized film as having shrug worthiness peter bradshaw wrote in guardian that film catalogues a horrendous unending nightmare of abuse and then abruptly turns into something resembling 1980s musical fame bradshaw commended film s acting and energy but said it was not quite transcendent masterpiece some had made it out to be sukhdev sandhu wrote in daily telegraph that he found film a dispiriting mix of cliche and melodrama although he acknowledged that precious does feature some superb acting noting daniels admiration of work of john waters and pedro almodovar and joking attitude he and actors sometimes took towards their material while making movie jim emerson argued that precious is best understood as a deliberately over top piece of camp in vein of waters s female trouble received dozens of nominations in award categories
