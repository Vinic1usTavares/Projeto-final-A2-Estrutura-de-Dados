his literary reputation with his novels collector 1963 and magus 1965 while writing french lieutenant s woman he was working on screenplay for film adaptation of magus 1968 moreover collector 1965 had already been adapted in a film which had gained fowles further popular attention fowles notes on an unfinished novel 143 144 fowles described his main inspiration for french lieutenant s woman to be a persistent image of a victorian woman who later developed into novel s titular character sarah woodruff in a 1969 essay entitled notes on an unfinished novel fowles reflects on his writing process he said he had an image during autumn of 1966 of a woman who stands at end of a deserted quay and stares out to sea fowles notes on an unfinished novel 136 he determined that she belonged to a victorian age and had mysterious and vaguely romantic qualities he made a note at time about function of novel in an appended comment dated october 27 1967 he writes that he finished first draft of novel at about 140 000 words fowles notes on an unfinished novel 150 throughout essay fowles describes multiple influences and issues important to novel s development including his debt to other authors such as thomas hardy in essay he describes surprise that female character sarah had taken primary role in novel fowles notes on an unfinished novel 139 149 later fowles described other influences shaping characters development noting that characters and story of french lieutenant s woman were loosely derived from claire de duras novel ourika 1823 which features a tragic affair between an african woman and french military man fowles later published a 1977 translation of ourika into english plot summary thumb cobb at lyme regis near where smithson and ernestina first encounter sarah set in mid nineteenth century narrator identifies novel s protagonist as sarah woodruff woman of title also known as tragedy and as french lieutenant s whore she lives in coastal town of lyme regis as a disgraced woman supposedly abandoned by a french ship s officer named who had returned to france and married she spends some of her limited free time on cobb a stone jetty where she stares out to sea one day charles smithson an orphaned gentleman and ernestina freeman his fiancee and a daughter of a wealthy tradesman see sarah walking along cliffside ernestina tells charles something of sarah s story and he becomes curious about her though continuing to court ernestina charles has several more encounters with sarah meeting her clandestinely three times during these meetings sarah tells charles of her history and asks for his emotional and social support during same period he learns of possible loss of place as heir to his elderly uncle who has become engaged to a woman young enough to bear a child meanwhile charles s servant sam falls in love with mary maid of ernestina s aunt in fact charles has fallen in love with sarah and advises her to leave lyme for exeter returning from a journey to warn ernestina s father about his uncertain inheritance charles stops in exeter as if to visit sarah from there narrator who intervenes throughout novel and later becomes a character in it offers three different ways in which novel could end first ending charles does not visit sarah but immediately returns to lyme to reaffirm his love for ernestina they marry though marriage never becomes particularly happy and charles enters trade under ernestina s father mr freeman narrator pointedly notes lack of knowledge about sarah s fate charles tells ernestina about an encounter which he implies is with french lieutenant s whore but sordid details and matter is ended narrator dismisses this ending as a daydream by charles before alternative events of subsequent meeting with ernestina are described critic michelle phillips buchberger describes this first ending as a semblance of verisimilitude in traditional happy ending found in actual victorian novels buchberger 149 before second and third endings narrator appears as a character sharing a railway compartment with charles he tosses a coin to determine order in which he will portray other two possible endings emphasising their equal plausibility they are as follows second ending charles and sarah have a rash sexual encounter in which charles realises that sarah was a virgin reflecting on his emotions during this charles ends his engagement to ernestina and proposes to sarah through a letter charles s servant sam fails to deliver letter and after charles breaks his engagement ernestina s father him his uncle marries and his wife bears an heir ensuring loss of expected inheritance to escape social suicide and depression caused by his broken engagement charles goes abroad to europe and america ignorant of charles proposal sarah flees to london without telling her lover during charles trips abroad his lawyer searches for sarah finding her two years later living in chelsea house of painter and poet dante gabriel rossetti where she enjoys an artistic creative life sarah shows charles child of their affair leaving him in hope that three may be reunited third ending narrator re appears outside house at 16 cheyne walk and turns back his pocket watch by fifteen minutes events are same as in second ending version until charles meets sarah when their reunion is sour new ending does not make clear parentage of child and sarah expresses no interest in reviving relationship charles leaves house intending to return to united states wondering whether sarah is a manipulative lying woman who exploited him characters narrator as in other works of metafiction narrator s voice frequently intervenes in story with a personality of its own though voice appears to be that of fowles magali cornier michael notes that chapter 13 which discusses role of author and narrator within fiction distinguishes between author s role in text and narrator s michael who is sarah 227 alice ferrebe describes narrator as both a lens for critiquing traditional gender roles and a perpetuation of perspectives on gendered identity perpetuated by male gaze ferrebe sarah woodruff main protagonist according to narrator formerly a governess she becomes disgraced after an illicit but unconsummated liaison with an injured french naval merchant feminist critic magali cornier michael argues that she is more a plot device not interpretable as a main character because her thoughts and motivations are only interpreted from perspective of outside male characters sarah offers a representation of myth or symbol within a male perspective on women michael who is sarah 225 235 charles smithson main male character though born into a family with close ties to nobility smithson does not possess a title but has a sizable income and considerable education early in novel he is described both as a casual naturalist and a darwinist though trying to become an enlightened and forward thinking individual narrator often emphasises through commentary on smithson s actions and situation that his identity is strongly rooted in traditional social system moreover conflicting identification with social forces such as science and religion lead smithson to an existential crisis 129 136 ernestina freeman smithson s fiancee and daughter to a london based owner of department stores unlike sarah ernestina s temperament is much less complex and much more simple minded sam farrow charles s hackney servant with aspirations to become a haberdasher throughout novel sam becomes narrator s model for working class peoples of victorian britain comparing sam s identity with charles s ignorance of that culture according to critic david landrum tension between sam and charles smithson importantly demonstrates marxist class struggle though this aspect of novel is often overlooked by criticism emphasizing charles s relationship to sarah landrum 103 104 dr grogan an irish doctor in town of lyme regis who both advises various upper class families in town and becomes an adviser to charles his education and interest in darwin and other education make him a good companion for charles mr freeman father of ernestina he earned his wealth as an owner of a drapery and clothes sales chain of stores he represents rising entrepreneurial class in england which stands in stark contrast to old money which smithson comes from mrs tranter a prominent member of lyme regis society who is friends with grogan and as her maternal aunt hosts ernestina during her stay mrs poulteney a wealthy widow and at beginning of novel employer of sarah woodruff hypocritical and hypersensitive her character fulfills archetype of high society villainess mary stereotypical lower class servant to mrs tranter and future wife to sam farrow montague charles smithson s family lawyer of a firm which has been around since eighteenth century 2 3 years older than charles he helps his client in search of sarah towards end of novel style and structure like many other postmodern novels fowles uses multiple different stylistic and structural techniques to highlight his thematic interests in french lieutenant s woman when discussing these stylistic concerns many literary critics comment on importance of narrator and narration intertextual references to other literary works and multiple endings narration throughout novel omniscient narrative voice alongside a series of footnotes reflect with an objective tone on a number of plot devices author s difficulty controlling characters conventions that are expected of a victorian novel and analyses of differences in 19th century customs and class narrator often returns to topics of interest to literature and scholarship from period like theories of charles darwin and charles lyell radical politics of karl marx and works of matthew arnold alfred lord tennyson and thomas hardy margarita imitation and parody of victorian novel in john fowle s french lieutenant s woman vilnius university master paper 2006 retrieved 25 november 2013 through a metafictional and metahistorical voice contemporary postmodern narrator questions role of author and historian in thinking about past fletcher hutcheon in her article discussing use of paratext or contextualizing text printed in book such as footnotes and epigraphs deborah bowen argues that novel s paratext forces reader like in other postmodern works to rethink importance of such peripheral material that in other contexts will get overlooked in light of preference for main text bowen 67 69 instead of nicely complementing main plot and adding meaning these elements can distract from effectiveness of novel and challenging authority of narrative voice bowen 70 intertextuality beyond narrator intervening and emphasizing particular interpretations of text book s metafictional approach often relies on intertextual references to provide further commentary in epigraphs for each chapter book gestures towards a number of important 19th century texts and ideas partially references to other texts act in ironic play parodied by how novel emulates other victorian conventions throughout text linda describes works of william george eliot charles dickens froude and thomas hardy as direct inspirations for this parody hutcheon 45 in his discussion of science and religion in novel john glendening notes that both character commentary on darwin s publications along with epigraphs mentioning those works as direct contributor s to novels emphasis on science superseding religion glendening 118 125 similarly by quoting marx with first epigraph along with multiple subsequent epigraphs novel directs thematic attention towards socio economics issues within novel deborah bowen describes literary critics struggling to find readings of epigraphs that explore themes of novel and argues that poor relationship between epigraphs and text disperses authority of narrative voice thus destroying his power to speak as a moralist for bowen epigraphs support satire of victorian fiction conventions in novel multiple endings often critics will comment on novel s multiple endings each offers a possible ending for charles s pursuit of sarah first ends with charles married to ernestina second with a successful reestablishment of a relationship with sarah and third with charles cast back into world without a partner michelle phillips buchberger discusses these endings as a demonstration of fowles s rejection of a narrow mimesis of reality rather fowles presents this multiplicity of endings to highlight role of author in plot choices buchberger 147 it is not enough to suggest that novel with its multiple endings is a mere experiment with narrative form there is something more in it as mandal puts it an impasse that resists any straight forward resolution to story after all form of a narrative is determined by its content it is sarah woodruff content of whose character produces multiple and contradictory possibilities for narrative mandal 2017 pp 278 294 themes though a bestseller novel has also received significant scrutiny by literary critics especially during 1960s and 70s a novel with great popularity and significant academic scrutiny is unusual in literary study canon and its academic defenders often focused on high literary works that didn t have large popular followings in her study of postmodernism linda hutcheon described french lieutenant s woman s binary of popular and academic interest as a paradox similar to postmodern thematic binaries produced within novel s content hutcheon 20 21 because of its prominence since publication novel has received a variety of different academic re examinations in light of numerous critical and thematic approaches some of most popular concerns for novel are its discussion of gender especially questioning is novel a feminist novel its engagement with metafictional and metahistorical concepts and its treatment of science and religion gender novel creates a number of binaries between men and women michelle phillips buchberger argues that french lieutenant s woman along with fowles two earlier novels collector 1963 and magus 1965 portrays a fundamental binary between male and female characters female characters act as an elite set of creators or educated visionary and predominantly female characters who provide facilitation for evolution in existential terms of male collectors whose traits are present in all of fowles s flawed male protagonists buchberger 136 though acknowledging such binaries in role of characters critic alice ferrebe does not treat these binaries as necessary thematic elements rather binaries demonstrate what she calls a gendered politics or a politics created by a gaze not dissimilar from male gaze noticed in cinema studies that constructs an artificial gender binary within fowle s early novels as opposed to a multiplicity of socially constructed genders ferrebe 207 210 for ferrebe this binary creates a tension especially with sarah who becomes a violently fetishised and objectified other differentiated from male characters like charles ferrebe 216 218 feminist novel a number of critics have treated novel as a feminist novel novel s narrator demonstrates and proclaims a feminist approach to women sarah is presented as a more liberated and independently willed woman as compared to other model female characters such as ernestina and her aunt in a 1985 interview by jan relf fowles declared himself a feminist buchberger 145 magali cornier michael criticises this reading of text saying that novel s overwhelming reliance on male perspectives on women and feminism prevents novel from meeting feminist objectives similarly michelle phillips buchberger argues that french lieutenant s woman along with fowles two earlier novels collector 1963 and magus 1965 proclaimed a pseudo feminism while advocating some feminist ideas but she says they are permeated by a fetishism of women that perpetuates idea of woman as other buchberger 133 alice ferrebe also notes that despite fowles attempts to critique masculine values his novels remain male fantasies demonstrative of compromises and contradictions created by gendered situation in which he was writing ferrebe 223 other literary critics such as william palmer peter conradi bruce woodcock and pamela cooper have also critiqued fowles claims to a feminist perspective and representation michelle phillips buchberger cites following in her discussion of debate william j palmer fiction of john fowles tradition art and loneliness of selfhood columbia university of missouri press 1974 p 75 peter conradi john fowles london methuen 1982 p 91 bruce woodcock male mythologies brighton harvester 1984 p 15 and a discussion of cooper s criticism in an unholy inquisition john fowles and dianne 1995 repr in john fowles wormholes essays and occasional writings ed by jan relf new york henry holt 1998 pp 365 84 fowles s presentation of sarah one of most enigmatic female characters in literary history is also informed fowles himself was interested in psychology of men and women enigma of femininity myth of masculinity and impossibility of man woman relationship are some of crucial themes through sarah s deliberate spreading of lies about herself and her relationship with charles fowles brilliantly brings about various aspects of femininity that has potential to authenticate threaten and expose vanity of male subjects mandal 2017 pp 278 298 metafiction historiography and metahistory in her important study of postmodernity and its poetics in literature linda describes this novel as definitive of a genre she calls historiographic metafiction she defines this postmodern genre as well known and popular novels which are both intensely self reflexive yet paradoxically also lay claim to historical events and personages hutcheon 5 typically postmodern this genre of fiction blends creation of imagined narratives with critique on various modes in which we create knowledge such as history and literature important to her discussion of genre s post modern style french lieutenant s woman s self reflexive narration bridges different discourses that usually remain separated such as academic history literary criticism philosophy and literature text s representations of past introduce anachronistic perspectives on time and characters for example in her queer studies based article historical romance gender and heterosexuality lisa fletcher argues that french lieutenant s woman by relying on a good love story as central means of representing past projects a contemporary hetero normative sexuality on history of victorian england fletcher 31 for fletcher fowles paradoxical treatment of sarah as both a victorian character and as a desirable modern woman through feminist gestures and sexual tension between charles and sarah confines historical set characters and their experience to stereotypical heterosexual romance fletcher 31 34 fletcher believes that overall text creates a stereotypical and limited perspective on past essentially passage of and relationship to history fletcher 41 science and religion thumb ammonite fossils on beach near lyme regis narrator often reflects on smithson s fascination with science and natural history while referring to fossils found near lyme regis emphasis on a conflicted relationship between science and religion frequently occurs in both historical studies of victorian history and neo victorian novels in his chapter on french lieutenant s woman in his book evolution and jesus john glendening argues that fowles novel is one of first neo victorian novels to handle dynamic created between science and religion in victorian identity glendening notes that more generally christian ideas and conventions become appropriated in service of a secularist and extensional version of truth glendening 113 glendening says that fowles uses commentary on darwinism to comment on characters and their experience and to forward a view of natural and human reality opposed to christian doctrine and within limits amenable to existentialist philosophy glendening 119 in general glendening sees ideas of science and religion as central to personal and social identities that develop within novel but creating symbolically conflictual binaries he suggests that fowles manoeuvres these conflictual forces to favour an existential self revelation exhibited through main character of smithson leading to a conclusion that freedom implicit in accepting alienation should be exercised in overcoming it glendening 133 contemporary reception novel received mixed critical attention at its initial publication critics focused both praise and critique on its style plot and approach to metafiction and metahistory following samples those responses for a more complete listing of reviews see french lieutenant s

review by christopher lehmann haupt warned readers to be certain there s only one log on fire if unhappily you lack fireplace by which this book should be read set an alarm clock lehmann haupt found book to begin as irresistibly novelistic that he has disguised it as a victorian romance yet metafictional construction by end positively explodes all assumptions of our victorian sensibilities time magazine s november 1969 review described novel as resourceful and penetrating talent at work on that archaic form in march 1970 magazine american libraries named novel as one of notable books of 1969 calling it a successful blending of two worlds as author writes in modern terminology of victorian era not all of reviews were positive for example roger sale in hudson review largely criticized novel saying at times it seems that commentary is not so bad and novel awful but at others fowles makes novel almost work and comments are embarrassingly vulgar ultimately reviewer concluded that novel was
