valentine s preceding single strawberry wine and reissued on compilation album ecstasy and wine 1989 which was released on lazy records without band s consent background following minor success on underground scene after release of new record by my bloody valentine 1986 and 1987 s sunny sundae smile original my bloody valentine vocalist david conway left band due to a gastric illness disillusionment with music and his ambitions to become a writer remaining members guitarist kevin shields drummer colm o ciosoig and bassist debbie googe considered splitting up and forming a new band under a different name however band placed advertisements for a vocalist in local music press in london which shields referred to later as pointless disastrous and due to advertisements attracting a number of morrissey inspired vocalists who he referred to as through mutual friends band recruited two vocalists joe byfield and bilinda butcher after performing one show in april 1987 with both on vocals my bloody valentine considered byfield unsuitable for band and he was subsequently fired butcher whose prior musical experience had been playing classical guitar as a child and singing and playing tambourine with some girlfriends for fun was chosen as my bloody valentine s new vocalist and began rehearsing with band in middle of 1987 thumb left ecstasy was band s second release to feature vocalist and guitarist bilinda butcher pictured in 2009 who was recruited in april 1987 lazy records on which band released sunny sundae smile requested a full length album from my bloody valentine during summer 1987 band refused label s request claiming their newly formed line up had only been together a couple of months and hadn t really had time to get settled however band compromised and agreed to record a mini album provided they could release a single beforehand preceding single strawberry wine was released on 9 november 1987 and peaked at number 13 on uk independent singles chart recording recording sessions for ecstasy took place a week after recording sessions for strawberry wine my bloody valentine spent a total of 10 days recording album according to kevin shields sessions had no direction and band didn t even know what they were doing and bashed out all these tunes quickly very demo like a number of songs were recorded that did not feature on final release as band considered them awful however sessions were first time band had actually played around properly in studio which resulted in extreme and quite nasty guitar sounds which my bloody valentine would later become associated with ecstasys recording was plagued by technical and financial errors which impacted eventual release of album mastering process was affected by album s engineer steve nunn who mislaid source material of final mix prior to its transfer to master recording shields subsequently brought an independent engineer in to studios to point out what was wrong but lazy records refused to invest further finances into album s recording process as a result much of what was originally sound of was lost and much of tone was dulled and album showed a group who appeared to have run out of money half way through recording composition all of ecstasys seven tracks were written and composed by kevin shields with colm o ciosoig credited as co writer of three tracks things i miss clair and please lose yourself in me regarding lyrical content of album in contrast to music shields said that songs may sound sweet but subject matter isn t necessarily very nice a lot of it is relationship based but it s always vague and never just boy meets girl it could easily be boy meets boy or girl meets girl then there s hate and whimsical thoughts you get from nowhere o ciosoig remarked that it s more weird perversions of feeling you get in a relationship and referred to lyrics as being marked by extremes because we re entertained by extreme things shields noted that lyrics were a progression from band s earlier releases as idea of composing a sweet pop song that sugar coated some lyrical horror and sending it hurtling up charts appealed to our sense of humour and considered songwriting process for ecstasy as fresh after having made pure noise earlier my bloody valentine experimented with a noise pop sound on album a venture which was influenced by jesus and mary chain and incorporated elements of twee pop similar to strawberry wine shields used a twelve string electric guitar during ecstasys recording sessions and was influenced by byrds during writing process which resulted in guitar tones being too jingly jangly writer colin larkin described ecstasys sound as bubblegum pop with buzzsaw guitars which was similar to their prior releases and further diverged from their earlier post punk and gothic rock sound jim derogatis noted that ecstasys overall sound ushered in a sunnier more optimistic vibe for band which was reminiscent of sound of 1960s american psychedelia in particular los angeles based band love clair one of first recordings to feature bilinda butcher features a sampled tape loop of audience screams from beatles live album beatles at hollywood bowl 1977 sample was processed through audio filters to emulate guitar feedback however music on ecstasy has been criticised as being directionless and floundered about within framework of songs which appeared to be only half formed ideas which was due to band s in studio experimentation with different aspects of their guitar sound in hindsight shields said that even when we d finished it we didn t like half songs we d done record never came out right and it made us realise that we were still too twee in response to band s unwanted reputation for jangly my bloody valentine later incorporated elements of american indie rock music and shields customised his guitars tremolo systems resulting in band pioneering an alternative rock subgenre known as shoegazing term shoegazing which was considered derogatory was coined by sounds journalists in early 1990s to describe certain bands motionless performing style where they stood on stage and stared at floor release

guitars words from back of beyond tying in to a large shifting whole and larger than sum of its parts in loveless a book from 33 1 3 series about my bloody valentine album of same name mike referred to ecstasy as a effete and poppy approach to rock and allmusic rated album two and a half out of five stars in a separate review of ecstasy and wine allmusic writer bradley torreano described ecstasy as point where band started moving toward cocteau twins territory using guitarist bilinda butcher s airy voice to define their image and when shields and butcher were exploring guitar landscapes that would later become their trademark on ecstasys supporting tour my bloody valentine conceived idea of holocaust an interlude of noise and excessive feedback during live performances which was later attributed to their song you made me realise and often exceeded 130 decibels band toured small student venues and according to kevin shields at one particular place there were these guy playing pool
