fizeau foucault apparatus is either of two types of instrument historically used to measure speed of light conflation of two instrument types arises in part because hippolyte fizeau and leon foucault had originally been friends and collaborators they worked together on such projects as using daguerreotype process to take images of sun between 1843 and 1845 and characterizing absorption bands in infrared spectrum of sunlight in 1847 in 1834 charles wheatstone developed a method of using a rapidly rotating mirror to study transient phenomena and applied this method to measure velocity of electricity in a wire and duration of an electric spark he communicated to francois arago idea that his method could be adapted to a study of speed of light arago expanded upon wheatstone s concept in an 1838 publication emphasizing possibility that a test of relative speed of light in air versus water could be used to distinguish between particle and wave theories of light in 1845 arago suggested to fizeau and foucault that they attempt to measure speed of light sometime in 1849 however it appears that two had a falling out and they parted ways pursuing separate means of performing this experiment in 1848 49 fizeau used not a rotating mirror but a toothed wheel apparatus to perform an absolute measurement of speed of light in air in 1850 fizeau and foucault both used rotating mirror devices to perform relative measures of speed of light in air versus water foucault used a scaled up version of rotating mirror apparatus to perform an absolute measurement of speed of light in 1862 subsequent experiments performed by marie alfred cornu in 1872 76 and by albert a michelson in 1877 1931 used improved versions of toothed wheel and rotating mirror experiments to make steadily more accurate estimates of speed of light fizeau s determination of speed of light thumb figure 1 schematic of fizeau apparatus light passes on one side of a tooth on way out and other side on way back assuming cog rotates one tooth during transit of light in 1848 49 hippolyte fizeau determined speed of light between an intense light source and a mirror about 8 km distant light source was interrupted by a rotating cogwheel with 720 notches that could be rotated at a variable speed of up to hundreds of times a second figure 1 fizeau adjusted rotation speed of cogwheel until light passing through one notch of cogwheel would be completely eclipsed by adjacent tooth spinning cogwheel at 3 5 and 7 times this basic rotation rate also resulted in eclipsing of reflected light by cogwheel teeth next in line given rotational speed of wheel and distance between wheel and mirror fizeau was able to calculate a value of km s for speed of light it was difficult for fizeau to visually estimate intensity minimum of light being blocked by adjacent teeth and his value for light s speed was about 5 too high fizeau s paper appeared in comptes rendus hebdomadaires de de l academie de sciences paris vol 29 july december 1849 pp 90 92 early to mid 1800s were a period of intense debate on particle versus wave nature of light although observation of arago spot in 1819 may seem to have settled matter definitively in favor of fresnel s wave theory of light various concerns continued to appear to be addressed more satisfactorily by newton s corpuscular theory arago had suggested in 1838 that a differential comparison of speed of light in air versus water would serve to prove or disprove wave nature of light in 1850 racing against foucault to establish this point fizeau engaged l f c breguet to build a rotary mirror apparatus in which he split a beam of light into two beams passing one through water while other traveled through air beaten by foucault by a mere seven weeks he confirmed that speed of light was greater as it traveled through air validating wave theory of light foucault s determination of speed of light thumb 500px center figure 2 in foucault s experiment lens l forms an image of slit s at spherical mirror m if mirror r is stationary reflected image of slit reforms at original position of slit s regardless of how r is tilted as shown in lower annotated figure however if r rotates rapidly time delay due to finite speed of light traveling from r to m and back to r results in reflected image of slit at s becoming displaced thumb figure 3 schematic of foucault apparatus left panel mirror r is stationary lens l not shown forms an image of slit s on spherical mirror m reflected image of slit reforms at original position of slit s regardless of how r is tilted right panel mirror r is rotating rapidly reflected light from mirror m bounces from mirror r that has advanced an angle th during transit of light telescope detects reflected image of slit at angle 2th relative to position of slit s in 1850 and in 1862 leon foucault made improved determinations of speed of light substituting a rotating mirror for fizeau s toothed wheel figure 2 apparatus involves light from slit s reflecting off a rotating mirror r forming an image of slit on distant stationary mirror m which is then reflected back to reform an image of original slit if mirror r is stationary then slit image will reform at s regardless of mirror s tilt situation is different however if r is in rapid rotation as rotating mirror r will have moved slightly in time it takes for light to bounce from r to m and back light will be deflected away from original source by a small angle if distance between mirrors is h time between first and second reflections on rotating mirror is 2h c c speed of light if mirror rotates at a known constant angular rate o it changes angle during light roundtrip by an amount th given by speed of light is calculated from observed angle th known angular speed o and measured distance h as as seen in figure 3 displaced image of source slit is at an angle 2th from source direction thumb 400px foucault s determination of relative speed of light in air vs water light from a passing through a slit not shown is reflected by mirror m rotating clockwise around c towards concave spherical mirrors m and m lens l forms images of slit on surfaces of two concave mirrors light path from m to m is entirely through air while light path from m to m is mostly through a water filled tube t lens l compensates

at position a if mirror m is rapidly rotating light reflected from m forms an image of slit at a while light reflected from m forms an image of slit at a guided by similar motivations as his former partner foucault in 1850 was more interested in settling particle versus wave debate than in determining an accurate absolute value for speed of light foucault measured differential speed of light through air versus water by inserting a tube filled with water between rotating mirror and distant mirror his experimental results announced shortly before fizeau announced his results on same topic were viewed as driving last nail in coffin of newton s theory of light when it showed that light travels more slowly through water than through air newton had explained refraction as a pull of medium upon light implying an increased speed of light in medium corpuscular theory of light went into abeyance completely overshadowed by wave theory this state of affairs lasted until 1905 when einstein presented heuristic arguments that under various circumstances such as when considering photoelectric effect light exhibits behaviors indicative of a particle nature in contrast to his 1850 measurement foucault s 1862 measurement was aimed at obtaining an accurate absolute value for speed of light since his concern was to deduce an improved value for astronomical unit at time foucault was working at paris observatory under urbain le verrier it was le verrier s belief based on extensive celestial mechanics calculations that consensus value for speed of light was perhaps 4 too high technical limitations prevented foucault from separating mirrors r and m by more than about 20 meters despite this limited path length foucault was able to measure displacement of slit image less than 1 mm with considerable accuracy in addition unlike case with fizeau s experiment which required gauging rotation rate of an adjustable speed toothed wheel he could spin mirror at a constant determined speed foucault s measurement confirmed le verrier s estimate his 1862 figure for speed of light km s was within 0 6 of modern value cornu s refinement of fizeau experiment thumb figure 4 chronograph record from cornu s speed of light determination showing wheel rotations timing signals based on observatory clock and observer markings at behest of paris observatory under le verrier marie alfred cornu repeated fizeau s 1848 toothed wheel measurement in a series of experiments in 1872 76 goal was to obtain a value for speed of light accurate to one part in a thousand cornu s equipment allowed him to monitor high orders of extinction up to 21st order instead of estimating intensity minimum of light being blocked by adjacent teeth a relatively inaccurate procedure cornu made pairs of observations on either side of intensity minima averaging values obtained with wheel spun clockwise and counterclockwise an electric circuit recorded wheel rotations on a chronograph chart which enabled precise rate comparisons against observatory clock and a telegraph key arrangement allowed cornu to mark on this same chart precise moments when he judged that an extinction had been entered or exited his final experiment was run over a path nearly three times as long as that used by fizeau and yielded a figure of km s that is within 0 2 of modern value michelson s refinement of foucault experiment thumb center 500px figure 5 michelson s 1879 repetition of foucault s speed of light determination incorporated several improvements enabling use of a much longer light path it was seen in figure 2 that foucault placed rotating mirror r as close as possible to lens l so as to maximize distance between r and slit s as r rotates an enlarged image of slit s sweeps across face of distant mirror m greater distance rm more quickly that image sweeps across mirror m and less light is reflected back foucault could not increase rm distance in his folded optical arrangement beyond about 20 meters without image of slit becoming too dim to accurately measure between 1877 and 1931 albert a michelson made multiple measurements of speed of light his 1877 79 measurements were performed under auspices of simon newcomb who was also working on measuring speed of light michelson s setup incorporated several refinements on foucault s original arrangement as seen in figure 5 michelson placed rotating mirror r near principal focus of lens l i e focal point given incident parallel rays of light if rotating mirror r were exactly at principal focus moving image of slit would remain upon distant plane mirror m equal in diameter to lens l as long as axis of pencil of light remained on lens this being true regardless of rm distance michelson was thus able to increase rm distance to nearly 2000 feet to achieve a reasonable value for rs distance michelson used an extremely long focal length lens 150 feet and compromised on design by placing r about 15 feet closer to l than principal focus this allowed an rs distance of between 28 5 to 33 3 feet he used carefully calibrated tuning forks to monitor rotation rate of air turbine powered mirror r and he would typically measure displacements of slit image on order of 115 mm his 1879 figure for speed of light 51 km s was within about 0 05 of modern value his 1926 repeat of experiment incorporated still further refinements such as use of polygonal prism shaped rotating mirrors enabling a brighter image having from eight through sixteen facets and a 22 mile baseline surveyed to fractional parts per million accuracy his figure of 299 796 4 km s was only about 4 km s higher than current accepted value michelson s final 1931 attempt to measure speed of light in vacuum was interrupted by his death although his experiment was completed posthumously by f g pease and f pearson various factors militated against a measurement of highest accuracy including an earthquake which disturbed baseline measurement
