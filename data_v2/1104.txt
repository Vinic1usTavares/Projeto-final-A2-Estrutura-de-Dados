enrico fermi 29 september 1901 28 november 1954 was an italian american physicist and creator of world s first nuclear reactor chicago pile 1 he has been called architect of nuclear age and architect of atomic bomb he was one of very few physicists to excel in both theoretical physics and experimental physics fermi held several patents related to use of nuclear power and was awarded 1938 nobel prize in physics for his work on induced radioactivity by neutron bombardment and for discovery of transuranium elements he made significant contributions to development of statistical mechanics quantum theory and nuclear and particle physics fermi s first major contribution involved field of statistical mechanics after wolfgang pauli formulated his exclusion principle in 1925 fermi followed with a paper in which he applied principle to an ideal gas employing a statistical formulation now known as fermi dirac statistics today particles that obey exclusion principle are called fermions pauli later postulated existence of an uncharged invisible particle emitted along with an electron during beta decay to satisfy law of conservation of energy fermi took up this idea developing a model that incorporated postulated particle which he named neutrino his theory later referred to as fermi s interaction and now called weak interaction described one of four fundamental interactions in nature through experiments inducing radioactivity with recently discovered neutron fermi discovered that slow neutrons were more easily captured by atomic nuclei than fast ones and he developed fermi age equation to describe this after bombarding thorium and uranium with slow neutrons he concluded that he had created new elements although he was awarded nobel prize for this discovery new elements were later revealed to be nuclear fission products fermi left italy in 1938 to escape new italian racial laws that affected his jewish wife laura capon he emigrated to united states where he worked on manhattan project during world war ii fermi led team that designed and built chicago pile 1 which went critical on 2 december 1942 demonstrating first human created self sustaining nuclear chain reaction he was on hand when x 10 graphite reactor at oak ridge tennessee went critical in 1943 and when b reactor at hanford site did so next year at los alamos he headed f division part of which worked on edward teller s thermonuclear super bomb he was present at trinity test on 16 july 1945 where he used his fermi method to estimate bomb s yield after war fermi served under j robert oppenheimer on general advisory committee which advised atomic energy commission on nuclear matters after detonation of first soviet fission bomb in august 1949 he strongly opposed development of a hydrogen bomb on both moral and technical grounds he was among scientists who testified on oppenheimer s behalf at 1954 hearing that resulted in denial of oppenheimer s security clearance fermi did important work in particle physics especially related to pions and muons and he speculated that cosmic rays arose when material was accelerated by magnetic fields in interstellar space many awards concepts and institutions are named after fermi including enrico fermi award enrico fermi institute fermi national accelerator laboratory fermi gamma ray space telescope enrico fermi nuclear generating station and synthetic element fermium making him one of 16 scientists who have elements named after them early life thumb right fermi was born in rome at via gaeta 19 thumb plaque at fermi s birthplace enrico fermi was born in rome italy on 29 september 1901 he was third child of alberto fermi a division head in ministry of railways and ida de gattis an elementary school teacher his sister maria was two years older than him his brother giulio a year older after two boys were sent to a rural community to be wet nursed enrico rejoined his family in rome when he was two and a half although he was baptised a roman catholic in accordance with his grandparents wishes his family was not particularly religious enrico was an agnostic throughout his adult life as a young boy he shared same interests as his brother giulio building electric motors and playing with electrical and mechanical toys giulio died during an operation on a throat abscess in 1915 and maria died in an airplane crash near milan in 1959 at a local market fermi found a physics book 900 page mathematicae written in latin by jesuit father a professor at collegio romano it presented mathematics classical mechanics astronomy optics and acoustics as they were understood at time of its 1840 publication with scientifically inclined friend enrico persico fermi pursued projects such as building gyroscopes and measuring acceleration of earth s gravity a colleague of fermi s father gave him books on physics and mathematics which he assimilated quickly scuola normale superiore in pisa right thumb upright enrico fermi as a student in pisa fermi graduated from high school in july 1918 and at amidei s urging applied to scuola normale superiore in pisa having lost one son his parents only reluctantly allowed him to live in school s lodgings for four years fermi took first place in difficult entrance exam which included an essay on theme of specific characteristics of sounds 17 year old fermi chose to use fourier analysis to derive and solve partial differential equation for a vibrating rod and after interviewing fermi examiner declared he would become an outstanding physicist at scuola normale superiore fermi played pranks with fellow student franco rasetti two became close friends and collaborators fermi was advised by luigi puccianti director of physics laboratory who said there was little he could teach fermi and often asked fermi to teach him something instead fermi s knowledge of quantum physics was such that puccianti asked him to organize seminars on topic during this time fermi learned tensor calculus a technique key to general relativity fermi initially chose mathematics as his major but soon switched to physics he remained largely self taught studying general relativity quantum mechanics and atomic physics in september 1920 fermi was admitted to physics department since there were only three students in department fermi rasetti and nello carrara puccianti let them freely use laboratory for whatever purposes they chose fermi decided that they should research x ray crystallography and three worked to produce a laue photograph an x ray photograph of a crystal during 1921 his third year at university fermi published his first scientific works in italian journal nuovo cimento first was entitled on dynamics of a rigid system of electrical charges in translational motion a sign of things to come was that mass was expressed as a tensor a mathematical construct commonly used to describe something moving and changing in three dimensional space in classical mechanics mass is a scalar quantity but in relativity it changes with velocity second paper was on electrostatics of a uniform gravitational field of electromagnetic charges and on weight of electromagnetic charges using general relativity fermi showed that a charge has a weight equal to u c2 where u was electrostatic energy of system and c is speed of light first paper seemed to point out a contradiction between electrodynamic theory and relativistic one concerning calculation of electromagnetic masses as former predicted a value of 4 3 u c2 fermi addressed this next year in a paper concerning a contradiction between electrodynamic and relativistic theory of electromagnetic mass in which he showed that apparent contradiction was a consequence of relativity this paper was sufficiently well regarded that it was translated into german and published in german scientific journal physikalische zeitschrift in 1922 that year fermi submitted his article on phenomena occurring near a world line to italian journal in this article he examined principle of equivalence and introduced so called fermi coordinates he proved that on a world line close to time line space behaves as if it were a euclidean space left thumb a light cone is a three dimensional surface of all possible light rays arriving at and departing from a point in spacetime here it is depicted with one spatial dimension suppressed time line is vertical axis fermi submitted his thesis a theorem on probability and some of its applications to scuola normale superiore in july 1922 and received his laurea at unusually young age of 20 thesis was on x ray diffraction images theoretical physics was not yet considered a discipline in italy and only thesis that would have been accepted was one on experimental physics for this reason italian physicists were slow in embracing new ideas like relativity coming from germany since fermi was quite at home in lab doing experimental work this did not pose insurmountable problems for him while writing appendix for italian edition of book fundamentals of einstein relativity by august kopff in 1923 fermi was first to point out that hidden inside famous einstein equation was an enormous amount of nuclear potential energy to be exploited it does not seem possible at least in near future he wrote to find a way to release these dreadful amounts of energy which is all to good because first effect of an explosion of such a dreadful amount of energy would be to smash into smithereens physicist who had misfortune to find a way to do it in 1924 fermi was initiated into masonic lodge adriano of grand orient of italy fermi spent a semester studying under max born at university of gottingen where he met werner heisenberg and pascual jordan fermi then studied in leiden with paul ehrenfest from september to december 1924 on a fellowship from rockefeller foundation obtained through intercession of mathematician vito volterra here fermi met hendrik lorentz and albert einstein and became good friends with samuel goudsmit and jan tinbergen from january 1925 to late 1926 fermi taught mathematical physics and theoretical mechanics at university of florence where he teamed up with rasetti to conduct a series of experiments on effects of magnetic fields on mercury vapour he also participated in seminars at sapienza university of rome giving lectures on quantum mechanics and solid state physics while giving lectures on new quantum mechanics based on remarkable accuracy of predictions of schrodinger equation italian physicist would often say it has no business to fit so well after wolfgang pauli announced his exclusion principle in 1925 fermi responded with a paper on of perfect gas in which he applied exclusion principle to an ideal gas paper was especially notable for fermi s statistical formulation which describes distribution of particles in systems of many identical particles that obey exclusion principle this was independently developed soon after by british physicist paul dirac who also showed how it was related to bose einstein statistics accordingly it is now known as fermi dirac statistics after dirac particles that obey exclusion principle are today called fermions while those that do not are called bosons professor in rome thumb upright 1 5 right fermi and his students via panisperna boys in courtyard of rome university s physics institute in via panisperna about 1934 from left to right oscar d agostino emilio segre edoardo amaldi franco rasetti and fermi professorships in italy were granted by competition for a vacant chair applicants being rated on their publications by a committee of professors fermi applied for a chair of mathematical physics at university of cagliari on sardinia but was narrowly passed over in favour of giovanni giorgi in 1926 at age of 24 he applied for a professorship at sapienza university of rome this was a new chair one of first three in theoretical physics in italy that had been created by minister of education at urging of professor orso mario corbino who was university s professor of experimental physics director of institute of physics and a member of benito mussolini s cabinet corbino who also chaired selection committee hoped that new chair would raise standard and reputation of physics in italy committee chose fermi ahead of enrico persico and aldo pontremoli and corbino helped fermi recruit his team which was soon joined by notable students such as edoardo amaldi bruno pontecorvo ettore and emilio segre and by franco rasetti whom fermi had appointed as his assistant they were soon nicknamed via panisperna boys after street where institute of physics was located fermi married laura capon a science student at university on 19 july 1928 they had two children nella born in january 1931 and giulio born in february 1936 on 18 march 1929 fermi was appointed a member of royal academy of italy by mussolini and on 27 april he joined fascist party he later opposed fascism when 1938 racial laws were promulgated by mussolini in order to bring italian fascism ideologically closer to german national socialism these laws threatened laura who was jewish and put many of fermi s research assistants out of work during their time in rome fermi and his group made important contributions to many practical and theoretical aspects of physics in 1928 he published his introduction to atomic physics which provided italian university students with an up to date and accessible text fermi also conducted public lectures and wrote popular articles for scientists and teachers in order to spread knowledge of new physics as widely as possible part of his teaching method was to gather his colleagues and graduate students together at end of day and go over a problem often from his own research a sign of success was that foreign students now began to come to italy most notable of these was german physicist hans bethe who came to rome as a rockefeller foundation fellow and collaborated with fermi on a 1932 paper on interaction between two electrons at this time physicists were puzzled by beta decay in which an electron was emitted from atomic nucleus to satisfy law of conservation of energy pauli postulated existence of an invisible particle with no charge and little or no mass that was also emitted at same time fermi took up this idea which he developed in a tentative paper in 1933 and then a longer paper next year that incorporated postulated particle which fermi called a neutrino his theory later referred to as fermi s interaction and still later as theory of weak interaction described one of four fundamental forces of nature neutrino was detected after his death and his interaction theory showed why it was so difficult to detect when he submitted his paper to british journal nature that journal s editor turned it down because it contained speculations which were too remote from physical reality to be of interest to readers thus fermi saw theory published in italian and german before it was published in english in introduction to 1968 english translation physicist fred l wilson noted that in january 1934 irene joliot curie and frederic joliot announced that they had bombarded elements with alpha particles and induced radioactivity in them by march fermi s assistant gian carlo wick had provided a theoretical explanation using fermi s theory of beta decay fermi decided to switch to experimental physics using neutron which james chadwick had discovered in 1932 in march 1934 fermi wanted to see if he could induce radioactivity with rasetti s polonium beryllium neutron source neutrons had no electric charge and so would not be deflected by positively charged nucleus this meant that they needed much less energy to penetrate nucleus than charged particles and so would not require a particle accelerator which via panisperna boys did not have thumb upright 1 3 enrico fermi between franco rasetti left and emilio segre in academic dress fermi had idea to resort to replacing polonium beryllium neutron source with a radon beryllium one which he created by filling a glass bulb with beryllium powder evacuating air and then adding 50 mci of radon gas supplied by giulio cesare this created a much stronger neutron source effectiveness of which declined with 3 8 day half life of radon he knew that this source would also emit gamma rays but on basis of his theory he believed that this would not affect results of experiment he started by bombarding platinum an element with a high atomic number that was readily available without success he turned to aluminium which emitted an alpha particle and produced sodium which then decayed into magnesium by beta particle emission he tried lead without success and then fluorine in form of calcium fluoride which emitted an alpha particle and produced nitrogen decaying into oxygen by beta particle emission in all he induced radioactivity in 22 different elements fermi rapidly reported discovery of neutron induced radioactivity in italian journal la ricerca on 25 march 1934 natural radioactivity of thorium and uranium made it hard to determine what was happening when these elements were bombarded with neutrons but after correctly eliminating presence of elements lighter than uranium but heavier than lead fermi concluded that they had created new elements which he called hesperium and ausonium chemist ida noddack suggesting that some of experiments could have produced lighter elements than lead rather than new heavier elements her suggestion was not taken seriously at time because her team had not carried out any experiments with uranium or build theoretical basis for this possibility at that time fission was thought to be improbable if not impossible on theoretical grounds while physicists expected elements with higher atomic numbers to form from neutron bombardment of lighter elements nobody expected neutrons to have enough energy to split a heavier atom into two light element fragments in manner that noddack suggested thumb left beta decay a neutron decays into a proton and an electron is emitted in order for total energy in system to remain same pauli and fermi postulated that a neutrino was also emitted via panisperna boys also noticed some unexplained effects experiment seemed to work better on a wooden table than a marble table top fermi remembered that joliot curie and chadwick had noted that paraffin wax was effective at slowing neutrons so he decided to try that when neutrons were passed through paraffin wax they induced a hundred times as much radioactivity in silver compared with when it was bombarded without paraffin fermi guessed that this was due to hydrogen atoms in paraffin those in wood similarly explained difference between wooden and marble table tops this was confirmed by repeating effect with water he concluded that collisions with hydrogen atoms slowed neutrons lower atomic number of nucleus it collides with more energy a neutron loses per collision and therefore fewer collisions that are required to slow a neutron down by a given amount fermi realised that this induced more radioactivity because slow neutrons were more easily captured than fast ones he developed a diffusion equation to describe this which became known as fermi age equation in 1938 fermi received nobel prize in physics at age of 37 for his demonstrations of existence of new radioactive elements produced by neutron irradiation and for his related discovery of nuclear reactions brought about by slow neutrons after fermi received prize in stockholm he did not return home to italy but rather continued to new york city with his family in december 1938 where they applied for permanent residency decision to move to america and become u s citizens was due primarily to racial laws in italy manhattan project fermi arrived in new york city on 2 january 1939 he was immediately offered positions at five universities and accepted one at columbia university where he had already given summer lectures in 1936 he received news that in december 1938 german chemists otto hahn and fritz strassmann had detected element barium after bombarding uranium with neutrons which lise meitner and her nephew otto frisch correctly interpreted as result of nuclear fission frisch confirmed this experimentally on 13 january 1939 news of meitner and frisch s interpretation of hahn and strassmann s discovery crossed atlantic with niels bohr who was to lecture at princeton university isidor isaac rabi and willis lamb two columbia university physicists working at princeton found out about it and carried it back to columbia rabi said he told enrico fermi but fermi later gave credit to lamb noddack was proven right after all fermi had dismissed possibility of fission on basis of his calculations but he had not taken into account binding energy that would appear when a nuclide with an odd number of neutrons absorbed an extra neutron for fermi news came as a profound embarrassment as transuranic elements that he had partly been awarded nobel prize for discovering had not been transuranic elements at all but fission products he added a footnote to this effect to his nobel prize acceptance speech thumb upright 1 2 left diagram of chicago pile 1 first nuclear reactor to achieve a self sustaining chain reaction designed by fermi it consisted of uranium and uranium oxide in a cubic lattice embedded in graphite scientists at columbia decided that they should try to detect energy released in nuclear fission of uranium when bombarded by neutrons on 25 january 1939 in basement of pupin hall at columbia an experimental team including fermi conducted first nuclear fission experiment in united states other members of team were herbert l anderson eugene t booth john r dunning g norris and francis g slack next day fifth washington conference on theoretical physics began in washington d c under joint auspices of george washington university and carnegie institution of washington there news on nuclear fission was spread even further fostering many more experimental demonstrations french scientists hans von halban lew kowarski and frederic joliot curie had demonstrated that uranium bombarded by neutrons emitted more neutrons than it absorbed suggesting possibility of a chain reaction fermi and anderson did so too a few weeks later leo szilard obtained of uranium oxide from canadian radium producer eldorado gold mines limited allowing fermi and anderson to conduct experiments with fission on a much larger scale fermi and szilard collaborated on a design of a device to achieve a self sustaining nuclear reaction a nuclear reactor owing to rate of absorption of neutrons by hydrogen in water it was unlikely that a self sustaining reaction could be achieved with natural uranium and water as a neutron moderator fermi suggested based on his work with neutrons that reaction could be achieved with uranium oxide blocks and graphite as a moderator instead of water this would reduce neutron capture rate and in theory make a self sustaining chain reaction possible szilard came up with a workable design a pile of uranium oxide blocks interspersed with graphite bricks szilard anderson and fermi published a paper on neutron production in uranium but their work habits and personalities were different and fermi had trouble working with szilard fermi was among first to warn military leaders about potential impact of nuclear energy giving a lecture on subject at navy department on 18 march 1939 response fell short of what he had hoped for although navy agreed to provide 1 500 towards further research at columbia later that year szilard eugene wigner and edward teller sent famous letter signed by einstein to u s president roosevelt warning that nazi germany was likely to build an atomic bomb in response roosevelt formed advisory committee on uranium to investigate matter thumb upright 0 70 right fermi s id photo from los alamos advisory committee on uranium provided money for fermi to buy graphite and he built a pile of graphite bricks on seventh floor of pupin hall laboratory by august 1941 he had six tons of uranium oxide and thirty tons of graphite which he used to build a still larger pile in schermerhorn hall at columbia s 1 section of office of scientific research and development as advisory committee on uranium was now known met on 18 december 1941 with u s now engaged in world war ii making its work urgent most of effort sponsored by committee had been directed at producing enriched uranium but committee member arthur compton determined that a feasible alternative was plutonium which could be mass produced in nuclear reactors by end of 1944 he decided to concentrate plutonium work at university of chicago fermi reluctantly moved and his team became part of new metallurgical laboratory there possible results of a self sustaining nuclear reaction were unknown so it seemed inadvisable to build first nuclear reactor on university of chicago campus in middle of city compton found a location in argonne woods forest preserve about from chicago stone webster was contracted to develop site but work was halted by an industrial dispute fermi then persuaded compton that he could build reactor in squash court under stands of university of chicago s stagg field construction of pile began on 6 november 1942 and chicago pile 1 went critical on 2 december shape of pile was intended to be roughly spherical but as work proceeded fermi calculated that criticality could be achieved without finishing entire pile as planned this experiment was a landmark in quest for energy and it was typical of fermi s approach every step was carefully planned every calculation meticulously done when first self sustained nuclear chain reaction was achieved compton made a coded phone call to james b conant chairman of national defense research committee thumb upright 1 1 left ernest o lawrence fermi and isidor isaac rabi alt three men talking one on left

photo id passes to continue research where it would not pose a public health hazard reactor was disassembled and moved to argonne woods site there fermi directed experiments on nuclear reactions revelling in opportunities provided by reactor s abundant production of free neutrons laboratory soon branched out from physics and engineering into using reactor for biological and medical research initially argonne was run by fermi as part of university of chicago but it became a separate entity with fermi as its director in may 1944 when air cooled x 10 graphite reactor at oak ridge went critical on 4 november 1943 fermi was on hand just in case something went wrong technicians woke him early so that he could see it happen getting x 10 operational was another milestone in plutonium project it provided data on reactor design training for dupont staff in reactor operation and produced first small quantities of reactor bred plutonium fermi became an american citizen in july 1944 earliest date law allowed in september 1944 fermi inserted first uranium fuel slug into b reactor at hanford site production reactor designed to breed plutonium in large quantities like x 10 it had been designed by fermi s team at metallurgical laboratory and built by dupont but it was much larger and was water cooled over next few days 838 tubes were loaded and reactor went critical shortly after midnight on 27 september operators began to withdraw control rods to initiate production at first all appeared to be well but around 03 00 power level started to drop and by 06 30 reactor had shut down completely army and dupont turned to fermi s team for answers cooling water was investigated to see if there was a leak or contamination next day reactor suddenly started up again only to shut down once more a few hours later problem was traced to neutron poisoning from xenon 135 a fission product with a half life of 9 2 hours dupont had deviated from metallurgical laboratory s original design in which reactor had 1 500 tubes arranged in a circle and had added 504 tubes to fill in corners scientists had originally considered this over engineering a waste of time and money but fermi realized that if all 2 004 tubes were loaded reactor could reach required power level and efficiently produce plutonium thumb right upright 0 85 an analog computer invented by fermi to study neutron transport in mid 1944 robert oppenheimer persuaded fermi to join his project y at los alamos new mexico arriving in september fermi was appointed an associate director of laboratory with broad responsibility for nuclear and theoretical physics and was placed in charge of f division which was named after him f division had four branches f 1 super and general theory under teller which investigated super thermonuclear bomb f 2 water boiler under l d p king which looked after water boiler aqueous homogeneous research reactor f 3 super experimentation under egon bretscher and f 4 fission studies under anderson fermi observed trinity test on 16 july 1945 and conducted an experiment to estimate bomb s yield by dropping strips of paper into blast wave he paced off distance they were blown by explosion and calculated yield as ten kilotons of tnt actual yield was about 18 6 kilotons along with oppenheimer compton and ernest lawrence fermi was part of scientific panel that advised interim committee on target selection panel agreed with committee that atomic bombs would be used without warning against an industrial target like others at los alamos laboratory fermi found out about atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki from public address system in technical area fermi did not believe that atomic bombs would deter nations from starting wars nor did he think that time was ripe for world government he therefore did not join association of los alamos scientists post war work fermi became charles h swift distinguished professor of physics at university of chicago on 1 july 1945 although he did not depart los alamos laboratory with his family until 31 december 1945 he was elected a member of u s national academy of sciences in 1945 enrico fermi on org metallurgical laboratory became argonne national laboratory on 1 july 1946 first of national laboratories established by manhattan project short distance between chicago and argonne allowed fermi to work at both places at argonne he continued experimental physics investigating neutron scattering with leona marshall he also discussed theoretical physics with maria mayer helping her develop insights into spin orbit coupling that would lead to her receiving nobel prize manhattan project was replaced by atomic energy commission aec on 1 january 1947 fermi served on aec general advisory committee an influential scientific committee chaired by robert oppenheimer he also liked to spend a few weeks of each year at los alamos national laboratory where he collaborated with nicholas metropolis and with john von neumann on rayleigh taylor instability science of what occurs at border between two fluids of different densities thumb left laura and enrico fermi at institute for nuclear studies los alamos 1954 after detonation of first soviet fission bomb in august 1949 fermi along with isidor rabi wrote a strongly worded report for committee opposing development of a hydrogen bomb on moral and technical grounds nonetheless fermi continued to participate in work on hydrogen bomb at los alamos as a consultant along with stanislaw ulam he calculated that not only would amount of tritium needed for teller s model of a thermonuclear weapon be prohibitive but a fusion reaction could still not be assured to propagate even with this large quantity of tritium fermi was among scientists who testified on oppenheimer s behalf at oppenheimer security hearing in 1954 that resulted in denial of oppenheimer s security clearance in his later years fermi continued teaching at university of chicago his phd students in post war period included owen chamberlain geoffrey chew jerome friedman marvin goldberger tsung dao lee arthur rosenfeld and sam jack steinberger was a graduate student and mildred dresselhaus was highly influenced by fermi during year she overlapped with him as a phd student fermi conducted important research in particle physics especially related to pions and muons he made first predictions of pion nucleon resonance relying on statistical methods since he reasoned that exact answers were not required when theory was wrong anyway in a paper co authored with chen ning yang he speculated that pions might actually be composite particles idea was elaborated by shoichi sakata it has since been supplanted by quark model in which pion is made up of quarks which completed fermi s model and vindicated his approach fermi wrote a paper on origin of cosmic radiation in which he proposed that cosmic rays arose through material being accelerated by magnetic fields in interstellar space which led to a difference of opinion with teller fermi examined issues surrounding magnetic fields in arms of a spiral galaxy he mused about what is now referred to as fermi paradox contradiction between presumed probability of existence of extraterrestrial life and fact that contact has not been made right thumb upright fermi s grave in chicago toward end of his life fermi questioned his faith in society at large to make wise choices about nuclear technology he said death fermi underwent what was called an exploratory operation in billings memorial hospital in october 1954 after which he returned home fifty days later he died of stomach cancer at age 53 in his home in chicago his memorial service was held at university of chicago chapel where colleagues samuel k allison emilio segre and herbert l anderson spoke to mourn loss of one of world s most brilliant and productive physicists his body was interred at oak woods cemetery impact and legacy legacy fermi received numerous awards in recognition of his achievements including matteucci medal in 1926 nobel prize for physics in 1938 hughes medal in 1942 franklin medal in 1947 and rumford prize in 1953 he was awarded medal for merit in 1946 for his contribution to manhattan project fermi was elected a foreign member of royal society frs in 1950 basilica of santa croce florence known as temple of italian glories for its many graves of artists scientists and prominent figures in italian history has a plaque commemorating fermi in 1999 time named fermi on its list of top 100 persons of twentieth century fermi was widely regarded as an unusual case of a 20th century physicist who excelled both theoretically and experimentally historian of physics c p snow wrote that if fermi had been born a few years earlier one could well imagine him discovering rutherford s atomic nucleus and then developing bohr s theory of hydrogen atom if this sounds like hyperbole anything about fermi is likely to sound like hyperbole fermi was known as an inspiring teacher and was noted for his attention to detail simplicity and careful preparation of his lectures later his lecture notes were transcribed into books his papers and notebooks are today in university of chicago victor weisskopf noted how fermi always managed to find simplest and most direct approach with minimum of complication and sophistication fermi s ability and success stemmed as much from his appraisal of art of possible as from his innate skill and intelligence he disliked complicated theories and while he had great mathematical ability he would never use it when job could be done much more simply he was famous for getting quick and accurate answers to problems that would stump other people later on his method of getting approximate and quick answers through back of envelope calculations became informally known as fermi method and is widely taught fermi was fond of pointing out that alessandro volta working in his laboratory could have had no idea where study of electricity would lead fermi is generally remembered for his work on nuclear power and nuclear weapons especially creation of first nuclear reactor and development of first atomic and hydrogen bombs his scientific work has stood test of time this includes his theory of beta decay his work with non linear systems his discovery of effects of slow neutrons his study of pion nucleon collisions and his fermi dirac statistics his speculation that a pion was not a fundamental particle pointed way towards study of quarks and leptons things named in fermi s honor right thumb sign at enrico fermi street in rome thumb memorial plaque in basilica santa croce florence italy many things bear fermi s name these include fermilab particle accelerator and physics lab in batavia illinois which was renamed in his honor in 1974 and fermi gamma ray space telescope which was named after him in 2008 in
