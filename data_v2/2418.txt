devotions upon emergent occasions or in full devotions upon emergent occasions and severall steps in my sicknes is a prose work by english metaphysical poet and cleric in church of england john donne published in 1624 it covers death rebirth and elizabethan concept of sickness as a visit from god reflecting internal sinfulness devotions were written in december 1623 as donne recovered from a serious but unknown illness believed to be relapsing fever or typhus having come close to death he described illness he had suffered from and his thoughts throughout his recovery with near super human speed and concentration registered by 9 january and published soon after devotions is one of only seven works attributed to donne which were printed during his lifetime devotions is divided into 23 parts each consisting of 3 sub sections called meditation expostulation and a prayer 23 sections are chronologically ordered each covering his thoughts and reflections on a single day of illness famously 17th devotion meditation xvii includes phrases no man is an iland often modernised as no man is an island and for whom bell tolls work as a whole is considered similar to 17th century devotional writing generally and particularly to donne s holy sonnets some academics have also identified political strands running through work possibly from a polemic arminian denunciation of puritanism to advise young prince charles background thumb john donne aged about 42 donne was born in 1572 to a wealthy ironmonger and a warden of worshipful company of ironmongers and his wife elizabeth after his father s death when he was four donne was trained as a gentleman scholar his family used money his father had made to hire tutors who taught him grammar rhetoric mathematics history and foreign languages elizabeth remarried to a wealthy doctor ensuring family remained comfortable as a result despite being son of an ironmonger and portraying himself in his early poetry as an outsider donne refused to accept that he was anything other than a gentleman after study at hart hall oxford donne s private education saw him study at lincoln s inn one of inns of court where he occupied his time with history poetry theology and humane learning and languages it was at lincoln s inn that donne first began writing poetry looking upon it as a life sign or minor irritation rather than something that defined him in november 1623 donne fell seriously ill london was scene of a spotted or relapsing fever which hit its victims unexpectedly and left them conscious but physically helpless what disease donne suffered from is not known writers have suggested typhus as a likely culprit but donne s writings on subject reference multiple diseases clara lander writing in sel studies in english literature 1500 1900 suggests that typhus may have exacerbated enteritis donne had suffered from since childhood donne was of opinion as were many others of age that illness reflected a state of internal sinfulness and constituted a visit from god despite being ordered to rest he insisted that a pen and paper be given to him and he wrote down his impressions of disease after his recovery in december these became devotions upon emergent occasions one of his few published prose works and also one of only seven printed works of which he acknowledged authorship written with near super human speed and concentration work was registered with stationers company by 9 january 1624 it was published that year and again in 1634 and 1638 full albeit rarely used title is devotions upon emergent occasions and severall steps in my sicknes contents structurally devotions consists of 23 chronologically ordered sections representing length in days of donne s illness each one contains a meditation in which he describes a stage of his illness an expostulation containing his reaction to that stage and finally a prayer in which he makes peace with disease in five editions published during 17th century book opens with a latin preface titled stationes sive in ad quas meditationes also 23 sections long each line of preface is followed by what purports to be an english translation of latin joan webber argues that these lines constitute a poem in hexameter david disputes this arguing that stationes has none of donne s customary wit drama and imagination instead it represents stations of cross or mary arshagouni writing in modern philology argues that stationes indeed constitute a poem or at least something more than a mere table of contents latin lines play off english translations and contain nuanced meaning not found in english that better represents sections to which they refer following stationes 23 meditations begin each section taken in an isolated way follows same pattern donne states some element of his illness or treatment and then expands upon his statement to develop a theme that culminates with him becoming closer to god perhaps most famous of meditations is meditation xvii which begins with statement this statement or title is then expanded on donne first concludes that he may not be aware that bell is tolling saying hee for whom this bell tolls may be so ill as that he not it tolls for him and perchance i may thinke my selfe so much better than i am as that they who are about mee and see my state may have caused it to toll for mee and i know not that this is then expanded with realisation that even if bell is tolling for others it is a matter of concern for donne as donne then argues that if someone dies anyone has right to use their death as long as they do so valuably considering it a treasure he writes that death of an individual signified by tolling of bell is thus a treasure buried at bottom of a mine only of value if it is given to someone who makes good use of it in this he refers to work of augustine of hippo specifically on christian doctrine in which augustine describes knowledge of pagans as gold and silver something that can be involved in christian purposes if appropriated properly donne twisting this idea is arguing that death of any individual is something others can learn from should they understand it properly style and meaning stylistically devotions is an example of 17th century devotional writing and has been compared by roger rollin professor of literature at clemson university to holy sonnets and considered in effect a sequel in context of 17th century devotional writing rollin uses devotions to demonstrate that in his view such writings were more public than private serving as vehicles for diagnosis of spiritual malaise and as sources of remedies lander argued that full title signifies growth of spirit through physical ordeal and in doing so draws on devotional works of joseph hall thomas f van laan writing in studies in philology draws parallels between donne s style and ignatian exercises a set of structured mental exercises designed to bring an individual closer to understanding god a number of literary theorists have approached devotions as politically themed richard strier in particular identifies devotions as an arminian polemic arguing that it was highly atypical of donne to actually publish works rather than merely let them circulate amongst friends both before and after ordination donne actively resisted publication normally only publishing works that had been result of a commission such as anniversaries or pseudo martyr devotions however were literally rushed into print with volume being handed to printers a month after he had recovered from his disease strier argues that donne s rationale for publishing devotions matches his rationale for publishing a sermon encaenia same year to assert importance of places and of dayes and of all outward meanes because he felt some sense of urgency about what he had to say this is coupled with devotion xvi in which donne explicitly comes out against puritanism and is simultaneously purposely militant deliberately frustrating other extreme from puritanism where arminianism and polemical anti puritanism of volume becomes explicit dave gray and jeanne shami writing in modern language quarterly argue that it was not just a work of political rhetoric but a work of political advice aimed at prince charles to whom it was dedicated political situation at time was complex as king james was ill and charles attempting to gain control of government gray and shami highlight noted line no man is an island while most interpret it spiritually they argue that it was a reminder to prince and his advisors that even private actions have public consequences veiled nature of political references was deliberate it allowed work to be acceptable to censors but accessible to charles and those close to him in event that they rejected underlying message it would also be accessible to other prominent and influential political figures lander argues that structure of work is itself symbolic as well as division of poem into 23 parts each signifying and describing one day of donne s illness each part is itself split in three representing trinity use of three elements meditation expostulation and prayer also matches three services found in book of common prayer a common influence on devotional writers of donne s era critical response devotions have received a mixed reaction from critics evelyn simpson described it as a curious little book and wrote that a s a manual of devotion devotions compares unfavourably with devotions of bishop andrewes or holy living of jeremy taylor it is too introspective too metaphysical too much overloaded with learning of different kinds helen c white described it as output of an anxious and restless mind arshagouni on other hand describes devotions as donne s most mature perhaps most complex work a remarkable sustained prose poem that not only expresses conflicting and powerful internal emotions but also consciously provides its readers with a touching model of experiences of god s elect in confronting inexorable course of human sinfulness that characterizes life on earth helen wilcox writes that mixture of elaborate rhetoric painstaking argument and frank details of his melancholic distemper creates a particularly powerful impact and draws particular attention to meditation xvii noting that despite apparent self interest of devotions that piece highlights donne s recognition of ultimate interconnectedness of humanity meditation xvii was also focus of robert who writing in american notes and queries noted it as most forceful statement of donne s theme in what was ultimately a powerful psychological analysis in wider popular culture several phrases from devotions particularly meditation xvii have become commonly quoted including no man is an iland often modernised as no man is an island and for whom bell tolls thomas festa writing in notes and queries identifies similarities between thomas browne s christian morals
