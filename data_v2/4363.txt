in geometry an isosceles triangle is a triangle that has two sides of equal length sometimes it is specified as having exactly two sides of equal length and sometimes as having at least two sides of equal length latter version thus including equilateral triangle as a special case examples of isosceles triangles include isosceles right triangle golden triangle and faces of bipyramids and certain catalan solids mathematical study of isosceles triangles dates back to ancient egyptian mathematics and babylonian mathematics isosceles triangles have been used as decoration from even earlier times and appear frequently in architecture and design for instance in pediments and gables of buildings two equal sides are called legs and third side is called base of triangle other dimensions of triangle such as its height area and perimeter can be calculated by simple formulas from lengths of legs and base every isosceles triangle has an axis of symmetry along perpendicular bisector of its base two angles opposite legs are equal and are always acute so classification of triangle as acute right or obtuse depends only on angle between its two legs terminology classification and examples euclid defined an isosceles triangle as a triangle with exactly two equal sides but modern treatments prefer to define isosceles triangles as having at least two equal sides difference between these two definitions is that modern version makes equilateral triangles with three equal sides a special case of isosceles triangles a triangle that is not isosceles having three unequal sides is called scalene isosceles is a compound word made from greek roots isos equal and skelos leg same word is used for instance for isosceles trapezoids trapezoids with two equal sides and for isosceles sets sets of points every three of which form an isosceles triangle in an isosceles triangle that has exactly two equal sides equal sides are called legs and third side is called base angle included by legs is called vertex angle and angles that have base as one of their sides are called base angles vertex opposite base is called apex in equilateral triangle case since all sides are equal any side can be called base whether an isosceles triangle is acute right or obtuse depends only on angle at its apex in euclidean geometry base angles can not be obtuse greater than 90deg or right equal to 90deg because their measures would sum to at least 180deg total of all angles in any euclidean triangle since a triangle is obtuse or right if and only if one of its angles is obtuse or right respectively an isosceles triangle is obtuse right or acute if and only if its apex angle is respectively obtuse right or acute in edwin abbott s book flatland this classification of shapes was used as a satire of social hierarchy isosceles triangles represented working class with acute isosceles triangles higher in hierarchy than right or obtuse isosceles triangles as well as isosceles right triangle several other specific shapes of isosceles triangles have been studied these include calabi triangle a triangle with three congruent inscribed squares golden triangle and golden gnomon two isosceles triangles whose sides and base are in golden ratio 80 80 20 triangle appearing in langley s adventitious angles puzzle and 30 30 120 triangle of triakis triangular tiling five catalan solids triakis tetrahedron triakis octahedron tetrakis hexahedron dodecahedron and triakis icosahedron each have isosceles triangle faces as do infinitely many pyramids and bipyramids formulas height for any isosceles triangle following six line segments coincide altitude a line segment from apex perpendicular to base angle bisector from apex to base median from apex to midpoint of base perpendicular bisector of base within triangle segment within triangle of unique axis of symmetry of triangle and segment within triangle of euler line of triangle their common length is height of triangle if triangle has equal sides of length and base of length general triangle formulas for lengths of these segments all simplify to this formula can also be derived from pythagorean theorem using fact that altitude bisects base and partitions isosceles triangle into two congruent right triangles euler line of any triangle goes through triangle s intersection of its three altitudes its centroid intersection of its three medians and its circumcenter intersection of perpendicular bisectors of its three sides which is also center of circumcircle that passes through three vertices in an isosceles triangle with exactly two equal sides these three points are distinct and by symmetry all lie on symmetry axis of triangle from which it follows that euler line coincides with axis of symmetry incenter of triangle also lies on euler line something that is not true for other triangles if any two of an angle bisector median or altitude coincide in a given triangle that triangle must be isosceles area area of an isosceles triangle can be derived from formula for its height and from general formula for area of a triangle as half product of base and height same area formula can also be derived from heron s formula for area of a triangle from its three sides however applying heron s formula directly can be numerically unstable for isosceles triangles with very sharp angles because of near cancellation between and side length in those triangles if apex angle and leg lengths of an isosceles triangle are known then area of that triangle is this is a special case of general formula for area of a triangle as half product of two sides times sine of included angle perimeter perimeter of an isosceles triangle with equal sides and base is just as in any triangle area and perimeter are related by isoperimetric inequality this is a strict inequality for isosceles triangles with sides unequal to base and becomes an equality for equilateral triangle area perimeter and base can also be related to each other by equation if base and perimeter are fixed then this formula determines area of resulting isosceles triangle which is maximum possible among all triangles with same base and perimeter on other hand if area and perimeter are fixed this formula can be used to recover base length but not uniquely there are in general two distinct isosceles triangles with given area and perimeter when isoperimetric inequality becomes an equality there is only one such triangle which is equilateral angle bisector length if two equal sides have length and other side has length then internal angle bisector from one of two equal angled vertices satisfies as well as and conversely if latter condition holds an isosceles triangle parametrized by and exists steiner lehmus theorem states that every triangle with two angle bisectors of equal lengths is isosceles it was formulated in 1840 by c l lehmus its other namesake jakob steiner was one of first to provide a solution although originally formulated only for internal angle bisectors it works for many but not all cases when instead two external angle bisectors are equal 30 30 120 isosceles triangle makes a boundary case for this variation of theorem as it has four equal angle bisectors two internal two external radii thumb isosceles triangle showing its circumcenter blue centroid red incenter green and symmetry axis purple and circumradius formulas for an isosceles triangle may be derived from their formulas for arbitrary triangles radius of inscribed circle of an isosceles triangle with side length base and height is center of circle lies on symmetry axis of triangle this distance above base an isosceles triangle has largest possible inscribed circle among triangles with same base and apex angle as well as also having largest area and perimeter among same class of triangles radius of circumscribed circle is center of circle lies on symmetry axis of triangle this distance below apex inscribed square for any isosceles triangle there is a unique square with one side collinear with base of triangle and opposite two corners on its sides calabi triangle is a special isosceles triangle with property that other two inscribed squares with sides collinear with sides of triangle are of same size as base square a much older theorem preserved in works of hero of alexandria states that for an isosceles triangle with base and height side length of inscribed square on base of triangle is isosceles subdivision of other shapes thumb partition of a cyclic pentagon into isosceles triangles by radii of its circumcircle for any integer any triangle can be partitioned into isosceles triangles see also in a right triangle median from hypotenuse that is line segment from midpoint of hypotenuse to right angled vertex divides right triangle into two isosceles triangles this is because midpoint of hypotenuse is center of circumcircle of right triangle and each of two triangles created by partition has two equal radii as two of its sides similarly an acute triangle can be partitioned into three isosceles triangles by segments from its circumcenter but this method does not work for obtuse triangles because circumcenter lies outside triangle generalizing partition of an acute triangle any cyclic polygon that contains center of its circumscribed circle can be partitioned into isosceles triangles by radii of this circle through its vertices fact that all radii of a circle have equal length implies that all of these triangles are isosceles this partition can be used to derive a formula for area of polygon as a function of its side lengths even for cyclic polygons that do not contain their this formula generalizes heron s formula for triangles and brahmagupta s formula for cyclic quadrilaterals either diagonal of a rhombus divides it into two congruent isosceles triangles similarly one of two diagonals of a kite divides it into two isosceles triangles which are not congruent except when kite is a rhombus applications in architecture and design isosceles triangles commonly appear in architecture as shapes of gables and pediments in ancient greek architecture and its later imitations obtuse isosceles triangle was used in gothic architecture this was replaced by acute isosceles triangle in architecture of middle ages another isosceles triangle shape became popular egyptian isosceles triangle this is an isosceles triangle that is acute but less so than equilateral triangle its height is proportional to 5 8 of its base egyptian isosceles triangle was brought back into use in modern architecture by dutch architect hendrik petrus thumb detailed view of a modified warren truss with verticals warren truss structures such as bridges are commonly arranged in isosceles triangles although sometimes vertical beams are also included for additional strength surfaces tessellated by obtuse isosceles triangles can be used to form deployable structures that have two stable states an unfolded state in which surface expands to a cylindrical column and a folded state in which it folds into a more compact prism shape that can be more easily transported in graphic design and decorative arts isosceles triangles have been a frequent design element in cultures around world from at least early neolithic to modern times they are a common design element in flags and heraldry appearing prominently with a vertical base for instance in flag of guyana or with a horizontal base in flag of saint lucia where they form a stylized image of a mountain island they also have been used in designs with religious or mystic significance for instance in sri yantra of hindu practice in other areas of mathematics if a cubic equation with real coefficients has three roots that are not all real numbers then when these roots are plotted in complex plane as an diagram they form vertices of an isosceles triangle whose axis of symmetry coincides with horizontal real axis this is because complex roots are complex conjugates and hence are symmetric about real axis in celestial mechanics three body problem has been studied in special case that three bodies form an isosceles triangle because assuming that bodies are arranged in this way reduces number of degrees of freedom of system without reducing it to solved lagrangian point case when bodies form an equilateral triangle first instances of three body problem shown to have unbounded oscillations were in isosceles three body problem history and fallacies long before isosceles triangles were studied by ancient greek mathematicians practitioners of ancient egyptian mathematics and babylonian mathematics knew how to calculate their area problems of this type are included in moscow mathematical papyrus and rhind mathematical papyrus although many of early egyptologists believed that egyptians used an inexact formula for area half product of base and side vasily vasilievich struve championed view that they used correct formula half product of base and height this question rests on translation of one of words in rhind papyrus and with this word translated as height or more precisely as ratio of height to base formula is correct theorem that base angles of an isosceles triangle are equal appears as proposition i 5 in euclid this result has been called pons bridge of asses or isosceles triangle theorem rival explanations for this name include theory that it is because diagram used by euclid in his demonstration of result resembles a bridge or because this is first difficult result in euclid and acts to separate those who can understand euclid s geometry from those who cannot a well known fallacy is false proof of statement that all triangles are isosceles robin wilson credits this argument to lewis carroll who published it in 1899 but w w rouse ball published it in 1892 and later wrote that carroll obtained argument from him fallacy is rooted in euclid s lack of recognition of concept of betweenness and resulting
