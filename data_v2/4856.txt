large estate this inheritance was challenged by his cousin who argued that re registration was invalid under this interpretation forbes would legally be considered a woman and thus unable to inherit

betty obituary in daily telegraph dated 1 october 1991 reprinted in daily telegraph book of obituaries ed hugh massingberd 1995 early life issue of ewan s gender would later prove contentious birth registration recorded a female child but forbes later commented that this was a ghastly mistake ewan was brought up as a girl alongside margaret but found childhood to be dominated by a growing gender insecurity they spent a large amount of time playing with their cousins patrick and david forbes p 31 and in many contemporary photographs forbes can be seen dressed in trousers and a male jacket unconventional dress for a young woman of that era various photographs are in forbes 1984 none are dated but they seem to be from c 1925 or later in his book aul days written many years later forbes recalled a hatred of being made to dress up for social engagements and of going to great lengths to avoid them lord sempill insisted on a strict scottish upbringing for his children which meant that they were taught to speak and write fluently in doric as well as various european languages forbes p 6 forbes refused to go away to a girls school which meant being educated at home at fifteen he pressed to be allowed to go overseas to attend a pre university course and eventually settled on a co educational institution in dresden forbes p 19 after coming out as a debutante in london in late

don that he had formed together with isabella mitchell by this time forbes s heart was set on studying medicine however his father refused to fund his studies arguing that since there was more than enough work to be done managing estate there was no need for him to study further ewan resolved to fund his own studies aiming to put aside ps1 000 to cover costs forbes p 50 in 1933 he studied under psychologist leonhard seif in munich living with british novelist phyllis whilst there he witnessed german elections which brought nazi party into power and heard adolf hitler speak on death of lord

junior casualty officer at aberdeen royal infirmary forbes p 79 after a swift progression to senior casualty officer he began to work as a general practitioner in alford aberdeenshire in 1945 forbes of craigievar hon sir ewan in who was who a c black 1920 2007 online edn oxford university press dec 2007 accessed 9 nov 2008 in addition to normal work of a rural doctor in 1946 forbes was called upon to act as a medical officer for a large number of german prisoners of war who were held in area due to his command of language forbes p 88 alford area was one of largest medical practices in great britain and in winter months forbes often had to travel through ten foot snowdrifts in a converted universal carrier these conditions were not entirely unfamiliar a trip to see an uncle in st moritz at age of thirteen had led to him taking up skiing and figure skating and winning a number of bob sled races he did not live in alford but remained at brux appointing a medical assistant to live in town estate left in hands of a small resident staff quickly ran into financial troubles to raise a large amount of money quickly forbes sold practice in alford and returned to farm in 1952 running it directly as a going concern from then on forbes p 68 note however that who s who gives his retirement from medical work as 1955 on moving to alford forbes had begun publicly to present as a man in 1952 he formally became male by simple process of requesting a warrant for birth re registration from sheriff of aberdeen registering himself as male and changing his name to ewan forbes sempill he announced this with a notice in aberdeen press and journal of 12 september 1952 dr e forbes sempill henceforth wishes to be known as dr ewan forbes sempill his plans had been known in advance to many of his patients who were reported as universally supportive forbes was equally candid with press describing situation to one reporter as a ghastly mistake i was carelessly registered as a girl in first place but of course that was forty years ago doctors in those days were mistaken too i have been sacrificed to prudery and horror which our parents had about sex a month later on 10 october he married isabella mitchell his housekeeper for past five years and formerly co founder of his dance troupe marriage took place at kirk in kildrummy which he had recently joined forbes p 65 inheritance and lawsuit re registration passed without much public comment and issue of his gender would remain a private one until 1965 that december his elder brother died leaving daughters but no sons and thus posing a problem of inheritance barony could be inherited by heirs male or female and so passed directly to sempill s eldest daughter ann but baronetcy along with bulk of land would have to pass to first male heir family had assumed that ewan would inherit as younger brother following death of lord sempill in december 1965 times cited debrett s in reporting that heir to baronetcy was hon ewan forbes sempill formerly registered as elizabeth however this was challenged by his cousin john forbes sempill john was only son of rear admiral arthur forbes sempill younger brother of forbes s father he was thus next male heir as neither of lord sempill s sisters had male children who argued that 1952 re registration was invalid this would mean that forbes was still legally considered a woman unable to inherit title and so it would pass to john forbes sempill at time gender re registration was permitted in a limited set of cases leading case decided in 1965 had held that re registration of this form was only permitted when sex of a child was indeterminate at birth and it was later discovered that an error had been made challenge was taken to court of session where case was heard in great secrecy no papers were publicly filed and judge sat in a solicitor s office rather than in open court to hear case however records of case have recently been made available via national archives of scotland barnes p 166 papers are reported as being held under reference 1991 they show that a total of twelve medical experts were called to give evidence and their testimony was taken by court to indicate that forbes was a physical hermaphrodite which would accord with legal requirement of indeterminate at birth however medical evidence was not conclusive professor martin roth observed in evidence that he felt forbes condition was closer to that of a transsexual and professor john strong described medical tests involved as not wholly conclusive barnes p 170 judge ruled in favour of forbes though it has been suggested that judge desired to ensure estate and title was inherited by right candidate and was flexible with his judgement to obtain this result ruling was appealed to lord advocate who referred matter to home secretary james callaghan callaghan finally ruled in december 1968 that forbes was rightful holder of title confirming court s decision level of secrecy of case which was criticised by some contemporary observers meant that it was not properly recorded or published and exact facts of argument were not known for some time as a result whilst it sharply differs from later rulings such as corbett v corbett 1970 it was not able to be considered as precedent in later judgments on legal recognition of gender variance later life on taking up baronetcy forbes dropped sempill from his surname this had been adopted by family in 1880s when they inherited barony and there was no reason to persist once titles were separated with inheritance case settled he left public eye and returned to life of a rural landowner he placed craigievar castle in hands of national trust for scotland and continued to live in his house at brux forbes was an elder of local kirk at kildrummy and was appointed a justice of peace for aberdeenshire in 1969 he published a book of reminiscences of his early years in 1984 aul days forbes died leaving no children
