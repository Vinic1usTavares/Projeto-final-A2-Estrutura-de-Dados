ultimately winning and triumphing he commented that show is about making you feel good in end it s about happy endings and optimism and power of your personal journey and making you feel that weird thing about me is great thing about me i ve done other shows with gay characters and i will say that in many of those cases gay characters didn t have a happy ending and i thought you know what enough colfer has commented that his biggest challenge was in ensuring scene felt honest and not comical or used as a punchline he explained i think it s probably first time a character s sexuality has been respected and almost dignified in a way and i think that s really important and there needs to be more of that on tv reception thumb upright colfer s performance in kurt s coming out scene was well

overstuffed with story lines he felt that key characters did not receive enough screentime and that there was so much exposition going on that there didn t seem to be much room for laughs tim stack for entertainment weekly wrote that although dancing in episode was fun preggers was lacking in big singing moments apart from rachel s performance of taking chances he deemed quinn s pregnancy a good dramatic twist but hoped that it would not be a long lasting storyline eric goldman of ign rated episode 8 8 out of 10 he called single ladies performance a memorable tv moment and wrote that quinn s pregnancy was a very soap opera plotline however commented luckily glee is kind of show to handle it with humor james poniewozik for time deemed kurt s coming out beautifully handled commenting fact that dad mike o malley who has turned out to be a pretty good character actor ends up not being boor we think he s going to be is one of first signs that glee is growing up as a series that having established a world of primary color stereotypes it s now willing to subvert those expectations raymund flandez of wall street journal criticized rachel s actions in episode and felt that rachel has become insufferable disagreements with mr schue about her own development as a bona fide triple threat have branded her as an overbearing prima donna to rest of glee comedic pairing of sue and sandy attracted some praise with stack deeming them best villains ever goldman said that tobolowsky is terrific in this role as sandy manages to make everything he says sound amazingly disturbing hale criticized lynch as sue however writing that she gave a one note performance suggesting that she had been miscast in role references external links preggers at fox com preggers at tv com category 2009
