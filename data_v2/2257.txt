okapi okapia johnstoni also known as forest giraffe congolese giraffe or zebra giraffe is an artiodactyl mammal native to northeast of democratic republic of congo in central africa although okapi has striped markings reminiscent of zebras it is most closely related to giraffe okapi and giraffe are only living members of family giraffidae okapi stands about tall at shoulder and has a typical body length around its weight ranges from it has a long neck and large flexible ears its coat is a chocolate to reddish brown much in contrast with white horizontal stripes and rings on legs and white ankles male okapis have short hair covered horn like protuberances on their heads called ossicones less than in length females possess hair whorls and ossicones are absent okapis are primarily diurnal but may be active for a few hours in darkness they are essentially solitary coming together only to breed okapis are herbivores feeding on tree leaves and buds grasses ferns fruits and fungi rut in males and estrus in females does not depend on season in captivity estrous cycles recur every 15 days gestational period is around 440 to 450 days long following which usually a single calf is born juveniles are kept in hiding and nursing takes place infrequently juveniles start taking solid food from three months and weaning takes place at six months okapis inhabit canopy forests at altitudes of they are endemic to tropical forests of democratic republic of congo where they occur across central northern and eastern regions international union for conservation of nature and natural resources classifies okapi as endangered major threats include habitat loss due to logging and human settlement extensive hunting for bushmeat and skin and illegal mining have also led to a decline in populations okapi conservation project was established in 1987 to protect okapi populations etymology and taxonomy thumb left strips cut from striped part of skin of an okapi sent home by sir harry johnston were first evidence of okapi s existence to reach europe although okapi was unknown to western world until 20th century it may have been depicted since early fifth century bce on facade of apadana at persepolis a gift from ethiopian procession to achaemenid kingdom oriental institute of university of chicago photographic archives photo detail oriental institute identifies subject as an okapi with a question mark for years europeans in africa had heard of an animal that they came to call african unicorn animal was brought to prominent european attention by speculation on its existence found in press reports covering henry morton stanley s journeys in 1887 in his travelogue of exploring congo stanley mentioned a kind of donkey that natives called atti which scholars later identified as okapi explorers may have seen fleeting view of striped backside as animal fled through bushes leading to speculation that okapi was some sort of rainforest zebra when british special commissioner in uganda sir harry johnston discovered some pygmy inhabitants of congo being abducted by a showman for exhibition he rescued them and promised to return them to their homes pygmies fed johnston s curiosity about animal mentioned in stanley s book johnston was puzzled by okapi tracks natives showed him while he had expected to be on trail of some sort of forest dwelling horse tracks were of a cloven hoofed beast thumbnail upright illustration from an original painting by sir harry johnston based on preserved skins 1901 though johnston did not see an okapi himself he did manage to obtain pieces of striped skin and eventually a skull from this skull okapi was correctly classified as a relative of giraffe in 1901 species was formally recognized as okapia johnstoni okapia johnstoni was first described as equus johnstoni by english zoologist philip lutley sclater in 1901 generic name okapia derives from lese karo name while specific name johnstoni is in recognition of sir harry johnston who first acquired an okapi specimen for science from ituri forest while repatriating a group of pygmies to congo free state nowak ronald m 1999 walker s mammals of world 6th ed p 1085 remains of a carcass were later sent to london by johnston and became a media event in 1901 in 1901 sclater presented a painting of okapi before zoological society of london that depicted its physical features with some clarity much confusion arose regarding taxonomical status of this newly discovered animal sir harry johnston himself called it a or a relative of other extinct giraffids based on description of okapi by pygmies who referred to it as a horse sclater named species equus johnstoni subsequently lankester declared that okapi represented an unknown genus of giraffidae which he placed in its own genus okapia and assigned name okapia johnstoni to species in 1902 swiss zoologist charles immanuel forsyth major suggested inclusion of o johnstoni in extinct giraffid subfamily however species was placed in its own subfamily by swedish palaeontologist birger bohlin in 1926 mainly due to lack of a cingulum a major feature of in 1986 okapia was finally established as a sister genus of giraffa on basis of cladistic analysis two genera together with palaeotragus constitute tribe evolution thumb upright despite vast difference in neck length okapi left and giraffe right both have seven cervical vertebrae as do all mammals except for manatees and sloths earliest members of giraffidae first appeared in early miocene in africa having diverged from superficially deer like giraffids spread into europe and asia by middle miocene in a first radiation another radiation began in pliocene but was terminated by a decline in diversity in pleistocene several important primitive giraffids existed more or less contemporaneously in miocene 23 10 million years ago including canthumeryx palaeotragus and samotherium according to palaeontologist and author kathleen hunt samotherium split into okapia 18 million years ago and giraffa 12 million years ago however j d skinner argued that canthumeryx gave rise to okapi and giraffe through latter three genera and that okapi is extant form of palaeotragus okapi is sometimes referred to as a living fossil as it has existed as a species over a long geological time period and morphologically resembles more primitive forms e g samotherium in 2016 a genetic study found that common ancestor of giraffe and okapi lived about 11 5 million years ago characteristics upright left thumbnail male okapi displaying its striking white stripes and short hair covered ossicones okapi is a medium sized giraffid standing tall at shoulder its average body length is about and its weight ranges from it has a long neck and large and flexible ears coat is a chocolate to reddish brown much in contrast with white horizontal stripes and rings on legs and white ankles striking stripes make it resemble a zebra these features serve as an effective camouflage amidst dense vegetation face throat and chest are greyish white interdigital glands are present on all four feet and are slightly larger on front feet male okapis have short hair covered horns called ossicones less than in length okapi exhibits sexual dimorphism with females taller on average slightly redder and lacking prominent ossicones instead possessing hair whorls okapi shows several adaptations to its tropical habitat large number of rod cells in retina facilitate night vision and an efficient olfactory system is present large auditory bullae allow a strong sense of hearing dental formula of okapi is teeth are low crowned and finely cusped and efficiently cut tender foliage large caecum and colon help in microbial digestion and a quick rate of food passage allows for lower cell wall digestion than in other ruminants thumb upright head of a male okapi okapi can be easily distinguished from its nearest extant relative giraffe it is much smaller and shares more external similarities with deer and bovids than with giraffe while both sexes possess horns in giraffe only males bear horns in okapi okapi has large palatine sinuses unique among giraffids morphological similarities shared between giraffe and okapi include a similar gait both use a pacing gait stepping simultaneously with front and hind leg on same side of body unlike other ungulates that walk by moving alternate legs on either side of body and a long black tongue longer in okapi useful in plucking buds and leaves as well as for grooming ecology and behaviour okapis are primarily diurnal but may be active for a few hours in darkness they are essentially solitary coming together only to breed they have overlapping home ranges and typically occur at densities around 0 6 animals per square kilometre male home ranges average while female home ranges average males migrate continuously while females are sedentary males often mark territories and bushes with their urine while females use common defecation sites grooming is a common practice focused at earlobes and neck okapis often rub their necks against trees leaving a brown exudate male is protective of his territory but allows females to pass through domain to forage males visit female home ranges at breeding time although generally tranquil okapi can kick and butt with its head to show aggression as vocal cords are poorly developed vocal communication is mainly restricted to three sounds contact calls used by both sexes moan by females during courtship and bleat by infants under stress individuals may engage in flehmen response a visual expression in which animal curls back its upper lips displays teeth and inhales through mouth for a few seconds leopard is main natural predator of okapi diet thumbnail left long tongue of okapi okapis are herbivores feeding on tree leaves and buds grasses ferns fruits and fungi they are unique in ituri forest as they are only known mammal that feeds solely on understory vegetation where they use their 18 inch tongues to selectively browse for suitable plants tongue is also used to groom their ears and eyes they prefer to feed in gaps okapi has been known to feed on over 100 species of plants some of which are known to be poisonous to humans and other animals fecal analysis shows that none of those 100 species dominates diet of okapi staple foods comprise shrubs and lianas main constituents of diet are woody species monocotyledonous plants are not eaten regularly in ituri forest okapi feeds mainly upon plant families acanthaceae ebenaceae euphorbiaceae rubiaceae and reproduction thumbnail a female okapi stands next to her calf at antwerp zoo female okapis become sexually mature at about one and a half years old while males reach maturity after two years rut in males and estrous in females does not depend on season in captivity estrous cycles recur every 15 days male and female begin courtship by circling smelling and licking each other male shows his interest by extending his neck tossing his head and protruding one leg forward this is followed by mounting and copulation gestational period is around 440 to 450 days long following which usually a single calf is born weighing udder of pregnant female starts swelling 2 months before parturition and vulval discharges may occur parturition takes 3 4 hours and female stands throughout this period though she may rest during brief intervals mother consumes afterbirth and extensively grooms infant her milk is very rich in proteins and low in fat as in other ruminants infant can stand within 30 minutes of birth although generally similar to adults newborn calves have false eyelashes a long dorsal mane and long white hairs in stripes these features gradually disappear and give way to general appearance within a year juveniles are kept in hiding and nursing takes place infrequently calves are known not to defecate for first month or two of life which is hypothesized to help avoid predator detection in their most vulnerable phase of life growth rate of calves is appreciably high in first few months of birth after which it gradually declines juveniles start taking solid food from 3 months and weaning takes place at 6 months horn development in males takes 1 year after birth okapi s typical lifespan is 20 30 years distribution and habitat okapi is endemic to democratic republic of congo where it occurs north and east of congo river it ranges from maiko national park northward to ituri rainforest then through river basins of rubi lake tele and ebola to west and river further north smaller populations exist west and south of congo river it is also common in and areas it is extinct in uganda okapi inhabits canopy forests at altitudes of it occasionally uses seasonally inundated areas but does not occur in gallery forests swamp forests and habitats disturbed by human settlements in wet season it visits rocky that offer forage uncommon elsewhere results of research conducted in late 1980s in a mixed forest indicated that okapi population density averaged 0 53 animals per square kilometre in 2008 it was recorded in virunga national park status threats and conservation thumb left okapi at disney s animal kingdom iucn classifies okapi as endangered it is fully protected under congolese law okapi wildlife reserve and maiko national park support significant populations of okapi though a steady decline in numbers has occurred due to several threats other areas of occurrence are rubi tele hunting reserve and reserve major threats include habitat loss due to logging and human settlement extensive hunting for bushmeat and skin and illegal mining have also led to population declines a threat that has emerged quite recently is presence of illegal armed groups around protected areas inhibiting conservation and monitoring actions a small population occurs north of virunga national park but is bereft of protection due to presence of armed groups in vicinity in june 2012 a gang of poachers attacked headquarters of okapi wildlife reserve killing six guards and other staff as well as all 14 okapis at their breeding center okapi conservation project established in 1987 works towards conservation of okapi as well as growth of indigenous people in november 2011 white oak conservation center and jacksonville zoo and gardens hosted an international meeting of okapi species survival plan and okapi european endangered species programme at jacksonville which was attended by representatives from zoos from us europe and japan aim was to discuss management of captive okapis and arrange support for okapi conservation many zoos in north america and europe currently have okapis in captivity okapis

most successful breeding programs with 13 calves having been born since 1991 san diego zoo has exhibited okapis since 1956 and had their first birth of an okapi in 1962 since then over 60 births have occurred between zoo and san diego zoo safari park with most recent being mosi a male calf born in early august 2017 at san diego zoo brookfield zoo in chicago has also greatly contributed to captive
