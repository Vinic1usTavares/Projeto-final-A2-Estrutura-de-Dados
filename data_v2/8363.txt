was a russian composer of romantic period whose works are among most popular music in classical repertoire he was first russian composer whose music made a lasting impression internationally bolstered by his appearances as a guest conductor in europe and united states he was honored in 1884 by emperor alexander iii and awarded a lifetime pension although musically precocious tchaikovsky was educated for a career as a civil servant there was scant opportunity for a musical career in russia at that time and no system of public music education when an opportunity for such an education arose he entered nascent saint petersburg conservatory from which he graduated in 1865 formal western oriented teaching he received there set him apart from composers of contemporary nationalist movement embodied by russian composers of five with whom his professional relationship was mixed tchaikovsky s training set him on a path to reconcile what he had learned with native musical practices to which he had been exposed from childhood from this reconciliation he forged a personal but unmistakably russian style a task that did not prove easy principles that governed melody harmony and other fundamentals of russian music ran completely counter to those that governed western european music this seemed to defeat potential for using russian music in large scale western composition or for forming a composite style and it caused personal that dented tchaikovsky s self confidence russian culture exhibited a split personality with its native and adopted elements having drifted apart increasingly since time of peter great this resulted in uncertainty among intelligentsia about country s national identity an ambiguity mirrored in tchaikovsky s career despite his many popular successes tchaikovsky s life was punctuated by personal crises and depression contributory factors included his early separation from his mother for boarding school followed by his mother s early death death of his close friend and colleague nikolai rubinstein and collapse of one enduring relationship of his adult life which was his 13 year association with wealthy widow nadezhda von meck who was his patron even though they never actually met each other his homosexuality which he kept private has traditionally also been considered a major factor though some musicologists now downplay its importance tchaikovsky s sudden death at age of 53 is generally ascribed to cholera there is an ongoing debate as to whether cholera was indeed cause of death and whether his death was accidental or self inflicted while his music has remained popular among audiences critical opinions were initially mixed some russians did not feel it was sufficiently representative of native musical values and expressed suspicion that europeans accepted music for its western elements in an apparent reinforcement of latter claim some europeans lauded tchaikovsky for offering music more substantive than base exoticism and said he transcended stereotypes of russian classical music others dismissed tchaikovsky s music as lacking in elevated thought according to longtime new york times music critic harold c

that did not exist in russian music brown final 424 second way melody worked against tchaikovsky was a challenge that he shared with majority of romantic age composers they did not write in regular symmetrical melodic shapes that worked well with sonata form such as those favored by classical composers such as haydn mozart or beethoven but were complete and independent in themselves cooper 26 this completeness hindered their use as structural elements in combination with one another this challenge was why romantics were never natural cooper 24 all a composer like tchaikovsky could do with them was to essentially repeat them even when he modified them to generate tension maintain interest and satisfy listeners warrack symphonies 8 9 harmony harmony could be a potential trap for tchaikovsky according to brown since russian creativity tended to focus on inertia and self enclosed tableaux while western harmony worked against this to propel music onward and on a larger scale shape it brown final 422 432 34 modulation shifting from one key to another was a driving principle in both harmony and sonata form primary western large scale musical structure since middle of 18th century modulation maintained harmonic interest over an extended time scale provided a clear contrast between musical themes and showed how those themes were related to each other roberts new grove 1980 12 454 one point in tchaikovsky s favor was a flair for harmony that astonished rudolph kundinger tchaikovsky s music tutor during his time at school of jurisprudence as quoted in eyes 18 added to what he learned at saint petersburg conservatory studies this talent allowed tchaikovsky to employ a varied range of harmony in his music from western harmonic and textural practices of his first two string quartets to use of whole tone scale in center of finale of second symphony a practice more typically used by five rhythm rhythmically tchaikovsky sometimes experimented with unusual meters more often he used a firm regular meter a practice that served him well in dance music at times his rhythms became pronounced enough to become main expressive agent of music they also became a means found typically in russian folk music of simulating movement or progression in large scale symphonic movements a synthetic propulsion as brown phrases it which substituted for momentum that would be created in strict sonata form by interaction of melodic or motivic elements this interaction generally does not take place in russian music brown new grove 1980 18 628 final 424 for more on this please see repetition below structure tchaikovsky struggled with sonata form its principle of organic growth through interplay of musical themes was alien to russian practice traditional argument that tchaikovsky seemed unable to develop themes in this manner fails to consider this point it also discounts possibility that tchaikovsky might have intended development passages in his large scale works to act as enforced hiatuses to build tension rather than grow organically as smoothly progressive musical arguments zajaczkowski 25 according to brown and musicologists hans keller and daniel zhitomirsky tchaikovsky found his solution to large scale structure while composing fourth symphony he essentially sidestepped thematic interaction and kept sonata form only as an outline as zhitomirsky phrases it zhitomirsky 102 within this outline focus centered on periodic alternation and juxtaposition tchaikovsky placed blocks of dissimilar tonal and thematic material alongside one another with what keller calls new and violent contrasts between musical themes keys and harmonies brown final 426 keller 347 this process according to brown and keller builds final 426 and adds intense drama keller 346 47 while result warrack charges is still an ingenious episodic treatment of two tunes rather than a symphonic development of them in germanic sense warrack symphonies 11 brown counters that it took listener of period through a succession of often highly charged sections which added up to a radically new kind of symphonic experience italics brown one that functioned not on basis of summation as austro german symphonies did but on one of accumulation partly due to melodic and structural intricacies involved in this accumulation and partly due to composer s nature tchaikovsky s music became intensely expressive brown new grove 1980 18 628 keller 346 47 maes 161 this intensity was entirely new to russian music and prompted some russians to place tchaikovsky s name alongside that of dostoyevsky volkov 115 german musicologist hermann credits tchaikovsky in his later symphonies with offering full images of life developed freely sometimes even dramatically around psychological contrasts this music has mark of truly lived and felt experience as quoted in botstein 101 botstein in elaborating on this comment suggests that listening to tchaikovsky s music became a psychological mirror connected to everyday experience one that reflected on dynamic nature of listener s own emotional self this active engagement with music opened for listener a vista of emotional and psychological tension and an extremity of feeling that possessed relevance because it seemed reminiscent of one s own truly lived and felt experience or one s search for intensity in a deeply personal sense botstein 101 repetition thumb right 350px sequence ascending by step note that there are only four segments continuously higher and that segments continue by same distance seconds c d d e etc as mentioned above repetition was a natural part of tchaikovsky s music just as it is an integral part of russian music warrack symphonies 9 also see brown final 422 23 his use of sequences within melodies repeating a tune at a higher or lower pitch in same voice benward and saker 111 12 could go on for extreme length problem with repetition is that over a period of time melody being repeated remains static even when there is a surface level of rhythmic activity added to it brown final 423 24 warrack symphonies 9 tchaikovsky kept musical conversation flowing by treating melody tonality rhythm and sound color as one integrated unit rather than as separate elements maes 161 by making subtle but noticeable changes in rhythm or phrasing of a tune modulating to another key changing melody itself or varying instruments playing it tchaikovsky could keep a listener s interest from flagging by extending number of repetitions he could increase musical and dramatic tension of a passage building into an emotional experience of almost unbearable intensity as brown phrases it controlling when peak and release of that tension would take place brown new grove 1980 18 628 also see 105 musicologist martin cooper calls this practice a subtle form of unifying a piece of music and adds that tchaikovsky brought it to a high point of refinement cooper 32 for more on this practice see next section orchestration like other late romantic composers tchaikovsky relied heavily on orchestration for musical effects holoman new grove 2001 12 413 tchaikovsky however became noted for sensual opulence and voluptuous virtuosity of his orchestration maes 73 taruskin grove opera 4 669 like glinka tchaikovsky tended toward bright primary colors and sharply delineated contrasts of texture brown new grove 1980 18 628 hopkins new grove 1980 13 698 however beginning with third symphony tchaikovsky experimented with an increased range of 78 tchaikovsky s scoring was noted and admired by some of his peers rimsky korsakov regularly referred his students at saint petersburg conservatory to it and called it devoid of all striving after effect to give a healthy beautiful sonority as quoted in taruskin stravinsky 206 this sonority musicologist richard taruskin points out is essentially germanic in effect tchaikovsky s expert use of having two or more instruments play a melody simultaneously a practice called doubling and his ear for uncanny combinations of instruments resulted in a generalized orchestral sonority in which individual timbres of instruments being thoroughly mixed would vanish taruskin stravinsky 206 pastiche passe ism in works like serenade for strings and variations on a rococo theme tchaikovsky showed he was highly gifted at writing in a style of 18th century european pastiche in ballet sleeping beauty and opera queen of spades tchaikovsky graduated from imitation to full scale evocation this practice which alexandre benois calls passe ism lends an air of timelessness and immediacy making past seem as though it were present volkov 124 on a practical level tchaikovsky was drawn to past styles because he felt he might find solution to certain structural problems within them his rococo pastiches also may have offered escape into a musical world purer than his own into which he felt himself irresistibly drawn in this sense tchaikovsky operated in opposite manner to igor stravinsky who turned to neoclassicism partly as a form of compositional self discovery tchaikovsky s attraction to ballet might have allowed a similar refuge into a fairy tale world where he could freely write dance music within a tradition of french elegance brown new grove 1980 18 613 615 antecedents and influences thumb 180px robert schumann lithograph by josef in 1839 of tchaikovsky s western contemporaries robert schumann stands out as an influence in formal structure harmonic practices and piano writing according to brown and musicologist roland john wiley brown new grove 1980 18 613 18 620 wiley tchaikovsky 58 boris asafyev comments that schumann left his mark on tchaikovsky not just as a formal influence but also as an example of musical and self expression asafyev 13 14 leon botstein claims music of franz liszt and richard wagner also left their imprints on tchaikovsky s orchestral style 103 as proof of wagner s influence botstein cites a letter from tchaikovsky to taneyev in which composer readily admits influence of nibelungen on francesca da rimini this letter is quoted in brown crisis 108 late romantic trend for writing orchestral suites begun by franz jules massenet and joachim raff after rediscovery of bach s works in that genre may have influenced tchaikovsky to try his own hand at them fuller new grove 2001 24 681 62 maes 155 his teacher anton rubinstein s opera demon became a model for final tableau of eugene onegin taruskin grove opera 4 664 so did leo delibes ballets coppelia and sylvia for sleeping it is sometimes thought these two ballets also influenced tchaikovsky s work on swan lake he had already composed that work before learning of them brown crisis 77 and georges bizet s opera carmen a work tchaikovsky admired tremendously for queen of spades brown final 189 maes 131 138 152 otherwise it was to composers of past that tchaikovsky turned beethoven whose music he respected mozart whose music he loved wiley tchaikovsky 293 94 glinka whose opera a life for tsar made an indelible impression on him as a child and whose scoring he studied assiduously brown early 34 97 and adolphe adam whose ballet giselle was a favorite of his from his student days and whose score he consulted while working on sleeping beauty brown early 39 52 final 187 beethoven s string quartets may have influenced tchaikovsky s attempts in that medium wiley new grove 2001 25 149 other composers whose work interested tchaikovsky included hector berlioz felix mendelssohn giacomo meyerbeer gioachino rossini giuseppe verdi vincenzo bellini and henry brown early 72 aesthetic impact maes maintains that regardless of what he was writing tchaikovsky s main concern was how his music impacted his listeners on an aesthetic level at specific moments in piece and on a cumulative level once music had finished what his listeners experienced on an emotional or visceral level became an end in itself maes 138 tchaikovsky s focus on pleasing his audience might be considered closer to that of mendelssohn or mozart considering that he lived and worked in what was probably last 19th century feudal nation statement is not actually that surprising figes 274 maes 139 41 and yet even when writing so called programme music for example his romeo and juliet fantasy overture he cast it in sonata form his use of stylized 18th century melodies and patriotic themes was geared toward values of russian aristocracy maes 137 he was aided in this by ivan vsevolozhsky who commissioned sleeping beauty from tchaikovsky and libretto for queen of spades from modest with their use of 18th century settings stipulated firmly maes 146 152 vsevolozhsky originally intended libretto for a now unknown composer named nikolai not tchaikovsky maes 152 tchaikovsky also used polonaise frequently dance being a musical code for romanov dynasty and a symbol of russian patriotism using it in finale of a work could assure its success with russian listeners figes 274 maes 78 79 137 reception and collaborators 180px thumb upright marius petipa tchaikovsky s relationship with collaborators was mixed like nikolai rubinstein with first piano concerto virtuoso and pedagogue leopold auer rejected violin concerto initially but changed his mind he played it to great public success and taught it to his students who included jascha heifetz and nathan milstein steinberg wilhelm fitzenhagen intervened considerably in shaping what he considered his piece variations on a rococo theme according to music critic michael steinberg tchaikovsky was angered by fitzenhagen s license but did nothing rococo variations were published with cellist s amendments brown crisis 122 composer s original has since been published but most cellists still perform fitzenhagen s version campbell 77 his collaboration on three ballets went better and in marius petipa who worked with him on last two he might have found an advocate tchaikovsky s work with julius reisinger on swan lake was evidently also successful since it left him with no qualms about working with petipa but very little is written about it maes 146 when sleeping beauty was seen by its dancers as needlessly complicated petipa convinced them to put in extra effort tchaikovsky compromised to make his music as practical as possible for dancers and was accorded more creative freedom than ballet composers were usually accorded at time he responded with scores that minimized rhythmic subtleties normally present in his work but were inventive and rich in melody with more refined and imaginative orchestration than in average ballet score maes 145 48 critics thumb upright left eduard hanslick critical reception to tchaikovsky s music was also varied but also improved over time even after 1880 some inside russia held it suspect for not being nationalistic enough and thought western european critics lauded it for exactly that reason botstein 99 there might have been a grain of truth in latter according to musicologist and conductor leon botstein as german critics especially wrote of indeterminacy of tchaikovsky s artistic character being truly at home in non russian as quoted in botstein 100 of foreign critics who did not care for his music eduard hanslick lambasted violin concerto as a musical composition whose stink one can hear hanslick eduard music criticisms 1850 1900 ed and trans henry pleasants baltimore penguin books 1963 as quoted in steinberg concerto 487 and william forster wrote of fifth symphony furious sounds like nothing so much as a horde of demons struggling in a torrent of brandy music growing drunker and drunker pandemonium delerium tremens raving and above all noise worse confounded boston evening transcript 23 october 1892 as quoted in steinberg symphony 631 division between russian and western critics remained through much of 20th century but for a different reason according to brown and wiley prevailing view of western critics was that same qualities in tchaikovsky s music that appealed to audiences its strong emotions directness and eloquence and colorful orchestration added up to compositional shallowness brown new grove 1980 18 628 wiley new grove 2001 25 169 music s use in popular and film music brown says lowered its esteem in their eyes still further there was also fact pointed out earlier that tchaikovsky s music demanded active engagement from listener and as botstein phrases it spoke to listener s imaginative interior life regardless of nationality conservative critics he adds may have felt threatened by violence and hysteria they detected and felt such emotive displays attacked boundaries of conventional aesthetic appreciation cultured reception of art as an act of formalist discernment and polite engagement of art as an act of amusement there has also been fact that composer did not follow sonata form strictly relying instead on juxtaposing blocks of tonalities and thematic groups maes states this point has been seen at times as a weakness rather than a sign of originality even with what schonberg termed a professional reevaluation of tchaikovsky s work practice of faulting tchaikovsky for not following in steps of viennese masters has not gone away entirely while his intent of writing music that would please his audiences is also sometimes taken to task in a 1992 article new york times critic allan kozinn writes it is tchaikovsky s flexibility after all that has given us a sense of his variability tchaikovsky was capable of turning out music entertaining and widely beloved though it is that seems superficial manipulative and trivial when regarded in context of whole literature first piano concerto is a case in point it makes a joyful noise it swims in pretty tunes and its dramatic rhetoric allows or even requires a soloist to make a grand swashbuckling impression but it is entirely hollow in 21st century however critics are reacting more positively to tchaikovsky s tunefulness originality and craftsmanship tchaikovsky is being viewed again as a composer of first rank writing music of depth innovation and influence according to cultural historian and author joseph horowitz important in this reevaluation is a shift in attitude away from disdain for overt emotionalism that marked half of 20th century ref name wiley wiley new grove 2001 25 169 we have acquired a different view of romantic excess horowitz says tchaikovsky is today more admired than deplored for his emotional frankness if his music seems harried and insecure so are we all public horowitz maintains that while standing of tchaikovsky s music has fluctuated among critics for public it never went out of style and his most popular works have yielded iconic sound bytes such as love theme from romeo and juliet along with those tunes botstein adds tchaikovsky appealed to audiences outside of russia with an immediacy and directness that were startling even for music an art form often associated with emotion botstein 100 tchaikovsky s melodies stated with eloquence and matched by his inventive use of harmony and orchestration have always ensured audience appeal brown new grove 18 606 07 628 his popularity is considered secure with his following in many countries including great britain and united states second only to that of beethoven his music has also been used frequently in popular music and film steinberg symphony 611 legacy thumb statue of tchaikovsky in simferopol crimea according to wiley tchaikovsky was a pioneer in several ways thanks in large part to nadezhda von meck wiley writes he became first full time professional russian composer this wiley adds allowed him time and freedom to consolidate western compositional practices he had learned at saint petersburg conservatory with russian folk song and other native musical elements to fulfill his own expressive goals and forge an original deeply personal style he made an impact in not only absolute works such as symphony but also program music and as wiley phrases it transformed liszt s and berlioz s achievements into matters of shakespearean elevation and psychological import wiley new grove 2001 25 144 wiley and holden both note that tchaikovsky did all this without a native school of composition upon which to fall back they point out that only glinka had preceded him in combining russian and western practices and his teachers in saint petersburg had been thoroughly germanic in their musical outlook he was they write for all intents and purposes alone in his artistic quest holden xxi wiley new grove 2001 25 144 thumb left 190px stamp of russia swan lake 1993 maes and taruskin write that tchaikovsky believed that his professionalism in combining skill and high standards in his musical works separated him from his contemporaries in five maes 73 taruskin grove opera 4 663 maes adds that like them he wanted to produce music that reflected russian national character but which did so to highest european standards of quality maes 73 tchaikovsky according to maes came along at a time when nation itself was deeply divided as to what that character truly was like his country maes writes it took him time to discover how to express his russianness in a way that was true to himself and what he had learned because of his professionalism maes says he worked hard at this goal and succeeded composer s friend music critic hermann laroche wrote of sleeping beauty that score contained an element deeper and more general than color in internal structure of music above all in foundation of element of melody this basic element is undoubtedly russian as quoted in maes 166 tchaikovsky was inspired to reach beyond russia with his music according to maes and taruskin maes 73 taruskin grove opera 664 his exposure to western music they write encouraged him to think it belonged to not just russia but also world at large volkov adds that this mindset made him think seriously about russia s place in european musical culture first russian composer to do so it steeled him to become first russian composer to acquaint foreign audiences personally with his own works warrack writes as well as those of other russian composers warrack 209 in his biography of tchaikovsky anthony holden recalls dearth of
