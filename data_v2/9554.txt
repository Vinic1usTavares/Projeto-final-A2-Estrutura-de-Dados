gwyn in short canadians began to become a single community at same time provincial government became increasingly difficult to manage an act affecting both canada east and canada west required a double majority a majority of legislators from each of two sections of province this led to increasing deadlock in assembly two sections each elected 65 legislators even though canada west had a larger population one of brown s major demands was rep by pop that is representation by population which would lead to canada west having more seats and was bitterly opposed by canada east american civil war led to fears in canada and in britain that once americans had concluded their internal warfare they would invade canada again britain asked canadians to pay a part of expense of defence and a militia bill was introduced in assembly in 1862 opposition objected to expense and canada east representatives feared that french canadians would have to fight in a british instigated war at time

constitutional reform brown had led a parliamentary committee on confederation among british north american colonies which had reported back just before tache macdonald government fell brown was more interested in representation by population macdonald s priority was a federation that other colonies could join two compromised and agreed that new government would support federative principle a conveniently elastic phrase discussions were not public knowledge and macdonald stunned assembly by announcing that dissolution was being postponed because of progress in negotiations with brown two men were not only political rivals but were known to hate each other parties resolved their differences joining in great coalition with only parti rouge of canada east led by jean baptiste eric dorion

ratified terms after a debate over high cost that cabinet member alexander morris described as worst fight conservatives had had since confederation there were continuing disputes with americans over deep sea fishing rights and in early 1871 an anglo american commission was appointed to settle outstanding matters between british and canadians and americans canada was hoping to secure compensation for damage done by fenians raiding canada from bases in united states macdonald was appointed a british commissioner a post he was reluctant to accept as he realised canadian interests might be sacrificed for mother country this proved to be case canada received no compensation for raids and no significant trade advantages in settlement which required canada to open her waters to american fishermen macdonald returned home to defend treaty of washington against a political firestorm second majority and pacific scandal 1872 1873 in run up to 1872 election macdonald had yet to formulate a

feeling macdonald could be defeated over issue applied immense pressure to wavering members on 3 november macdonald rose in commons to defend government and according to his biographer p b waite gave speech of his life and in a sense for his life he began his speech at 9 p m looking frail and ill an appearance which quickly improved as he spoke he consumed glass after glass of gin and water he denied that there had been a corrupt bargain and stated that such contributions were common to both political parties after five hours macdonald concluded i leave it with this house with every confidence i am equal to either fortune i can see past decision of this house either for or against me but whether it be against me or for me i know and it is no vain boast to say so for even my enemies will admit that i am no boaster that there does not exist in canada a man who has given more of his time more of his heart more of his wealth or more of his intellect and power as it may be

mistakes he took long holidays and resumed his law practice moving his family to toronto and going into partnership with his son hugh john one mistake that macdonald believed liberals had made was a free trade agreement with washington negotiated in 1874 macdonald had come to believe that protection was necessary to build canadian industry panic of 1873 had led to a worldwide depression liberals found it difficult to finance railroad in such a climate and were generally opposed to line anyway slow pace of construction led to british columbia claims that agreement under which it had entered confederation was in jeopardy of being broken by 1876 macdonald and conservatives had adopted protection as party policy this view was widely promoted in speeches at a number of political picnics held across ontario during summer of 1876 macdonald s proposals struck a chord with public and conservatives began to win a string of by elections by end of 1876 tories had picked up 14 seats as a result

territories which extended canada to its present day boundaries with exception of newfoundland which would not enter confederation until 1949 also in 1880 canada sent its first diplomatic

returned for ontario riding of carleton transcontinental railroad project was heavily subsidised by government cpr was granted of land along route of railroad and 25 000 000 from government in addition government was pledged to build 32 000 000 of other railways to support cpr entire project was extremely costly especially for a nation with only 4 1 million people in 1881 between 1880 and 1885 as railway was slowly built cpr repeatedly came close to financial ruin not only was terrain in rocky mountains difficult route north of lake superior proved treacherous as tracks and engines

lived in exile in united states since 1870 he journeyed to regina with connivance of macdonald s government who believed he would prove a leader they could deal with instead metis rose following year under riel in north west rebellion macdonald put down rebellion with militia troops transported by rail and riel was captured tried for treason convicted and hanged macdonald refused to consider reprieving riel who was of uncertain mental health hanging of riel proved bitterly controversial and alienated many quebecers like riel catholic and culturally french canadian from conservatives they soon realign themselves with liberals cpr was almost bankrupt but its essential role in rushing troops to crisis proved its worth and parliament provided money for its completion on 7 november 1885

americans fishermen had been using treaty provisions allowing them to land in canada to take on wood and water as a cover for clandestine inshore fishing several vessels were detained in canadian ports to outrage of americans who demanded their release macdonald sought to pass a fisheries act which would override some of treaty provisions to dismay of british who were still responsible for external relations british government instructed governor general lord lansdowne to reserve royal assent for bill effectively placing it on hold without vetoing it after considerable discussion british government allowed royal assent at end of 1886 and indicated it would send a warship to protect fisheries if no agreement was reached with americans fifth and sixth majorities 1887 1891 death

february during campaign macdonald suffered another blow when quebec provincial liberals were able to form a government four months after october 1886 quebec election forcing conservatives from power

nova scotia liberal leader edward blake ran an uninspiring campaign and conservatives were returned nationally with a majority of 35 winning easily in ontario nova scotia and manitoba tories even took a narrow majority of quebec s seats despite resentment over riel s hanging macdonald became mp for kingston once again even younger ministers such as future prime minister john thompson who sometimes differed with macdonald on policy admitted prime minister was an essential electoral asset for conservatives blake whom macdonald biographer gwyn describes as liberal party s worst campaigner until stephane dion early in twenty first century resigned after defeat to be replaced by wilfrid laurier under laurier s early leadership liberals who had accepted much of national policy under blake while questioning details rejected it entirely calling for unrestricted reciprocity or free trade with united states advocates of laurier s plan argued that north south trade made more economic sense than trying to trade across vast empty prairies using a cpr which was already provoking resentment for what were seen as high freight rates macdonald was willing to see some reciprocity with united states but was reluctant to lower many tariffs american advocates of what they dubbed commercial union saw it as a prelude to political union and did not scruple to say so causing additional controversy in
