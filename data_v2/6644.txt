of madonna s older hits like into groove and holiday gave them a campy eurotrash feel like songs on confessions on a dance floor he added that reworkings help give disc a cohesive feel even if live performance like album it s hawking is kind of humorless that said as madonna s first live cd i m going to tell you a secret is strong and entertaining and even if excessive minutiae on accompanying dvd means only hardcore fans will sit through its two hours it s also quite well done sterdan from jam complimented cd section of release saying that thankfully cd takes up slack delivering more than an hour of newer fare like american life and music peppered with oldies like vogue holiday and like a prayer next time madonna wants to share a secret she should just leave cameras at home conversely sebastien from canoe ca website preferred dvd over cd saying that disc was not absolutely necessary but could understand business logic behind adding cd to release barry walters from rolling stone said that live cd proved that madonna is a better singer a reviewer from buffalo news was impressed with release saying that this is exactly what you d expect it to be a live document of madonna s most recent tour which means essentially a tour through dance based pop music of past 20 years colin jacobson from dvd movie guide website explained that though parts of i m going to tell you a secret frustrate it remains a reasonably entertaining program it probably will be most interesting for madonna s most serious fans though those in search of broader titillation of truth or dare will leave
