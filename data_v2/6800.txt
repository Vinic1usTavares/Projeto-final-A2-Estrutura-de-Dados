by lukather and stan lynch reached number 64 on uk charts some tambu reviewers contrasted lukather s vocals with those of former singers kimball and williams and indeed heavily criticized entire album

brought back williams and kimball to collaborate on 1998 s toto xx that lukather returned predominantly to role of backup vocalist lukather s songwriting contributions grew from a smattering of tracks on early toto albums to co writing almost every track starting in late 1980s lukather admitted that reason why he has no songwriting contributions on first two toto albums was that he wasn t writing

after toto had been recording and playing for 11 years and consensus among band members was to take a break as lukather had written a number of songs that did not appear on toto albums he decided to pursue a solo album with intention of presenting a dimension of his music that fans would be unfamiliar with he collaborated with many notable musicians including eddie van halen richard marx jan hammer steve stevens and fellow toto members jeff porcaro and david paich lukather has said that album was produced very simply and that a lot of ambient studio noise counting off on various tracks for instance is audible on it he also credits bands pink floyd cream led zeppelin and guitarists jimi hendrix david gilmour jeff beck and eric clapton as influences on album single swear your love came from album candyman recorded and mastered from march 1993 through november 1993 was a collaboration of musicians who were for most part also in lukather s band los lobotomys toto familiars simon phillips and david paich participated as well as david garfield john pena chris trujillo lenny castro larry fee waybill richard page and paul rodgers lukather recorded album in mostly live takes with little overdubbing some international fans were confused about whether candyman was a steve lukather album or a los lobotomys album japanese and us releases of candyman were under los lobotomys name rather than lukather s japanese release also featured a version of hendrix song red house european release of candyman was credited to lukather alone additionally touring band for album was sometimes introduced as steve lukather and los lobotomys and sometimes as just los lobotomys song borrowed time was released as a single in europe and included red house as a b side lukather describes 1997 s luke as a much different and more introspective album than his previous two solo efforts album is a concentrated collection of many of lukather s musical influences and he deliberately let those influences come out on album luke is an experimental album and like candyman it was recorded mostly in live sessions with minimal overdubbing and processing afterwards luke also features instrumentation not heard on previous lukather albums pedal steel harmonicas and experimental guitar bass and drum sounds us version of luke includes a version of jeff beck song pump song hate everything about u was released as a single 2003 santamental santamental released in october 2003 is a collaborative project featuring several prominent musicians such as guitarists eddie van halen

company wanted him to do record knowing he would approach project with a unique angle and produce something different from typical christmas album lukather recruited keyboardist jeff babko and guitarist larry carlton who lukather had worked with previously to help arrange songs project was a challenge to lukather who had to be creative to turn traditionally simple songs into something interesting for listeners without altering fundamental structures he said of album but i never dreamt in a million years that i d do a christmas record musicians lukather chose for santamental most of whom were involved in hard rock genre lent a heavy feel to album van halen recorded guitar tracks for joy to world after not having been in studio for some time but immediately made an impression on

vocals on five of tracks lukather wrote songs for album in a hotel room with his son and a handful of other musicians using basic equipment his song writing philosophy is that if a song sounds good with only guitars and vocals it will likely sound good after a full production lukather collaborated with grammy award winning engineer and producer steve macmillan on project with goal of introducing some new methods and techniques into recording process lukather described final tracks as perfectly imperfect preferring to record with five piece backing band in one room and in one take macmillan encouraged lukather to use organic vintage tones as a result lukather eschewed effects and played guitar parts directly through tube amplifiers manufactured by marshall vox and some boutique brands

that emerges prominently in later solo work such as all s well that ends well journalist jude gold notes that his vibrato is very pronounced and his exaggerated wide bends are distinctive and quickly recognizable well versed in music theory lukather can follow chord charts and changes in a way typical of jazz musicians this ability enhances his value as a session musician in interviews he has explained how he thinks of guitar in a chordal cluster format and not typical linear scale format lukather s approach to engineering his sound in studio is usually simple he is not known for doing a large number of takes or for incorporating much overdubbing rather he has a reputation for doing only single takes for many parts he has said about this approach if a solo didn t work either because i didn t have right sound or because i wasn t inspired at that moment i d just move on a part either works or it doesn t you can t batter it into submission or force inspiration to save you it s always better to just surrender and then come back later to give it a go with fresh ears although he enjoys technical mastery that is possible in studio lukather prefers dynamic of performing live on stage he has stated that dynamics are most important element of producing a recording with good sound quality despite being known in past for having an intricate set of effects units lukather now says he plays mostly free of such modifications after seeing some overdone commercial unit configurations named after him other than some delay he has not used many effects in recent years he has held a long association with bob bradshaw of custom audio electronics who designed and manufactured key elements of lukather s effects rack lukather was one of few official endorsers of emg pickups having
