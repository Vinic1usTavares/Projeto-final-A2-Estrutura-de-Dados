1832 he is remembered for strongly defending slavery and for advancing concept of minority rights in politics which he did in context of protecting interests of white south when it was outnumbered by northerners he began his political career as a nationalist modernizer and proponent of a strong national government and protective tariffs in late 1820s his views changed radically and he became a leading proponent of states rights limited government nullification and opposition to high tariffs he saw northern acceptance of these policies as a condition of south remaining in union his beliefs and warnings heavily influenced south s secession from union in 1860 1861 calhoun began his political career with election to house of representatives in 1810 as a prominent leader of war hawk faction calhoun strongly supported war of 1812 to defend american honor against british infractions of american independence and neutrality during napoleonic wars he then served as secretary of war under president james monroe and in this position reorganized and modernized war department calhoun was a candidate for presidency in 1824 election after failing to gain support he let his name be put forth as a candidate for vice president electoral college elected calhoun for vice president by an overwhelming majority he served under john quincy adams and continued under andrew jackson who defeated adams in election of 1828 calhoun had a difficult relationship with jackson primarily due to nullification crisis and petticoat affair in contrast with his previous nationalism calhoun vigorously supported south carolina s right to nullify federal tariff legislation he believed unfairly favored north putting him into conflict with unionists such as jackson in 1832 with only a few months remaining in his second term he resigned as vice president and entered senate he sought democratic nomination for presidency in 1844 but lost to surprise nominee james k polk who went on to become

boundary dispute with britain he then returned to senate where he opposed mexican american war wilmot proviso and compromise of 1850 before his death in 1850 calhoun often served as a virtual party independent who variously aligned as needed with democrats and whigs later in life calhoun became known as cast iron man for his rigid defense of white southern beliefs and practices his concept of republicanism emphasized approval of slavery and minority rights as particularly embodied by southern states his concept of minority rights did not extend to slaves he owned dozens of slaves in fort hill south carolina calhoun asserted that slavery rather than being a necessary evil was a positive good benefiting both slaves and slave owners to protect minority rights against majority rule he called for a concurrent majority whereby minority could sometimes block proposals that it felt infringed on their liberties to this end calhoun supported states rights and nullification through which states could declare null and void federal laws that they viewed as unconstitutional calhoun was one of great triumvirate or immortal trio of congressional leaders along with his congressional colleagues daniel webster and henry clay in 1957 a senate committee headed by senator john f kennedy selected calhoun as one of five greatest united states senators of all time early life thumb

legislature as a presbyterian he stood opposed to anglican elite based in charleston he was a patriot in american revolution and opposed ratification of federal constitution on grounds of states rights and personal liberties calhoun would eventually adopt his father s states rights beliefs young calhoun showed scholastic talent and although schools were scarce on carolina frontier he was enrolled briefly in an academy in appling georgia which soon closed he continued his studies privately when his father died his brothers were away starting business careers and so 14 year old calhoun took over management of family farm and five other farms for four years he simultaneously kept up his reading and his hunting and fishing family decided he should continue his education and so he resumed studies at academy after it reopened with financing from his brothers he went to yale college in connecticut in 1802 for first time in his life calhoun encountered serious advanced well organized intellectual dialogue that could shape his mind yale was dominated by president timothy dwight a federalist who became his mentor dwight s brilliance entranced and sometimes repelled calhoun biographer john niven says dwight repeatedly denounced jeffersonian democracy and calhoun challenged him in class dwight could not shake calhoun s commitment to republicanism young man retorted dwight your talents are of a high order and might justify you for any station but i deeply regret that you do not love sound principles better than sophistry you seem to possess a most unfortunate bias for error dwight also expounded on strategy of secession from union as a legitimate solution for new england s disagreements with national government calhoun made friends easily read widely and was a

calhoun won election to house of representatives in 1810 he immediately became a leader of war hawks along with speaker henry clay of kentucky and south carolina congressmen william lowndes and langdon cheves brushing aside vehement objections of both anti war new englanders and arch conservative jeffersonians led by john randolph of roanoke they demanded war against britain to preserve american honor and republican values which had been violated by british refusal to recognize american shipping rights as a member and later acting chairman of committee on foreign affairs calhoun played a major role in drafting two key documents in push for war report on foreign relations and war report of 1812 drawing on linguistic tradition of declaration of independence calhoun s committee called for a declaration of war in ringing phrases denouncing britain s lust for power unbounded tyranny and mad ambition war report of 1812 papers of john c calhoun 1 110 historian james roark says these were fighting words in a war that was in large measure about insult and honor united states declared war on britain on june 18 inaugurating war of 1812 opening phase involved multiple disasters for american arms as well as a financial crisis when treasury could barely pay bills conflict caused economic hardship for americans as royal navy blockaded ports and cut off imports exports and coastal trade several attempted invasions of canada were fiascos but u s in 1813 seized control of lake erie and broke power of hostile indians in battles such as battle of thames in canada in 1813 and battle of horseshoe bend in alabama in 1814 these indians had in many cases cooperated with british or spanish in opposing american interests calhoun labored to raise troops provide funds speed logistics rescue currency and regulate commerce to aid war effort one colleague hailed him as young hercules who carried war on his shoulders disasters on battlefield made him double his legislative efforts to overcome obstructionism of john randolph daniel webster and other opponents of war in december 1814 with armies of napoleon bonaparte apparently defeated and british invasions of new york and baltimore thwarted british and american diplomats signed treaty of ghent it called for a return to borders of 1812 with no gains or losses before treaty reached senate for ratification and even before news of its signing reached new orleans a massive british invasion force was utterly defeated in january 1815 at battle of new orleans making a national hero of general andrew jackson americans celebrated what they called a second war of independence against britain this led to beginning of era of good feelings an era marked by formal demise of federalist party and increased nationalism postwar planning despite american successes mismanagement of army during war distressed calhoun and he resolved to strengthen and centralize war department militia had proven itself quite unreliable during war and calhoun saw need for a permanent and professional military force in 1816 he called for building an effective navy including steam frigates as well as a standing army of adequate size british blockade of coast had underscored necessity of rapid means of internal transportation calhoun proposed a system of great permanent roads blockade had cut off import of manufactured items so he emphasized need to encourage more domestic manufacture fully realizing that industry was based in northeast dependence of old financial system on import duties was devastated when blockade cut off imports calhoun called for a system of internal taxation that would not collapse from a war time shrinkage of maritime trade as tariffs had done expiration of charter of first bank of united states had also distressed treasury so to reinvigorate and modernize economy calhoun called for a new national bank a new bank was chartered as second bank of united states by congress and approved by president james madison in 1816 through his proposals calhoun emphasized a national footing and downplayed sectionalism and states rights historian ulrich b phillips says that at this stage of calhoun s career word nation was often on his lips and his conviction was to enhance national unity which he identified with national power rhetorical style regarding his career in house of representatives an observer commented that calhoun was most elegant speaker that sits in house his gestures are easy and graceful his manner forcible and language elegant but above all he confines himself closely to subject which he always understands and enlightens everyone within hearing his talent for public speaking required systematic self discipline and practice a later critic noted sharp contrast between his hesitant conversations and his fluent speaking styles adding that calhoun had so carefully cultivated his naturally poor voice as to make his utterance clear full and distinct in speaking and while not at all musical it yet fell pleasantly on ear calhoun was a high strung man of ultra intellectual cast as such calhoun was not known for charisma he was often seen as harsh and aggressive with other representatives but he was a brilliant intellectual orator and strong organizer historian russell kirk says that zeal which flared like greek fire in randolph burned in calhoun too but it was contained in cast iron man as in a furnace and calhoun s passion glowed out only through his eyes no man was more stately more reserved john quincy adams concluded in 1821 that calhoun is a man of fair and candid mind of honorable principles of clear and quick understanding of cool self possession of enlarged philosophical views and of ardent patriotism he is above all sectional and factious prejudices more than any other statesman of this union with whom i have ever acted historian charles wiltse noted calhoun s evolution though he is known today primarily for his sectionalism calhoun was last of great political leaders of his time to take a sectional position later than daniel webster later than henry clay later than adams himself secretary of war and postwar nationalism thumb

deplorable state of war department led four men to decline offers from president james monroe to accept office of secretary of war before calhoun finally assumed role calhoun took office on december 8 and served until 1825 he continued his role as a leading nationalist during era of good feelings he proposed an elaborate program of national reforms to infrastructure that he believed would speed economic modernization his first priority was an effective navy including steam frigates and in second place a standing army of adequate size and as further preparation for emergency great permanent roads a certain encouragement to manufactures and a system of internal taxation that would not collapse from a war time shrinkage of maritime trade like customs duties a reform minded modernizer calhoun attempted to institute centralization and efficiency in indian department and in army by establishing new coastal and frontier fortifications and building military roads but congress either failed to respond to his reforms or responded with hostility calhoun s frustration with congressional inaction political rivalries and ideological differences spurred him to create bureau of indian affairs in 1824 responsibilities of bureau were to manage treaty negotiations schools and trade with indians in addition to handling all expenditures and correspondence concerning indian affairs thomas mckenney was appointed as first head of bureau as secretary calhoun had responsibility for management of indian affairs he promoted a plan adopted by monroe in 1825 to preserve sovereignty of eastern indians by relocating them to western reservations they could control without interference from state governments in over seven years calhoun supervised negotiation and ratification of 40 treaties with indian tribes calhoun opposed invasion of spanish florida launched in 1818 by general jackson during first seminole war which was done without direct authorization from calhoun or president monroe and in private with other cabinet members advocated of jackson as punishment calhoun claimed that jackson had begun a war against spain in violation of constitution and falsely that he had contradicted calhoun s explicit orders in doing so no official instructions not to invade florida or attack spanish were ever issued by administration however calhoun supported execution of alexander arbuthnot and robert ambrister two british soldiers living in florida who were accused of inciting seminole to make war against united states calhoun accused british of being involved in wickedness corruption and barbarity at which heart sickens and which in this enlightened age it ought not scarcely to be believed that a christian nation would have participated he added that he hoped executions of arbuthnot and ambrister would deter british and any other nations who by false promises delude and excite a indian tribe to all deeds of savage war united states annexed florida from spain in 1819 through adams onis treaty calhoun s tenure as secretary of war witnessed outbreak of missouri crisis in december 1818 when a petition arrived from missouri settlers seeking admission into union as a slave state in response representative james tallmadge jr of new york proposed two amendments to bill designed to restrict spread of slavery into what would become new state this amendments touched off an intense debate between north and south that had some talking openly of disunion in february 1820 calhoun predicted to secretary of state john quincy adams a new englander that missouri issue would not produce a dissolution of union but if it should calhoun went on south would of necessity be compelled to form an alliance with great britain i said that would be returning to colonial state adams recalled saying afterwards according to adams he said yes pretty much but it would be forced upon them after war ended in 1815 old republicans in congress with their jeffersonian ideology for economy in federal government sought to reduce operations and finances of war department calhoun s political rivalry with william h crawford secretary of treasury over pursuit of presidency in 1824 election complicated calhoun s tenure as war secretary general lack of military action following war meant that a large army such as that preferred by calhoun was no longer considered necessary radicals a group of strong states rights supporters who mostly favored crawford for president in coming election were inherently suspicious of large armies some allegedly also wanted to hinder calhoun s own presidential aspirations for that election thus on march 2 1821 congress passed reduction act which reduced number of enlisted men of army by half from 11 709 to 5 586 and number of officer corps by a fifth from 680 to 540 calhoun though concerned offered little protest later to provide army with a more organized command structure which had been severely lacking during war of 1812 he appointed major general jacob brown to a position that would later become known as commanding general of united states army vice presidency 1824 and 1828 elections and adams presidency thumb upright state historic marker at fort hill calhoun s home from 1825 until his death in 1850 alt large cast embossed concrete or metal panel atop a metal post embossing gives dates of other senators and politicians as well as calhoun s son in law calhoun was initially a candidate for president of united states in election of 1824 four other men also sought presidency andrew jackson adams crawford and henry clay calhoun failed to win endorsement of south carolina legislature and his supporters in pennsylvania decided to abandon his candidacy in favor of jackson s and instead supported him for vice president other states soon followed and calhoun therefore allowed himself to become a candidate for vice president rather than president electoral college elected calhoun vice president by a landslide he won 182 of 261 electoral votes while five other men received remaining votes no presidential candidate received a majority in electoral college and election was ultimately resolved by house of representatives where adams was declared winner over crawford and jackson who in election had led adams in both popular vote and electoral vote after clay speaker of house was appointed secretary of state by adams jackson s supporters denounced what they considered a corrupt bargain between adams and clay to give adams presidency in exchange for clay receiving office of secretary of state holder of which had traditionally become next president calhoun also expressed some concerns which caused friction between him and adams calhoun also opposed president adams plan to send a delegation to observe a meeting of south and central american leaders in panama believing that united states should stay out of foreign affairs calhoun became disillusioned with adams high tariff policies and increased centralization of government through a network of internal improvements which he now saw as a threat to rights of states calhoun wrote to jackson on june 4 1826 informing him that he would support jackson s second campaign for presidency in 1828 two were never particularly close friends calhoun never fully trusted jackson a frontiersman and popular war hero but hoped that his election would bring some reprieve from adams s anti states rights policies jackson selected calhoun as his running mate and together they defeated adams and his running mate richard rush calhoun thus became second of two vice presidents to serve under two different presidents only other man who accomplished this feat was george clinton who served as vice president from 1805 to 1812 under thomas jefferson and james madison during election jackson s aide james alexander hamilton attempted a rapprochement between jackson and crawford whom jackson resented owing partially to belief that it was he not calhoun who had opposed invasion of florida hamilton spoke about this prospect with governor john forsyth of georgia who acted as a mediator between jackson campaign and crawford forsyth wrote a letter back to hamilton in which he claimed that crawford had stated to him that it was calhoun not crawford who had supported censuring jackson for his invasion of florida knowing that letter could destroy partnership between jackson and calhoun hamilton and fellow jackson aide william b lewis allowed it to remain in hamilton s possession without informing jackson or public of its existence petticoat affair early in jackson s administration floride calhoun organized cabinet wives hence term petticoats against peggy eaton wife of secretary of war john eaton and refused to associate with her they alleged that john and peggy eaton had engaged in an adulterous affair while she was still legally married to her first husband and that her recent behavior was unladylike allegations of scandal created an intolerable situation for jackson petticoat affair ended friendly relations between calhoun and jackson jackson sided with eatons he and his late wife rachel donelson had undergone similar political attacks stemming from their marriage in 1791 two had married in 1791 not knowing that rachel s first husband lewis robards had failed to finalize expected divorce once divorce was finalized they married legally in 1794 but episode caused a major controversy and was used against him in 1828 campaign jackson saw attacks on eaton stemming ultimately from political opposition of calhoun who had failed to silence his wife s criticisms were widely regarded as chief instigators jackson who loved to personalize disputes also saw petticoat affair as a direct challenge to his authority because it involved lower ranking executive officials and their wives seeming to contest his ability to choose whomever he wanted for his cabinet secretary of state martin van buren a widower took jackson s side and defended eatons van buren was a northerner and a supporter of 1828 tariff which calhoun bitterly opposed calhoun and van buren were main contenders for vice presidential nomination in ensuing election and nominee would then presumably be party s choice to succeed jackson that van buren sided with eatons in addition to disagreements between jackson and calhoun on other issues mainly nullification crisis marked him as calhoun s likely vice presidential successor some historians including jackson biographers richard b latner and robert v remini believe that hostility towards eatons was rooted less in questions of proper behavior than in politics eaton had been in favor of tariff of abominations he was also politically close to van buren calhoun may have wanted to expel eaton from cabinet as a way of boosting his anti tariff agenda and increasing his standing in democratic party many cabinet members were southern and could be expected to sympathize with such concerns especially treasury secretary samuel d ingham who was allied with calhoun and believed that he not van buren should succeed jackson as president in 1830 reports had emerged accurately stating that calhoun as secretary of war had favored censuring jackson for his 1818 invasion of florida these infuriated jackson eventually lewis decided to reveal existence of forsyth s letter and on april 30 crawford wrote a second letter this time to forsyth repeating charge forsyth represented him as having previously made jackson received letter on may 12 which confirmed his suspicions he claimed that calhoun had betrayed him eaton took his revenge on calhoun for reasons unclear calhoun asked eaton to approach jackson about possibility of calhoun publishing his correspondence with jackson at time of seminole war eaton did nothing leading calhoun to believe that jackson had approved publication of letters calhoun published them in united states telegraph a newspaper edited by a calhoun protege duff green this gave appearance of calhoun trying to justify himself against a conspiracy to damage him and further enraged president finally in spring of 1831 at suggestion of van buren who like jackson supported eatons jackson replaced all but one of his cabinet members thereby limiting calhoun s influence van buren began process by resigning as secretary of state facilitating jackson s removal of others van buren thereby grew in favor with jackson while rift between president and calhoun was widened later in 1832 calhoun as vice president cast a tie breaking vote against jackson s nomination of van buren as minister to great britain in a failed attempt to end van buren s political career missouri senator thomas hart benton a staunch supporter of jackson then stated that calhoun had elected a vice president as van buren was able to move past his failed nomination as minister to great britain and instead gain democratic party s vice presidential nomination in 1832 election in which he and jackson were victorious nullification calhoun had begun to oppose increases in protective tariffs as they generally benefited northerners more than southerners while he was vice president in adams administration jackson s supporters devised a high tariff legislation that placed duties on imports that were also made in new england calhoun had been assured that northeastern interests would reject tariff of 1828 exposing pro adams new england congressmen to charges that they selfishly opposed legislation popular among jacksonian democrats in west and mid atlantic states southern legislators miscalculated and so called tariff of abominations passed and was signed into law by president adams frustrated calhoun returned to his south carolina plantation where he anonymously composed south carolina exposition and protest an essay rejecting centralization philosophy and supporting principle of nullification as a means to prevent tyranny of a central government calhoun supported idea of nullification through a concurrent majority nullification is a legal theory that a state has right to nullify or invalidate any federal law it deems unconstitutional in calhoun s words it is right of a state to interpose in last resort in order to arrest an unconstitutional act of general government within its limits nullification can be traced back to arguments by jefferson and madison in writing kentucky and virginia resolutions of 1798 against alien and sedition acts madison expressed hope that states would declare acts unconstitutional while jefferson explicitly endorsed nullification calhoun openly argued for a state s right to secede from union as a last resort to protect its liberty and sovereignty in his later years madison rebuked supporters of nullification stating that no state had right to nullify federal law in south carolina exposition and protest calhoun argued that a state could veto any federal law that went beyond enumerated powers and encroached upon residual powers of state president jackson meanwhile generally supported states rights but opposed nullification and secession at 1830 jefferson day dinner at jesse brown s indian queen hotel jackson proposed a toast and proclaimed our federal union it must be preserved calhoun replied union next to our liberty most dear may we all remember that it can only be preserved by respecting rights of states and distributing equally benefit and burden of union calhoun s publication of letters from seminole war in telegraph caused his relationship with jackson to deteriorate further thus contributing to nullification crisis jackson and calhoun began an angry correspondence that lasted until jackson stopped it in july on july 14 1832 jackson signed into law tariff of 1832 it was designed to placate nullifiers by lowering tariff rates but nullifiers in south carolina remained unsatisfied on november 24 south carolina legislature officially nullified both tariff of 1832 and tariff of 1828 to be null and void as of february 1 1833 in response jackson sent u s navy warships to charleston harbor and threatened to hang calhoun or any man who worked to support nullification or secession after joining senate calhoun began to work with clay on a new compromise tariff a bill sponsored by administration had been introduced by representative c verplanck of new york but it lowered rates more sharply than clay and other protectionists desired clay managed to get calhoun to agree to a bill with higher rates in exchange for clay s opposition to jackson s military threats and perhaps with hope that he could win some southern votes in his next bid for presidency on same day congress passed force bill which empowered president of united states to use military force to ensure state compliance with federal law south carolina accepted tariff but in a final show of defiance nullified force bill in calhoun s speech against force bill delivered on february 5 1833 no longer as vice president he strongly endorsed nullification at one point saying in his three volume biography of jackson james parton summed up calhoun s role in nullification crisis calhoun began it calhoun continued it calhoun stopped it resignation as tensions over nullification escalated south carolina senator robert y hayne was considered less capable than calhoun to represent south carolina in senate debates so in late 1832 hayne resigned to become governor south carolina legislature elected calhoun as his replacement on december 28 calhoun resigned as vice president to become a senator with a voice in debates van buren had already been elected as jackson s new vice president meaning that calhoun had less than three months left on his term anyway south carolina newspaper city gazette commented on change biographer john niven argues that these moves were part of a well thought out plan whereby hayne would restrain hotheads in state legislature and calhoun would defend his brainchild nullification in washington against administration stalwarts and likes of daniel webster new apostle of northern nationalism calhoun was first of two vice presidents to resign second being spiro agnew in 1973 during his terms as vice president he made a record of 31 tie breaking votes in senate first term in u s senate thumb upright a portrait of calhoun from 1834 alt oil painting at aged 52 slightly heavier than earlier images hair slightly gray white scarf when calhoun took his seat in senate on december 29 1832 his chances of becoming president were considered poor due to his involvement in nullification crisis which left him without connections to a major national party after implementation of compromise tariff of 1833 which helped solve nullification crisis nullifier party along with other anti jackson politicians formed a coalition known as whig party calhoun sometimes affiliated with whigs but chose to remain a virtual independent due to whig promotion of federally subsidized internal improvements from 1833 to 1834 jackson was engaged in removing federal funds from second bank of united states during bank war calhoun opposed this action considering it a dangerous expansion of executive power he called men of jackson administration artful cunning and corrupt politicians and not fearless warriors he accused jackson of being ignorant on financial matters as evidence he cited economic panic caused by nicholas biddle as a means to stop jackson from destroying bank on march 28 1834 calhoun voted with whig senators on a successful motion to censure jackson for his removal of funds in 1837 he refused to attend inauguration of jackson s chosen successor van buren even as other powerful senators who opposed administration such as webster and clay did witness inauguration however by 1837 calhoun generally had realigned himself with most of democrats policies to restore his national stature calhoun cooperated with van buren democrats were hostile to national banks and country s bankers had joined whig party democratic replacement meant to help combat panic of 1837 was independent treasury system which calhoun supported and which went into effect calhoun like jackson and van buren attacked finance capitalism and opposed what he saw as encroachment by government and big business for this reason he opposed candidacy of whig william henry harrison in 1840 presidential election believing that harrison would institute high tariffs and therefore place an undue burden on southern economy calhoun resigned from senate on march 3 1843 four years before expiration of his term and returned to fort hill to prepare an attempt to win democratic nomination for 1844 presidential election he gained little support even from south and quit secretary of state appointment and annexation of texas when harrison died in 1841 after a month in office vice president john tyler succeeded him tyler a former democrat was expelled from whig party after vetoing bills passed by whig congressional majority to reestablish a national bank and raise tariffs he named calhoun secretary of state on april 10 1844 following death of abel p upshur in uss princeton disaster thumb upright calhoun during his tenure as secretary of state april 1844 march 1845 upshur s loss was a severe blow to tyler administration when calhoun was nominated as upshur s replacement white house was well advanced towards securing a treaty of annexation with texas state department s secret negotiations with texas republic had proceeded despite explicit threats from a suspicious mexican government that an unauthorized seizure of its northern district of coahuila y tejas would be equivalent to an act of war both negotiations with texas envoys and garnering of support from u s senate had been spearheaded aggressively by secretary upshur a strong pro slavery partisan tyler looked to its ratification by senate as sine qua non to his ambition for another term in office tyler planned to outflank whigs by gaining support from democratic party or possibly creating a new party of discontented northern democrats and southern whigs calhoun though as avid a proponent for texas acquisition as upshur posed a political liability to tyler s aims as secretary of state calhoun s political objective was to see that presidency was placed in hands of a southern extremist who would put expansion of slavery at center of national policy tyler and his allies had since 1843 devised and encouraged national propaganda promoting texas annexation which understated southern slaveholders aspirations regarding future of texas instead tyler chose to portray annexation of texas as something that would prove economically beneficial to nation as a whole further introduction of slavery into vast expanses of texas and beyond they argued would diffuse rather than concentrate slavery regionally ultimately weakening white attachment and dependence on slave labor this theory was yoked to growing enthusiasm among americans for manifest destiny a desire to see social economic and moral precepts of republicanism spread across continent moreover tyler declared that national security was at stake if foreign powers great britain in particular were to gain influence in texas it would be reduced to a british cotton producing reserve and a base to exert geostrategic influence over north america texas might be coerced into relinquishing slavery inducing slave uprisings in adjoining slave states and deepening sectional conflicts between american free soil and slave soil interests appointment of calhoun with his southern states rights reputation which some believed was synonymous with slavery threatened to cast doubt on tyler s carefully crafted reputation as a nationalist tyler though ambivalent felt obliged to enlist calhoun as secretary of state because tyler s closest confidantes had in haste offered position to south carolinian statesman in immediate aftermath of princeton disaster calhoun would be confirmed by congress by unanimous vote in advance of calhoun s arrival in washington d c tyler attempted to quickly finalize treaty negotiations sam houston president of texas republic fearing mexican retaliation insisted on a tangible demonstration of u s commitments to security of texas when key texas diplomats failed to appear on schedule delay compelled tyler to bring his new secretary of state directly into negotiations secretary calhoun was directed to honor former secretary upshur s verbal assurances of protection now offered by calhoun in writing to provide for u s military intervention in event that mexico used force to hold texas tyler deployed u s navy vessels to gulf of mexico and ordered army units mobilized entirely paid for with 100 000 of executive branch contingency funds move side stepped constitutional requirements that congress authorize appropriations for war on april 22 1844 secretary calhoun signed treaty of annexation and ten days later delivered it to senate for consideration in secret session details of treaty negotiations and supporting documents were leaked to press by senator benjamin tappan of ohio tappan a democrat was an opponent of annexation and of slavery terms of tyler texas treaty and release of calhoun s letter to british ambassador richard pakenham exposed annexation campaign as a program to expand and preserve slavery in pakenham letter calhoun alleged that institution of slavery contributed to physical and mental well being of southern slaves u s senate was compelled to open its debates on ratification to public scrutiny and hopes for its passage by two thirds majority required by constitution were abandoned by administration supporters in linking texas annexation to expansion of slavery calhoun had alienated many who might previously have supported treaty on june 8 1844 after fierce partisan struggles senate rejected tyler texas treaty by a vote of 35 16 a margin of more than two to one vote went largely along party lines whigs had opposed it almost unanimously 1 27 while democrats split but voted largely in favor 15 8 nevertheless disclosure of treaty placed issue of texas annexation at center of 1844 general election election of 1844 at democratic convention in baltimore maryland in may 1844 calhoun s supporters with calhoun in attendance threatened to bolt proceedings and shift support to tyler s third party ticket if delegates failed to produce a pro texas nominee calhoun s pakenham letter and its identification with proslavery extremism moved presumptive democratic party nominee northerner martin van buren into denouncing annexation therefore van buren already not widely popular in south saw his support from that region crippled as a result james k polk a pro texas jacksonian and tennessee politician won nomination historian daniel walker howe says that calhoun s pakenham letter was a deliberate attempt to influence outcome of 1844 election writing in general election calhoun offered his endorsement to polk on condition that he support annexation of texas oppose tariff of 1842 and dissolve washington globe semi official propaganda organ of democratic party headed by francis preston blair he received these assurances and enthusiastically supported polk s candidacy polk narrowly defeated henry clay who opposed annexation lame duck president tyler organized a joint house senate vote on texas treaty which passed requiring only a simple majority he signed a bill of annexation on march 1 with

character by undermining republicanism in favor of empire and by bringing non white persons into country see ss evils of war and political parties when congress declared war against mexico on may 13 he abstained from voting on measure calhoun also vigorously opposed wilmot proviso an 1846 proposal by pennsylvania representative david wilmot to ban slavery in all newly acquired territories house

a first term democratic senator from illinois was designed to solve controversy over status of slavery in vast new territories acquired from mexico many pro slavery southerners opposed it and calhoun helped organize preparations for nashville convention which would meet that summer to discuss possibility of southern secession nearly 68 year old calhoun had suffered periodic bouts of tuberculosis throughout his life in march 1850 disease reached a critical stage weeks from death and too feeble to speak calhoun wrote a blistering attack on compromise that would become likely his most famous speech on march 4 a friend senator james mason of virginia read remarks calhoun affirmed right of south to leave union in response to northern subjugation he warned that day balance between two sections was destroyed would be a day not far removed from disunion anarchy and civil war calhoun queried how union might be preserved in light of subjugation by stronger party against weaker one he maintained that responsibility of solving question lay entirely on north as stronger section to allow southern minority an equal share in governance and to cease agitation he added calhoun died soon afterwards and although compromise measures did eventually pass calhoun s ideas about states rights attracted increasing attention across south historian william barney argues that calhoun s ideas proved appealing to southerners concerned with preserving slavery southern radicals known as fire eaters pushed doctrine of states rights to its logical extreme by upholding constitutional right of

was again exhumed and returned to its original place after calhoun had died an associate suggested that senator thomas hart benton give a eulogy in honor of calhoun on floor of senate benton a devoted

fort hill plantation which he bequeathed to his wife and daughter they sold it and its 50 slaves to a relative when that owner died thomas green clemson foreclosed mortgage he later bequeathed property to state for use as an agricultural college to be named after him calhoun s widow floride died on july 25 1866 and was buried in st paul s episcopal church cemetery in pendleton south carolina near their children but apart from her husband political philosophy agrarian republicanism historian cheek jr distinguishes between two strands of american republicanism puritan tradition based in new england and agrarian or south atlantic tradition which cheek argues was espoused by calhoun while new england tradition stressed a politically centralized enforcement of moral and religious norms to secure civic virtue south atlantic tradition relied on a decentralized moral and religious order based on idea of subsidiarity or localism cheek maintains that kentucky and virginia resolutions 1798 written by jefferson and madison were cornerstone of calhoun s republicanism calhoun emphasized primacy of subsidiarity holding that popular rule is best expressed in local communities that are nearly autonomous while serving as units of a larger society slavery calhoun led pro slavery faction in senate opposing both total abolitionism and attempts such as wilmot proviso to limit expansion of slavery into western territories thumb george peter alexander healy s 1851 painting of calhoun on exhibit at city hall in charleston south carolina alt full profile black suit with white ruffled shirt hand on chest with fingers spread out soft look calhoun s father patrick calhoun helped shape his son s political views he was a staunch supporter of slavery who taught his son that social standing depended not merely on a commitment to ideal of popular self government but also on ownership of a substantial number of slaves flourishing in a world in which slaveholding was a hallmark of civilization calhoun saw little reason to question its morality as an adult he further believed that slavery instilled in remaining whites a code of honor that blunted disruptive potential of private gain and fostered civic mindedness that lay near core of republican creed from such a standpoint expansion of slavery decreased likelihood for social conflict and postponed declension when money would become only measure of self worth as had happened in new england calhoun was thus firmly convinced that slavery was key to success of american dream whereas other southern politicians had excused slavery as a necessary evil in a famous speech on senate floor on february 6 1837 calhoun asserted that slavery was a positive good he rooted this claim on two grounds white supremacy and paternalism all societies calhoun claimed are ruled by an elite group that enjoys fruits of labor of a less exceptional group senator william cabell rives of virginia earlier had referred to slavery as an evil that might become a lesser evil in some circumstances calhoun believed that conceded too much to abolitionists calhoun s treatment of his own slaves includes an incident in 1831 when his slave alick ran away when threatened with a severe whipping calhoun wrote to his second cousin and brother in law asking him to keep a lookout for alick and if he was taken to have him severely whipped and sent back letter to james edward calhoun august 27 1831 correspondence of john c calhoun historical manuscripts commission 1899 p 301 when alick was captured calhoun wrote to captor calhoun rejected belief of southern leaders such as henry clay that all americans could agree on opinion and feeling that slavery was wrong although they might disagree on most practicable way to respond to that great wrong calhoun s constitutional ideas acted as a viable conservative alternative to northern appeals to democracy majority rule and natural rights as well as providing intellectual justification of slavery calhoun played a central role in devising south s overall political strategy according to phillips shortly after delivering his speech against compromise of 1850 calhoun predicted destruction of union over slavery issue speaking to senator mason he said evils of war and political parties thumb calhoun s home fort hill on grounds that became part of clemson university in clemson south carolina alt large classic style white house surrounded by lots of greenery calhoun was consistently opposed to war with mexico arguing that an enlarged military effort would only feed alarming and growing lust of public for empire regardless of its constitutional dangers bloat executive powers and patronage and saddle republic with a soaring debt that would disrupt finances and encourage speculation calhoun feared moreover that southern slave owners would be shut out of any conquered mexican territories as nearly happened with wilmot proviso he argued that war would detrimentally lead to annexation of all of mexico which would bring mexicans into country whom he considered deficient in moral and intellectual terms he said in a speech on january 4 1848 anti slavery northerners denounced war as a southern conspiracy to expand slavery calhoun in turn perceived a connivance of yankees to destroy south by 1847 he decided union was threatened by a totally corrupt party system he believed that in their lust for office patronage and spoils politicians in north pandered to anti slavery vote especially during presidential campaigns and politicians in slave states sacrificed southern rights in an effort to placate northern wings of their parties thus essential first step in any successful assertion of southern rights had to be jettisoning of all party ties in 1848 49 calhoun tried to give substance to his call for southern unity he was driving force behind drafting and publication of address of southern delegates in congress to their constituents it alleged northern violations of constitutional rights of south then warned southern voters to expect forced emancipation of slaves in near future followed by their complete subjugation by an unholy alliance of unprincipled northerners and blacks whites would flee and south would become permanent abode of disorder anarchy poverty misery and wretchedness only immediate and unflinching unity of southern whites could prevent such a disaster such unity would either bring north to its senses or lay foundation for an independent south but spirit of union was still strong in region and fewer than 40 of southern congressmen signed address and only one whig many southerners believed his warnings and read every political news story from north as further evidence of planned destruction of white southern way of life climax came a decade after calhoun s death with election of republican abraham lincoln in 1860 which led to secession of south carolina followed by six other southern states they formed new confederate states which in accordance with calhoun s theory did not have any organized political parties concurrent majority thumb upright undated photograph of calhoun alt full profile in oval frame black scarf under quilted sweater right arm draped over chair arm holding rim of hat austere look calhoun s basic concern for protecting diversity of minority interests is expressed in his chief contribution to political science idea of a concurrent majority across different groups as distinguished from a numerical majority a concurrent majority is a system in which a minority group is permitted to exercise a sort of veto power over actions of a majority that are believed to infringe upon minority s rights according to principle of a numerical majority will of more numerous citizens should always rule regardless of burdens on minority such a principle tends toward a consolidation of power in which interests of absolute majority always prevail over those of minority calhoun believed that great achievement of american constitution was in checking tyranny of a numerical majority through institutional procedures that required a concurrent majority such that each important interest in community must consent to actions of government to secure a concurrent majority those interests that have a numerical majority must compromise with interests that are in minority a concurrent majority requires a unanimous consent of all major interests in a community which is only sure way of preventing tyranny of majority this idea supported calhoun s doctrine of interposition or nullification in which state governments could refuse to enforce or comply with a policy of federal government that threatened vital interests of states historian richard hofstadter 1948 emphasizes that calhoun s conception of minority was very different from minorities of a century later unlike jefferson calhoun rejected attempts at economic social or political leveling claiming that true equality could not be achieved if all classes were given equal rights and responsibilities rather to ensure true prosperity it was necessary for a stronger group to provide protection and care for weaker one this meant that two groups should not be equal before law for calhoun protection order was more important than freedom individual rights were something to be earned not something bestowed by nature or god calhoun was concerned with protecting interests of southern states which he identified with interests of their slaveholding elites as a distinct and beleaguered minority among members of federal union his idea of a concurrent majority as a protection for minority rights has gained some acceptance in american political thought political scientist malcolm jewell argues decision making process in this country resembles john calhoun s concurrent majority a large number of groups both within and outside government must in practice approve any major policy calhoun s ideas on concurrent majority are illustrated in a disquisition on government disquisition is a 100 page essay on calhoun s definitive and comprehensive ideas on government which he worked on intermittently for six years until its 1849 completion it systematically presents his arguments that a numerical majority in any government will typically impose a despotism over a minority unless some way is devised to secure assent of all classes sections and interests and similarly that innate human depravity would debase government in a democracy state sovereignty and calhoun doctrine in 1840s three interpretations of constitutional powers of congress to deal with slavery in territories emerged free soil doctrine popular sovereignty position and calhoun doctrine free soilers stated that congress had power to outlaw slavery in territories popular sovereignty position argued that voters living there should decide calhoun doctrine said that congress and citizens of territories could never outlaw slavery in territories in what historian robert r russell calls calhoun doctrine calhoun argued that federal government s role in territories was only that of trustee or agent of several sovereign states it was obliged not to discriminate among states and hence was incapable of forbidding bringing into any territory of anything that was legal property in any state calhoun argued that citizens from every state had right to take their property to any territory congress and local voters he asserted had no authority to place restrictions on slavery in territories in a february 1847 speech before senate calhoun declared that of any law which should directly or by its effects deprive citizens of any of states of this union from emigrating with their property in to any of territories of united states will make such discrimination and would therefore be a violation of constitution enslavers therefore had a fundamental right to take their property wherever they wished as constitutional historian hermann von holst noted calhoun s doctrine made it a solemn constitutional duty of united states government and of american people to act as if existence or non existence of slavery in territories did not concern them in least calhoun doctrine was opposed by free soil forces which merged into new republican party around 1854 chief justice roger b taney based his decision in 1857 supreme court case dred scott v sandford in which he ruled that federal government could not prohibit slavery in any of territories upon calhoun s arguments moderates rejected these beliefs and taney s decision became a major point of partisan attack by republican party legacy thumb upright john c calhoun postage stamp csa issue of 1862 unused alt faded stamp image of calhoun saying confederate

television calhoun was portrayed by actor arliss howard in 1997 film amistad film depicts controversy and legal battle surrounding status of slaves who in 1839 rebelled against their transporters on la amistad slave ship historical reputation calhoun was despised by jackson and his supporters for his alleged attempts to subvert unity of nation for his own political gain on his deathbed jackson regretted that he had not had calhoun executed for treason my country he declared would have sustained me in act and his fate would have been a warning to traitors in all time to come even after his death calhoun s reputation among jacksonians remained poor they disparaged him by portraying him as a man thirsty for power who when he failed to attain it sought to tear down his country with him according to parton writing in 1860 calhoun is often remembered for his defense of minority rights in context of defending white southern interests from perceived northern threats by use of concurrent majority he is also noted and criticized for his strong defense of slavery these positions played an enormous role in influencing southern secessionist leaders by strengthening trend of sectionalism thus contributing to civil war during his lifetime and after calhoun was seen as one of senate s most important figures in 1957 a senate committee chaired by john f kennedy selected calhoun as one of five greatest united states senators in history biographer irving bartlett wrote calhoun is often held in high regard by southern lost cause historians who hold a romanticized view of old southern way of life and its cause during civil war historians such as charles m wiltse margaret coit and clyde n wilson have in their writings portrayed calhoun as a sympathetic or heroic figure john niven paints a portrait of calhoun that is both sympathetic and tragic he says that calhoun s ambition and personal desires were often thwarted by lesser men than he niven identifies calhoun as a driven man and a tragic figure he argues that calhoun was motivated by near disaster of war of 1812 of which he was a thoughtless advocate to work towards fighting for freedoms and securities of white southern people against any kind of threat ultimately niven says he would overcompensate and in end would more than any other individual destroy culture he sought to preserve perpetuating for several generations very insecurity that had shaped his public career recently calhoun s reputation has suffered particularly due to his defense of slavery racially motivated charleston church shooting in south carolina in
