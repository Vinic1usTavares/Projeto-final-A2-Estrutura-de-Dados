pitchfork media retrieved on 2011 11 123 track is a tender ballad that retains ocean s signature mellow minimalist vibe reinforced with shimmering synths and silky production ocean croons smoothly on song while employing a falsetto vocal range in certain sections mtv columnist jenna hally rubenstein likens ocean s singing on thinkin bout you to robin thicke justin timberlake and maxwell version of song featured on channel orange features an additional string section opening track with a swell of strings lyrically it s a melancholy record discussing torturous pain that comes with thinking about someone all time even if they may not reciprocate sentiment track being originally written for a woman can be viewed as unisex composition following ocean s revelation that he has been attracted to people of same sex some critics noted that lines such as my eyes don t shed tears but boy they pour when i m thinkin bout you had another additional message expressing his own thoughts on love song has been called a forbidden love track expressing ocean s turmoil about his own hidden sexuality refrain boy was originally viewed synonym for wow though new urgency was pumped into track adding extra pathos ocean reminisces about his first time with an ex lover who is addressed as boy during song track is an apology to an unnamed lover lines like a tornado flew around my room before you came serves as a confession and excuse mess it made it usually doesn t rain in southern california outlines ocean s own grief about situation admitting situation got out of control about ocean s writing pitchfork media s jordan sargent stated that strength of his songwriting is his ability to make unfamiliar feel intensely personal as if you re a friend that has long known all particulars of his relationships he continued thinking about you is also more primal though yearning in his falsetto is almost palpable as he flips gender roles and admits that he s been thinking about forever while simultaneously questioning if girl even had that kinda thing on her mind erika ramirez of billboard wrote that track gives prominence to his songwriting prowess and sonic versatility as he intertwines parallel styles of soul r b jazz and even a bit of funk song has been described as incredibly personal in nature sort of thing that s best sung by person who wrote it track telepathically serenades person who took ocean s virginity and in motel room of memories frank talks eternal love breaking into a sublime maxwell esque falsetto that makes a good case for restoring style to contemporary mainstream r b critical reception thinkin bout you received highly positive reviews from music critics pitchfork media called song bewitching and complimented its crossover potential sputnikmusic s sobhi youssef praised track commenting that ocean s ability to emote within confines of a ballad without making it saccharine or cheesy is nearly unparalleled by any of his contemporaries citing thinkin bout you as framework of most of album pitchfork media critic jordan sargent praised song and wrote this isn t a tale of bedroom triumph instead it s a beguiling sketch of a relationship just out of his reach like many of his songs magnetism of thinking about you lies not in details but in lack thereof billboard stated that odd future member tries out different singing styles showing off his beautiful falsetto vocal range in certain sections mtv journalist jenna hally commented that ocean had a surprisingly gorgeous falsetto and retains frank s classic laid back and relaxed r b vibe katherine asaph of popdust wrote that track might as well be ocean s final audition for r b stardom and that it was a smooth ballad version of novacane without sleaze getting in way of its purpose is just about best thing possible for ocean s burgeoning fame track shatters no earth and nobody will use it as a flawed example about how ocean s changing r b game but in everyone s career is a time for a solid ballad john calvert of quietus described thinkin bout you as a slow release torch song colour of caramel and bathed in low voltage lighting a buzzing but soothing synth cycle and muffled beats evoke touching and kissing in a velveteen womb poised considered classy and moving this is uniquely frank ocean greg kot of chicago tribune stated that track couldn t be any less auspicious as an opening song little more than a delicate yearning falsetto vocal over vaporous keyboards and a muffled rhythm track rolling stone writer jody rosen described song as woozy featuring ocean s falsetto rippling over murmuring electronic percussion she stated that it s a bisexual black bohemian new turned s avant r b torch ballad and of course it s just a love song an anthem for anyone anywhere who s found love and lost it hayley louise brown of clash viewed song as an important part of album musing opening with a reworked version of heartbreaking ballad thinking about you and an instant confrontation with full force of ocean s vocal range whole record echoes with extra terrestrial odd future synths and clumsy piano chords lane billings of paste noted song as in nature and made a case for ocean as an r b revivalist consequence of sound s harley brown of stated that song moves languidly like perfect thoughts about someone missed until muscle memory of ocean s falsetto bursts into song s upper register she continued while ocean might feel this more acutely than either woman who sung those songs there s a reason bey shed a tear first time she heard it regardless of how much these lyrics were influenced by lines like by time i realized i was in love it was malignant it was hopeless ache in ocean s voice is universal msn music s danielle cheesman felt that ocean did his followers a service by featuring song as album s opener describing track as year old spacey serenade to a boy that became a fan favorite she continued despite now being enhanced with a strings intro
