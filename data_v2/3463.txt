thumb upright 1 35 many animals such as this grey reef shark are countershaded thumb illustration from artist abbot thayer s 1909 book on camouflage of a luna caterpillar actias in position b inverted countershading or thayer s law is a method of camouflage in which an animal s coloration is darker on upper side and lighter on underside of body this pattern is found in many species of mammals reptiles birds fish and insects both predators and prey and has occurred since at least cretaceous period when light falls from above on a uniformly coloured three dimensional object such as a sphere it makes upper side appear lighter and underside darker grading from one to other this pattern of light and shade makes object appear solid and therefore easier to detect classical form of countershading discovered in 1909 by artist abbott handerson thayer works by counterbalancing effects of self shadowing again typically with grading from dark to light in theory this could be useful for military camouflage but in practice it has rarely been applied despite best efforts of thayer and later in second world war of zoologist hugh cott precise function of various patterns of animal coloration that have been called countershading has been debated by zoologists such as hannah rowland 2009 with suggestion that there may be multiple functions including flattening and background matching when viewed from side background matching when viewed from above or below implying separate colour schemes for top and bottom surfaces outline obliteration from above and a variety of other largely untested non camouflage theories a related mechanism counter illumination adds creation of light by bioluminescence or lamps to match actual brightness of a background counter illumination camouflage is common in marine organisms such as squid it has been studied up to prototype stage for military use in ships and aircraft but it too has rarely or never been used in warfare reverse of countershading with belly pigmented darker than back enhances contrast and so makes animals more conspicuous it is found in animals that can defend themselves such as skunks pattern is used both in startle or deimatic displays and as a signal to warn off experienced predators however animals that habitually live upside down but lack strong defences such as nile catfish and luna moth caterpillar have upside down countershading for camouflage early research thumb left thayer s 1902 patent application he failed to convince us navy english zoologist edward bagnall poulton author of colours of

betularia poulton 1887 thayer 1909 p 22 however he did not use term countershading nor did he suggest that effect occurred widely thumb upright thayer s white fowl lacking counter shading against a

conventionally camouflaged and visible whereas another on right is so carefully countershaded that it is effectively invisible behrens 2009 new hampshire artist abbott handerson thayer was one of first to study and write about countershading in his 1909 book concealing coloration in animal kingdom he correctly described and illustrated countershading with photographs and paintings but wrongly claimed that almost all animals are countershaded thayer 1909 for this reason countershading is sometimes called thayer s law thayer wrote thayer observed and painted a number of examples including luna moth caterpillar actias luna both in its habitual upside down feeding position where its countershading makes it appear flat and artificially inverted from that position where sunlight and its inverted countershading combine to make it appear heavily shaded and therefore solid thayer 1909 plate xii thayer obtained a patent in 1902 to paint warships both submarines and surface ships using countershading but failed to convince us navy to adopt his ideas goldstein 2009 pp 233 235 hugh bamford cott in his 1940 book adaptive coloration in animals described many instances of countershading following thayer in general 1940 pp 35 46 but criticising thayer s excessive claim he says all patterns and colors whatsoever of all animals that ever prey or are preyed upon are under certain normal circumstances obliterative that effectively all animals are camouflaged with countershading cott called this thayer straining theory to a fantastic extreme cott 1940 pp 172 173 both thayer and cott included in their books photographs of a non countershaded white cockerel against a white background to make point that in thayer s words a monochrome object can not be obliterated no matter what its background thayer 1909 caption to figure 7 or in cott s words colour resemblance alone is not sufficient to afford concealment cott 1940 caption to plate 7 cott explained that application in animals thumb are effectively flattened by countershading making them nearly invisible against a desert background there are three in image countershading is observed in a wide range of animal groups both terrestrial such as deer and marine such as sharks onr 2013 it is basis of camouflage in both predators and prey cott 1940 p 40 it is used alongside other forms of camouflage including colour matching and disruptive coloration among predatory fish gray snapper griseus is effectively flattened by its countershading while it hunts an almost invisible prey hardhead fish laticeps which swims over greyish sands cott 1940 p37 other countershaded marine animals include blue shark herring and dolphin while fish such as mackerel and sergeant fish are both countershaded and patterned with stripes or spots cott 1940 p41 countershading existed in marine reptiles in cretaceous period fossilised skin pigmented with dark coloured eumelanin reveals that both leatherback turtles and mosasaurs had dark backs and light bellies ornithischian dinosaur psittacosaurus similarly appears to have been countershaded implying that its predators detected their prey by deducing shape from shading modelling suggests further that dinosaur was optimally countershaded for a closed habitat such as a forest a related mechanism counter illumination another form of animal camouflage uses bioluminescence to increase average brightness of an animal to match brightness of background young and roper 1977 this is called counter illumination it is common in mid water pelagic fish and invertebrates especially squid it makes counter illuminated animal practically invisible to predators viewing it from below young and roper 1976 as such counter illumination camouflage can be seen as an extension beyond what countershading can achieve where countershading only paints out shadows counter illumination can add in actual lights permitting effective camouflage in changing conditions including where background is bright enough to make an animal that is not counter illuminated appear as a shadow jones 2004 p 1151 military thumb right countershaded rail mounted guns camouflaged by hugh cott above and in conventional style below august 1940 british authorities agreed cott s countershading worked but refused to adopt it countershading like counter illumination has rarely been applied in practice for military camouflage though not because military authorities were unaware of it both abbott thayer in first world war and hugh cott in second world war proposed countershading to their countries armed forces they each demonstrated effectiveness of countershading without succeeding in persuading their armed forces to adopt technique though they influenced military adoption of camouflage in general cott was a protege of john graham kerr who had quarrelled with norman wilkinson in first world war about dazzle camouflage for ships wilkinson remained influential in 1939 as an inspector of camouflage so a political argument developed cott was invited to camouflage a 12 inch rail mounted gun alongside a similar gun camouflaged conventionally cott carefully combined disruptive contrast to break up gun barrel s outlines with countershading to flatten out its appearance as a solid cylinder guns were then photographed from air from various angles and in peter forbes s view results were remarkable forbes 2009 p 150 cott s gun is invisible except to most minute scrutiny by someone who knows exactly where to look and what to look for other gun is always highly visible authorities hesitated appearing to be embarrassed by evidence that cott was right and argued that countershading would be too difficult to use as an expert zoologist would be needed to supervise every installation cott was posted to middle east and kerr unsuccessfully intervened pleading for guns to be painted cott s way and cott to be brought home forbes 2009 pp 142 146 149 151 156 thumb left a preserved sherman firefly 2008 its gun barrel is painted with a pattern that combines countershading and outline disruption to disguise its length australian zoologist william dakin in his 1941 book art of camouflage followed thayer in describing countershading in some detail and book was reprinted as a military handbook in 1942 dakin photographed model birds much as thayer and cott had done and argued that shoulders and arms of battledress should be countershaded elias 2011 countershading was described in us war department s 1943 principles of camouflage where after four paragraphs of theory and one on its use in nature advice given 1943 thumb true graduated from dark to light countershaded focke wulf fw 190 d 9 alt photo of wwii fighter plane parked on concrete inventors have continued to advocate military usage of countershading with for example a 2005 us patent for personal camouflage including countershading in form of statistical with varying sizes of rounded dark patches on a lighter ground tooley 2005 research by ariel tankus and yehezkel yeshurun investigating camouflage breaking automated detection of objects such as tanks showed that analysing images for convexity by looking for graded shadows can break very strong camouflage which might delude even human viewers more precisely images are searched for places where gradient of brightness crosses zero such as line where a shadow stops becoming darker and starts to become lighter again technique defeated camouflage using disruption of edges but authors observed that animals with thayer countershading are using counter measures to convexity based detectors which implied predators who use convexity based detectors tankus and yeshurun 2013 function thumb upright 1 5 countershading acts as a form of camouflage by painting out self shadowing of body or object result is a flat appearance instead of solid appearance with visual convexity of body before countershading hannah rowland reviewing countershading 100 years after abbott thayer observed that countershading which she defines as darker pigmentation on those surfaces exposed to most lighting is a common but poorly understood aspect of animal coloration rowland 2009 she noted there had been much debate about how countershading works rowland 2011 she considered evidence for thayer s theory that this acts as camouflage by reducing ventral shadowing and reviewed alternative explanations for countershading camouflage theories of countershading rowland wrote include self shadow concealment which results in improved background matching when viewed from side self shadow concealment that flattens form when viewed from side background matching when viewed from above or below and body outline obliteration when viewed from above these are examined in turn below flattening and background matching when viewed from side cott like thayer argued that countershading would make animals hard to see from side as they would fade into a ghostly elusiveness cott 1940 pp 36 37 rowland notes that cott is here reviewing thayer s theory and reinforcing view that a gradation in shading would act to eliminate effects of ventral shadowing kiltie measured effect of countershading of grey squirrel sciurus carolinensis showing that when squirrel is horizontal self shadowing of belly is partly concealed but that when squirrel is vertical as when climbing a tree trunk this effect did not occur kiltie 1944 thayer s original argument restated by cott was that nature did exact opposite with countershading that an artist did with paint when creating illusion of solid three dimensionality namely counteracting effect of shade to flatten out form shading is a powerful cue used by animals in different phyla to identify shapes of objects research with chicks showed that they preferred to peck at grains with shadows falling below them as if illuminated from above so both humans and birds may make use of shading as a depth cue hershberger 1970 background matching from above or below thumb mackerel like many pelagic fish is dark above pale below camouflaging it against ocean depths and bright surface a completely different function of animal and military vehicle coloration is to camouflage top and bottom surfaces differently to match their backgrounds below and above respectively this was noted for example by frank evers beddard in 1892 thumb right top bottom countershaded grumman f6f hellcat early researchers including alfred russel wallace wallace 1889 p 193 beddard beddard 1895 p 115 1940 and 1944 argued that in marine animals including pelagic fish such as marlin and mackerel as well as dolphins sharks and penguins upper and lower surfaces are sharply distinct in tone with a dark upper surface and often a nearly white lower surface they suggested that when seen from top darker dorsal surface of animal would offer camouflage against darkness of deep water below when seen from below lighter ventral area would similarly provide least possible contrast with sunlit ocean surface above there is some evidence for this in birds where birds that catch fish at a medium depth rather than at surface or on seabed are more often coloured in this way and prey of these birds would see only underside of bird ruxton 2004 rowland concluded that each possible role for coloration patterns lumped together as countershading needs to be evaluated separately rather than just assuming it functions effectively outline obliteration from above rowland 2009 identified an additional mechanism of countershading not previously analysed namely that a round body such as a cylinder illuminated and seen from above appears to have dark sides using a graphics tool she demonstrated that this effect can be flattened out by countershading since predators are known to use edges to identify prey countershading may therefore she argues make prey harder to detect when seen from above non camouflage theories non camouflage theories include protection from ultraviolet light thermoregulation and protection from abrasion all three of these plausible theories remained largely untested in 2009 according to rowland evidence thumb upright sea slug glaucus atlanticus swims and is countershaded upside down despite demonstrations and examples adduced by cott and others little experimental evidence for effectiveness of countershading was gathered in century since thayer s discovery experiments in 2009 using artificial prey showed that countershaded objects do have survival et al 2009 and in 2012 a study by william allen and colleagues showed that countershading in 114 species of ruminants closely matched predictions for self shadow concealment function predicted by poulton thayer and cott allen et al 2012 mechanism evolutionary developmental biology has assembled evidence from embryology and genetics to show how evolution has acted at all scales from whole organism down to individual genes proteins and genetic switches in case of countershaded mammals with dark often brownish upper parts and lighter often buff or whitish under parts such as in house mouse it is agouti gene which creates difference in shading agouti encodes for a protein agouti signalling peptide asp which specifically inhibits action of melanocortin 1 receptor mc1r in absence of agouti protein alpha melanocyte stimulating hormone stimulates cells bearing mc1r melanocytes to produce dark eumelanin colouring skin and fur dark brown or black in presence of agouti protein same system produces lighter coloured yellow or red a genetic switch active in cells of embryo that will become belly skin causes agouti gene to become active there creating countershading seen in adult mammals reverse countershading thumb left honey badger is reverse countershaded a form of aposematism warning coloration if countershading paints out shadows reverse darkening belly and lightening back would maximise contrast by adding to natural fall of light this pattern of animal coloration is found in animals such as skunk and honey badger with strong defences offensive stink of skunk and sharp claws aggressive nature and stink of honey badger these animals do not run when under attack but move slowly often turning to face danger and giving deimatic or threat displays either to startle inexperienced predators or as an aposematic signal to warn off experienced ones edmunds 2008 caterpillar of luna moth as discovered by thayer is in cott s phrase countershaded in relation to its attitude i e shaded with a light back grading to a dark belly as is nile catfish synodontis for same reason these animals and other caterpillars including io and eyed hawkmoth ocellatus habitually live upside down with belly uppermost similarly in sea slug glaucus atlanticus reverse countershading is associated with inverted habits these animals are thus employing countershading in usual way for camouflage cott 1940 p 43 examples in animals see also synodontis
