hallaton helmet is a decorated iron roman cavalry parade helmet originally covered in a sheet of silver and decorated in places with gold leaf it was discovered in 2000 near hallaton leicestershire after ken wallace a member of hallaton fieldwork group found coins in area further investigation by professional archaeologists from university of leicester archaeological services discovered that site appeared to have been used as a large scale iron age shrine nine years of conservation and restoration have been undertaken by experts from british museum supported by a heritage lottery fund grant of ps650 000 helmet is now on permanent display at harborough museum in market harborough alongside other artefacts from hallaton treasure hoard although it was found shattered into thousands of pieces and is now heavily corroded helmet still bears evidence of its original finely decorated design it was plated with silver gilt and decorated with images of goddesses and equestrian scenes it would have been used by a roman auxiliary cavalryman for displays and possibly in battle identity of owner is not known but helmet was discovered on a native british ceremonial site buried alongside thousands of iron age british and roman coins it is possible that helmet was owned by a briton who fought alongside romans during roman conquest of britain description and interpretation helmet is an example of a three piece roman ceremonial cavalry helmet made of sheet iron covered with silver sheet and partly decorated with gold leaf such helmets were worn by roman auxiliary cavalrymen in displays known as hippika gymnasia and may also have been worn in battle despite their relative thinness and lavish decoration horses and riders wore lavishly decorated clothes armour and plumes while performing feats of horsemanship and re enacting historical and legendary battles such as wars of greeks and trojans it is only roman helmet ever found in britain that still has most of its silver gilt plating attached helmet would originally have had two cheekpieces attached via holes in front of its ear guards it has a prominent browguard shape of which is similar to that of 3rd century guisborough helmet discovered in 1864 near guisborough in redcar and cleveland rear of helmet bowl descended to form a neckguard right thumb 200px emperor cheekpiece no 1 depicting a roman emperor being crowned by victory while trampling a barbarian under his horse s hooves as is case with other roman cavalry helmets hallaton helmet was very ornately decorated closest parallel to hallaton helmet in terms of overall appearance is a helmet found in xanten in germany which like hallaton example is made of silver gilded iron with a wreath on crown a central figure on browguard and a garland of flowers on neckguard a number of similar features have survived on hallaton helmet its bowl is decorated with laurel wreaths while scalloped browguard is edged with elaborate cabling in centre of browguard is now heavily damaged bust of a woman flanked by repousse lions her identity is unclear but she may have been an empress or goddess iconography is reminiscent of depictions of cybele magna mater or great mother whose image was used to promote values of augustan period a few decades after helmet was deposited however depiction has a number of features that are more in common with funerary art are in shape of silver ears and neckguard is decorated with a scrolling leaf pattern six detached cheekpieces were found within helmet bowl along with disintegrated remains of a seventh although only two would have been needed hinges were also found as was pin of one cheekpiece which had been bent it may have been forcibly removed or possibly sustained damage at a later date perhaps from a plough it is unclear why there were so many cheekpieces accompanying helmet it is possible that they may all have been used on same helmet to customise its appearance on different occasions or alternatively they may have been intended as spares in event of damage surviving cheekpieces are very elaborate five of cheekpieces show equestrian scenes one depicts triumph of a roman emperor on horseback holding his arm in air as he is crowned with a laurel wreath by goddess victoria victory a cowering barbarian is depicted below being trampled by hooves of emperor s horse another less well preserved cheekpiece depicts a possibly middle eastern figure holding a large cornucopia and a roman helmet and shield below helmet was found along with some 5 296 iron age and roman coins mostly dating to ad 20 30 50 largest assemblage of iron age coins ever found in britain they had been buried at what appears to have been a pre roman shrine where large scale animal slaughtering had taken place nearly 7 000 bone fragments were also found at site 97 per cent of which were from pigs many appear to have been buried without meat being eaten suggesting that they had been used as offerings site is located on a hilltop which appears to have been encircled by a boundary ditch and palisade with a possible processional way leading up to it in roman times it would have been located in territory of corieltauvi who inhabited an area of east midlands stretching from northamptonshire to lincolnshire it is very unusual to find a helmet of this type on a native ceremonial site it was probably made between 25 and 50 ad close to date of conquest of britain in 43 ad this makes it one of earliest roman helmets ever found in britain other british examples of later date were found in isolation away from settlements as in cases of guisborough helmet and crosby garrett helmet or on roman sites as with newstead helmet various suggestions have been put forward as to why helmet ended up at hallaton it may have been owned by a briton who served in roman cavalry it may have been a diplomatic gift from romans or it may have been captured in war according to dr jeremy hill of british museum first explanation is most likely here you probably have a situation where local britons are fighting on roman side roman cavalry at this time was mostly recruited from native allies not italians suggesting that britons fought alongside romans as they carried out their conquest of britain discovery and restoration right thumb hallaton helmet and cheekpieces on display at harborough museum market harborough helmet was discovered by 71 year old ken wallace a retired teacher and amateur archaeologist he and other members of hallaton fieldwork group had found fragments of roman pottery on a hill near hallaton in 2000 he visited site with a second hand metal detector late one afternoon and found about 200 coins which had been buried in a series of small pits dug into clay he also found another artifact which he left in ground overnight following day he returned to examine his discovery and found it that it was a silver ear he reported find to leicestershire s county archaeologist who called in university of leicester archaeological services ulas to excavate site dig took place in spring of 2003 helmet was too fragile to be excavated in situ so it was removed within a block of earth held together with plaster of paris it was taken to british museum in london for conservation which took nine years of work by conservator marilyn hockey and her colleagues fleur shearman and corrosion and effects of time had shattered helmet into thousands of pieces most of which were smaller than nail on a person s little finger reconstructed and conserved helmet was unveiled in january 2012 leicester county council was able to raise ps1 million to buy entire hoard and pay for conservation of helmet with assistance of donations from heritage lottery fund which gave a ps650 000 grant art fund and other trusts and charities helmet was valued at ps300 000 under terms of treasure act ken wallace and landowner were each awarded ps150 000 helmet was put on permanent public display at end of january 2012 at harborough museum in market harborough nine miles from site where hoard was found alongside other objects found at hallaton references category 1st
