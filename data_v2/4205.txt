much a part of who i am and will always be and they put it right there on that track according to scott shetler of popcrush run world contains an optimistic message and upbeat melody shetler

difficult sometimes it s amazing sometimes overwhelming sometimes you just don t know what to do and i hope that i captured all of that on this album mtv news noted that on songs lopez might be giving

2002 he concluded by stating that song was worthy of a standalone release monica herrera from billboard complimented dream for production of song and his background vocals she continued by calling run world refreshingly self assured when original version of song leaked online an editor from vibe commented that with help of dream and rick ross lopez takes another shot at running charts shane phoenix of hot spots said that keys are a little lost and synth clapping is over used but breaks are amazing and lyrics have something to say poppy reid of music network criticized song for its reliance on auto tune and lyrics you just don t expect or want from a 41 year old ur chicago s neil miller jr also gave a negative review of song questioning if run world was meant for lopez stating that because up until this point it seemed like we were listening to album that brave was meant to be a collection of tracks meant to make us dance not ones that we re supposed to blast out of our trunks of radio and music gave a negative review of song stating that it is slow paced and has a miss on beats which leaves listeners wanting for more credits and personnel credits adapted from liner notes of love
