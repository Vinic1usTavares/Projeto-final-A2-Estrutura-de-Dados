michigan existed as early as 1952 planning to extend south bend bypass northward into michigan to i 96 later i 196 began in 1962 a report issued in 1970 detailed four routing corridors spawning a lawsuit over how berrien springs would be bypassed construction was to begin in 1975 but michigan state highways department delayed construction plans in 1972 pushing start to 1977 first section running from state line north to us 12 was completed and dedicated august 10 1979 and opened to traffic by september 6 of that year from there us 31 was routed east along us 12 to bus us 12 and north

northwest of niles bus us 31 was created along former routing in niles and walton road was rebuilt as a state trunkline connection between northern end of freeway and former two lane routing of us 31 berrien springs bypass section was opened in late 1992 southbound lanes opening on october 23 and northbound on november 20 as a cost saving measure this section was initially an expressway with crossroads and was converted to a freeway in stages through 1999 since then mdot built a freeway segment north to napier avenue that was opened on august 27 2003 at a cost of 97 million equivalent to in a proposed spur westward to i 94 in area was never built future thumb right mitchell s satyr east of benton harbor michigan st joseph valley parkway extension was under study due to environmental economical and historical site issues one of environmental concerns relates to habitat of an endangered species mitchell s satyr butterfly that has its habitat in area of freeway extension habitat is home to second largest population of rare butterfly this freeway connection was originally approved in 1981 as part of a final environmental impact study that included freeway built from niles northward to napier avenue since that approval butterfly was discovered in blue creek fen in late 1980s and it was listed an endangered species in 1992 listing stalled construction of freeway north of berrien springs us fish and wildlife service usfws issued an opinion two years later that freeway project would jeopardize species mdot was given permission to modify previously approved freeway to cross blue creek on longer bridges usfws also required that any construction be done from elevated platforms among other restrictions in interim mdot proceeded with construction of southern portion of last freeway segment completing freeway northward from berrien springs to napier avenue interchange in august 2003 a revised environmental impact study to account for butterfly s habitat was approved in 2004 study compared original proposal for this extension that involved connecting directly to i 196 at i 94 with a pair of alternate routines that involved connecting us 31 directly to bl i 94 at i 94 near benton harbor with auxiliary lanes to i 196 recommendation was to use pa 2 version of alternative connection to avoid blue creek fen at time last freeway segment was opened in 2003 mdot expected remaining segment would not take much longer to complete but funding was not available for many years construction of extension was not included for this reason in subsequent mdot five year highway projects plans although most of design work and land acquisition was identified in 2013 as having been finished funding for project was listed in 2017 21 plan draft released in july 2016 which split remaining work into three phases mdot received a federal grant for project in december 2018 citing at that time a completion date of 2022 or 2023 for project until freeway is complete us 31 follows a stretch of napier avenue which was upgraded in conjunction with st joseph valley parkway opening to that point westward to i 94 us 31 i 94 bl i 94 interchange will be converted to a cloverleaf interchange or partial cloverleaf interchange if a connection is completed in future st joseph valley parkway name has already been applied to this unbuilt section exit list see also
