apartment to an entire weekend with her including a five hour sightseeing boat ride around manhattan production conception and writing seinfeld chronicles was written as pilot for show that would eventually be called seinfeld though earlier versions of script would refer to program as stand up and jerry seinfeld show idea for show started on november 2 1988 after nbc executives had approached comedian jerry seinfeld to do a project with network upon a suggestion by george shapiro seinfeld s manager at time seinfeld enlisted fellow comedian larry david to help him develop it and they wrote a concept for a special about how comedians get their material however upon further discussion seinfeld felt that concept could not be sustained for 90 minutes and two decided that project was to become a pilot for a series rather than a special developed by nbc executive rick ludwin and produced by castle rock entertainment it was a mix of seinfeld s stand up comedy routines and idiosyncratic conversational scenes focusing on mundane aspects of everyday life thumb upright larry david co wrote episode conceived as a show about nothing in which main characters would just make fun of stuff seinfeld said that idea of pilot episode was to explore gaps in society where there are no rules storyline as well as most of main characters were inspired by personal lives of its creators jerry was a fictionalized version of seinfeld george a fictionalized version of larry david and kessler was based on david s neighbor kenny kramer though seinfeld was initially concerned wacky neighbor would be too much of a cliche david convinced him to put character in script however anticipating that actual kramer would exploit benefits of having a tv character based on him david hesitated to call character kramer thus in pilot character s name was kessler however intrigued by name seinfeld was convinced that character s name should be kramer prompting kenny kramer to call nbc s legal department with various financial and legal demands most of which he received name inconsistency would eventually be addressed in season 9 episode betrayal in which kramer explains that kessler is name on his apartment buzzer david and seinfeld re wrote script several times before submitting it to network dropping and adding various elements originally george who was called bennett in early drafts was a comedian as well and first scene of episode focused on jerry and george discussing their stand up material character of kramer was not included in first draft of script and in another draft he was called hoffman another element that was added was kessler s dog since it was originally planned that jerry s stand up routines would match events of each episode though stand up routine about dogs was eventually dropped scene in which kessler enters with his dog remained in episode when david and seinfeld eventually submitted script network executives were unsure whether or not to produce pilot but as nbc executive warren littlefield would later state we all said ah what hell let s try a pilot on this thing and see what happens directed by art wolff pilot was filmed in front of a live studio audience on april 27 1989 at stage 9 of ren mar studios same studio where dick van dyke show was filmed which was seen by crew as a good omen exterior of pete s luncheonette restaurant in which episode opens was a leftover set piece from muppets take manhattan 1984 bjorklund 2013 p 7 seinfeld s stand up routine was recorded at ren mar studios in hollywood in front of an audience of paid extras though not all of recorded material was included in broadcast version additionally a scene was recorded featuring jerry and george driving to airport talking about changing lanes on road and giving thank you waves but was cut before broadcasting music used in episode was composed by epstein however when show was picked up epstein s tune was replaced by trademark slap bass music by jonathan wolff casting thumb upright michael richards reportedly did a handstand during his audition seinfeld chronicles featured four characters that were intended to be series regulars if show was to be picked up for a first season jerry george kramer and claire waitress though it was already settled that seinfeld would play a fictionalized version of himself auditions were held for other three characters though george was based on larry david david was keen on writing and did not have desire to portray character himself prior to casting progress seinfeld pleaded with his friend jake johannsen to play part but he rejected it when casting process started as casting director marc hirschfeld stated casting crew saw every actor they could possibly see in los angeles among these actors were larry miller seinfeld s best friend brad hall david alan grier and nathan lane yet none of them seemed fit for part jason alexander auditioned for part via a video tape though he had very little hope for being cast as he felt he was doing a woody allen impression however upon watching tape david and seinfeld were immediately convinced alexander would be right actor to cast however casting sessions traditionally work with rounds so alexander and a few other actors considered for role were flown to los angeles for a second audition one of other actors who made it to this round was larry miller as alexander knew miller was a close friend of seinfeld he was convinced he would not get part but eventually did kenny kramer initially demanded that he would play part of kessler as he served as inspiration for character however david did not want this and it was decided upon that casting sessions would be held among those who auditioned for part of kramer were steve tony shalhoub and larry hankin although he was not cast for part hankin would later portray an in show fictional version of kramer in season four episode pilot seinfeld and david were both familiar with michael richards and david had worked with him on fridays richards did his final audition at century plaza hotel on april 18 1989 reputedly finishing with a handstand david was not sure about casting richards as he was trying to cast an actor who resembled original kramer however impressed by richards audition seinfeld convinced david that richards would be right actor for part lee garlington was cast as claire waitress who in an earlier draft of episode was called meg though initially cast as a series regular character was replaced with elaine benes when series was picked up for a first season accounts differ on reason why character was replaced warren littlefield has said that it was because character s occupation i thought that as a waitress she d never be one of gang she d be relegated to pouring coffee catching up so i insisted they create a female character they wanted to spend time with dennis bjorklund of seinfeld reference has suggested that character was dropped in favor of a female character with more sex appeal however alexander said that garlington was written out of series because she had re written her scene and given it to david who was not happy with this seinfeld has however stated that this was not reason character was removed from show but rather that producers were looking for someone who was more involved julia louis dreyfus who would go on to replace garlington has stated that she was not aware of pilot before becoming a regular on show and she will never watch it out of superstition reception pilot was first screened by a group of two dozen nbc executives in burbank california in early 1989 although pilot did not yield explosion of laughter garnered by pilots for decade s previous nbc successes like cosby show and golden girls it drew mostly positive responses from assembled executives one exception was brandon tartikoff who was concerned that show was too new york too jewish before episode s tv premiere it was shown to a test audience of 400 households and met with extremely negative responses littlefield would later recall in history of pilot reports seinfeld has got to be one of worst of all time memo that summarized test audience s reaction contained feedback such as no segment of audience was eager to watch show again and none of supporting characters were particularly liked despite low rating show received from its test

show was unusual and intriguing yet quite funny joe stein of san diego evening tribune commented not all standup comedians fit into a sitcom format but seinfeld does a more negative response came from a fresno bee critic that stated i liked concept but seinfeld s jokes were so dull that you hoped standup stuff would fly by so you could get back to story though critic praised alexander s acting he commented that his performance was not enough to keep show from being just another piece of summer drivel offered up by a major commercial network various critics compared pilot to it s garry
