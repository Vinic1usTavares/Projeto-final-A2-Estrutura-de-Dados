1999 odisha cyclone imd designation bob 06 jtwc designation 05b was most intense recorded tropical cyclone in north indian ocean and among most destructive in region 1999 odisha cyclone organized into a tropical depression in andaman sea on 25 october though its origins could be traced back to an area of convection in sulu sea four days prior disturbance gradually strengthened as it took a west northwesterly path reaching cyclonic storm strength next day aided by highly favorable conditions storm rapidly intensified attaining super cyclonic storm intensity on 28 october before peaking on next day with winds of 260 km h 160 mph and a record low pressure of 912 mbar hpa 26 93 inhg storm maintained this intensity as it made landfall on odisha on 29 october cyclone steadily weakened due to persistent land interaction and dry air remaining quasi stationary for two days before slowly drifting offshore as a much weaker system storm dissipated on 4 november over bay of bengal although its primary effects were felt in a localized area of india outer fringes of super cyclone impacted myanmar and bangladesh ten people were killed in former while two were killed in latter by storm s rainbands storm was most severe to strike odisha in 20th century raking state and adjacent areas with high storm surge powerful winds and torrential rainfall storm s impacts exacerbated damage caused by a very severe cyclone that struck same region less than two weeks earlier 5 6 m 16 20 ft surge brought water up to 35 km 20 mi inland carrying along with it coastal debris and inundating towns and villages surge combined with heavy rains to produce widespread flooding damaging around 1 6 million homes and causing rivers to breach 20 005 flood embankments storm s effects destroyed numerous crops including sugar cane rice and other winter time harvests although estimates of death toll varied significantly at times suggesting 30 000 fatalities government of india enumerated 9 887 fatalities in country of which a majority were caused by storm surge over 8 000 deaths occurred in jagatsinghpur total damage cost of destruction wrought by super cyclone amounted to us 4 44 billion recovery efforts were extensive following storm s passage government of india allocated rs3 billion us 69 3 million to odisha state government supplementing earlier contributions made towards relief from earlier cyclone various branches of indian armed forces were dispatched to aid recovery efforts contributions from foreign governments amounted to nearly us 13 million with more than reliefweb int report india india cyclone fact sheet 1 fiscal year fy 2000 allocated by united states alongside foreign and domestic government contributions between 12 14 international aid agencies concurrently participated in relief efforts in storm s aftermath meteorological history although storm organized into a tropical cyclone in andaman sea origins of 1999 odisha cyclone can be traced back to an area of convection that began developing in sulu sea on october 21 despite some signs of development wind shear suppressed outflow and prevented any significant organization tracking westward disturbance encountered a more favorable environment in south china sea as a result thunderstorm activity began to increase prompted by these changes joint typhoon warning center jtwc issued a tropical cyclone formation alert tcfa at 02 00 utc on 23 october however system failed to develop any further before wind shear reemerged in gulf of thailand causing convection to diminish and resulting in cancellation of tcfa on 24 october storm crossed malay peninsula and moved into andaman sea by 03 00 utc on following day although environment remained moderately unfavorable for tropical cyclogenesis disturbance organized developing fair outflow a strong rainband and additional convection at 06 00 utc on 25 october system became a tropical depression while centered 550 km 340 mi east of port blair as such india meteorological department imd designated system as bob 06 with storm now steadily organizing jtwc once again issued a tcfa at 19 30 utc on 25 october early following day imd assessed that nascent depression had strengthened into a cyclonic storm at time storm was located 325 km 200 mi south southeast of rangoon myanmar under steering influence of an upper level ridge to its northeast bob 06 began to take a more northwesterly course ridge also provided a highly conducive environment for intensification and eventually became positioned atop strengthening cyclonic storm slowing cyclone and allowing it to generate good outflow with these conditions in place bob 06 entered a phase of rapid intensification strengthening faster than climatological rates bob 06 strengthened into a severe cyclonic storm at 03 00 utc on 27 october and attained very severe cyclonic storm intensity just nine hours later with storm centered 650 km 405 mi south of chittagong bangladesh an eye emerged on visible satellite imagery early on 28 october and at 15 00 utc that day imd classified bob 06 as a super cyclonic storm highest rating on imd s cyclone scale using dvorak technique imd estimated that bob 06 reached its peak intensity three hours later with maximum sustained winds of 260 km h 160 mph and a minimum barometric pressure of 912 mbar hpa 26 93 inhg this made bob 06 strongest tropical cyclone ever recorded in north indian ocean by pressure with sustained winds at time matched by only two other known cyclones in bay of bengal at time 1977 andhra pradesh cyclone was only storm in region of comparable intensity although storm s organization and appearance deteriorated as it neared land bob 06 s intensity held steady up until it made landfall on odisha coast between puri and kendrapara at 06 00 utc on 29 october rather than moving inland as forecast tropical cyclone became quasi stationary over coastal jajpur area as it laid within a weak steering region between two upper level anticyclones remaining situated over land storm steadily weakened as it began to dry air into its circulation deteriorating into a cyclonic storm on 30 october entraining of dry air limited thunderstorm activity to a single rainband to system s northeast soon weakening storm became caught in a mid tropospheric wind flow inducing a southward drift that brought bob 06 back over bay of bengal cyclone continued to weaken over water and imd stopped monitoring storm on 31 october jtwc followed suit a day later remnant low pressure system continued to meander around area for a few more days before eventually dissipating preparations thumb odisha cyclone as it was rapidly intensifying on 28 october at time it was classified as a very severe cyclonic storm alt image of a cyclone whose center is slightly above center storm s clouds appear white with a bluish tinge an eye is visible in gray shades at storm s center while thicker clouds are opaque and clustered around cyclone s center sprawling transparent clouds span length of image indian meteorological department periodically issued cyclone warning bulletins during storm s lifetime with first being directed to chief secretary of andaman and nicobar islands on 26 october first bulletin noted potential impacts and advised fishermen not to venture out to sea six warnings were issued for islands with last being issued on 27 october once storm passed to north and west due to initial uncertainty in storm s forecast track first warnings for coast of mainland india on 27 october concerned northern andhra pradesh odisha and west bengal hourly dissemination of cyclone bulletins were carried out by doordarshan and all india radio beginning on 28 october these warnings eventually narrowed in scope to eventually affected areas with last warning being issued for odisha on 31 october indian department of agriculture and cooperation dac served as primary administrative body for coordinating preparatory and relief work during 1999 odisha cyclone upon storm s formation dac requested chief secretaries and relief commissioners of andhra pradesh odisha and west bengal to begin storm preparations and initiate evacuations if necessary evacuations in odisha involved nearly 150 000 people living within 10 km 6 mi of coastline in five districts six districts maintained 23 permanent cyclone shelters operated by indian red cross society eventually serving to house 30 000 evacuees at paradip port twelve docked ships were evacuated out to sea to avoid cyclone in neighboring west bengal 200 000 people were evacuated from state s vulnerable low lying islands indian army was placed on stand by and food supplies were stocked up in prone regions train service was cancelled for areas expected to be impacted by cyclone impact myanmar and bangladesh in myanmar 10 people were killed and 20 000 families were displaced passing south of bangladesh 1999 odisha super cyclone s northern fringes swept across country killing two people and initially causing 200 fishermen to go missing substantial damage to housing was reported india effects in odisha 887 state of odisha sustained most catastrophic damage associated with cyclone bob 06 which was considered state s severest cyclone of 20th century damage was compounded by earlier impact of a very severe cyclonic storm that struck nearby areas just 11 days earlier twelve districts of odisha suffered severe damage reporting complete breakdown of essential services balasore jagatsinghpur jajpur kendrapara puri and among these blocks of and in jagatsinghpur were worst affected in total 12 9 million people were affected by storm estimates for storm s death toll vary significantly though india meteorological department indicated that around 9 887 were killed with an additional 40 persons missing and 2 507 others injured majority of these deaths occurred in jagatsinghpur where 8 119 were killed centre for research on epidemiology of disasters em dat disaster database indicates that 10 915 people were killed however other estimates suggested that death toll may have been as high as 30 000 storm s effects damaged 1 6 million homes across 14 643 villages and 97 blocks in turn 2 5 million people were marooned a total of 18 420 km2 7 of crop land was impacted and 444 000 livestock casualties were also reported sugar cane crop was destroyed alongside other kharif and rabi crops about 2 million tonnes 2 2 million tons of winter rice crop was destroyed total damage caused by destructive cyclone amounted to us 4 billion along odisha coast cyclone generated a 5 6 m 16 20 ft storm surge that brought water up to 35 km 20 mi inland inundating a large swath of coastal areas indian ministry of urban development estimated a peak storm surge height of 6 7 m 22 ft one visually estimated storm surge of 9 m 30 ft was reported however this estimate was determined to have been too high regardless no in situ measurement of peak storm surge exists as all potential instruments were destroyed by storm storm surge was responsible for a majority of fatalities linked to 1999 odisha cyclone accounting for around 7 000 deaths intense wave action sank 9 085 fishing boats and caused loss of 22 143 fishing nets some fishing trawlers were carried and deposited 1 5 2 0 km 0 9 1 2 mi inland a 4 km 2 5 mi stretch of road leading out of paradip was covered by sand dunes measuring 1 m 3 3 ft in height and 0 5 km 0 3 mi in width paradip port sustained severe damage to several components including various warehouses and its power transmission system though its core infrastructure remained intact damage at port was estimated at around rs300 million us 6 9 million storm surge destroyed nearly every house in paradip near point of landfall in 27 villages were submerged by surge to south in southern andhra pradesh 48 trawlers sank to north in west bengal substantial damage to housing was reported causing injuries to 30 people in midnapore stations in paradip and bhubaneswar each recorded sustained winds of 150 km h 90 mph before their instruments failed winds of 175 km h 110 mph were measured in puri as cyclone passed to north strong winds damaged electric lines and uprooted trees over 50 years old in puri and kendrapada downed power lines across state cut off communications between odisha and rest of world for over 24 hours and caused widespread power outages according to southern electricity supply corporation damage to power grid caused by cyclone totaled million us 4 4 million stalling over land odisha cyclone dropped torrential rainfall with 24 hour rainfall rates at times exceeding 20 cm 7 9 in paradip documented 53 cm 20 9 in over one 24 hour period over course of storm s passage total rainfall amounts over 60 cm 23 6 in occurred over a large swath of odisha highest recorded rainfall total was documented in which measured 95 5 cm 37 60 in of rain over a three day period flooding caused by storm was estimated to have killed approximately 2 000 people heavy rains flattened thatched huts and damaged roads and other infrastructure within seven worst affected districts over 70 of homes were destroyed most of these were thatched homes though 10 15 of non thatch roofed homes were also destroyed approximately 11 000 schools were either significantly damaged or destroyed all major district roads in area were either washed out or blocked by felled trees in bhubaneswar 60 of trees were flattened by winds and rain aerial surveys revealed that entire city was submerged by floodwaters adjacent areas were nearly stripped of all tree cover until 8 november city remained without power inundation induced by far reaching storm surge and heavy rain kept konark submerged in knee deep water for six days after landfall over course of four days excessive rainfall caused flooding of baitarani brahmani and rivers resulting in 20 005 flood embankment breaches and damaging of 6 headworks thousands of people suffered chemical burns after flooding mixed industrial chemicals into bathing ponds chemicals and fertilisers which maintained world s largest diammonium phosphate plant reported severe damage to facility in five districts most affected all electric water pumps were disabled though hand pumps remained operable aftermath foreign government contributions country contribution usd source s australia canada denmark european union finland germany netherlands new zealand sweden switzerland united kingdom united states total government of india declared a national disaster in aftermath of cyclone though international appeals were initially unanticipated destruction wrought by cyclone was expected to cause a six month long total loss of normal livelihood damage sustained to various sanitation infrastructure led to a heightened risk of communicable disease outbreaks indeed diarrhea and cholera saw increased incidences following storm s impact within a month of cyclone s landfall odisha state government reported 22 296 cases of disorders area s vulnerability to disease was also compounded by a lack of pre storm vaccinations raising fears of a potential measles outbreak outbreak of diseases caused by storm s effects stabilized by february 2000 for most locations initial loss of telecommunication and rail operation was restored within a few days prime minister of india atal bihari vajpayee announced allocation of rs3 billion us 69 3 million to odisha state government supplementing an earlier allocation of us 59 5 million made towards relief from cyclone that struck region earlier that october however odisha state government demanded a larger commitment of rs5 billion us 73 3 million for relief alongside billion us 366 7 million for rehabilitation federal government also considered establishment of a department for natural disaster management to handle devastation caused by cyclone ultimately a high powered task force was formed under command of ministry of defence to provide rehabilitation support indian army sent infantry engineers and signal detachments to assist with disaster relief including a field medical unit containing 30 ambulances and 340 doctors indian air force helicopters dropped food packets in affected regions beginning on 30 october while other government ground personnel distributed various relief supplies including vaccines and plastic sheeting due to severe damage to air traffic control infrastructure patnaik international airport was closed until 2 november curtailing relief operations schools that survived cyclone were repurposed as temporary shelters for those displaced due to high amount of animal carcasses government of india offered us 3 for every carcass burned higher than minimum wage however backlash led government to fly in 200 dalits from new delhi and 500 from odisha to carry out carcass removal on 2 november canadian international development agency contributed c 150 000 us 203 964 to international federation of red cross to aid recovery effort canada eventually doubled their contributions through canadian lutheran world relief and care european commission channeled eur2 million us 2 1 million through european community humanitarian office for use by various relief organizations contributions to aid agencies were also made by british department for international development dfid with initial contributions made to christian aid and care totaling ps330 000 us 540 837 dfid s initial emergency assistance was later increased to ps3 million us 4 9 million and supplemented by a ps25 million 40 9 million contribution over course of six months swiss humanitarian aid unit allocated chf 800 000 us 779 666 to five swiss relief organizations operating in india food aid worth a 300 000 us 191 700 was sent by australian government and delivered to approximately 1 million people through world food program other countries sent aid through their respective international federation of red cross and red crescent societies branch following an initial disaster declaration by united states ambassador to india dick celeste united states agency for international development contributed us 7 482 000 through food for peace and office of foreign disaster assistance to complement recovery efforts united nations children s fund allocated more than us 100 000 to help supply basic health and shelter needs while united nations office for coordination of humanitarian affairs made a similar allocation through an emergency grant and with reserves from an earlier grant from norway between 12 14 international aid agencies were concurrently active in odisha in storm s aftermath odisha government made appeals to various non governmental organizations as government s relief supplies only covered 40 of affected areas in response to storm s devastation oxfam prepared an initial aid package including emergency water equipment worth ps250 000 us 306 665 and 50 000 instant meals several members of action by churches together alliance made contributions to post cyclone relief efforts lutheran world relief made initial grants of us 15 000 each to church s auxiliary for social action casa and lutheran world federation for emergency programs in northeastern india united evangelical lutheran churches in india sent us 700 000 worth of various relief supplies in concert with casa indian red cross society distributed relief supplies from their zonal warehouse in calcutta with initial supplies valued at chf 20 000 us 19 491 in addition to indian society of red cross a joint indian and international federation assessment team was assembled to survey damage care carried over its preexisting relief operations from early october cyclone routing food supplies by train to hard hit locations in odisha odisha state branch of red cross extended emergency relief phase to a three month relief operation and a six month rehabilitation program with help of federation overall humanitarian response spanned well into late 2000 purushottam swaminarayan sanstha dispatched aid to 91 villages greatly affected by storm in jagatsinghpur and kendrapada districts medical camps were established in 32 villages three villages were adopted by baps charities in january 2000 to rebuild in jagatsinghpur and a total of 200 concrete homes were constructed as well as two concrete schools and two village tube wells project was finally completed in may 2002 two and a half years after cyclone hit similarly oxfam facilitated various restoration projects in ganjam district including in communities of denotified tribes runoff caused by cyclone enhanced available nutrients in bay of bengal supplementing already present
