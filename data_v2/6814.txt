enthusiastic young group of friends riding bus production development aparna sen a noted actress and director of bengali cinema made her debut as a director with english film 36 lane 1981 mr and mrs iyer was her second film in english she hoped to write a simple romantic story but it shaped out to be a relationship drama in backdrop of sectarian violence sen came up with background of story in aftermath of 9 11 and 2002 gujarat riots in an interview sen stated that omnipresent circumstantial violence in film was only to serve as a strain in script which aimed to show how relationship evolves between two people who are forced to be together under trying times she stated that time frame of film was set after attacks on parliament of india on 13 december 2001 in an interview at screening at locarno film festival sen revealed that konkona was involved in pre production research and she suggested title about cinematographer gautam ghose aparna sen said that they had a good rapport and that ghose himself an acclaimed director was one of best cinematographers she knew ghose in reply said that he hoped to give his best for film and thus contribute to their friendship casting rahul bose s work in english august 1994 and split wide open 1999 made aparna sen feel that he was a good controlled and intelligent actor after a costume and a makeup test he was chosen for character of raja sen admitted that bose s work was up to mark and working with him was a wonderful experience she told in an interview that konkona sen sharma s abilities as a sensitive actress fetched her role of meenakshi iyer konkona said that she chose this film as she was interested in indian films made in english and was reluctant to do regular commercial films sen had penned elderly muslim woman s character bearing surekha sikri in mind eventually sikri and author and playwright bhisham sahni were cast to play roles of muslim couple in film santhanam infant son of meenakshi iyer in film is sen s grand niece aparna sen chose english as film s narrative since characters are linguistically diverse she had to make sure that characters spoke in english with their regional accent konkona admitted in an interview that playing role of a tamil brahmin did not come easy director forced her to visit chennai where major language is tamil for two weeks to research her character she also said that she had learned many characteristics nuances and mannerisms native to tamilian housewives she took a close look at iyer lifestyles and customs in and around a cultural hub in chennai she attempted listening to recorded conversations in iyer households to get a suitable tamil accent filming production commenced in december 2001 sen chose to keep geographical setting unstated because she felt that it was a journey that could take place anywhere film was shot in himalayan foothills of northern west bengal producers provided a state of art camera from chennai s prasad studios to ensure that shooting crew was technically better equipped mehta from triplecom productions co producer oversaw crew of over 100 complete production schedule in 50 days production team resorted to certain cost cutting measures to ensure they committed fewer mistakes for example they had organised a workshop for actors to avoid mistakes while filming while filming in jalpaiguri sen got embroiled in a controversy for damages caused to forest bungalow a heritage property where a portion of filming was done she admitted that to give bungalow a haunted look they sprayed slush on walls and plastered cobwebs all over place however she claimed that place was cleaned up after completion of their shoot release and reception following objections from local police two scenes were removed by producers from version of film screened in city of mumbai one scene showed a hindu man saying using profanity that muslims should be sent back to pakistan other featured a policeman using obscenities with a communal undertone police felt both scenes were too provocative for a communally sensitive city however for rest of india film was screened in its entirety film had only modest box office success domestically it made 7 3 million rupees in its first release however thanks to its low budget and spread of multiplexes in india it brought in some revenue furthermore contemporary trend in indian television channels is to showcase films within months of their release this trend helped modest box office successes such as mr and mrs iyer to get additional thrust to their financial returns indeed mr and mrs iyer was one of first films that led to reworking of business models for small films in india in addition triplecom productions sold dubbed version in italy for 20 000 a trade analysis by rediff com suggested that small budget films such as mr and mrs iyer did not compromise on marketing budgets instead they put efforts in marketing themselves more innovatively special screenings and awards in 2002 mr and mrs iyer was chosen as india s official entry at locarno international film festival it ran for 3 minutes longer than its runtime of 120 minutes at locarno though it missed out on golden leopard award at locarno it won netpac jury prize along with two other films film won golden maile award at 22nd hawaii international film festival audience award for

nargis dutt award for best feature film on national integration at 2003 national film awards ceremony govind nihalani an indian film director wondered if mr and mrs iyer could have been sent to oscars instead of regular song and dance entries eventually film federation of india apex organisation that sends nation s official entries to oscars did not find any film worth sending for 76th academy awards reviews lawrence van gelder commented in his review in new york times that well acted romance as two principal characters are thrown together by unanticipated events is hard to resist even though answer to crucial question it raises is all too conveniently deferred time and again however he added that mr and mrs iyer is not a subtle film chicago reader also said sen is anything but subtle in populating bus with a cross section of class and ethnic types but friendship that blossoms between leads is tenderly depicted and hints at a solution to sectarian strife time magazine praised aparna sen for her attention to detail that skillfully captures characters idiosyncrasies village voice said actors appear game yet director aparna sen who conceived film in wake of september 11 resorts often to hokey pseudo lyricism and prefers sound bite ballyhoo to sociological depth metacritic a website with a medley of reviews by american critics gives film a score of 50 100 meaning mixed or average reviews in his review derek elley of variety remarked that film had awkward issue driven dialogue and wavering direction showing influences from both arty and commercial two leads just about scrape through although hindu review praised director for handling these scenes in an understated muted fashion giving them power to disturb and haunt you it questioned certain aspects of film stating though flutters of heart have been treated with finesse sometimes a little too pandering perhaps to middle class morality we are never entirely convinced that love could blossom between meenakshi iyer and raja chowdhary indeed sen was criticised for contriving cinematic situation not quite fitting to real world can a married woman with a baby in arms fall in love with a total stranger that she meets on a very short bus journey however extraordinary situation may have been having decided to drive them to each other s arms sen thinks up situations which are terribly contrived sen s story and script are found wanting elsewhere too police officer who plays good samaritan appears so unreal in world of rancour that sen creates she probably in her over enthusiasm lets her own emotions derail her konkona sen sharma who had not been widely seen outside bengal before release of film received particular praise for her performance movie clearly belongs to konkona sen sharma who as meenakshi iyer gets so beautifully into psyche of a tamil brahmin she emotes just splendidly when her eyes well up at thought of parting with raja chowdhary when she gently rests her head on his shoulders in train and when her expressions suggest faintest hint of love we know that here is a great actress a rediff com review said konkana a youngster bowls you over with her silently sledge hammering portrayal of meenakshi iyer a conservative tamilian brahmin housewife her eyes tell a thousand untold stories an australian critic said that film with wonderfully nuanced performances by and rahul bose whose love affair is as innocent as lyrical lingering soundtrack mr and mrs iyer is a gentle film whose simple and haunting love story will appeal to romantic traveller attractive lensing by gautam ghose a director in his own right and atmospheric scoring by ustad zakir hussain were well received looking through eyes of gautam ghose s illuminating lens aparna sen builds a miniature but epic world of tremendous inner strength in her first seriously politically committed film sen takes on issue of communal conflict with surging humanism of gabriel garcia marquez painting words on celluloid if zakir hussain creates sounds within seesaw of silences and screams cinematographer gautam ghose creates a lucid contrast between silently majestic himalayan hinterland and fundamentalists home media dvd dvd which released on 2 june 2004 has subtitle options in english hindi punjabi tamil and urdu it is available in 16 9 anamorphic widescreen dolby digital 5 1 surround progressive 24 fps widescreen and ntsc format soundtrack ustad zakir hussain composed music for film for first time in mainstream cinema he sang for one part of a song he said this in an interview and added that it was only after track was recorded producers decided to go for hussain s voice rahul bose who introduced hussain to aparna and konkona was instrumental in influencing hussain to compose
