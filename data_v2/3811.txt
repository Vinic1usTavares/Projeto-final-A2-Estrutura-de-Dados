gastroenteritis also known as infectious diarrhea is inflammation of gastrointestinal tract stomach and small intestine symptoms may include diarrhea vomiting and abdominal pain fever lack of energy and dehydration may also occur this typically lasts less than two weeks it is not related to influenza though it has erroneously been called stomach flu gastroenteritis is usually caused by viruses however bacteria parasites and fungus can also cause gastroenteritis in children rotavirus is most common cause of severe disease in adults norovirus and campylobacter are common causes eating improperly prepared food drinking contaminated water or close contact with a person who is infected can spread disease treatment is generally same with or without a definitive diagnosis so testing to confirm is usually not needed prevention includes hand washing with soap drinking clean water proper disposal of human waste and breastfeeding babies instead of using formula rotavirus vaccine is recommended as a prevention for children treatment involves getting enough fluids for mild or moderate cases this can typically be achieved by drinking oral rehydration solution a combination of water salts and sugar in those who are breastfed continued breastfeeding is recommended for more severe cases intravenous fluids may be needed fluids may also be given by a nasogastric tube zinc supplementation is recommended in children antibiotics are generally not needed however antibiotics are recommended for young children with a fever and bloody diarrhea in 2015 there were two billion cases of gastroenteritis resulting in 1 3 million deaths globally children and those in developing world are affected most in 2011 there were about 1 7 billion cases resulting in about 700 000 deaths of children under age of five in developing world children less than two years of age frequently get six or more infections a year it is less common in adults partly due to development of immunity signs and symptoms thumb upright 1 7 bristol stool chart gastroenteritis usually involves both diarrhea and vomiting sometimes only one or other is present this may be accompanied by abdominal cramps signs and symptoms usually begin 12 72 hours after contracting infectious agent if due to a virus condition usually resolves within one week some viral infections also involve fever fatigue headache and muscle pain if stool is bloody cause is less likely to be viral and more likely to be bacterial some bacterial infections cause severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks children infected with rotavirus usually make a full recovery within three to eight days however in poor countries treatment for severe infections is often out of reach and persistent diarrhea is common dehydration is a common complication of diarrhea severe dehydration in children may be recognized if skin color and position returns slowly when pressed this is called prolonged capillary refill and poor skin turgor abnormal breathing is another sign of severe dehydration repeat infections are typically seen in areas with poor sanitation and malnutrition stunted growth and long term cognitive delays can result reactive arthritis occurs in 1 of people following infections with campylobacter species guillain barre syndrome occurs in 0 1 hemolytic uremic syndrome hus may occur due to infection with shiga toxin producing escherichia coli or shigella species hus causes low platelet counts poor kidney function and low red blood cell count due to their breakdown children are more predisposed to getting hus than adults some viral infections may produce benign infantile seizures cause viruses particularly rotavirus and bacteria escherichia coli and campylobacter species are primary causes of gastroenteritis there are however many other infectious agents that can cause this syndrome including parasites and fungus non infectious causes are seen on occasion but they are less likely than a viral or bacterial cause risk of infection is higher in children due to their lack of immunity children are also at higher risk because they are less likely to practice good hygiene habits children living in areas without easy access to water and soap are especially vulnerable viral rotavirus norovirus adenovirus and are known to cause viral gastroenteritis rotavirus is most common cause of gastroenteritis in children and produces similar rates in both developed and developing world viruses cause about 70 of episodes of infectious diarrhea in pediatric age group rotavirus is a less common cause in adults due to acquired immunity norovirus is cause in about 18 of all cases norovirus is leading cause of gastroenteritis among adults in america causing greater than 90 of outbreaks these localized epidemics typically occur when groups of people spend time in close physical proximity to each other such as on cruise ships in hospitals or in restaurants people may remain infectious even after their diarrhea has ended norovirus is cause of about 10 of cases in children bacterial thumb salmonella atcc as seen with a microscope at 1000 fold magnification and following gram staining in developed world campylobacter jejuni is primary cause of bacterial gastroenteritis with half of these cases associated with exposure to poultry in children bacteria are cause in about 15 of cases with most common types being escherichia coli salmonella shigella and campylobacter species if food becomes contaminated with bacteria and remains at room temperature for a period of several hours bacteria multiply and increase risk of infection in those who consume food some foods commonly associated with illness include raw or undercooked meat poultry seafood and eggs raw sprouts unpasteurized milk and soft cheeses and fruit and vegetable juices in developing world especially sub saharan africa and asia cholera is a common cause of gastroenteritis this infection is usually transmitted by contaminated water or food clostridium difficile is an important cause of diarrhea that occurs more often in elderly infants can carry these bacteria without developing symptoms it is a common cause of diarrhea in those who are hospitalized and is frequently associated with antibiotic use staphylococcus aureus infectious diarrhea may also occur in those who have used antibiotics acute traveler s diarrhea is usually a type of bacterial gastroenteritis while persistent form is usually parasitic acid suppressing medication appears to increase risk of significant infection after exposure to a number of organisms including clostridium difficile salmonella and campylobacter species risk is greater in those taking proton pump inhibitors than with h2 antagonists parasitic a number of parasites can cause gastroenteritis giardia is most common but entamoeba histolytica cryptosporidium spp and other species have also been implicated as a group these agents comprise about 10 of cases in children giardia occurs more commonly in developing world but this type of illness can occur nearly everywhere it occurs more commonly in persons who have traveled to areas with high prevalence children who attend day care men who have sex with men and following disasters transmission transmission may occur from drinking contaminated water or when people share personal objects water quality typically worsens during rainy season and outbreaks are more common at this time in areas with four seasons infections are more common in winter worldwide bottle feeding of babies with improperly sanitized bottles is a significant cause transmission rates are also related to poor hygiene especially among children in crowded households and in those with poor nutritional status adults who have developed immunities might still carry certain organisms without exhibiting symptoms thus adults can become natural reservoirs of certain diseases while some agents such as shigella only occur in primates others such as giardia may occur in a wide variety of animals non infectious there are a number of non infectious causes of inflammation of gastrointestinal tract some of more common include medications like nsaids certain foods such as lactose in those who are intolerant and gluten in those with celiac disease crohn s disease is also a non infectious source of often severe gastroenteritis disease secondary to toxins may also occur some food related conditions associated with nausea vomiting and diarrhea include ciguatera poisoning due to consumption of contaminated predatory fish associated with consumption of certain types of spoiled fish tetrodotoxin poisoning from consumption of puffer fish among others and botulism typically due to improperly preserved food in united states rates of emergency department use for noninfectious gastroenteritis dropped 30 from 2006 until 2011 of twenty most common conditions seen in emergency department rates of noninfectious gastroenteritis had largest decrease in visits in that time period pathophysiology thumb gastroenteritis caused due to intestinal infection gastroenteritis is defined as vomiting or diarrhea due to inflammation of small or large bowel often due to infection changes in small bowel are typically while ones in large bowel are inflammatory number of pathogens required to cause an infection varies from as few as one for cryptosporidium to as many as 108 for vibrio cholerae diagnosis gastroenteritis is typically diagnosed clinically based on a person s signs and symptoms determining exact cause is usually not needed as it does not alter management of condition however stool cultures should be performed in those with blood in stool those who might have been exposed to food poisoning and those who have recently traveled to developing world it may also be appropriate in children younger than 5 old people and those with poor immune function diagnostic testing may also be done for surveillance as hypoglycemia occurs in approximately 10 of infants and young children measuring serum glucose in this population is recommended electrolytes and kidney function should also be checked when there is a concern about severe dehydration dehydration a determination of whether or not person has dehydration is an important part of assessment with dehydration typically divided into mild 3 5 moderate 6 9 and severe 10 cases in children most accurate signs of moderate or severe dehydration are a prolonged capillary refill poor skin turgor and abnormal breathing other useful findings when used in combination include sunken eyes decreased activity a lack of tears and a dry mouth a normal urinary output and oral fluid intake is reassuring laboratory testing is of little clinical benefit in determining degree of dehydration thus use of urine testing or is generally not needed differential diagnosis other potential causes of signs and symptoms that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis that need to be ruled out include appendicitis inflammatory bowel disease urinary tract infections and diabetes mellitus pancreatic insufficiency short bowel syndrome whipple s disease coeliac disease and laxative abuse should also be considered differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea rather than both appendicitis may present with vomiting abdominal pain and a small amount of diarrhea in up to 33 of cases this is in contrast to large amount of diarrhea that is typical of gastroenteritis infections of lungs or urinary tract in children may also cause vomiting or diarrhea classical diabetic ketoacidosis dka presents with abdominal pain nausea and vomiting but without diarrhea one study found that 17 of children with dka were initially diagnosed as having gastroenteritis prevention thumb upright 1 3 percentage of rotavirus tests with positive results by surveillance week united states july 2000 june 2009 lifestyle a supply of easily accessible uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices are important for reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis personal measures such as hand washing with soap have been found to decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both developing and developed world by as much as 30 alcohol based gels may also be effective food or drink that is thought to be contaminated should be avoided breastfeeding is important especially in places with poor hygiene as is improvement of hygiene generally breast milk reduces both frequency of infections and their duration vaccination due to both its effectiveness and safety in 2009 world health organization recommended that rotavirus vaccine be offered to all children globally two commercial rotavirus vaccines exist and several more are in development in africa and asia these vaccines reduced severe disease among infants and countries that have put in place national immunization programs have seen a decline in rates and severity of disease this vaccine may also prevent illness in non vaccinated children by reducing number of circulating infections since 2000 implementation of a rotavirus vaccination program in united states has substantially decreased number of cases of diarrhea by as much as 80 percent first dose of vaccine should be given to infants between 6 and 15 weeks of age oral cholera vaccine has been found to be 50 60 effective over 2 years management gastroenteritis is usually an acute and self limiting disease that does not require medication preferred treatment in those with mild to moderate dehydration is oral rehydration therapy ort for children at risk of dehydration from vomiting taking a single dose of anti vomiting medication metoclopramide or ondansetron may be helpful and is useful in treating abdominal pain rehydration primary treatment of gastroenteritis in both children and adults is rehydration this is preferably achieved by drinking rehydration solution although intravenous delivery may be required if there is a decreased level of consciousness or if dehydration is severe drinking replacement therapy products made with complex carbohydrates i e those made from wheat or rice may be superior to those based on simple sugars drinks especially high in simple sugars such as soft drinks and fruit juices are not recommended in children under 5 years of age as they may increase diarrhea plain water may be used if more specific ort preparations are unavailable or person is not willing to drink them a nasogastric tube can be used in young children to administer fluids if warranted in those who require intravenous fluids one to four hours worth is often sufficient dietary it is recommended that breast fed infants continue to be nursed in usual fashion and that formula fed infants continue their formula immediately after rehydration with ort lactose free or lactose reduced formulas usually are not necessary children should continue their usual diet during episodes of diarrhea with exception that foods high in simple sugars should be avoided brat diet bananas rice applesauce toast and tea is no longer recommended as it contains insufficient nutrients and has no benefit over normal feeding some probiotics have been shown to be beneficial in reducing both duration of illness and frequency of stools they may also be useful in preventing and treating antibiotic associated diarrhea fermented milk products such as yogurt are similarly beneficial zinc supplementation appears to be effective in both treating and preventing diarrhea among children in developing world antiemetic medications may be helpful for treating vomiting in children ondansetron has some utility with a single dose being associated with less need for intravenous fluids fewer hospitalizations and decreased vomiting metoclopramide might also be helpful however use of ondansetron might possibly be linked to an increased rate of return to hospital in children intravenous preparation of ondansetron may be given orally if clinical judgment warrants while reducing vomiting does not appear to have a significant clinical benefit antibiotics antibiotics are not usually used for gastroenteritis although they are sometimes recommended if symptoms are particularly severe or if a susceptible bacterial cause is isolated or suspected if antibiotics are to be employed a macrolide such as azithromycin is preferred over a due to higher rates of resistance to latter colitis usually caused by antibiotic use is managed by discontinuing causative agent and treating it with either metronidazole or bacteria and protozoans that are amenable to treatment include shigella salmonella and giardia species in those with giardia species or entamoeba histolytica treatment is recommended and superior to metronidazole world health organization who recommends use of antibiotics in young children who have both bloody diarrhea and fever antimotility agents antimotility medication has a theoretical risk of causing complications and although clinical experience has shown this to be unlikely these drugs are discouraged in people with bloody diarrhea or diarrhea that is complicated by fever loperamide an opioid analogue is commonly used for symptomatic treatment of diarrhea loperamide is not recommended in children however as it may cross immature blood brain barrier and cause toxicity bismuth subsalicylate an insoluble complex of trivalent bismuth and salicylate can be used in mild to moderate cases but salicylate toxicity is theoretically possible epidemiology thumb upright 1 4 deaths due to diarrhoeal diseases per million persons in 2012 thumb upright 1 4 disability adjusted life year for diarrhea per 100 000 inhabitants in 2004 it is estimated that there were two billion cases of gastroenteritis that resulted in 1 3 million deaths globally in 2015 children and those in developing world are most commonly affected as of 2011 in those less than five there were about 1 7 billion cases resulting in 0 7 million deaths with most of these occurring in world s poorest nations more than 450 000 of these fatalities are due to rotavirus in children under 5 years of age cholera causes about three to five million cases of disease and kills approximately 100 000 people yearly in developing world children less than two years of age frequently get six or more infections a year that result in significant gastroenteritis it is less common in adults partly due to development of acquired immunity in 1980 gastroenteritis from all causes caused 4 6 million deaths in children with majority occurring in developing world death rates were reduced significantly to approximately 1 5 million deaths annually by year 2000 largely due to introduction and widespread use of oral rehydration therapy in us infections causing gastroenteritis are second most common infection after common cold and they result in between 200 and 375 million cases of acute diarrhea and approximately ten thousand deaths annually with 150 to 300 of these deaths in children less than five years of age history first usage of gastroenteritis was in 1825 before this time it was commonly known as typhoid fever or cholera morbus among others or less specifically as griping of guts surfeit flux colic bowel complaint or any one of a number of other archaic names for acute diarrhea rudy s list of archaic medical terms cholera morbus is a historical term that was used to refer to gastroenteritis rather than specifically cholera society and culture gastroenteritis is associated with many colloquial names including montezuma s revenge delhi belly la and back door sprint among others it has played a role in many military campaigns and is believed to be origin of term no guts no glory gastroenteritis is main reason for 3 7 million visits to physicians a year in united states and 3 million visits in france in united states gastroenteritis as a whole is believed to result in costs of us 23 billion per year with that due to rotavirus alone resulting in estimated costs of us 1 billion a year research there are a number of vaccines against gastroenteritis in development for example vaccines against shigella and escherichia coli are two of leading bacterial causes of gastroenteritis worldwide other animals many of same agents cause gastroenteritis in cats and dogs as in humans most common organisms are campylobacter clostridium difficile clostridium and salmonella a large number of toxic plants may also cause symptoms some agents are more specific to a certain species transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus occurs in pigs resulting in vomiting diarrhea and dehydration it is believed to be introduced to pigs by wild birds and there is no specific treatment available it is not transmissible to humans
