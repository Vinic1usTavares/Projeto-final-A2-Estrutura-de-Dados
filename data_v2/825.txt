in early 20th century lead composers such as edgard varese to explore use of noise based sonorities in an orchestral setting in same period italian futurist luigi russolo created a noise orchestra using instruments he called intonarumori later in 20th century term noise music came to refer to works consisting primarily of noise based sound in more general usage noise is any unwanted sound or signal in this sense even sounds that would be perceived as musically ordinary in another context become noise if they interfere with reception of a message desired by receiver attali 1985 27 prevention and reduction of unwanted sound from tape hiss to squeaking bass drum pedals is important in many musical pursuits but noise is also used creatively in many ways and in some way in nearly all genres definition of noise in conventional musical practices sounds that are considered unmusical tend to be treated as noise scholes 1970 10 686 oscillations and waves defines noise as irregular vibrations of an object in contrast to periodical patterned structure of music reddy badami balasubramanian 1994 206 more broadly electrical engineering professor bart kosko in introductory chapter of

disturbance in any signaling system kouvaras 2013 54 in regard to what is noise as opposed to music robert fink in origin of music a theory of universal development of music claims that while cultural theories view difference between noise and music as purely result of social forces habit and custom everywhere in history we see man making some selections of some sounds as noise certain other sounds as music and in overall development of all cultures this distinction is made around same sounds fink 1981 25 however musicologist jean jacques nattiez considers difference between noise and music nebulous explaining that border between music and noise is always culturally defined which implies that even within a single society this border does not always pass through same place in short there is rarely a consensus by all accounts there is no single and intercultural universal concept defining what music might be nattiez 1990 48 55 noise as a feature of music musical tones produced by human voice and all acoustical musical instruments incorporate noises in varying degrees most consonants in human speech e g sounds of f v s z both voiced and unvoiced th scottish and german ch are characterised by distinctive noises and even vowels are not entirely noise free wind instruments include whizzing or hissing sounds of air breaking against edges of mouthpiece while bowed instruments produce audible rubbing noises that contribute when instrument is poor or player unskilful to what is perceived as a poor tone when they are not excessive listeners make themselves deaf to these noises by ignoring them helmholtz 1885 67 68 unpitched percussion thumb maracas owe their distinctive tone to noise in their sound many unpitched percussion instruments such as snare drum or maracas make use of presence of random sounds or noise to produce a sound without any perceived pitch maconie 2005 84 hopkin 1996 2 92 see timbre unpitched percussion is typically used to maintain a rhythm or to provide accents and its sounds are unrelated to melody and harmony of music within orchestra unpitched percussion is termed auxiliary percussion and this subsection of percussion section includes all unpitched instruments of orchestra no matter how they are played for example pea whistle and siren traditional music antiquity although percussion instruments were generally rather unimportant in ancient greek music two exceptions were in dance music and ritual music of orgiastic cults former required instruments providing a sharply defined rhythm particularly clappers with a dry nonresonant sound and similar to finger cymbals cult rituals required more exciting noises such as those produced by drums cymbals jingles and bull which produced a demonic roaring noise particularly important to ceremonies of priests of cybele mathiesen 2001 west 1992 122 athenaeus deipnosophists xiv 38 quotes a passage from a now lost play semele by diogenes tragedian describing an all percussion accompaniment to some of these rites and now i hear turban wearing women votaries of th asiatic cybele wealthy phrygians daughters loudly sounding with drums and rhombs and brazen clashing cymbals their hands in concert striking on each other pour forth a wise and healing hymn to gods athenaeus 1854 3 1015 an altogether darker picture of function of this noise music is painted by livy in ab urbe condita xxxix 8 10 written in late first century bc he describes a greek of mean condition a low operator in sacrifices and a soothsayer a teacher of secret mysteries who imported to etruria and then to rome a dionysian cult which attracted a large following all manner of debaucheries were practised by this cult including rape and polynesia a tahitian traditional dance genre dating back to

bass drums multiple pairs of cymbals small kettledrums triangles tambourines and one or more turkish crescents blades 1996 265 europe through turkish ambassadorial visits and other contacts europeans gained a fascination with barbarous noisy sound of these bands and a number of european courts established turkish military ensembles in late 17th and early 18th centuries music played by these ensembles however were not authentically turkish music but rather compositions in prevalent european manner meyer 1974 484 85 general enthusiasm quickly spread to opera and concert orchestras where combination of bass drum cymbals tambourines and triangles were collectively referred to as turkish music best known examples include haydn s symphony no 100 which acquired its nickname military from its use of these instruments and three of beethoven s works alla marcia section from finale of his symphony no 9 an early sketch reads end of symphony with turkish music his wellington s victory or battle symphony with picturesque sound effects bass drums are designated as cannons side drums represent opposing troops of soldiers and ratchets sound of rifle fire and turkish march with expected

head hitting back of sounding board cymbals strips of brass striking lower strings and triangle and bells small metal objects struck by rods even when percussion instruments were not actually employed certain alla turca tricks were used to imitate these percussive effects examples include rondo alla turca from mozart s piano sonata k 331 and part of finale of his violin concerto k 219 meyer 1974 486 87 harpsichord piano and organ left thumb giuseppe verdi who used noise in form of a tone cluster in otello at about same time that turkish music was coming into vogue in europe a fashion for programmatic keyboard music opened way for introduction of another kind of noise in form of keyboard cluster played with fist flat of hand forearm or even an auxiliary object placed on keyboard on harpsichord and piano this device was found mainly in battle pieces where it was used to represent cannon fire earliest instance was by jean francois dandrieu in les caracteres de la guerre 1724 and for next hundred years it remained predominantly a french feature with examples by michel corrette la victoire d un combat naval remportee par une fregate contre plusieurs corsaires reunis 1780 claude benigne balbastre march des marseillois 1793 pierre antoine cesar la battaille de gemmap ou la prise de mons ca 1794 and jacques marie beauvarlet charpentier bataille d austerlitz 1805 in 1800 bernard viguerie introduced sound to chamber music in keyboard part of a piano trio titled la bataille de maringo piece militaire et historique henck 2004 32 50 last time this pianistic cannon effect was used before 20th century was in 1861 in a depiction of then recent battle of manassas in a piece by black american piano virtuoso blind tom bethune a piece that also feature vocalised sound effect noises gates and higginbotham 2004 85 clusters were also used on organ where they proved more versatile or their composers more imaginative their most frequent use on this instrument was to evoke sound of thunder but also to portray sounds of battle storms at sea earthquakes and biblical scenes such as fall of walls of jericho and visions of apocalypse noisy sound nevertheless remained a special sound effect and was not integrated into general texture of music earliest examples of organ thunder are from descriptions of improvisations by abbe vogler in last quarter of 18th century his example was soon imitated by justin heinrich knecht die durch ein 1794 michel corrette who employed a length of wood on pedal board and his elbow on lowest notes of keyboard during some improvisations and also in composed works by guillaume te deum judex 1786 sigismond a concert on a lake interrupted by a thunderstorm louis james alfred wely scene pastorale 1867 jacques vogt fantaisie pastorale et orage dans les alpes ca 1830 and jules blanc la procession 1859 henck 2004 41 45 most notable 19th composer to use such organ clusters was giuseppe verdi storm music which opens his opera otello 1887 includes an organ cluster c c d that is also longest notated duration of any scored musical texture henck 2004 56 kimbell 1991 606 bowed strings thumb heinrich ignaz franz biber introduced noises into string music for programmatic effects percussive effects in imitation of drumming had been introduced to bowed string instruments by early in 17th century earliest known use of col legno tapping on strings with back of bow is found in tobias hume s first part of ayres for unaccompanied viola da gamba 1605 in a piece titled harke harke walls 2001 ss2 xi carlo farina an italian violinist active in germany also used col legno to mimic sound of a drum in his capriccio stravagante for four stringed instruments 1627 where he also used devices such as glissando tremolo pizzicato and sul to imitate noises of barnyard animals cat dog chicken newman 1972 207 pyron and bianco 2001 later in century heinrich ignaz franz biber in certain movements of battalia 1673 added to these effects device of placing a sheet of paper under a string of double bass in order to imitate dry rattle of a snare drum and in die gesellschaft von humor from same programmatic battle piece superimposed eight different melodies in different keys producing in places dense orchestral clusters he also uses percussive snap of fortissimo pizzicato to represent gunshots arnold 1994 54 an important aspect of all of these examples of noise in european keyboard and string music before 19th century is that they are used as sound effects in programme music sounds that would likely cause offense in other musical contexts are made acceptable by their illustrative function over time their evocative effect was weakened as at same time they became incorporated more generally into abstract musical contexts arnold 1994 56 57 orchestras orchestras continued to use noise in form of a percussion section which expanded though 19th century berlioz was perhaps first composer to thoroughly investigate effects of different mallets on tone color of timpani hast cowdery and scott 1999 149 however before 20th century percussion instruments played a very small role in orchestral music and mostly served for punctuation to highlight passages or for novelty but by 1940s some composers were influenced by non western music as well as jazz and popular music and began incorporating marimbas xylophones bells gongs cymbals and drums vocal music in vocal music noisy nonsense syllables were used to imitate battle drums and cannon fire long before clement made these devices famous in his programmatic chanson la bataille battle in 1528 arnold 1994 53 unpitched or semi pitched performance was introduced to formal composition in 1897 by engelbert humperdinck in first version of his melodrama this style of performance is believed to have been used previously by singers of lieder and popular songs technique is best known however from somewhat later compositions by arnold schoenberg who introduced it for solo voices in his gurrelieder 1900 11 pierrot lunaire 1913 and opera moses und aron 1930 32 and for chorus in die hand 1910 13 later composers who have made prominent use of device include pierre boulez luciano berio benjamin britten in death in venice 1973 mauricio kagel and wolfgang in his opera jakob lenz 1977 78 amongst other works griffiths 2001 a well known example of this style of performance in popular music was rex harrison s portrayal of professor henry higgins in my fair lady kennedy 2006 another form of unpitched vocal music is speaking chorus prominently represented by ernst toch s 1930 geographical fugue an example of fashionable in germany at that time oechsler 2001 machine music left thumb 283x283px edgard varese who explored noise in an orchestral setting in 1920s a fashion emerged for composing what was called machine music depiction in music of sounds of factories locomotives steamships dynamos and other aspects of recent technology that both reflected modern urban life and appealed to then prevalent spirit of objectivity detachment and directness representative works in this style which features motoric and insistent rhythms a high level of dissonance and often

episode from his ballet steel 1926 27 and carlos chavez s ballet de vapor also titled hp horsepower 1926 32 this trend reached its apex in music of edgard varese who composed ionisation in 1931 a study in pure sonority and rhythm for an ensemble of thirty five unpitched percussion instruments machlis 1979 154 56 357 percussion ensembles following varese s example a number of other important works for percussion ensemble were composed in 1930s and 40s henry cowell s ostinato pianissimo 1934 combines latin american european and asian percussion instruments john cage s first construction in metal 1939 employs differently pitched thunder sheets brake drums gongs and a water gong carlos chavez s toccata for percussion instruments 1942 requires six performers to play a large number of european and latin american drums and other unpitched percussion together with a few tuned instruments such as xylophone tubular chimes and glockenspiel lou harrison in works such as canticles nos 1 and 3 1940 and 1942 song of 1941 suite for percussion 1942 and in collaboration with john cage double music 1941 explored use of found instruments such as brake drums and metal pipes in all of these

prepared piano use of noise was central to development of experimental music and avant garde music in mid 20th century noise was used in important new ways edgard varese challenged traditional conceptions of musical and non musical sound and instead incorporated noise based sonorities into his compositional work what he referred to as organised sound goldman 1961 varese stated that to stubbornly conditioned ears anything new in music has always been called noise and he posed question what is music but organized noises varese and chou 1966 18 in years immediately following first world war henry cowell composed a number of piano pieces featuring tone clusters and direct manipulation of piano s strings one of these titled banshee 1925 features sliding and shrieking sounds

colorful unpitched sounds from piano simms 1986 319 20 many variations such as prepared guitar have followed rhodes and westwood 2008 184 in 1952 cage wrote 4 33 in which there is no deliberate sound at all but only whatever background noise occurs during performance karlheinz stockhausen employed noise in vocal compositions such as 1962 64 69 in which four choirs clap their hands talk and shuffle their feet in order to mediate between instrumental and vocal sounds as well as to incorporate sounds normally made by audiences into those produced by performers simms 1986 374 robert ashley used

controlling modulation noise is used as basic tonal material in electronic music when pure frequency sine tones were first synthesised into complex timbres starting in 1953 combinations using relationships noises were used far more often than harmonic ones tones stockhausen 1963b 142 and 144 tones were seen as analogous to vowels and noises to consonants in human speech and because traditional music had emphasised tones almost exclusively composers of electronic music saw scope for exploration along continuum stretching from single pure sine tones to white noise densest superimposition of all audible frequencies that is from entirely periodic to entirely aperiodic sound phenomena in a process opposite to building up of sine tones into complexes white noise could be filtered to produce sounds with different bandwidths called coloured noises such as speech sounds represented in english by sh f s or ch an early example of an electronic composition composed entirely by filtering white noise in this way is henri pousseur s exchanges realised at studio di in milan in 1957 stockhausen 1963b 144 45 in 1980s electronic white noise machines became commercially available anon n d these are used alone to provide a pleasant background noise and to mask unpleasant noise a similar role to conventional background music heller 2003 197 this usage can have health

a higher volume bacon 1981 142 guitarists quickly discovered creative possibilities of using amplifier to modify sound particularly by extreme settings of tone and volume controls bacon 1981 119 distortion was at first produced by simply overloading amplifier to induce clipping resulting in a tone rich in harmonics and also in noise and also producing dynamic range compression and therefore sustain and sometimes destroying amplifier dave davies of kinks took this technique to its logical conclusion by feeding output from a 60 watt guitar amplifier directly into guitar input of a second amplifier piccola 2009 popularity of these techniques quickly resulted in development of electronic devices such as fuzz box to produce similar but more controlled effects and in greater variety distortion devices also developed into vocal enhancers effects units that electronically enhance a vocal performance including adding air noise or distortion or both maserati 2012 guitar distortion is

noise reduction thumb dolby noise reduction system hardware most often musicians are concerned not to produce noise but to minimise it noise reduction is of particular concern in sound recording this is accomplished by many techniques including use of low noise components and proprietary noise reducing technologies such as dolby dolby laboratories n d in both recording and in live musical sound reinforcement key to noise minimisation is headroom headroom can be used either to reduce distortion and audio feedback by keeping signal levels low amyes 1998 60 self 2011 417 or to reduce interference both from outside sources and from johnson nyquist noise produced in equipment by keeping signal levels high self 2011 411 29 510 11 most proprietary noise reducing technologies also introduce low levels of distortion noise minimisation therefore becomes a compromise between interference and distortion both in recording and in live music and between interference and feedback in live amplification work of bart kosko and sanya mitaim has also demonstrated that stochastic resonance can be used as a technique in noise minimisation and signal improvement in non linear dynamical systems as addition of noise to a signal can improve signal to noise ratio kosko mitaim 1998 2152 noise created by mobile phones has become a particular concern in live performances particularly those
