alid revolt of 762 763 or revolt of muhammad pure soul was an uprising by hasanid branch of alids against newly established abbasid caliphate led by brothers muhammad called pure soul and ibrahim rejected legitimacy of abbasid family s claim to power reacting to mounting persecution by abbasid regime in 762 they launched a rebellion with muhammad rising in revolt at medina in september and ibrahim following in basra in november lack of co ordination and organization as well as lukewarm support of their followers allowed abbasids under caliph al mansur to react swiftly caliph contained muhammad s rebellion in hejaz and crushed it only two weeks after ibrahim s uprising before turning his forces against latter ibrahim s rebellion had achieved some initial successes in southern iraq but his camp was riven by dissent among rival shi a groups as to prosecution of war and future political objectives in end ibrahim s army was decisively defeated at bakhamra in january 763 with ibrahim dying of his wounds shortly after failure of rebellion did not mark end of alid unrest but it consolidated power of abbasid dynasty background following death of muhammad in 632 a strong body of opinion within nascent muslim community antecedents of shi a held family of muhammad al muhammad to be only rightful leaders who would have divine guidance necessary to rule according to quran and bring justice these sentiments were fed by increasing discontent against umayyad dynasty which ruled caliphate from 661 until 750 initially they were expressed by a succession of failed risings most notably battle of karbala in 680 and uprising of zayd ibn ali in 740 in support of various alid claimants i e descendants of ali cousin and son in law of muhammad and fourth caliph r 656 661 whose death had marked rise of umayyad family to power iraq and kufa in particular became centres of pro alid support kennedy 2004 pp 123 1960 p 402 it was abbasids however and their supporters hashimiyya who launched revolution that overthrew umayyad regime abbasids claimed authority based on their membership in extended al muhammad through muhammad s uncle abbas ibn abd al unlike later shi a doctrine membership of family was not strictly limited to alids at that time but encompassed entire banu hashim abbasids were able to exploit weakening of alid cause after zayd s failure in 740 as well as widespread anti umayyad sentiment and lack of pro alid agitation among numerous arab settlers of khurasan to gain their backing and secure leadership of anti umayyad movement for themselves nevertheless in first stages of their uprising they were careful not to antagonize alids supporters and merely called for a chosen one from family of muhammad al rida min al muhammad to become new muslim leader cobb 2010 pp 261 hibri 2010 pp 269 2004 pp 123 127 following their takeover of caliphate abbasids tried to ensure alids acquiescence through honours and pensions however some alids remained opposed to abbasid rule going into hiding and once again trying to rouse discontented against new regime kennedy 2004 p 130 chief among them were muhammad ibn abdallah and his brother ibrahim both had been groomed by their father as leaders since their youth and some sources even claim that he had received bay ah oath of allegiance of hashimiyya leaders including future caliph al mansur r 754 775 in 744 before abbasid revolution el hibri 2010 p 1993 p vagleri 1971 pp 983 984 muhammad was often called pure soul al nafs al for his noble character but he was also a somewhat unworldly even romantic individual hugh n kennedy and apparently less capable or learned than his younger brother ibrahim buhl 1993 p 2004 p vagleri 1971 p 985 when abbasids took power two brothers refused to accept what they regarded as usurpation of their legitimate rights and went into hiding from there they continued their work of which reportedly brought them as far as sindh although mostly they stayed in arabia first abbasid caliph al saffah r 750 754 was content to mostly ignore their activities but his successor al mansur launched a manhunt against them in 758 al mansur arrested their brother abdallah when he refused to reveal their whereabouts followed in early 762 by their cousins and nephews captive alids were taken to kufa where they were mistreated so that many of them died veccia vagleri 1971 p 984 muhammad s revolt in medina as al mansur s persecution intensified pressure began to mount on brothers to react kufa traditional alid base was kept under close surveillance by abbasid government and two brothers resolved to launch a simultaneous rebellion in basra and medina although alids could count on a large network of sympathizers throughout caliphate action was rushed and lacked organization on 25 september 762 muhammad declared himself at medina catching abbasid governor ibn uthman by surprise rebellion was bloodless and muhammad quickly gained support of old muslim families of medina and mecca ansar but movement had been doomed from start despite medina s great symbolic value it had little strategic importance and error of using it as centre of a rebellion became apparent when abbasids immediately cut off grain supply from egypt that fed city al mansur himself was relieved at news of uprising in such a remote location remarking that at last he had enticed fox out of his hole al mansur left baghdad whose construction he was supervising for kufa from there he called upon muhammad to surrender promising an amnesty only fruit of this offer was an exchange of letters which are preserved though doubtlessly much embellished by al tabari in them muhammad reiterated his claim to leading muslims and stressed his descent from ali and fatimah muhammad s daughter as well as his typically shi a ideals of rejecting absolutist monarchical traditions of umayyads now adopted by abbasids in favour of returning to simpler practices of early islam al mansur countered by invoking pre islamic tradition of inheritance which gave priority to a man s male relatives over his daughters implying that caliphate had passed to abbasid line by right isa ibn musa caliph s nephew was sent against medina with 4 000 men but muhammad refused to abandon holy city and insisted on meeting abbasid attack there in meantime he imitated actions of muhammad like restoring famous ditch around city muhammad s supporters nevertheless began deserting him when isa appeared before city he waited a few days before ditch and repeatedly offered amnesty then his troops laid a few doors over ditch and entered medina where muhammad and his remaining 300 supporters fell fighting on 6 december 762 muhammad s corpse was beheaded and his head dispatched to caliph ibrahim s uprising in basra due to muhammad s rushed actions ibrahim failed to co ordinate his own uprising with his brother s and only declared himself two weeks before muhammad s death on 23 november ibrahim s revolt at first met with quick success securing control over ahwaz fars and wasit and his army register diwan was said to number 100 000 names when news of muhammad s death arrived rebels acclaimed ibrahim as his successor ibrahim now was faced with a choice a group of dedicated alid supporters which had managed to escape from kufa urged him to march on city while basrans preferred to stay in place and reach a negotiated settlement this dissension is indicative of disparate nature of ibrahim s supporters alid cause was fractured into several competing groups with different political objectives and ibrahim represented hasanid branch only refused to take part in an uprising while ibrahim quarrelled with zaydi branch on everything from political objectives and leadership to tactics to be followed or provisioning of their troops elsewhere support for uprising was cautious and most alid supporters adopted a wait and see attitude limiting themselves to verbal support or contributions of money el hibri 2010 pp 271 vagleri 1971 pp 984 985 al mansur in meantime used his time more effectively he mobilized troops in syria and iran and brought them to iraq and recalled isa ibn musa from medina to lead them finally ibrahim decided to march on kufa but on way he abandoned this plan and turned back instead of returning to basra however he encamped at bakhamra a location on road between two cities there on 21 january ibrahim with his troops reduced by defections to some 15 000 men confronted abbasid army under isa ibn musa isa s vanguard was at first beaten but battle ended in a crushing abbasid victory ibrahim himself was heavily wounded and escaped with a handful of supporters he died of his wounds on 14 february 763 signalling end of rebellion aftermath failure and brutal suppression of muhammad and ibrahim s revolt was followed by a large scale reprisal campaign against alids many of whom were imprisoned or killed until death of al mansur brought about another period of attempts at conciliation under al mahdi r 775 785 which ended after another alid uprising in 786 relationship of abbasids with alids remained troubled periods of repression usually following pro alid revolts were alternated with periods of relative tolerance although al ma mun r 813 833 at one point nominated an alid ali ibn musa al rida as his heir during fourth fitna this move was not followed up and under ma mun s successors two families became completely estranged of muhammad s sons and brothers many fled abbasid persecution to remoter corners of caliphate where they
