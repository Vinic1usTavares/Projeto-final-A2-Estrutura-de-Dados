2010 that 5 4 million copies of original light novels have been published reception to maria sama ga miteru anime series has been generally positive although anime news network ann noted that series leaves itself wide open to cynical sniggering carlos ross from them anime regarded it as one of most beautiful and graceful anime series adding that animation is sometimes of questionable quality but overall very appealing andrew shelton from amr found series to be fairly unique compared to other shojo works explaining that although story is a little basic and overly dramatic what is most important is response and actions of character on who story is focused stig hogset also from them anime commented that third season was criticized for being too short but he personally did not feel like it was lacking something jason thompson credits maria sama ga miteru with starting modern yuri trend newer anime titles that maria sama ga miteru is compared to include otome wa boku ni strawberry panic best student council and aria carlos ross writing about first novel in series felt story was a classic rags to riches tale but that it was also sweet touching and witty when it needs to be he criticized lack of teachers and schoolwork in series which led to plot being filled with extracurricular activities which are common to high school series he also criticized yumi s low self esteem a characteristic element of series is extensive use of french titles which carlos ross has criticized as distracting mania com criticized early anime episodes as being difficult and saying that first episode throws a lot of terms and names at you on other hand ross compared atmosphere presented by series artwork with those from other anime titles of similar setting including bright and vivid revolutionary girl utena another reviewer from them anime also compared maria sama ga miteru with e but noted that former is much less dramatic marc hairston commented on unusual character designs compared to other series and said they are ordinary students ann also noted clear expressive eyes and character designs that are gifted with an understated mobility praising casting choices and noting that even peripheral characters are fully realized holly ellingwood of active anime described relationships between characters as intensely platonic and pseudo gay for most part ann noted that second anime season tends to especially in last three episodes ann also describes second season as more embarrassing and shoujo ai oriented than first season but that solid characterization is still a strength of series holly ellingwood of active anime appreciated focus on characters other than yumi and sachiko for second season regarding shimako s loss of sei and befriending noriko as being one of more moving arcs of printemps ann regarded ova season as best of first three seasons citing improved production standards and less melodramatic storylines ann notes that fourth season is a return to dramatic form after relaxation of ova series but it is not as melodramatic as second season due to increased maturity of cast chris beveridge writing for mania com found it odd that yumi and sachiko did not spend so much time together in fourth season and felt that series needed an epilogue but enjoyed seeing yumi taking on some adult responsibilities andrew shelton has suggested that maria sama ga miteru s reduced capacity for epic drama is due to lack of malicious characters he considers series pure shojo mostly due to its character driven storyline japanese reviewers for their part regard story as a revival of class s genre and specifically a modern day equivalent of nobuko s hana monogatari hairston notes that maria sama ga miteru emphasizes romance and emotion over sexuality and it has a respectful treatment of its homoerotic themes he describes series as one of most interesting and touching anime series of last two years adding that it is about self discovery and self acceptance a pizza hut tie in campaign for fourth anime series started on january 7 2008 rose mansion from story was recreated in second life virtual world and opened on february 8 2008 references
