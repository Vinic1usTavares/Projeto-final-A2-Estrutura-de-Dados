of judah ben david hayyuj and led to a series of controversial exchanges with samuel ibn naghrillah that remained unresolved during their lifetimes his magnum opus kitab al anqih contained both first complete grammar for hebrew and a dictionary of classical hebrew and is considered most influential hebrew grammar for centuries and a foundational text in hebrew scholarship ibn janah is considered a very influential scholar in field of hebrew grammar his works and theories were popular and cited by hebrew scholars in europe and middle east name name in which he is known in hebrew jonah dove also

modern day spain and then capital of umayyad caliphate of cordoba between 985 and 990 he studied in nearby lucena his teachers there included isaac ibn gikatilla and isaac ibn mar saul his education included languages of arabic hebrew and aramaic exegesis of bible and quran as well as rabbinic literature ibn mar saul was a master of poetry and ibn janah attempted to write some hebrew poetry himself but was not very successful at it ibn gikatilla was an expert in both hebrew and arabic grammar and under his tutelage ibn janah became fluent in arabic familiar with arabic literature and acquired an easy and graceful arabic writing style arabic became his language of choice for most of his writings ibn janah also mentioned judah ben david hayyuj as one of his major influences but he was unlikely to have met him because hayyuj was active in cordoba and died before ibn janah returned there around 1012 he returned to cordoba where he studied and practiced medicine by this time al andalus or islamic iberia was in a period of instability and civil war known as fitna of al andalus cordoba was besieged and sacked by berber rebels who committed atrocities on its citizens including jews caliphate of cordoba soon disintegrated into small states known as taifas ibn janah and many other jews were forced to leave capital he moved to upper march region of al andalus and after a period of wandering there settled in zaragoza he had at least one son career in zaragoza he remained in zaragoza until end of his life where he practiced medicine and wrote books he wrote at least one medical book kitab al arabic for book of extract on formulae and measures of medical remedies which is now lost he became known as a successful physician often called by epithet physician and was mentioned by 13th century syrian physician ibn abi in his collection of biographies lives of physicians aside from his work in medicine he also worked on field of hebrew grammar and philology joining other scholars in zaragoza including solomon ibn kitab al mustalhaq ibn janah was deeply influenced by works of judah ben david hayyuj earlier hebrew grammarians such as menahem ben saruq and saadia gaon had believed that hebrew words could have letter roots of any length hayyuj argued that this was not case and hebrew roots are consistently triliteral in his work kitab al mustalhaq book of criticism also known as sefer in hebrew ibn janah strongly supported hayyuj s work but proposed some improvements among others he added 54 roots to hayyuj s 467 filled some gaps and clarified some ambiguities in his theories dispute with hayyuj s supporters in kitab al ibn janah praised hayyuj s works and acknowledged them as source for most of his knowledge on hebrew grammar he intended for this work to be uncontroversial and to be an extension to works of hayyuj whom he deeply admired however work caused offense among hayyuj s supporters they considered hayyuj greatest authority of all times worthy of taqlid or unquestioning conformity they were offended when ibn janah a relatively junior scholar at time leveled a criticism on their master and found his works incomplete one of disciples of hayyuj was samuel ibn naghrillah vizier of taifa of granada a muslim state which emerged in city after fall of cordoba ibn janah subsequently wrote brief risalat al letter of admonition which defended his views as well as risalat al wa l letter of approximation and facilitation which sought to clarify hayyuj s work for beginners while visiting his friend abu sulaiman ibn taraka he met a stranger from granada who enumerated various attacks on ibn janah s views ibn janah wrote kitab al a book of reprobation to counter arguments ibn then wrote al letters from friends attacking ibn janah who then responded by writing kitab al book of confusion further pamphlets were exchanged between two which were later of great benefit to hebrew grammarians pamphlets were in arabic and were never translated into hebrew debates were unresolved during their lifetimes many were lost but some were reprinted and translated into french kitab al anqih thumb upright a page from a copy of ibn janah s magnum opus kitab al translated to hebrew by judah ibn tibbon towards end of his life ibn janah wrote what is considered his magnum opus kitab al anqih book of minute research known in hebrew as sefer book is divided into two sections kitab al luma book of many colored flower beds or sefer which covered hebrew grammar and kitab al usul book of roots or sefer a dictionary of classical hebrew words arranged by root kitab al luma kitab al luma was first complete hebrew grammar ever produced during his time works of arabic grammar and quranic exegesis had a large influence among hebrew grammarians in this work ibn janah drew from arabic grammatical works of al and others both referencing them and directly copying from them book consisted of 54 chapters inspired by how arabic grammars were organized by using similarities between two semitic languages he adapted existing rules and theories of arabic language and used them for hebrew these introductions allowed bible to be analyzed by criteria similar to those used by quranic scholars of time ibn janah also introduced concept of lexical substitution in interpreting classical hebrew this concept in which meaning of a word in bible was substituted by a closely associated word proved to be controversial twelfth century biblical commentator abraham ibn ezra strongly opposed it and called it madness close to heresy kitab al usul kitab al usul dictionary was arranged into 22 chapters one for each letter of hebrew alphabet dictionary included more than 2 000 roots nearly all of them triliteral less than five percent of roots have more than three letters and they were added as appendix in each chapter definitions for words were derived from talmud tanakh or other classical jewish works as well as similar arabic and aramaic words this approach was controversial and new in hebrew scholarship ibn janah defended his method by pointing to precedents in talmud as well as previous works by jewish writers in babylonia and north africa which all used examples from other languages to define hebrew words legacy ibn janah died in approximately 1055 his works quickly became popular among hebrew scholars in spain they were initially inaccessible in other parts of europe which did not read arabic however in late twelfth century spanish jewish scholars in italy and southern france spread ibn janah s work there and to rest of europe ibn janah s main work kitab al anqih was translated into hebrew by judah ben saul ibn tibbon in 1214 this translation as well as others spread ibn janah s methods and fame outside arabic speaking jews he was subsequently cited by hebrew scholars and exegetes in iberian peninsula middle east and southern france in 1875 kitab al usul was published in english as book of hebrew roots and a second printing with some corrections occurred in 1968 it was republished in hebrew in 1876 his work research and methodology are considered deeply important encyclopedia of jews in islamic world ejiw describes him as one of best known most influential closely followed and highly praised scholars of hebrew professor of judaic studies michael l writes that kitab al anqih is fundamental to study of hebrew grammar sephardic studies professor zion zohar calls it most influential hebrew grammar for centuries and an example of where medieval judeo arabic literary culture reached its apogee writer david tene s on kitab al luna calling it first complete description of biblical hebrew and no similar work comparable in scope depth and precision was written until modern times it was high point of linguistic thought in all medieval grammatical history ejiw described kitab al usul as basis of all other medieval hebrew dictionaries jewish encyclopedia however notes serious gaps in kitab al because it does not discuss vowels and accents and because it omits explaining hayyuj s works on which it is based on encyclopaedia britannica calls him perhaps most important
