b hydroxy b methylbutyric acid hmb otherwise known as its conjugate base is a naturally produced substance in humans that is used as a dietary supplement and as an ingredient in certain medical foods that are intended to promote wound healing and provide nutritional support for people with muscle wasting due to cancer or hiv aids in healthy adults supplementation with hmb has been shown to increase exercise induced gains in muscle size muscle strength and lean body mass reduce skeletal muscle damage from exercise improve aerobic exercise performance and expedite recovery from exercise medical reviews and meta analyses indicate that hmb supplementation also helps to preserve or increase lean body mass and muscle strength in individuals experiencing age related muscle loss hmb produces these effects in part by stimulating production of proteins and inhibiting breakdown of proteins in muscle tissue no adverse effects from long term use as a dietary supplement in adults have been found hmb is sold as a dietary supplement at a cost of about per month when taking 3 grams per day hmb is also contained in several nutritional products including certain formulations of ensure juven and myoplex hmb is also present in insignificant quantities in certain foods such as alfalfa asparagus avocados cauliflower grapefruit and catfish effects of hmb on human skeletal muscle were first discovered by steven l nissen at iowa state university in hmb has not been banned by national collegiate athletic association world anti doping agency or any other prominent national or international athletic organization in 2006 only about 2 of college student athletes in united states used hmb as a dietary supplement as of 2017 hmb has found widespread use as an ergogenic supplement among young athletes uses available forms hmb is sold as an over counter dietary supplement in free acid form b hydroxy b methylbutyric acid hmb fa and as a monohydrated calcium salt of conjugate base calcium monohydrate hmb ca since only a small fraction of hmb s metabolic precursor is metabolized into hmb pharmacologically active concentrations of compound in blood plasma and muscle can only be achieved by supplementing hmb directly a healthy adult produces approximately 0 3 grams per day while supplemental hmb is usually taken in doses of grams per day hmb is sold at a cost of about per month when taken in doses of 3 grams per day hmb is also contained in several nutritional products and medical foods marketed by abbott laboratories e g certain formulations of ensure juven and myoplex and is present in insignificant quantities in certain foods such as alfalfa asparagus avocados cauliflower grapefruit and catfish medical supplemental hmb has been used in clinical trials as a treatment for preserving lean body mass in muscle wasting conditions particularly sarcopenia and has been studied in clinical trials as an adjunct therapy in conjunction with resistance exercise based upon two medical reviews and a meta analysis of seven randomized controlled trials hmb supplementation can preserve or increase lean muscle mass and muscle strength in older adults hmb does not appear to significantly affect fat mass in older adults preliminary clinical evidence suggests that hmb supplementation may also prevent muscle atrophy during bed rest a growing body of evidence supports efficacy of hmb in nutritional support for reducing or even reversing loss of muscle mass muscle function and muscle strength that occurs in disease states such as cancer cachexia consequently authors of two 2016 reviews of clinical evidence recommended that prevention and treatment of sarcopenia and muscle wasting in general include supplementation with hmb regular resistance exercise and consumption of a high protein diet clinical trials that used hmb for treatment of muscle wasting have involved administration of 3 grams of hmb per day under different dosing regimens according to one review an optimal dosing regimen is to administer it in one 1 gram dose three times a day since this ensures elevated plasma concentrations of hmb throughout day however best dosing regimen for muscle wasting conditions is still being investigated some branded products that contain hmb i e certain formulations of ensure and juven are medical foods that are intended to be used to provide nutritional support under care of a doctor in individuals with muscle wasting due to hiv aids or cancer to promote wound healing following surgery or injury or when otherwise recommended by a medical professional juven a nutrition product which contains 3 grams of 14 grams of arginine and 14 grams of glutamine per two servings has been shown to improve lean body mass during clinical trials in individuals with aids and cancer but not rheumatoid cachexia further research involving treatment of cancer cachexia with juven over a period of several months is required to adequately determine treatment efficacy enhancing performance thumb right 290px a commercially available formulation of hmb each size 000 gelatin capsule contains 1 gram of and an unspecified amount of microcrystalline cellulose and magnesium stearate alt an image of a commercially available hmb supplement with an appropriate exercise program dietary supplementation with 3 grams of hmb per day has been shown to increase exercise induced gains in muscle size muscle strength and power and lean body mass reduce exercise induced skeletal muscle damage and expedite recovery from high intensity exercise based upon limited clinical research hmb supplementation may also improve aerobic exercise performance and increase gains in aerobic fitness when combined with high intensity interval training these effects of hmb are more pronounced in untrained individuals and athletes who perform high intensity resistance or aerobic exercise in resistance trained populations effects of hmb on muscle strength and lean body mass are limited hmb affects muscle size strength mass power and recovery in part by stimulating muscle protein synthesis and inhibiting muscle protein breakdown through various mechanisms including activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 mtorc1 and inhibition of proteasome mediated proteolysis in skeletal muscles efficacy of hmb supplementation for reducing skeletal muscle damage from prolonged or high intensity exercise is affected by time that it is used relative to exercise greatest reduction in skeletal muscle damage from a single bout of exercise has been shown to occur when is ingested hours prior to exercise or is ingested minutes prior to exercise in 2006 only about 2 of college student athletes in united states used hmb as a dietary supplement as of 2017 hmb has found widespread use as an ergogenic supplement among athletes hmb has not been banned by national collegiate athletic association world anti doping agency or any other prominent national or international athletic organization side effects safety profile of hmb in adult humans is based upon evidence from clinical trials in humans and animal studies in humans no adverse effects in young adults or older adults have been reported when hmb is taken in doses of 3 grams per day for up to a year studies on young adults taking 6 grams of hmb per day for up to 2 months have also reported no adverse effects studies with supplemental hmb on young growing rats and livestock have reported no adverse effects based upon clinical chemistry or observable characteristics for humans younger than 18 there is limited data on safety of supplemental hmb human equivalent dose of hmb for no observed adverse effect level that was identified in a rat model is approximately 0 4 g kg of body weight per day two animal studies have examined effects of hmb supplementation in pregnant pigs on offspring and reported no adverse effects on fetus no clinical testing with supplemental hmb has been conducted on pregnant women and pregnant and lactating women are advised not to take hmb by metabolic technologies inc company that grants licenses to include hmb in dietary supplements due to a lack of safety studies pharmacology pharmacodynamics several components of signaling cascade that mediates hmb induced increase in human skeletal muscle protein synthesis have been identified in vivo similar to hmb s metabolic precursor hmb has been shown to increase protein synthesis in human skeletal muscle via phosphorylation of mechanistic target of rapamycin mtor and subsequent activation of which leads to protein biosynthesis in cellular ribosomes via phosphorylation of mtorc1 s immediate targets i e kinase and translation repressor protein supplementation with hmb in several non human animal species has been shown to increase serum concentration of growth hormone and insulin like growth factor 1 igf 1 via an unknown mechanism in turn promoting protein synthesis through increased mtor phosphorylation based upon limited clinical evidence in humans supplemental hmb appears to increase secretion of growth hormone and igf 1 in response to resistance exercise signaling cascade that mediates hmb induced reduction in muscle protein breakdown has not been identified in living humans although it is well established that it attenuates proteolysis in humans in vivo unlike hmb attenuates muscle protein breakdown in an insulin independent manner in humans hmb is believed to reduce muscle protein breakdown in humans by inhibiting 19s and 20s subunits of ubiquitin proteasome system in skeletal muscle and by inhibiting apoptosis of skeletal muscle nuclei via unidentified mechanisms based upon animal studies hmb appears to be metabolized within skeletal muscle into cholesterol which may then be incorporated into muscle cell membrane thereby enhancing membrane integrity and function effects of hmb on muscle protein metabolism may help stabilize muscle cell structure one review suggested that observed hmb induced reduction in plasma concentration of muscle damage biomarkers i e muscle enzymes such as creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase in humans following intense exercise may be due to a cholesterol mediated improvement in muscle cell membrane function hmb has been shown to stimulate proliferation differentiation and fusion of human myosatellite cells in vitro which potentially increases regenerative capacity of skeletal muscle by increasing protein expression of certain regulatory factors e g and and gene transcription factors e g hmb induced human myosatellite cell proliferation in vitro is mediated through phosphorylation of activated protein kinases and hmb induced human myosatellite differentiation and accelerated fusion of myosatellite cells into muscle tissue in vitro is mediated through phosphorylation of akt a serine threonine specific protein kinase pharmacokinetics thumb this graph shows plasma concentration of hmb in units of micromoles per liter of blood plasma over time following ingestion of a 1 gram dose of calcium or free acid form of hmb alt graphic of hmb plasma concentration over time free acid and monohydrated calcium salt forms of hmb have different pharmacokinetics hmb fa is more readily absorbed into bloodstream and has a longer elimination half life 3 hours relative to hmb ca 2 5 hours tissue uptake and utilization of hmb fa is higher than for hmb ca fraction of an ingested dose that is excreted in urine does not differ between two forms after ingestion is converted to following dissociation of calcium moiety in gut when hmb ca dosage form is ingested magnitude and time at which peak plasma concentration of hmb occurs depends on dose and concurrent food intake higher hmb ca doses increase rate of absorption resulting in a peak plasma hmb level that is disproportionately greater than expected of a linear dose response relationship and which occurs sooner relative to lower doses consumption of hmb ca with sugary substances slows rate of hmb absorption resulting in a lower peak plasma hmb level that occurs later hmb is eliminated via kidneys with roughly of an ingested dose being excreted unchanged in urine remaining of dose is retained in tissues or excreted as hmb metabolites fraction of a given dose of hmb that is excreted unchanged in urine increases with dose metabolism metabolism of hmb is catalyzed by an uncharacterized enzyme which converts it to hmb coa is metabolized by either enoyl coa hydratase or another uncharacterized enzyme producing b methylcrotonyl coa or coa respectively is then converted by enzyme methylcrotonyl coa carboxylase to methylglutaconyl coa which is subsequently converted to by methylglutaconyl coa hydratase is then cleaved into and acetoacetate by lyase or used in production of cholesterol via pathway biosynthesis hmb is synthesized in human body through metabolism of a branched chain amino acid in healthy individuals approximately 60 of dietary is metabolized after several hours with roughly 5 range of dietary being converted to around 40 of dietary is converted to which is subsequently used in synthesis of other compounds vast majority of metabolism is initially catalyzed by branched chain amino acid aminotransferase enzyme producing a kic figure 8 57 metabolism of leucine a kic is mostly metabolized by mitochondrial enzyme branched chain dehydrogenase which converts it to isovaleryl coa isovaleryl coa is subsequently metabolized by isovaleryl coa dehydrogenase and converted to which is used in synthesis of acetyl coa and other compounds during biotin deficiency hmb can be synthesized from via enoyl coa hydratase and an unknown enzyme which convert into and into hmb respectively a relatively small amount of a kic is metabolized in liver by cytosolic enzyme 4 dioxygenase kic dioxygenase which converts a kic to hmb in healthy individuals this minor pathway which involves conversion of to a kic and then hmb is predominant route of hmb synthesis chemistry acid is a b hydroxy acid and natural product with molecular formula at room temperature pure acid occurs as a transparent colorless to light yellow liquid which is soluble in water acid is a weak acid with a pka of 4 4 its refractive index is 1 42 chemical structure acid is a member of carboxylic acid family of organic compounds it is a structural analog of butyric acid with a hydroxyl functional group and a methyl substituent located on its beta carbon by extension other structural analogs include acid and acid synthesis a variety of synthetic routes to acid have been developed first reported chemical syntheses approached hmb by oxidation of alkene vicinal diol and alcohol precursors in 1877 russian chemists michael and alexander zaytsev reported preparation of hmb by oxidation of 2 methylpent 4 en 2 ol with chromic acid earliest citation for synthesis of b hydroxy b methylbutyric acid in chemical database as of september 2016 is in 1880 and 1889 and respectively reported that oxidative cleavage of vicinal diol 4 methylpentane 1 2 4 triol with acidified potassium permanganate kmno4 yields hmb this result is closest related to first synthesis as cold dilute kmno4 oxidises alkenes to vicinal cis diols which hot acid kmno4 further oxidises to carbonyl containing compounds and diol intermediate is not obtained when hot acidic conditions are used for alkene oxidation in other words racemic 4 methylpentane 1 2 4 triol is a derivative of 2 methylpent 4 en 2 ol and b hydroxy b methylbutyric acid is a derivative of both and in 1892 reported preparation of hmb by permanganate oxidation of 3 1 3 diol abstracted by 600px center thumb alt graphic of first synthetic routes to b hydroxy b methylbutyric acid first synthetic routes to acid depending on experimental conditions cycloaddition of acetone and ketene produces either or 4 4 2 one both of which hydrolyze under basic conditions to yield conjugate base of hmb reaction provides another pathway to hmb involving exhaustive halogenation of methyl ketone region of diacetone alcohol with sodium or sodium hypochlorite diacetone alcohol is readily available from aldol condensation of acetone an organometallic approach to hmb involves carboxylation of tert butyl alcohol with carbon monoxide and fenton s reagent hydrogen peroxide and ferrous iron alternatively hmb can be prepared through microbial oxidation of acid by fungus 700px center thumb alt graphic of later synthetic routes to b hydroxy b methylbutyric

by leopold ruzicka earliest reported isolation of hmb as a human metabolite was by tanaka and coworkers in 1968 from a patient with acidemia effects of hmb on human skeletal muscle were first discovered by steven l nissen at iowa state university in nissen founded a company called metabolic technologies inc mti around time of his discovery which later acquired six hmb related patents that company has used to license right to manufacture and incorporate hmb into dietary supplements granted patents include and when it first became available commercially in late 1990s hmb was marketed solely as an exercise supplement to help athletes and bodybuilders build muscle mti subsequently developed two hmb containing products juven and revigor to which abbott nutrition obtained market
