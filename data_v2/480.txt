lollapalooza festival in 2011 reception of not afraid was mixed to positive jon dolan of rolling stone praised song s tone over a dark operatic beat eminem delivers rhymes that are typically acrobatic and typically heavy handed but anger has a gathering quality dolan also praised song s inspirational theme henry adaso of about com gave a positive review on song noting boi 1da s bouncy charm and lyrics from a master poet as good aspects of song and noted no negative aspects in adaso s guide review he praised boi 1da s production and eminem s affecting lyrics he considered former s work shimmering and eminem s sensitive lyrics entwine on this knocker overall he gave song four and a half stars out of a possible five after song s release allhiphop called it an anthem in nature and rebellious to core in her review of recovery jody rosen of rolling stone noted that even if eminem reaching his late 30s is becoming a grumpy middle aged man at least he s owning it winston robbins of music website consequence of sound called not afraid one of songs on recovery with catchy hooks choruses and beats multiplied by endless pool of wit and anger that eminem possesses in his album review thomas nassiff wrote on behalf of absolutepunk he noted song for being radio friendly and that it doesn t sacrifice anything to be friendly to masses andy gill of independent said that this is where only completely commendable sentiment on entire album comes and called it a proud rehab anthem in his review for recovery benjamin meadows ingram of spin magazine called not afraid a stadium ready lead single he went on to say finally eminem addresses his personal and professional failings head on rather than hiding behind a joke or inside a nightmare it s a necessary first step in moving on song also faced mixed and negative reviews after not afraid leaked onto internet on april 29 2010 simon vozick levinson of entertainment weekly magazine commented on song noting both positive and negative characteristics he first complimented eminem s change of lyrical theme calling it anthemic in nature and noting its inspirational and powerful message he compared song s theme to eminem s 2002 single sing for moment and his 2009 single beautiful vozick levinson called eminem s rapping wild but was dismissive of production saying track behind not afraid has same tinny repetitive wannabe epic quality that s annoyed me on boi 1da productions like forever mayer nissem of british site digital spy gave song three stars out of a possible five and wrote a mixed review reviewer first commented thank heavens marshall mathers iii has opted against his usual trick of cobbling together a hook and some satire via two year old back issues of inquirer to trail it however nissem criticized other aspects of song saying that eminem s decision to chronicle feels a little worthy and more than a touch dull he felt that eminem s previous songs never bored listener unlike not afraid jeff weiss of los angeles times commented that not afraid was an improvement from lead singles of encore 2004 and relapse just lose it and we made you respectively giving for a more serious and inspirational theme however weiss misses comic nature of eminem s classic singles such as my name is instead he felt that song was composed of vague self help bromides and a bombastic but nondescript beat from boi 1da when discussing chorus weiss commented that it doesn t make for very engaging listening finally he discussed possible influences by american rapper t i but overall he named it a disappointing lead single john ulmer of website one thirty bpm gave song seven points out of a possible ten and published a mixed review he praised it for being a more serious track compared to previous lead singles just lose it 2004 and we made you 2009 but criticized it for being less powerful compared to his 2002 hit single lose yourself and beautiful according to ulmer upon first listen it s a bit corny but it s appropriately anthemic and not bad enough to deter from strength of overall track he noted that although eminem does not have as much of a frustrated voice as he does in despicable he admits that relapse was a silly album pitchfork media s jayson greene wrote a rather negative review on recovery and was very dismissive on song eminem spends nearly half of recovery insisting he s best rapper alive but for first time in his career he actually sounds clumsy kitty empire of newspaper guardian also wrote negatively on song in her album review criticizing song s lyrics rhyming through a storm with whatever weather cold or warm in chorus is unforgivable for a master as part of his album review greg kot of daily newspaper chicago tribune criticized eminem s
