lagrivea is a fossil genus of squirrel from middle miocene of france single species l vireti is known from three mandibles lower jaws and two isolated teeth all come from fissure filling a fossil deposit formed when a rock fissure filled with sediment of la grive l5 part of la grive saint alban complex in saint alban de roche southeastern france lagrivea was a large tree squirrel with flat lower incisors and a large triangular fourth lower premolar p4 each of four cheekteeth p4 and three molars m1 through m3 bears a deep basin in middle of crown m3 is about rectangular in shape but rounded at back although m1 and m2 have two roots m3 has three taxonomy pierre mein and leonard ginsburg described lagrivea vireti in 2002 in a review of ages and faunas of miocene fossil sites of la grive saint alban in southeastern france mein and ginsburg 2002 p 29 they suggested that it was probably a tree squirrel and related to mein and ginsburg 2002 p 30 lagrivea belongs to squirrel family sciuridae which first appears in late eocene of north america and early oligocene of europe mckenna and bell 1997 p 121 specific name vireti honors jean viret for his work on mammals of la grive saint

one holotype with fourth premolar p4 and all three molars m1 3 preserved one with incisor and m2 and one with incisor p4 m1 and m2 an isolated lower incisor and an isolated m2 it was large for a squirrel and can be distinguished from fossil squirrels palaeosciurus aliveria and ratufa obtusidens by its larger size in mandible diastema gap between incisors and cheekteeth premolars and molars is relatively deep mental foramen an opening in bone is located relatively high and before p4 upper and lower masseteric ridges which are located on outer side of jaw and anchor some of chewing muscles meet at m1 surfaces of incisor are very flat but there are small irregular striations in enamel along length of tooth cheekteeth increase regularly in size from front to back they all consist of a large central basin surrounded by cusps and crests mein and ginsburg 2002 fig 43 basins are deeper than in palaeosciurus and ratufa obtusidens and lack crenulations in enamel which distinguishes them from another fossil squirrel albanensia first cheekteeth p4 is large and about triangular in form short and quite broad at back mein and ginsburg 2002 pp 29 30 two cusps at front protoconid and metaconid are isolated from each other in front of metaconid there is a small cuspule an anteroconid at lingual side of tooth side of tongue central basin of tooth is relatively deep at back of tooth entoconid cusp is connected to posterolophid a crest that forms back margin of two roots one at front is round and one at back is broad although m1 is nearly rectangular width at front is still smaller than width at back there is a strong anteroconid a crest metalophid reaches from protoconid nearly to metaconid a small cusp is connected to metaconid in front of it unlike in miopetaurista and aliveria there are two broad roots next tooth m2 is similar to m1 in most respects but width at front is virtually equal to width at back so that tooth is about rectangular back of m3 is rounded but tooth is still nearly rectangular there is a long anteroconid which is mainly connected to metaconid there is no metalophid this tooth has three roots two at front and a larger one at back range and context remains of lagrivea were probably collected by viret at site la grive l5 in village of saint alban de roche department of isere southeastern france mein and ginsburg 2002 pp 7 29 la grive

locality for mn zone mn 7 8 about 13 to 11 million years ago steininger 1999 fig 1 2 la grive l5 is one of younger sites of la grive and mein and ginsburg proposed placing it in a separate zone mn 8 mein and ginsburg 2002 p 37 other squirrels at la grive saint alban include species of heteroxerus spermophilinus palaeosciurus and chipmunks and flying squirrels in genera albanensia miopetaurista and mein and ginsburg 2002 p 35 miopetaurista spermophilinus and heteroxerus are also known from la grive l5 mein and ginsburg 2002 table 9 in 2012 ginsburg and mein described an indeterminate squirrel from older mn 6 site of sansan france on basis of a single p4 this tooth is similar in size to lagrivea but differs in a narrower talonid ginsburg and mein 2012 p 93 references literature
