tropical storm bret was second named storm of 2011 atlantic hurricane season bret formed along southwestern periphery of a weather front north of bahamas on july 17 at first storm moved little and gradually strengthened in response to favorable upper level conditions reaching peak sustained winds of 70 mph 110 km h steering currents in area subsequently became better established and bret turned toward northeast only to encounter a substantial increase in vertical wind shear despite shear storm maintained a well defined wind circulation for several days with intermittent bursts of thunderstorms near its center by july 22 bret had been devoid of strong thunderstorm activity for several hours prompting national hurricane center to discontinue public advisories when it was located about 375 miles 605 km north of bermuda since bret remained over open atlantic for most of its existence its effects on land were limited while moving little storm produced inclement weather and widespread cloudiness over much of north central bahamas squalls off eastern coast of florida generated rough seas along coastlines injuring a number of people although it stayed well offshore storm enhanced tropical moisture over bermuda causing beneficial rainfall in dry areas meteorological history in mid july 2011 a broad upper trough dropped southward over northwest atlantic supporting a cold front that extended westward across bermuda to inland over georgia front produced a large area of light showers to its north with its westernmost component remaining quasi stationary over northeastern florida on july 16 a surface low developed along decaying boundary just off coast generating an area of sporadic convection north of bahamas although a wind circulation was initially absent and surface pressures were relatively high low later became better organized under abating shear conditions at 2100 utc on july 17 national hurricane center nhc declared it a tropical depression after reconnaissance confirmed presence of a closed circulation center about 100 mi 160 km northwest of great abaco island it strengthened into tropical storm bret just three hours later owing to a quick increase in winds and deep central convection situated along a weakness in subtropical ridge bret drifted very slowly southward during initial stages of its existence though traces of dry air approached it from west cyclone continued to strengthen as prominent bands of deep thunderstorms tightened around it eastern semicircle satellite images displayed a disorganized eye like feature on july 18 suggesting a rather sharp increase in strength indeed an additional reconnaissance flight into cyclone found peak surface winds of around 70 mph 110 km h just below hurricane strength following its peak bret began to accelerate toward northeast in response to building high pressure in area it fluctuated little in intensity for several hours although a combination of high wind shear and a lack of tropical moisture inhibited further development by july 19 circulation center had become exposed and devoid of deep convection and storm weakened to 50 mph 85 km h winds upon moving through increasingly hostile environment despite unfavorable conditions bret retained this intensity for next couple of days as it briefly slowed with a distinct low level circulation and a few patches of persistent thunderstorms over its southwestern quadrant early on july 20 heavily sheared cyclone began to within deepening southwesterly wind flow over next day bret continued to deteriorate in organization however a brief decline in upper winds allowed intermittent bursts of convection to redevelop south of exposed center bret eventually weakened to a tropical depression over cool ocean temperatures early on july 22 once again lacking significant convection while increasing in forward speed forecasters at nhc noted that bret remained a maverick tropical cyclone by refusing to dissipate despite experiencing very hostile wind shear conditions with ship data indications of prevailing strong winds by 1500 utc however circulation had become ill defined prompting nhc to declassify bret as a tropical system about 375 mi 605 km north of bermuda during next several hours remnant low of bret continued to move northeastward out into atlantic until it dissipated on july 23 preparations and impact bahamas thumb right remnants of bret passing to north of bermuda on july 22 upon formation of a depression government of bahamas issued a tropical storm watch for northwestern islands of nation it was upgraded to a tropical storm warning on july 18 when storm showed signs of intensification further south a severe weather warning was in effect for new providence and andros island and authorities urged small craft operators to secure their vessels warnings were discontinued later that day as bret turned away from territory since it initially moved little bret brought prolonged overcast conditions to much of northern bahamas with most of activity over abaco islands and grand bahama an estimated 3 in 75 mm of precipitation fell in abaco over weekend of july 16 17 in addition a weather station on island reported gale force gusting of up to 48 mph 77 km h at height of storm rain led to cancellation of a local little league baseball match outer rainbands spawned a waterspout that touched down on eastern paradise island accompanied by lightning strikes and torrents nevertheless locals considered storm s impact to be generally positive as its rains aided in alleviating mild drought conditions across nation united states and bermuda off coast of florida storm generated rough sea conditions with waves of up to 5 ft 1 9 m high surf lightly injured several swimmers and surfers in brevard county strong rip currents swept dozens of people out to sea but all remained unharmed and were quickly rescued additionally waves washed ashore venomous jellyfish that stung more than 200 people near coastal beaches scattered funnel clouds and waterspouts were reported overseas though phenomena dissipated soon thereafter without affecting land onshore bret s effects were minimal weak morning showers and breezy winds briefly brushed brevard and volusia counties as storm lifted out of area it drew in a large mass of dry air limiting chances of much needed rain to subdue a large wildfire in swamp light showers from precursor front skirted bermuda prior to tropical development with 24 hour precipitation totals of no more than 0 87 in 22 mm recorded on territory moisture brought on by storm from afar enhanced rainfall that ended months of dry conditions in bermuda 1 75 in 45 mm of precipitation fell at l f wade international airport on july 18 with an additional 1 6 in 40 mm recorded next day although rains proved to be mostly beneficial minor flooding affected some local businesses in poor drainage areas see also other storms of same name
