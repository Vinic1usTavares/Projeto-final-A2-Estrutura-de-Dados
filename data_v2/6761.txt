caledonian lapita pottery in addition some researchers have claimed there is evidence of new caledonian human habitation dating from 3000 bc predating lapita culture by 1500 years while others claim to have found pre lapita pottery at fourth lapita conference held in june 2000 in canberra australia question was posed is lapita kanak or is lapita oldest and first ancestor of a later culture that is labelled kanak still another problem in determining origin and early history of kanak people is that archaeological interpretation is in conflict with views of kanak people which have become politicized subsequent to colonial rule early colonial rule earliest history of europeans arriving on these islands is when captain cook of united kingdom landed in these islands in 1775 at a time when there were reportedly 70 000 kanaks living in archipelago cook gave name new caledonia to these islands after caledonia his scottish highlands fifty years later protestants of london missionary society came to new caledonia which was followed by entry of french catholics to island in 1843 this resulted in a conflict between two religious factions and eventually french catholics control of

kanaks were forced to move to reserve areas of island closer to mountains they occupied only 10 per cent of area of their ancestral territories given that their population had declined so dramatically due to disease and their living conditions became very hard this situation arose consequent to induction of 20 000 convicts by french government between 1864 and 1897 most of whom settled permanently in country and who were employed to extract nickel beginning with 1864 and copper from 1875 onwards this caused serious resentment among kanaks who revolted in 1878 against french colonial rule which was suppressed by french who were better armed kanak leader was decapitated and his head was put on display in museum of natural history after world war ii after world war ii kanak independence movement again picked up momentum when united nations placed new caledonia on its decolonisation list of non self governing territories in 1946 a major progression occurred when kanaks and french settlers in country obtained voting rights in 1951 shortly before it became an overseas territory of france in 1956 kanaks were then also allowed to move out of their reserve areas this was followed by establishment of territorial assembly in 1957 but this was short lived charles de gaulle abolished it after he became president of france in 1958 agitation for independence in 1981 movement for

melanesian spearhead group pacific forum and nonaligned countries movement were successful in getting un resolution 41 41 a of 2 december 1986 passed it re inscribed new caledonia on decolonisation list of non self governing territories but this resolution did not mitigate violence as what ensued was more confrontations with authorities ouvea cave hostage taking resulted in 21 deaths including 19 kanaks following battle there was an international outcry that resulted in initiation of talks for settlement between french government kanaks and french settlers matignon accord an agreement
