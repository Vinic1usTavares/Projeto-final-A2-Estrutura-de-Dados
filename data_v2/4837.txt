from one of few formed in countryside was composed of local maids core of women s guards were radical women who wanted to create a more egalitarian society and improve status of women women cut their hair short and wore unconventional clothing often rejecting skirts and dresses in favour of trousers worn only by men at time their rejection of traditional values earned enmity of finnish whites
