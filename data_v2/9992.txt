its release in 1973 american graffiti was extremely successful both with critics and at box office shortly after its release roger greenspun described film and its editing american graffiti exists not so much in its individual stories as in its orchestration of many stories its sense of time and place although it is full of material of fashionable nostalgia it never exploits nostalgia in its feeling for movement and music and vitality of night and even in its vision in white it is oddly closer to some early fellini than to recent american past of say last picture show or summer of 42

an academy award about as famous overnight as an editor ever gets he then quoted fields as saying that steven told me it was because i had cut first picture that was a monumental success in which you can really see editing and people discovered that it was a woman who edited jaws editing of jaws has been intensely studied for over thirty years bordwell illustrates wipe by cut using scene in jaws of brody who is fearful of a second shark attack anxiously surveying waters crowded with swimmers bordwell attributes name wipe by cut to verna fields lecture transcript posted at website of berlinale talent campus in film editor susan korda s 2005 lecture we ll fix it in edit at berlinale talent campus she broadly explained contribution of editing to film what is fascinating in jaws is that shark has a personality shark has an intelligence indeed sometimes i think shark has a sense of humor morbid as it might be and that was all achieved in first two acts of film before you see shark so cutting was very essential for that david bordwell has used second shark attack scene in jaws as literally a textbook illustration of an editing innovation that occurred in late 1960s innovation which fields herself named wipe by cut can be used when a character is filmed from a distance using a telephoto lens cut to a different framing of character occurs during interruption by a figure who passes between camera and character cut thus masks itself and avoids drawing viewer s attention away from narrative of scene critic david edelstein s affectionate comments on jaws and its editing are also a good indication of film s lasting influence 30 years after its release on a 2012 listing of 75 best edited films of all time that was compiled by motion picture editors guild jaws was listed eighth management for universal studios shortly after completion of jaws in 1975 fields was hired by universal as an executive consultant some insight into universal s reasons for hiring her can be gleaned from fact that during filming of jaws in addition to her editing fields had been omnipresent at spielberg s beck and call by means of a walkie talkie often she would shuttle back and forth on her bike between producers in town and spielberg at dock for last minute decisions producers of jaws were david brown and richard d zanuck along with brown zanuck and peter benchley book s author fields helped
