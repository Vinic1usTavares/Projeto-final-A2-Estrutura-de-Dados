european robin erithacus rubecula known simply as robin or robin redbreast in british isles is a small insectivorous passerine bird specifically a chat that was formerly classified as a member of thrush family turdidae but is now considered to be an old world flycatcher about 12 5 14 0 cm 5 0 5 5 inches in length male and female are similar in colouration with an orange breast and face lined with grey brown upper parts and a whitish belly it is found across europe east to western siberia and south to north africa it is sedentary in most of its range except far north term robin is also applied to some birds in other families with red or orange breasts these include american robin turdus migratorius which is a thrush and australasian robins of family petroicidae relationships of which are unclear taxonomy and systematics thumb left a robin perching on a fence european robin was described by carl linnaeus in 1758 in 10th edition of his systema naturae under binomial name motacilla rubecula its specific epithet rubecula is a diminutive derived from latin red genus erithacus was introduced by french naturalist georges cuvier in 1800 giving bird its current binomial name e rubecula year is given on title page as viii in french republican calendar genus name erithacus is from ancient greek and refers to an unknown bird now usually identified as robin genus previously included japanese robin and ryukyu robin these east asian species were shown in molecular phylogenetic studies to be more similar to a group of other asian species than to european robin in a reorganisation of genera japanese and ryukyu robins were moved to resurrected genus leaving european robin as sole member of erithacus phylogenetic analysis placed erithacus in subfamily which otherwise contained only african species but its exact position with respect to other genera was not resolved distinctive orange breast of both sexes contributed to european robin s original name of redbreast orange as name of a colour was unknown in english until 16th century by which time fruit of that name had been introduced in 15th century when it became popular to give human names to familiar species bird came to be known as robin redbreast which was eventually shortened to robin as a given name robin is originally a diminutive of robert other older english names for bird include ruddock and robinet in american literature of late 19th century this robin was frequently called english robin dutch french german italian and spanish all refer to distinctively coloured front robin belongs to a group of mainly insectivorous birds that have been variously assigned to thrushes or flycatchers depending on how these groups were perceived taxonomically eventually flycatcher thrush assemblage was re analysed and genus erithacus assigned to a group of thrush like true flycatchers tribe that also includes common nightingale and old world chats subspecies right thumb adult in toulouse france in its large continental eurasian range robins vary somewhat but do not form discrete populations that might be considered subspecies robin subspecies are mainly distinguished by forming resident populations on islands and in mountainous areas robin found in british isles and much of western europe erithacus rubecula melophilus occurs as a vagrant in adjacent regions e r from northwestern africa corsica and sardinia closely resembles melophilus but for a shorter wing length northeasternmost birds large and fairly washed out in colour are e r in southeast of its range e r valens of crimean peninsula e r caucasicus of caucasus and n transcaucasia and e r hyrcanus southeastwards into iran are generally accepted as significantly distinct on madeira and azores local population has been described as e r and although not distinct in morphology its isolation seems to suggest subspecies is valid but see below canary islands robin right 200px thumb gran canaria s robin call thumb left adult and juvenile of gran canaria robin most distinct birds are those of gran canaria e r marionae and tenerife e r superbus which may be considered two distinct species or at least two different subspecies it is readily distinguished by a white eye ring an intensely coloured breast and a grey line that separates orange red from brown colouration its belly is entirely white cytochrome b sequence data and vocalisations indicate that gran canaria tenerife robins are indeed very distinct and probably derived from colonisation by mainland birds some 2 million years ago although dietzen et al 2003 conclude that both tenerife and gran canaria populations are independently derived from mainland populations and should constitute two species or all be placed in e rubecula as subspecies their data does not allow for a definite conclusion alternative explanation that tenerife was colonised by already distinct gran canaria robins has not been explored and proposed model relies only on probabilistic inference likewise seemingly exact molecular dating is doubtful as it assumes a molecular clock that may or may not be correct and of course assumption that ancestor of all robins was similar in colouration to superbus and not continental birds is being inferred from their model of colonisation entirely conjectural christian dietzen hans hinrich witt and michael wink published in 2003 in avian science a study called phylogeographic differentiation of european robin erithacus rubecula on canary islands revealed by mitochondrial dna sequence data and morphometrics evidence for a new robin taxon on gran canaria in it they concluded that gran canaria s robin diverged genetically from their european relatives as far back as 2 3 million years while tenerife ones took another half a million years to make this leap 1 8 million years ago most likely reason would be a different colonization of canaries by this bird which arrived at oldest island first gran canaria and subsequently passed to neighboring island tenerife cesar javier palacios en gran canaria de una de unica en el mundo newspaper canarias 7 2006 accessed february 24 2015 a thorough comparison between marionae and superbus is pending to confirm that first one is effectively a different subspecies initial results suggest that birds from gran canaria have wings about 10 shorter than those on tenerife west canary islands populations are younger middle pleistocene and only beginning to diverge genetically robins from western canary islands el hierro la palma and la gomera e r are similar to european type subspecies e r rubecula finally robins which can be found in fuerteventura are european ones which is not surprising as species does not breed either in this island or in nearby lanzarote they are wintering birds or just passing through during their long migrations between africa and europe other robins larger american robin turdus migratorius is named for its similarity to european robin but two birds are not closely related similarity lies largely in orange chest patch in both species this american species was incorrectly shown feathering its nest in london in film mary poppins but it only occurs in uk as a very rare vagrant some south and middle american turdus thrushes are also named as robins such as rufous collared thrush australian robin redbreast more correctly scarlet robin petroica multicolor is more closely related to crows and jays than it is to european robin it belongs to family petroicidae commonly called australasian robins red billed leiothrix leiothrix lutea is sometimes named pekin robin by aviculturalists another group of old world flycatchers this time from africa and asia is genus its members are known as magpie

a wingspan of 20 22 cm 8 9 in male and female bear similar plumage an orange breast and face more strongly coloured in otherwise similar british subspecies e r melophilus lined by a bluish grey on sides of neck and chest upperparts are brownish or olive tinged in british birds and belly whitish while legs and feet are brown bill and eyes are black juveniles are a spotted brown and white in colouration with patches of orange gradually appearing distribution and habitat robin occurs in eurasia east to western siberia south to algeria and on atlantic islands as far west as azores and madeira it is a vagrant in iceland in south east it reaches caucasus range irish and british robins are largely resident but a small minority usually female migrate to southern europe during winter a few as far as spain scandinavian and russian robins migrate to britain and western europe to escape harsher winters these migrants can be recognised by greyer tone of upper parts of their bodies and duller orange breast european robin prefers spruce woods in northern europe contrasting with its preference for parks and gardens in ireland and britain in southern iberia habitat segregation of resident and migrant robins occurs with resident robins remaining in same woodlands where they bred attempts to introduce european robin into australia and new zealand in latter part of 19th century were unsuccessful birds were released around melbourne auckland christchurch wellington and dunedin by various local acclimatisation societies with none becoming established there was a similar outcome in north america as birds failed to establish after being released in long island new york in 1852 oregon in 1889 1892 and peninsula in british columbia in 1908 1910 behaviour and ecology thumb gardener s friend looking out for food on ground thumb feeding from a hand thumb robin with prey in roe valley country park limavady robin is diurnal although has been reported to be active hunting insects on moonlit nights or near artificial light at night well known to british and irish gardeners it is relatively unafraid of people and drawn to human activities involving digging of soil in order to look out for earthworms and other food freshly turned up indeed robin is considered to be a gardener s friend and for various folklore reasons robin would never be harmed in continental europe on other hand robins were hunted and killed as with most other small birds and are more wary robins also approach large wild animals such as wild boar and other animals which disturb ground to look for any food that might be brought to surface in autumn and winter robins will supplement their usual diet of terrestrial invertebrates such as spiders worms and insects with berries and fruit they will also eat seed mixtures placed on bird tables male robins are noted for their highly aggressive territorial behaviour they will fiercely attack other males and competitors that stray into their territories and have been observed attacking other small birds without apparent provocation there are instances of robins attacking themselves having seen their own reflection territorial disputes sometimes lead to fatalities accounting for up to 10 of adult robin deaths in some areas because of high mortality in first year of life a robin has an average life expectancy of 1 1 years however once past its first year it can expect to live longer and one robin has been recorded as reaching 19 years of age a spell of very low temperatures in winter may also result in significant mortality this species is parasitised by moorhen flea dasypsyllus gallinulae and breeding robins may choose a wide variety of sites for building a nest in fact anything which can offer some shelter like a depression or hole may be considered as well as usual crevices or sheltered banks other objects include pieces of machinery barbecues bicycle handlebars bristles on upturned brooms discarded kettles watering cans flower pots and even hats nest is composed of moss leaves and grass with fine grass hair and feathers for lining two or three clutches of five or six eggs are laid throughout breeding season which commences in march in britain and ireland eggs are a cream buff or white speckled or blotched with reddish brown colour often more heavily so at larger end when juvenile birds fly from nests they are mottled brown in colour all over after two to three months out of nest juvenile bird grows some orange feathers under its chin and over a similar period this patch gradually extends to complete adult appearance vocalisations left 200px thumb song 1 left 200px thumb song 2 left 200px thumb ticking calls thumb right singing near ireland robin produces a fluting warbling during breeding season both male and female sing during winter when they hold separate territories song then sounding more plaintive than summer version female robin moves a short distance from summer nesting territory to a nearby area that is more suitable for winter feeding male robin keeps same territory throughout year during breeding season male robins usually initiate their morning song an hour before civil sunrise and usually terminate their daily singing around thirty minutes after sunset nocturnal singing can also occur especially in urban areas that are artificially lit during night under artificial light nocturnal singing can be used by urban robins to actively shunt daytime anthropogenic noise a variety of calls is also made at any time of year including a ticking note indicating anxiety or mild alarm magnetoreception avian magnetic compass of robin has been extensively researched and uses vision based magnetoreception in which robin s ability to sense magnetic field of earth for navigation is affected by light entering bird s eye physical mechanism of robin s magnetic sense is not fully understood but may involve quantum entanglement of electron spins cultural depictions upright thumb left redbreast engraving by benjamin fawcett 1853 robin features prominently in british folklore and that of northwestern france but much less so in other parts of europe ingersoll p 167 it was held to be a storm cloud bird and sacred to thor god of thunder in norse mythology robins feature in traditional children s tale babes in wood birds cover dead bodies of children more recently robin has become strongly associated with christmas taking a starring role on many christmas cards since mid 19th century robin has appeared on many christmas postage stamps an old british folk tale seeks to explain robin s distinctive breast legend has it that when jesus was dying on cross robin then simply brown in colour flew to his side and sang into his ear in order to comfort him in his pain blood from his wounds stained robin s breast and thereafter all robins got mark of christ s blood upon them an alternative legend has it that its breast was scorched fetching water for souls in purgatory association with christmas more probably arises from fact that postmen in victorian britain wore red jackets and were nicknamed robins robin featured on christmas card is an emblem of postman delivering card in 1960s in a vote publicised by times robin was adopted as unofficial national bird of uk in 2015 robin was again voted britain s national bird in a poll organised by birdwatcher david lindo taking 34 of final vote several english and welsh sports organisations are nicknamed robins nickname is typically used for teams whose home colours predominantly use red these include professional football clubs bristol city crewe alexandra swindon town cheltenham town with bristol city as of 2019 swindon town and cheltenham town also incorporating a robin image in their current badge designs and traditionally wrexham fc as well as english rugby league team hull kingston rovers whose home colours are white with a red band
