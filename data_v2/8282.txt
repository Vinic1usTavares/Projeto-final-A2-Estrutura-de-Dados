number of other young medical men starting in 1840 he was a player with new york base ball club this team began play five years earlier than new york knickerbockers who are credited in several baseball histories as pioneering modern version of baseball adams played an early form of game but thorn writes that he understood it to be baseball no matter what it was called thumb upright

contest which knickerbockers lost 23 1 batting second in knickerbockers lineup he made one out and did not score a run knickerbockers did not play any known games against other clubs from 1847 to 1850 during these years team split its players into two squads which played against each other twice per week according to adams he often attempted to compel members of knickerbockers to attend sessions he was only occasionally successful and when few knickerbockers came they played variants of baseball that required fewer players than regular games twice in june 1851 club played against washington base ball club winning by scores of 21 11 and 22 20 no individual statistics are available for first game adams scored twice for knickerbockers in second in 1853 adams played in two games against gotham

game lasted 12 innings before being suspended due to darkness with score tied 12 12 both teams fell short of 21 runs that were required to win a game under rules of time following two november games against eagle base ball club that adams is not known to have participated in he returned to knickerbockers lineup for a june 1 1855 game against gotham and scored three times although gotham prevailed

opponents in 1856 as it won once lost twice and had one tie he scored ten times and records for two games showed that his defensive position was shortstop knickerbockers had a 2 2 win loss record in competitive games during 1857 that adams participated in playing three times at shortstop and once at first base defensively he contributed 12 runs offensively including a six run effort in knickerbockers 37 23 victory over empire club on june 24 in 1858 adams made four appearances for knickerbockers against outside opposition and scored nine runs but team went 1 3 in games he varied his defensive positioning between second base third base and shortstop playing style thumb right adams has been credited as creator of shortstop position highlighted alt a diagram of a baseball field and defensive positions with shortstop highlighted on left side of infield as a player adams created concept of shortstop position according to thorn and baseball hall of fame researcher freddy in first five years knickerbockers played team fielded anywhere from eight to eleven players only infielders were players covering each of bases if there were more than eight players extra outfielders were sometimes used outfielders had difficulty throwing baseballs into infield because of balls light weight adams shortstop position at which he started playing in about 1849 or 1850 was used to field throws from outfielders and throw to three infielders with advent of higher quality baseballs adams moved toward infield since distance balls could travel increased prior to invention of shortstop large gaps existed in defensive positioning of infields defensive players tended to stand by bases leaving empty space in between them for batters shortstop filled one of two gaps adams hit left handed he said that his batted balls occasionally went into a river by elysian fields ground in hoboken new jersey where knickerbockers practiced and played adams had a long on field career with knickerbockers he remained a player with team until 1859 he did not limit his play to shortstop he fielded at every position except pitcher little is known about relative performance of early baseball players and game was largely recreational as opposed to competitive thorn speculates that adams may have been best player of 1840s citing his lengthy playing career as evidence equipment maker and umpire in addition to playing game adams was involved in production of early baseball equipment he personally manufactured baseballs for a period of time supplying many new york city based clubs adams found that when ball was more tightly stitched it traveled further when batted or thrown according to author peter morris adams ball manufacturing efforts helped to keep knickerbockers in operation during their first few years as they would otherwise have had difficulty finding balls in later years adams gathered rubber from old galoshes for insides of baseballs a tanner then used horsehide to create balls as late as 1863 adams was one of three most prominent makers of baseballs in new york continuing to produce them by hand adams also played a role in producing baseball bats choosing which wood to use and overseeing manufacturing process adams also worked occasionally as an umpire in significant games one notable example was final contest of a three game series between all star teams from brooklyn and new york city held on september 10 1858 in long island during game which new york city all stars won 29 18 adams became first umpire to use a new rule allowing for a strike to be called against a batter who did not swing at a pitch in strike zone previously strikes were only called when a batter swung at a pitch and missed three batters were ruled out on strikes called by adams in game otherwise called strike rule was not applied often in its first few years of existence knickerbockers and nabbp executive thumb left adams standing in middle of a group of new york

and 1849 he was leader of a committee to revive constitution and by laws of baseball in 1848 adams was not chosen as an officer in 1851 but next year was named one of club s three treasurers he was elected to same position following two years number of baseball teams in new york city area started to grow during early 1850s as washington base ball club also known as gotham ball club and eagle base ball club were founded or reorganized eagle base ball club desiring a unified set of rules sent a message to knickerbockers requesting that a committee be formed adams was one of three knickerbockers members selected to be on committee and clubs agreed on a set of rules which were presented at knickerbockers meeting on april 1 1854 at same meeting adams was voted into position of club director after again being named a director in 1855 adams became president of knickerbockers for fourth time winning an election held at club s april 5 1856 meeting he remained team s president in 1857 and after not being named as an officer next three years was elected president in 1861 during his time as club s president knickerbockers organization was emulated by newly formed teams and adams himself was considered a respected figure by members of other clubs according to author andrew j schiff adams was among most powerful baseball figures of era concurrently adams maintained his new york city medical practice number of players and game length thumb upright duncan curry and adams were on opposite sides of knickerbockers debates on roster size and game length alt duncan curry in a suit and bow tie a supporter of nine man baseball teams adams favored a measure in 1856 which allowed for players from outside knickerbockers to join their intrasquad games when 17 or fewer team members appeared no rules existed at time regarding team size but official games between clubs were typically played with nine men per club proposal was defeated by a 13 11 vote in favor of a rule forbidding non club members to play if there were 14 players seven per team a two man committee was created with aim of working with eagle and washington clubs to resolve debate over how many players to field in official games duncan f curry and william f ladd were chosen as committee members but ladd withdrew and adams was named as a substitute his partner on committee curry had led opposition to nine man teams adams and curry also differed on another issue length of games at time a baseball game lasted until one of teams had 21 runs that team was awarded victory a change in how games were won was deemed necessary after suspended game in 1854 adams favored nine inning games while curry wanted contests to last seven innings a convention was scheduled for early 1857 and adams joined a three man committee tasked with encouraging local clubs to send delegates at convention which consisted of one session each in january and february adams was voted president knickerbockers had voted among themselves to back seven inning games but other teams backed a motion for nine inning contests which passed these changes were incorporated in laws of base ball written by adams he authored initial draft of regulations with what new york times richard sandomir called an upright script and strong hand laws included regulations governing bat and ball sizes and a ban on betting by players and umpires fellow knickerbocker william h grenelle copied adams work onto blue pages and modifications and notations were made as convention progressed among other changes part of rule adams had written on game length was crossed out number nine was replaced with seven before motion that settled issue was introduced in march knickerbockers changed their rules to match those passed at convention in may 1857 adams presided over a player convention where nine inning games were officially made part of rules of baseball for participating teams distance between bases and campaign against bound rule in march 1858 national association of base ball players nabbp was formed at another convention adams was one of knickerbockers two delegates having been selected at a february meeting attended by representatives from 25 clubs he held chairmanship of association s rules and regulations committee and drafted new organization s initial set of rules these included a clarification of prescribed distance between bases which under knickerbocker rules had been set at forty two paces between home plate and second base and forty two paces equidistant between first and third base historians differ on whether bases were roughly apart or a shorter distance thorn has written that pace itself may have been an imprecise and variable measure to gauge distances by stepping off and adams described rule as rather vague at 1857 convention it was decided that bases would be securely fastened upon four corners of a square whose sides are roughly thirty yards as rules committee chairman for new nabbp adams made baselines from one base to another distance seen in modern baseball he ruled on distance between home plate and pitcher s mound as well making them apart in addition committee mandated that clubs have nine players per side which became norm it also created called strike rule in an effort to reduce pitch totals and time required to play games adams campaigned for a further change in rules of baseball involving when outs were recorded at time an out was allowed when ball was caught by a fielder after one bounce this was known as bound rule adams supported a ban on such outs calling his preferred rule fly game under style of play he backed when a fly ball was hit a fielder would have to catch ball before it touched ground for an out to be made this was similar to rules on catches in cricket and would serve to increase level of skill required from fielders knickerbockers had enacted a rule mandating fly catch by 1857 knickerbockers attempted to introduce fly rule more widely at 1857 convention with a proposal that permitted continued use of bound rule for foul balls despite widespread support from sportswriters proposed rule change was voted down writer william hershberger said that decision showed limits of knickerbockers influence and divisions within baseball fraternity rule change was proposed to nabbp annually by adams but did not pass at 1858 nabbp convention a vote on eliminating bound rule was unsuccessful opponents raised concerns that proposal would dramatically lengthen game times despite his support for fly rule in 1858 adams successfully motioned for nabbp regulations including outs on bounces to apply to knickerbockers he did so because he was reluctant to oppose rules of nabbp shortly after his motion he organized a knickerbockers meeting to discuss fly rule and obtain a reconsideration of newly passed resolution at meeting knickerbockers decided to exclude outs on bounces from their practice games and contests against teams that supported fly rule in future years club remained an advocate of eliminating bound rule but adams continued efforts were rejected a split in rules and regulations committee caused it to avoid supporting fly game at nabbp s 1859 convention and votes at 1860 and 1861 conventions maintained bound rule adams final comments about regulation at an nabbp convention indicated that he believed it would soon be modified bound rule started losing support by 1863 after adams left knickerbockers and outs on bounced balls were outlawed in 1864 retirement in addition to his other roles adams regularly served as a delegate on behalf of knickerbockers at nabbp s annual meetings he remained with knickerbockers in an executive role until march 26 1862 when he retired having served 12 years overall in various non playing capacities upon leaving his position club named him an honorary member he received a scroll from knickerbockers which referred to him as nestor of ball players alluding to a mythical king known for offering advice adams also resigned from his role as rules committee chairman of nabbp later life adams and cornelia cook married in 1861 and remained together until adams death couple had five children first a son named charles died less than a month after his birth in 1864 others two sons frank and roger and two daughters catharine and mary were born between 1866 and 1874 adams continued to maintain his medical practice during his baseball career but was forced to abandon it in 1865 after he began suffering health issues after relocating to ridgefield connecticut he went on to become one of leading citizens of connecticut village according to author william j ryczek adams served as a republican legislator in connecticut house of representatives for town in 1870 site does not support direct linking search for adams under last name to find results he contributed to creation of ridgefield land improvement association and to a committee overseeing construction of a town house in 1871 he accepted a job with ridgefield savings bank later renamed fairfield county bank as company s first president after working there until 1879 adams took a break from his duties during this time he helped found ridgefield s library and served as its treasurer in 1884 he returned to ridgefield national bank and remained president there until mid 1886 adams and his family relocated to a house in new haven connecticut in 1888 along with baseball playing music was among adams favorite activities occasionally he and henry ward beecher performed flute duets although no longer actively involved in baseball adams was still a follower of sport he played in an exhibition as late as 1875 and stories exist that he played recreationally into following decade late in his life he said of growth of baseball we pioneers never expected to see game so universal as it has now become adams contracted pneumonia following a bout of influenza and died on january 3 1899 at age of 84 he was buried at new haven s evergreen cemetery legacy thumb right media reports that abner doubleday invented baseball led to a story on adams appearing in new york times in 1980 alt abner doubleday wearing an army jacket for decades after adams death his role in codifying baseball s early rules was largely unremembered thorn included adams among a group of powerfully influential figures from period also including louis f wadsworth and wheaton who he writes went unrecognized in their lifetimes and became mysteries to future generations alexander cartwright was more widely recognized as a pioneering figure for sport baseball hall of fame has claimed that cartwright was inventor of 90 foot 27 m baselines and nine inning game however by time conventions led by adams had enacted those rules in late 1850s cartwright had traveled to california and was no longer a member of knickerbockers adams is said to have avoided campaigning for credit for rules changes after he left knickerbockers researcher gary o maxfield said of him that he didn t like to brag several of rules approved at conventions survived to modern baseball including 90 foot 27 m baseline distance 45 foot 14 m distance from home plate to pitching mound however did not last through 19th century it was pushed back in 1880 shortstop position which for adams was located between infielders and outfielders was later played in infield between second and third base dickey pearce was first player to field in that area and his ability to prevent base hits in formerly unoccupied territory convinced other teams to employ similar tactics hartford courant points to 1980 as a year when adams started to gain greater attention for his achievements a share of new york mets was purchased by a publishing company led by nelson doubleday jr that year and claims that abner doubleday invented baseball in 1839 which are considered flawed by modern researchers were reported by media after doubleday reports in 1980 new york times received a letter from great great grandson of adams that courant said attempted to try to set record straight newspaper ran letter in its april 13 issue and added a 1939 piece by roger adams in 1993 thorn published research on adams contributions in encyclopedia total baseball new york times published an article on adams on september 23 2015 various historians have given adams recognition as an important figure from early years of baseball thorn has written that he may be counted as first among fathers of baseball o maxfield said of adams without him we wouldn t have game we know and love as baseball today father label was rejected by ryczek he wrote that adams did not conceive sport but called him a collaborator in its development on july 31 2014 society for american baseball research announced that it had chosen adams as its 2014 overlooked 19th century baseball legend eric has called him worthy of induction into baseball hall of fame for his role as a pioneer he says of adams should he be in hall of fame absolutely you ask anyone who knows about 19th century baseball they ll laugh at cartwright abner doubleday they won t even talk about but they all know doc adams he was glue that held things together in early part of baseball adams did not appear on a baseball hall of fame ballot until 2016 when he was up for consideration on hall s pre integration era committee ballot ten of 16 committee members supported him two fewer than number needed for induction while adams contributions had received notice from historians associated press writer andrew dalton called such reports somewhat speculative in nature before 2016 that year 1857 laws of base ball authored by adams were sold at an auction documents were included in a batch of historical papers that brought 12 000 in a 1999 sale adams authorship of papers was unknown at time but was confirmed after owner brought documents to attention of an auction house in
