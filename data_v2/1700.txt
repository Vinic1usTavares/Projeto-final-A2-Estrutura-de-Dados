evacuated from area but bomb squad were unable to defuse bomb in time more than 200 people were injured but there were no fatalities despite strength of bomb which has been largely credited to fast response of emergency services in evacuating city centre before bomb could explode at time england was hosting euro 96 football championships and a russia vs germany match was scheduled to take place in manchester following day although manchester had been targeted by ira before it had not been subjected to an attack on this scale in february 1996 ira had ended its seventeen month ceasefire with a large truck bomb attack on london s canary wharf financial district though 3 300 pound bomb of manchester was three times size of canary wharf bomb manchester bombing was condemned by british and irish governments and u s president bill clinton five days after blast ira issued a statement from dublin in which it claimed responsibility but regretted causing injury to civilians several buildings near explosion were damaged beyond repair and had to be demolished while many more were closed for months for structural repairs most of rebuilding work was completed by end of 1999 at a cost of ps1 2 billion although redevelopment continued until 2005 perpetrators of attack have not been caught and greater manchester police have conceded it is unlikely that anyone will be charged in connection

instincts to give sinn fein a chance to show that they could persuade ira to reinstate ceasefire president of united states bill clinton stated he was deeply outraged by bomb explosion and joined bruton and major in utterly condemning this brutal and cowardly act of terrorism sinn fein president gerry adams stated that he was shocked and saddened by bombing he insisted that his party was committed to achieving a peace settlement and argued it is sheer folly to return to old agenda of excluding sinn fein and seeking to isolate republicans on 20 june 1996 ira claimed responsibility for bombing and stated that it sincerely regretted causing injury to civilians ira statement continued bombing came five days after beginning of peace talks in belfast and represented ira s opposition to

return to war if we want to we can still put off a huge bomb in your cities and devastate them and therefore you have to deal with us in an effort to allay fears that manchester s considerable irish community might be subjected to reprisal attacks councillors richard leese and martin pagel leader and deputy leader of manchester city council respectively made a public visit to irish world heritage

assistant chief constable and a senior officer from royal ulster constabulary ruc it was decided for reasons never made public not to present findings of investigation to crown prosecution service cps body responsible for undertaking criminal prosecutions in england three may have felt that as ira suspects were already in police custody they were no longer a threat or that to pursue case against

reporter for manchester evening news leaked classified special branch documents naming those suspected of bombing documents also revealed that man suspected of organising attack had visited manchester

in a letter to a local mp that advice given to cps by an independent lawyer was that there was not a case to answer on evidence available a judge would stop case attorney general further wrote that decision not to prosecute was not influenced by government newspaper also identified six men arrested in london on 15 july as having planned attack by july 2000 all six had been released under terms of 1998 belfast agreement as of 2019 panter and mutch are only people to have been arrested in connection with bombing mutch was tried for misconduct in a public office during an 11 day trial held in

private investment graham stringer leader of manchester city council later admitted that after 1987 general election result there was no get out of jail card we had gambled on labour winning general

arndale centre exterior of which was widely unloved from rest of city centre a large building nearby now redeveloped as printworks and formerly occupied by daily mirror newspaper had been unoccupied since 1987 many locals therefore considered that bomb was best thing that ever happened to manchester as it cleared way for redevelopment of dysfunctional city centre a view also expressed in 2007 by terry rooney mp for bradford north leader of liberal democrat opposition on manchester city council simon ashley responded that i take exception to his rooney s comments about ira bomb no one who was in city on that day who lost their jobs or was scared witless or injured by blast would say bomb was best thing to happen to manchester sir gerald kaufman mp for manchester gorton stated that bomb provided opportunity for redeveloping manchester city centre although it was not fully exploited bomb was obviously bad but from a redevelopment point of view it was a lost opportunity while area
