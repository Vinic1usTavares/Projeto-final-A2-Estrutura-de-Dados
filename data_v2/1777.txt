monasteries and institutions in united states and canada in 2011 it had an estimated 84 900 members in united states oca has its origins in a mission established by eight russian orthodox monks in alaska then part of russian america in 1794 this grew into a full diocese of russian orthodox church after united states purchased alaska from russia in 1867 by late 19th century russian orthodox church had grown in other areas of united states due to arrival of immigrants from areas of eastern and central europe many of them formerly of eastern catholic churches greek catholics and from middle east these immigrants regardless of nationality or ethnic background were united under a single north american diocese of russian orthodox church after bolshevik revolution patriarch tikhon of moscow directed all russian orthodox churches outside of russia to govern themselves autonomously no 362 orthodox churches in america became a self governing russian orthodox greek catholic church in

orthodox church in 1970 and renamed orthodox church in america its hierarchs are part of assembly of canonical orthodox bishops of united states of america unlike most orthodox jurisdictions in united states oca does not have an affinity towards any particular ethnicity most oca members are culturally american and most oca clergy are those who are born and raised in united states however oca does have ethnic dioceses for romanian bulgarian and albanian immigrants additionally as a consequence of history certain ethnic groups particularly ruthenian americans and alaska natives are disproportionately represented in oca compared to general population liturgical and church traditions such as forms of singing vestments iconography use of church slavonic and architecture broadly reflect those of russian orthodoxy it is officially recognized as autocephalous by several orthodox churches mostly those based in slavic countries remaining churches do not recognize oca as autocephalous although they do recognize self governing nature of church while subject of political and ecclesiastical dispute this controversy does not impair communion between oca and wider eastern

hands of russian settlers and baranov they sent reports to shelikhov detailing abuse of local population but were ignored in response however holy synod created an auxiliary episcopal see in alaska in 1796 and elected fr joasaph as bishop fr joasaph and a small party returned to russia in 1798 for his consecration and to offer first hand accounts of what they had seen during their return voyage to colony in may 1799 their ship sank and all aboard died in 1800 baranov placed remaining monks under house arrest and forbade them to have any further contact with local population despite lack of leadership orthodox mission in alaska continued to grow in 1811 however holy synod officially closed episcopal see it was not until 1823 that holy synod sent instructions for a new priest to travel to alaska john veniaminov of irkutsk volunteered for journey and left russia in may 1823 he and his family arrived at unalaska island on july 29 1824 in 1840 after death of his wife veniaminov accepted

american sobor convened in mayfield pennsylvania following archbishop tikhon s reassignment to russia that year however few of his reforms were implemented during this period education and charity was a focus of diocese in 1905 archbishop tikhon oversaw creation of an orthodox seminary in minneapolis minnesota st platon s seminary moved from minneapolis to tenafly new jersey in 1912 and enrolled 78

by events of that year revolution and turmoil thumb albanian orthodox church in worcester massachusetts russian revolution of 1917 and subsequent establishment of communist soviet government ushered in a period of repression for russian orthodox church church property was confiscated and when patriarch tikhon resisted he was imprisoned from april 1922 until june 1923 on november 20 1920 patriarch tikhon formally authorized russian orthodox bishops to set up temporarily independent organizations until such time as normal communications with and governance from patriarchate could be restored ethnic groups within american diocese began to re align themselves with other national churches in 1918 a group of ukrainians in canada formed ukrainian greek orthodox church in canada and in 1922 greek orthodox archdiocese of america was established in 1926 serbs aligned with serbian orthodox church ware timothy orthodox church 2nd edition penguin books 1993 in soviet russia a splinter group known as living church gained official state recognition in place of russian orthodox church in 1922 in united states a group of living church clergy led by john kedrovsky attempted to depose ruling american hierarch bishop alexander bishop alexander in addition to political and ethnic struggles of his diocese had also to deal with mounting church debt as a result of loss of funds from russian

after archbishop platon s return he was elected metropolitan of all america and canada at third all american sobor in november 1922 soon after communist authorities in russia in collaboration with living church attempted to seize church assets in united states in response fourth all american sobor convened in april 1924 during sobor historic step of declaring north american diocese to be temporarily self governing was taken this was meant to be necessary only until relations with russian church could be normalized and justification for move was earlier decree by patriarch tikhon diocese was officially incorporated as russian orthodox greek catholic church of america despite conditions set out by tikhon s decree for this temporary autonomy not being met american diocese of russian church declared self governance in 1924 against protests of patriarchate with which it had communication and which was capable of governance had its american branch been willing refusal of american branch to submit to patriarchate thus based itself officially on a document whose conditions it had not met in reality however it was a fear of communism and a belief that patriarchate had been compromised which fueled rebellion paired with a desire on part of metropolia to dissociate itself from russian orthodox church outside russia rocor of which it had allegedly been part rocor and oca orthodoxwiki article despite declaration of self governance kedrovsky and living church were awarded church s diocesan cathedral in new york city to prevent further loss of property diocese allowed individual parishes to take ownership of their properties which made them effectively independent this combined with increasing number of ethnic parishes aligning themselves with other orthodox jurisdictions as well as some non orthodox led to a unique situation in orthodox america whereby multiple jurisdictions overlapped geographically remainder of american church became known informally as metropolia or under jurisdiction of metropolitan following patriarch tikhon s death russian orthodox church led by metropolitan sergius began cooperating with soviet government in 1933 russian church declared metropolia to be schismatic a third russian church synod of bishops of russian church abroad also known as synod and later russian orthodox church outside russia or rocor formed in 1921 synod saw itself as representing all russian orthodox abroad including metropolia metropolia cooperated with synod at first but severed relations with them in 1926 citing synod s increasing claims of authority in america synod for its part suspended metropolitan platon and his clergy in 1935 an agreement entitled temporary regulations of russian orthodox church abroad was signed that normalized relations between metropolia and rocor 6th all american sobor held in 1937 affirmed that while metropolia remained autonomous it reported to rocor in matters of faith rocor forced to leave yugoslavia toward end of world war ii eventually established its base of operations in new york city in 1946 it was decided at 7th all american sobor that metropolia would sever its ties with rocor and attempt to return to patriarchate of moscow this return was proposed with stipulation that metropolia be allowed to retain its autonomy when this condition was not met metropolia continued as a self governing church although there were periodic attempts at reconciliation between metropolia and russian church over next few decades no serious progress was made during this time ethnic character of metropolia began to change since many russian immigrants to america aligned themselves with vocally anti communist rocor metropolia experienced its growth increasingly through addition of english speaking converts as a result ethnic makeup of metropolia began to shift away from a purely slavic one that had included mainly russians ukrainians and rusyns move toward unity and independence prior to 13th all american sobor in november 1967 a proposal was prepared to change name of church from russian orthodox greek catholic church of america to orthodox church in america council of bishops already aware of proposal forbade a vote on matter after much debate however a non binding straw poll was permitted result of poll was decidedly in favor of name change as a result decision to deal with matter at another sobor to be held in two years was made in early 1960s metropolia resumed communication with patriarch of moscow in 1968 metropolia and russian church communicated informally to resolve long standing differences representatives from metropolia sought right of self governance as well as removal of russian jurisdiction from all matters concerning american church official negotiations on matter began in 1969 on april 10 1970 patriarch alexius i and fourteen bishops of russian church s holy synod signed official tomos of autocephaly which made newly renamed orthodox church in america fifteenth autocephalous orthodox church name change as well as granting of autocephaly was officially accepted at 14th all american sobor also known as 1st all american council in recognition of church s new found independence in october 1970 granting of autocephaly by moscow patriarchate then under operational control of ussr s kgb felix corley svyatoslav files metropolitan and kgb was strongly condemned by ecumenical patriarchate of constantinople as an act that exceeded former s authority and violated holy letter from ecumenical patriarch athenagoras on autocephaly letter of ecumenical patriarch athenagoras of 24 june 1970 to metropolitan locum tenens of moscow patriarchate regarding granting of autocephaly to russian metropolia oca s autocephaly is currently recognized only by a minor share of other autocephalous orthodox churches all canonical orthodox churches recognize oca as canonical and its sacraments as valid however oca was a member of standing conference of orthodox bishops in america scoba together with greek orthodox archdiocese of america antiochian orthodox christian archdiocese of north america aoca and other member jurisdictions in 2010 scoba was dissolved with creation of new assembly of canonical orthodox bishops of north and central america which was mandated by orthodox patriarchates in 2009 at a meeting in switzerland serious consideration has been given recently to a possible merger between oca and aoca both groups share a significant common history in that a syrian priest raphael hawaweeny was sent by moscow patriarchate in late 19th century as a missionary to arabic speaking orthodox christians living in north america raphael was ordained a bishop in 1904 and his flock eventually became aoca bishop raphael was canonized in march 2000 by oca as st raphael of brooklyn financial scandal in 2005 former treasurer protodeacon eric wheeler publicly accused oca administration of financial misconduct wheeler alleged that millions of dollars in donations to church were improperly used for personal expenses or to cover shortfalls in church accounts a 32 page report was released on september 3 2008 that addressed financial scandal and recommended discipline for five individuals including then primate metropolitan herman his predecessor metropolitan theodosius and two former treasurers as well as a former comptroller same report recommended then primate metropolitan herman immediately resign or retire from his post or risk being defrocked one day after report was released metropolitan herman resigned from his position as metropolitan that november oca elected a new primate at its 15th annual all american council metropolitan jonah was chosen because he had recently been appointed as a bishop only 11 days prior and was viewed to not be involved with previous financial scandal metropolitan jonah immediately took a strong stance against previous scandal and became a very public metropolitan seeking to repair damage done by previous scandal and bring oca into public realm metropolitan jonah also sought to improve relations with non orthodox groups and especially sought to repair relations between oca and traditional anglican groups he was invited twice to speak at conference of anglican church of north america in 2009 and 2012 less than four years after his election metropolitan jonah was asked by holy synod in a unanimous decision to resign from his position while wary of initially releasing information about resignation holy synod felt prompted to release a public statement about his release due to rumors that had spread about their intentions statement they released on official website of oca detailed several administrative decisions metropolitan jonah had made that holy synod felt put church and its members at risk statement from holy synod regarding resignation of metropolitan jonah orthodox church in america holy synod of orthodox church in america 16 july 2012 web 17 jul 2012 in statement holy synod clarified reason they withheld information initially was to protect reputation and integrity of metropolitan jonah as

recognition of autocephaly currently russian bulgarian georgian polish serbian and czech and slovak churches recognize autocephaly of oca though bulgarian georgian russian and serbian patriarchates continue to maintain parishes inside oca s claimed jurisdiction assembly of canonical orthodox bishops of united states of america bishops in united states of america among churches that do not recognize it is ecumenical patriarchate of constantinople which argues that russian church did not have authority to grant autocephaly partly because russian church at time was considered to be heavily influenced by soviet government ecumenical patriarch also cites canon 28 of council of chalcedon which asserted jurisdiction of bishop of constantinople in dioceses located among barbarians i e outside roman empire as source of ecumenical patriarchate s authority in matter apologists for oca s autocephaly claim that decree did not need approval of ecumenical patriarchate as it was an internal matter for russian orthodox church to decide many autocephalous churches russian church included were not recognized as such for many years albeit their autocephaly was granted by ecumenical patriarchate membership exact number of oca parishioners is debated according to 2006 edition of yearbook of american and canadian churches oca has 1 064 000 members an increase of 6 4 percent from
