written by bamboo dong editor called series mindlessly fun jokingly citing how cell phones are always pointed directly at demons as if they would be incapable of fighting if it were otherwise dong also likened series as watching someone else play video game designs of various demons and septentriones were described as most interesting part of series on other hand editor described immense amount of video game plot packed into next batch of four episodes as messy dong also referred to central premise as being pretty dark since it involved main characters constantly receiving videos showing exactly how their friends would die editor gave series props for not dabbling in destruction porn taking place since all of widespread death around japan is implied but added that showing some of it would have aided realism of story after reviewing twelve episodes dong was not able to develop any interest in characters this continued into series finale and dong still felt that characters were not fleshed out as much as they could have been dong explained that since there was basically no time to explore how characters reacted to a disappearing world it was essentially dehumanizing to such an extent that their deaths carried no emotional weight dong presented a full series review in their shelf life column and expressed that viewers who like brawn action and some emotion will enjoy series as long as they can come to terms with fact that they ll pretty much just be watching someone play a video game for several hours right thumb destruction caused in series was thought of as being similar to real world devastation brought to japan by 1923 great kanto earthquake spring 2013 anime preview guide written by rebecca silverman also of anime news network expressed differing sentiments than that of dong silverman was quick to mention that she had not previously played game to which series was based on with that being said she described first episode as not feeling like a game adaptation since you at no point have sensation of watching someone else play she also noted that transformation from everyday world to one of total chaos and destruction as both swift and impressive she supported this by citing similar descriptions of destruction caused by great kanto earthquake of 1920s in her full series review silverman went into detail about how noticeably dark series as a whole is when taking into account its animated depictions coupled with death themes used unlike fellow reviewer bamboo dong silverman felt that character deaths would hit viewers more personally since they get to know them as story progress and are then suddenly torn down she further wrote that nearly every character death can potentially pack a punch since they are removed from ending animation upon their demise on other hand silverman remarked that some of characters were truly unlikable as they did not appear to grow and change after seven episodes richard eisenbeis of kotaku disliked series so much that he discouraged viewers from watching it for that particular season he supported this by stating that premise of teenagers summoning monsters has been done to death and that adaptation has no compelling mysteries nor are there deeper psychological dilemmas being explored eisenbeis shared sentiments with anime news network reviewers when he elaborated on what he called woefully underdeveloped characters of devil survivor 2 who are only given rudimentary back stories this had added effect of making it nearly impossible to figure out who exactly is a one off character and who is a main character since they are all equally subjected to threat of death eisenbeis noted that this made their demise genuinely shocking as it added to viewing tension eisenbeis went on to write that other characters were contrast to main villain or antihero yamato hotsuin since he gets so much development that much of series runtime is spent on his backstory and goals than all other characters combined this helps give an in depth understanding of character and simultaneously made him an excellent villain uk anime network had andy hanley review first four episodes and he expressed a much more positive outlook than previous reviewers hanley wrote about how fast series was in setting up its premise and described it as an in at deep end experience hanley cited ruination of tokyo at end of first episode and countless deaths that occur by episode four to support this hanley argued that while this pace leaves series open to being labelled as shallow it s actually very effective
