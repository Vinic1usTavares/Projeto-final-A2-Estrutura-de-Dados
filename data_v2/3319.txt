thumb right title page of beowulf monsters and critics 1936 beowulf monsters and critics was a 1936 lecture given by j r r tolkien on literary criticism on old english heroic epic poem beowulf it was first published as a paper in that year in proceedings of british academy and has since been reprinted in many collections tolkien argues that original poem has almost been lost under weight of scholarship on it that beowulf must be seen as a poem not just as a historical document and that quality of its verse and its structure give it a powerful effect he rebuts suggestions that poem is an epic or exciting narrative likening it instead to a strong masonry structure built of blocks that fit together he points out that poem s theme is a serious one mortality and that poem is in two parts first on beowulf as a young man defeating grendel and his mother second on beowulf in old age going to his death fighting dragon work has been praised by critics including poet and beowulf translator seamus heaney michael d c drout called it most important article ever written about poem scholars of anglo saxon agree that work was influential transforming study of beowulf overview j r r tolkien s essay beowulf monsters and critics initially delivered as a lecture in 1936 is regarded as a formative work in modern beowulf studies in it tolkien speaks against critics who play down monsters in poem namely grendel grendel s mother and dragon in favour of using beowulf solely as a source for anglo saxon history tolkien argues that rather than being merely extraneous these elements are key to narrative and should be focus of study in doing so he drew attention to previously neglected literary qualities of poem and argued that it should be studied as a work of art not just as a historical document later critics such as hugh magennis who agree with tolkien on this point have cited him to defend their arguments essay is a redacted version of a series of lectures that tolkien delivered to oxford undergraduates in 1930s notes for these lectures exist in two manuscript versions published together in 2002 as beowulf and critics edited by michael d c drout these offer some insight into development of tolkien s thinking on poem especially his much quoted metaphor of material of poem as a tower beowulf monsters and critics is available in various collections including 1983 monsters and critics and other essays edited by christopher tolkien tolkien s argument rebuttal of earlier critics thumb upright tolkien s essay repeatedly responds to comments by william paton ker late 19th century portrait by johnston forbes robertson tolkien begins by noting that original book has almost been lost under extensive literature tolkien 1997 p 5 his inverted commas on subject he explains that beowulf had mainly been quarried as an historical document tolkien 1997 p 6 and that most of praise and censure of poem was due to beliefs that it was something that it was not for example primitive pagan teutonic an allegory political or mythical or most often an epic tolkien 1997 p 7 or because scholar would have liked it to be something else such as a heathen heroic lay a history of sweden a manual of germanic antiquities or a nordic summa theologica tolkien gives an allegory of a man who inherits a field full of stone from an old hall he builds a tower with some of it but when people find stones are older than tower they pull it down to look for hidden carvings and inscriptions tolkien 1997 p 8 tolkien quotes at length what scholar w p ker thought of beowulf namely that there is nothing much in story and that great beauty real value of beowulf is in its dignity of style tolkien notes that ker s opinion had been a powerful influence in favour of a paradoxical contrast between poem s supposed defect in speaking of monsters and in tolkien s words its agreed dignity loftiness in converse and well wrought finish tolkien 1997 pp 10 11 tolkien cites other critics such as raymond wilson chambers and ritchie who objected to poem s wilderness of dragons and its unworthy choice of theme tolkien finds it improbable that a mind lofty and thoughtful as evidenced by quality of poetry would write more than three thousand lines wrought to a high finish on matter that is really not worth serious attention tolkien 1997 pp 13 14 he notes that heroic human stories had been held to be superior to myth but argues that myth has a special value for myth is alive at once and in all its parts and dies before it can be dissected tolkien 1997 p 15 finally tolkien states directly we do not deny worth of hero by accepting grendel and dragon tolkien 1997 p 17 man in a hostile world in tolkien s view poem is essentially about a man at war with hostile world and his inevitable overthrow in time underlying tragedy is man s brief mortal life grendel and dragon are identified as enemies of a christian god unlike monsters encountered by odysseus on his travels tolkien 1997 pp 19 20 what had happened is that northern courage exultant defiant in face of inevitable defeat by chaos and unreason tolkien cites ker s words fuses with a christian faith and outlook tolkien 1997 p 21 beowulf poet uses both what he knew to be old heroic tradition darkened by distance in time along with newly acquired christian tradition christian tolkien notes is hemmed in a hostile world and monsters are evil spirits but as transition was incomplete in poem monsters remain real and focus remains an ancient theme that man each man and all men and all their works shall die tolkien 1997 p 23 tolkien returns to monsters and regrets we know so little about pre christian english mythology he resorts instead to icelandic myth which he argues must have had a similar attitude to monsters men and gods northern gods like men are doomed to die southern roman and greek pagan gods were immortal so to tolkien a christian southern religion must go forward to philosophy or relapse into anarchy tolkien 1997 p 25 death and monsters are peripheral but northern myths and beowulf put monsters mortality and death in centre tolkien is therefore very interested in contact of northern and christian thought in poem where scriptural cain is linked to giants and elves not through confusion but an indication of precise point at which an imagination pondering old and new was kindled tolkien 1997 p 26 poem is tolkien states an historical poem about pagan past or an attempt at one obviously not with modern ideas of literal historical fidelity poet takes an old plot a marauding monster troubling court paints a vivid picture of old days for instance using old testament image of shepherd patriarchs of israel in people s shepherd of danes tolkien 1997 p 27 structure youth versus age thumb upright first folio of beowulf manuscript c 975 1025 general structure of poem is then clear writes tolkien it is essentially a balance an opposition of ends and beginnings in its simplest terms it is a contrasted description of two moments in a great life rising and setting an elaboration of ancient and intensely moving contrast between youth and age first achievement and final death tolkien 1997 p 28 part a youth is lines 1 to 2199 part b age is lines 2200 to end a secondary division of poem occurs tolkien writes at line 1887 after which all earlier story is summarized so a complete account of beowulf s tragedy is given between 1888 and end but without account of gloomy court of heorot or of contrast between young beowulf and old hrothgar poem s metre too is founded on a balance of two halves to each line more like masonry than music tolkien 1997 p 30 tolkien argues that poem is not meant to be an exciting narrative nor a romantic story but a word picture a method and structure that approaches rather to sculpture or painting it is a composition not a tune far from being weakly structured it is curiously strong a singular effect tolkien takes a moment to dismiss another criticism that monsters should not have been made to appear in both halves he replies he can see point of no monsters but not in complaining about their mere numbers poet could not he argues have balanced beowulf s rise to fame through a war in frisia against death by dragon similarly he dismisses notions that poem is primitive it is instead a late poem using materials left over from a vanished age tolkien finishes by arguing that beowulf has its own individual character and peculiar solemnity and would still be powerful even if it came from some unknown time and place but that in fact its language old english reception scholars scholars and critics agree on work s wide influence tom shippey wrote that essay was seized upon eagerly even gratefully by generations of critics alvin a lee wrote that tolkien s manifesto and interpretation have had more influence on readers than any other single study even though it has been challenged on just about every one of its major points seth wrote that essay may well be piece of modern beowulf criticism strategies control fundamental assumptions of old english scholarship for next fifty years r d fulk commented that no one denies historical importance of this lecture opening way to formalist principles that played such a vital role in subsequent development of further beowulf scholarship methodology remains a model for emulation bruce mitchell and fred c robinson call it in their beowulf an edition 1998 most influential literary criticism of poem ever written george clark calls it most influential critical essay on poem stating it without qualification or justification as a known fact michael lapidge similarly names it his widely influential critical discussion of poem scholar and translator roy liuzza commented that tolkien s essay is usually credited with re establishing fabulous elements and heroic combats at center of modern reader s appreciation of poem liuzza at once went on to write however that separation of poem into mythical and historical elements is a false dichotomy he argues that if myth can condense and hold deepest sources of tension between self and social order and dramatises current ideologies by projecting them into past then even hero beowulf s mythic fights are at same time throwing light on society and history historian patrick wormald wrote of essay it would be no exaggeration to describe it as one of most influential works of literary criticism of that century and since which nothing in beowulf studies has been quite same however wormald continues arguments of tolkien s paper were not universally accepted and some of its effects would perhaps have been disowned by author but its general impact could be summarized by saying that most critics have learnt to take beowulf poet a great deal more seriously wormald added that michael d c drout similarly describes essay s importance and arguments writing that it drout then remarks on paradoxical success of essay john d niles observed that bypassing earlier scholarship critics of past fifty years have generally traced current era of beowulf studies back to 1936 meaning to tolkien s essay which he called eloquent and incisive niles argued that essay quickly came to be a starting point as scholars from then on assumed with tolkien that poem was an aesthetic unity endowed with spiritual significance in niles s view tolkien thought that battles with monsters and sombre elegiac tone of poem expressed artistic designs of a deep thinker religiously enlightened who let his mind play over a lost heroic world of imagination in other words that beowulf poet was a man much like tolkien niles cited george clark s observation that tolkien left beowulf scholars with myth of poet as brooding intellectual poised between a dying pagan world and a nascent christian one niles noted that tolkien s view of melancholic vision of beowulf poet and of heroic fatalism of poem s leading characters was not wholly new but that his view of poet himself as a hero was press joan acocella writing in new yorker calls it a paper that many people regard as not just finest essay on poem but one of finest essays on english literature she adds that tolkien preferred monsters to critics regina weinreich reviewing monsters and critics and other essays in new york times wrote that title essay revolutionized study of early english poem beowulf in which a young hero crushes a human handed monster called grendel against scorn of critics tolkien defends centrality and seriousness of literary monsters declaring his own belief in symbolic value of such preternatural representations of sheer evil weinreich added that beowulf like other ancient legends served to nourish tolkien s imagination john garth writing in guardian describes paper as still well worth reading not only as an introduction to poem but also because it decisively changed direction and emphasis of beowulf scholarship up to that point it had been used as a quarry of linguistic historical and archaeological detail garth notes that translator thumb upright poet and beowulf translator seamus heaney praised monsters and critics tolkien s paper was praised by irish poet seamus heaney in introduction to his critically acclaimed translation of beowulf he wrote that epoch making paper stood out in considering beowulf as literature heaney argued that tolkien took for granted poem s integrity and distinction as a work of art and showed how poem achieved that status heaney called paper s literary treatment brilliant he suggested that it had changed way that beowulf was valued and that it had started a new era of appreciation of poem new light from tolkien s beowulf translation tolkien s own translation of beowulf published posthumously in 2014 as beowulf a translation and commentary has been linked to essay shippey has argued that translation throws light on what tolkien really thought in 1936 tolkien stated for instance that beowulf was not an actual picture of scandinavia around 500 ad but was a self consistent picture with marks of design and thought this might leave reader wondering commented shippey what exactly tolkien meant by that shippey argued that there was evidence from chronology given in 2014 book supported by work of scholars such as martin that there was serious trouble among eastern with migration and taking over of mead halls by new leaders at that time just as portrayed in poem editions translations icelandic see also beowulf a translation and
