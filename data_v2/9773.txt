tanizaki brings lisa back down to basement her cyberman influence takes over and she kills him by attempting to upgrade him this causes a power flicker in hub ianto makes an excuse to look into it

for ianto but then promises that they can be upgraded together rest of torchwood team arriving to hear that open fire and kill her leaving ianto to mourn production background thumb cyberwoman was first episode to centre on ianto jones portrayed by gareth david lloyd pictured idea behind episode came from series creator russell t davies who realised there was a story begging to be told after doctor who episodes army of ghosts and doomsday in episodes cybermen from a parallel universe invade earth to assimilate human population they were ultimately defeated when doctor david tennant banishes them to void a space between universes to be imprisoned cyberwoman was among first episodes pitched for first series when chris chibnall was appointed head writer for torchwood davies asked him to write an episode about a cyber girl in basement of hub out of entire first series cyberwoman is biggest nod to doctor who there was little to no mention of series despite being a spin off which was made deliberate to send out confusing signals to audience about what series is chibnall wanted to include a base description of what a cyberman is for any viewer who had not seen doctor who episode was first to centre on ianto who in first three episodes was more or less a background character and what john barrowman described as like torchwoods version of alfred pennyworth in batman chibnall originally intended for episode to become sixth or seventh in series but was brought forward to fourth because some of other scripts were not yet completed it also became one of chibnall s harder episodes to write before settling on current title chibnall went through numerous working titles including trouble with lisa and long night of ianto cyberwoman was ultimately chosen because title says it all writing in writing beginning chibnall envisaged ianto meeting tanizaki at an airport and then escorting him to a hotel before entering hub however that was cut from final draft as it would be an expensive sequence to film chibnall wanted episode to take place several weeks after previous episode ghost machine as to show gwen knowing all protocols and how to handle weapons where as in last episode gwen was still considered a rookie despite episode being about stopping lisa chibnall still wanted beginning to be a love story between her and ianto and show audience that a half converted lisa is still human and girlfriend ianto loves also because ianto is fundamentally wrong about thinking lisa can be saved chibnall wanted audience to sympathise with character and his motives idea of having lisa fight pterodactyl named myfanwy by producers made them laugh and felt they had to include it line where ianto calls jack biggest monster was intended to be cut out but chibnall decided to keep it because of its impact to audience scene where team lines up to execute lisa towards end was first scene chibnall had in mind for episode though in first draft it was ianto who killed her after episode was written and filmed chibnall discovered two main plot holes in story first is that he did not make clear that everything about lisa including scene where she acted human was all part of her plan for her cyberman influence to take over and reflected to adding at least two lines of dialogue to explain her motives clearly second was jack having a cut lip in end even though he is immortal and all his wounds would have healed quickly in audio commentary for episode both chibnall and actor gareth david lloyd stated reasoning behind cut being there is because jack s immortal powers would only deal with life threatening wounds and not minor injuries filming thumb basement where ianto held lisa was filmed at a cellar in tredegar house before filming took place david lloyd met with caroline chikezie and got to know each other to help give their respective characters their chemistry episode was filmed as part of third production block of first series along with eighth episode they keep killing suzie director james strong wanted to film episode in a sort of real time format filming largely took place at upper boat studios outside pontypridd where torchwood hub set is located scene where jack threatens to kill ianto if he does not kill lisa was first scene to be shot flashback scene where ianto finds a half converted lisa in canary wharf took a full day to film it was originally supposed to take only a few hours but camera failed to record scene it was replaced but second camera failed to record also eve myles and burn gorman were both trained how to handle guns and a torch like a secret agent strong noted that they both held gun and torch in each hand like professionals external shots of hub were filmed at roald dahl plass in cardiff which is what exists above hub in series filming scenes at plass took place during middle of night and was disrupted by hooligans basement where ianto holds lisa was filmed at a cellar in tredegar house newport original ending to episode is where toshiko hands ianto coffee while he is cleaning hub however after it was filmed strong decided to cut that scene out as he felt overhead shot of hub before that scene would have made a more suitable ending because it was filmed in only a handful of locations mostly in hub set and there were only a few guest cast members cyberwoman was considered one of cheapest episodes in first series costume and effects producers noted there were a history of sexy pneumatic hydraulic women in science fiction and wanted to tap into that to make cyberwoman costume props department wanted to make it as sexy as they can director james strong wanted to make costume look amazing but threatening and scary as well there were discussions about which parts of lisa would be human and which parts would be cyborg made out of rubber it was custom made to fit chikezie as much as possible it took an entire day for actress to get her body cast after costume was completed it would take an hour to apply each morning and an hour to remove by lunch break chikezie found it difficult to hear anything from helmet while shooting scenes it was also uncomfortable for her but producers noted she remained stoic throughout filming fight scene between lisa and myfanwy was difficult to shoot as actress had to interact with a visual effect creature that would not be added until post production producers added a plastic green beak stuck on end of a stick to be used as a guide scene where team go up on invisible lift was made by making platform stationary but camera below it would descend giving illusion platform is ascending visual effect of tools used to create cybermen were reused from doctor who episode age of steel while ufo footage when torchwood team return from drinks was a tin foil covered frisbee on a fishing line broadcast reception and analysis ratings and critical reception cyberwoman was first broadcast on bbc three during 10 pm time slot on sunday 5 november 2006 episode was seen by 1 391 million viewers highest viewing on channel week it was broadcast repeat on terrestrial channel bbc two on 8 november 2010 was seen by 2 1 million viewers with a 10 audience share it was given an appreciation index of 84 daniel montesinos donaghy of den of geek reacted positively towards episode stating surprisingly it was absolutely brilliant a mini tragedy of sorts about secrets obsession and corruption that finally gave both gareth david lloyd something interesting to do and series some much needed focus plus they totally played a mogwai song how often does that happen on television montesinos donaghy felt it was a step in right direction adding that it has everything i could have wanted from a torchwood episode ian hyland of news of world disliked episode stating after this week s cyberwoman nonsense torch script would be a better idea androzani com said of episode it s awful it s horrific it seriously seriously sucks adding single nice thing we can find to say is that concept had potential seb patrick of noise to signal thought despite a strong and somewhat morally ambiguous ending episode really should have delivered in more spectacular fashion than this patrick also criticised jack s personality throughout episode stating we wanted a spinoff series about him because he was cocky cool and downright entertaining buzz lightyear meets ace rimmer meets james bond we didn t want some grumpy immortal bastard with a chip on his shoulder despite mixed reviews however series producers and bbc controller of fiction jane tranter regard episode as one of their favourites from first series critical analysis in an essay on evolving symbolism with cybermen lincoln geraghty of university of portsmouth argues that in cyberwoman we see first female cyber character on screen unable to control her programming she attempts to assimilate her ex boyfriend and his teammates like maria in metropolis and suburban threat seen in stepford wives 1975 technology is seen here as even more threatening when linked with possibility of female reproduction neil perryman of university of sunderland feels this episode is a prime example of transmedia storytelling in doctor who and torchwood describing episode and ancillary online material released after its airing being in part an attempt at continuity management he describes these have also been used to correct continuity errors that have appeared within television show for example following broadcast of torchwood episode cyberwoman 13 november 2006 official torchwood website provided information about fall of torchwood one that attempted to correct via additive comprehension what some fans had regarded as a glaring error in plot fans had asked how eponymous cyberwoman was not sucked into void along with rest of her kin during climax to doctor who episode doomsday 8 july 2006 and site retroactively explained away problem only exceptions were those being converted with material entirely derived from this side of void which allowed events of cyberwoman to take place without contradicting what viewers originally
