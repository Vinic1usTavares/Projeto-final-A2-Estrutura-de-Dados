as a franciscan friar early life john was youngest of four sons of erard ii count of brienne and agnes of montfaucon he seemed exceedingly about 80 george akropolites history ch 27 p 184 to 14 year old george akropolites in 1231 if akropolites estimate was correct john was born around 1150 however no other 13th century authors described john as an old man his father referred to john s brothers as children in 1177 and mentioned tutor of john s oldest brother walter iii in 1184 this suggests that john s brothers were born in late 1160s modern historians agree that john was born after 1168 probably during 1170s although his father destined john for a clerical career according to late 13th century tales of minstrel of reims he was unwilling instead minstrel continued john fled to his maternal uncle at clairvaux abbey encouraged by his fellows he became a knight and earned a reputation in tournaments and fights although elements of tales of minstrel of reims are apparently invented for instance john did not have a maternal uncle in clairvaux historian guy perry wrote that it may have preserved details of john s life a church career was not unusual for youngest sons of 12th century noblemen in france however if his father sent john to a monastery he left before reaching age of taking monastic vows john clearly developed physique that was necessary to fight well in his youth because 13th century sources akropolites and salimbene di adam emphasize his physical strength erard ii joined third crusade and died in holy land in 1191 his oldest son walter iii succeeded him in brienne john was first mentioned in an 1192 or 1194 charter issued by his brother indicating that he was a prominent figure in walter s court according to a version of ernoul s chronicle john participated in a war against peter ii of courtenay although tales of minstrel of reims claimed that he was called john lackland according to contemporary charters john held and two other villages in county of champagne around 1200 in 1201 theobald iii granted him additional estates in macon and elsewhere theobald s widow blanche of navarre persuaded john to sell his estate at macon saying that it was her dower walter iii of brienne died in june 1205 while fighting in southern italy his widow elvira of sicily gave birth to a posthumous son walter iv who grew up in italy john assumed title of count of brienne and began administering county on his nephew s behalf in 1205 or 1206 as a leading vassal of count of champagne john frequented court of blanche of navarre who ruled champagne during her son s minority according to a version of ernoul s chronicle she loved john more than any man in world this annoyed philip ii of france two versions of ernoul s chronicle tell different stories about john s ascent to throne of jerusalem according to one version leading lords of jerusalem sent envoys to france in 1208 asking philip ii to select a french nobleman as a husband for their queen maria taking advantage of opportunity to rid himself of john philip ii suggested him in other version an unnamed knight encouraged jerusalemite lords to select john who accepted their offer with philip s consent john visited pope innocent iii in rome pope donated 40 000 marks for defence of holy land stipulating that john could spend money only with consent of latin patriarch of jerusalem and

new truce with al adil by middle of 1211 and sent envoys to pope innocent urging him to preach a new crusade conflicts maria died shortly after giving birth to their daughter isabella in late 1212 her

april they decided to invade egypt they elected john supreme commander giving him right to rule land they would conquer his leadership was primarily nominal since he could rarely impose his authority on an army of troops from many countries crusaders laid siege to damietta on nile in may 1217 although they seized a strategically important tower on a nearby island on 24 august al kamil who had succeeded al adil i in egypt controlled traffic on nile in september reinforcements commanded by pope honorius iii s legate cardinal pelagius who considered himself crusade s supreme commander arrived

john left damietta for kingdom of jerusalem around easter 1220 although al mu azzam isa s successful campaign previous year also pressed john to leave egypt jacques de vitry and other fifth crusade

heard that she tried to poison his daughter isabella their only son died a few weeks later ending john s claim to cilicia soon after pope honorius learned about deaths of stephanie and her son he declared raymond roupen lawful ruler of cilicia and threatened john with excommunication if he fought for his late wife s inheritance john did not return to crusaders in egypt for several months

berengaria of castile decided to give her daughter berengaria of leon to john in marriage although modern historians do not unanimously accept chronicle s account of john s plan to marry sancha or
