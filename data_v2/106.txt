columbidae is a bird family constituted of pigeons and doves these are stout bodied birds with short necks and short slender bills that in some species feature fleshy ceres they primarily feed on seeds fruits and plants family occurs worldwide but greatest variety is in indomalaya and australasia ecozones animal order columbiformes is also constituted of pigeons and doves and includes about 42 genera and 310 species distinction between doves and pigeons in english is not consistent and does not exist in most other languages in contrast in scientific and ornithological practice dove tends to be used for smaller species and pigeon for larger ones but this is in no way consistently applied historically common names for these birds involve a great deal of variation between terms bird most commonly referred to as just pigeon is domestic pigeon which is common in many cities as feral pigeon pigeon is a french word that derives from latin for a peeping chick while dove is a germanic word that refers to bird s diving flight english dialectal word culver appears to derive from latin columba doves and pigeons build relatively flimsy nests often using sticks and other debris which may be placed on trees ledges or ground depending on species they lay one or two eggs at a time and both parents care for young which leave nest after 7 28 days unlike most birds both sexes of doves and pigeons produce crop milk to feed to their young secreted by a sloughing of fluid filled cells from lining of crop young doves and pigeons are called squabs taxonomy and systematics family columbidae was introduced by english zoologist william elford leach in a guide to contents of british museum published in 1820 although name of author is not specified in document leach was keeper of zoology at time columbidae is only living family in order columbiformes pteroclidae were formerly placed here but were moved to a separate order based on anatomical differences e g they are unable to drink by sucking or pumping they are now considered to be more closely related to shorebirds columbiformes pigeons doves and dodos francis hugh john crome grzimek s animal life encyclopedia michael hutchins dennis a and melissa c eds vol 9 detroit gale 2004 pp 241 246 recent studies support grouping of pigeons and sandgrouse together along with forming sister taxon to columbidae are usually divided into five subfamilies probably inaccurately for example american ground and quail doves which are usually placed in columbinae seem to be two distinct subfamilies basically conventional treatment had two large subfamilies one for fruit doves imperial pigeons and fruit pigeons and another for nearly all of remaining species additionally three monotypic subfamilies were noted one each for genera goura and old subfamily columbinae consists of five distinct lineages whereas other four groups are more or less accurate representations of evolutionary relationships order presented here follows baptista etal 1997 with some updates supplementary information arrangement of genera and naming of subfamilies is in some cases provisional because analyses of different dna sequences yield results that differ often radically in placement of certain mainly indo australian genera this ambiguity probably caused by long branch attraction seems to confirm first pigeons evolved in australasian region and that and allied forms crowned and pheasant pigeons for example represent earliest radiation of group family columbidae previously also contained family consisting of extinct rodrigues solitaire and dodo these species are in all likelihood part of indo australian radiation that produced three small subfamilies mentioned above with fruit doves and pigeons including nicobar pigeon therefore they are here included as a subfamily pending better material evidence of their exact relationships exacerbating these issues are not well represented in fossil record no truly primitive forms have been found to date genus has been described from early miocene deposits in france but while it was long believed to be a pigeon it is now considered a sandgrouse fragmentary remains of a probably early miocene pigeon were found in bannockburn formation of new zealand and described as columbina from roughly contemporary deposits of florida is nowadays tentatively separated in but its distinction from columbina and related genera needs to be more firmly established e g by cladistic analysis apart from that all other fossils belong to extant genera thumb baby pigeon thumb rock dove in flight thumb rock dove courtship taxonomy taxonomy based on work by john h boyd iii a professor of economics description thumb common ground dove is among smallest species in family size and appearance pigeons and doves exhibit considerable variation in size ranging in length from and in weight from to above largest species is crowned pigeon of new guinea which is nearly turkey sized at a weight of smallest is new world ground dove of genus columbina which is same size as a house sparrow weighing as little as dwarf fruit dove which may measure as little as has a marginally smaller total length than any other species from this family one of largest arboreal species marquesan imperial pigeon currently battles extinction anatomy and physiology overall anatomy of columbidae is characterized by short legs short bills with a fleshy cere and small heads on large compact bodies like some other birds columbidae have no gall bladders some medieval naturalists concluded they have no bile gall which in medieval theory of four humours explained allegedly sweet disposition of doves in fact however they do have bile as aristotle had earlier realized which is secreted directly into gut thumb a landing pigeon displays contour and flight feathers of its wings wings are large and have eleven primary feathers pigeons have strong wing muscles wing muscles comprise 31 44 of their body weight and are among strongest fliers of all birds in a series of experiments in 1975 by dr mark b friedman using doves their characteristic head bobbing was shown to be due to their natural desire to keep their vision constant it was shown yet again in a 1978 experiment by dr barrie j frost in which pigeons were placed on treadmills it was observed that they did not bob their heads as their surroundings were constant feathers thumb pigeon feather types excluding down columbidae have unique body feathers with shaft being generally broad strong and flattened tapering to a fine point abruptly in general is absent however small ones on some tail and wing feathers may be present body feathers have very dense fluffy bases are attached loosely into skin and drop out easily possibly serving as a predator avoidance mechanism large numbers of feathers fall out in attacker s mouth if bird is snatched facilitating bird s escape plumage of family is variable granivorous species tend to have dull plumage with a few exceptions whereas frugivorous species have brightly coloured plumage ptilinopus fruit doves are some of brightest coloured pigeons with three endemic species of fiji and indian ocean alectroenas being brightest pigeons and doves may be sexually monochromatic or dichromatic in addition to bright colours pigeons may sport crests or other ornamentation flight columbidae are excellent fliers due to lift provided by their large wings which results in low wing loading they are highly maneuverable in flight and have a low aspect ratio due to width of their wings allowing for quick flight launches and ability to escape from predators but at a high energy cost distribution and habitat thumb zebra dove has been widely introduced around world pigeons and doves are distributed everywhere on earth except for driest areas of sahara desert antarctica and its surrounding islands and high arctic they have colonised most of world s oceanic islands reaching eastern polynesia and chatham islands in pacific mauritius seychelles and reunion in indian ocean and azores in atlantic ocean family has adapted to most of habitats available on planet these species may be arboreal terrestrial or semi terrestrial various species also inhabit savannas grasslands deserts temperate woodlands and forests mangrove forests and even barren sands and gravels of atolls some species have large natural ranges eared dove ranges across entirety of south america from colombia to tierra del fuego eurasian collared dove has a massive if discontinuous distribution from britain across europe middle east india pakistan and china and laughing dove across most of sub saharan africa as well as india pakistan and middle east other species have tiny restricted distributions this is most common in island endemics whistling dove is endemic to tiny kadavu island in fiji caroline ground dove is restricted to two islands truk and pohnpei in caroline islands and grenada dove is restricted to grenada in caribbean some continental species also have tiny distributions for example black banded fruit dove is restricted to a small area of arnhem land of australia somali pigeon is restricted to a tiny area of northern somalia and moreno s ground dove is restricted to area around salta and tucuman in northern argentina largest range of any species is that of rock dove this species had a large natural distribution from britain and ireland to northern africa across europe arabia central asia india himalayas and up into china and mongolia range of species increased dramatically upon domestication as species went feral in cities around world species is currently resident across most of north america and has established itself in cities and urban areas in south america sub saharan africa southeast asia japan australia and new zealand species is not only pigeon to have increased its range due to actions of man several other species have become established outside of their natural range after escaping captivity and other species have increased their natural ranges due to habitat changes caused by human activity behaviour male pigeons are more opportunistic to mate with another female feeding thumb white bellied green pigeon feeding on fruit seeds and fruit form major component of diets of pigeons and doves in fact family can be divided into seed eating or granivorous species subfamily columbinae and fruit and mast eating or frugivorous species other four subfamilies granivorous species typically feed on seed found on ground whereas frugivorous species tend to feed in trees there are morphological adaptations that can be used to distinguish between two groups tend to have thick walls in their gizzards intestines and whereas frugivores tend to have thin walls in addition fruit eating species have short intestines whereas those that eat seeds have longer ones frugivores are capable of clinging to branches and even hang upside down to reach fruit in addition to fruit and seeds a number of other food items are taken by many species some particularly ground doves and quail doves eat a large number of prey items such as insects and worms one species atoll fruit dove is specialised in taking insect and reptile prey snails moths and other insects are taken by white crowned pigeons orange fruit doves and ruddy ground doves status and conservation thumb upright left socorro dove is extinct in wild while many species of pigeons and doves have benefited from human activities and have increased their ranges many other species have declined in numbers and some have become threatened or even succumbed to extinction among ten species to have become extinct since 1600 conventional date for estimating modern extinctions are two of most famous extinct species dodo and passenger pigeon passenger pigeon was exceptional for a number of reasons in modern times it is only pigeon species that was not an island species to have become extinct even though it was once most numerous species of bird on earth its former numbers are difficult to estimate but one ornithologist alexander wilson estimated one flock he observed contained over two billion birds decline of species was abrupt in 1871 a breeding colony was estimated to contain over a hundred million birds yet last individual in species was dead by 1914 although habitat loss was a contributing factor species is thought to have been massively over hunted being used as food for slaves and later poor in united states throughout 19thcentury dodo and its extinction was more typical of extinctions of pigeons in past like many species that colonise remote islands with few predators it lost much of its predator avoidance behaviour along with its ability to fly arrival of people along with a suite of other introduced species such as rats pigs and cats quickly spelled end for this species and all other island forms that have become extinct around 59 species of pigeons and doves are threatened with extinction today about 19 of all species most of these are tropical and live on islands all of species are threatened by introduced predators habitat loss hunting or a combination of these factors in some cases they may be extinct in wild as is socorro dove of socorro island mexico last seen in wild in 1972 driven to extinction by habitat loss and introduced feral cats in some areas a lack of knowledge means true status of a species is unknown negros fruit dove has not been seen since 1953 and may or may not be extinct and polynesian ground dove is classified as critically endangered as whether it survives or not on remote islands in far west of pacific ocean is unknown various conservation techniques are employed to prevent these extinctions including laws and regulations to control hunting pressure establishment of protected areas to prevent further habitat loss establishment of captive populations for reintroduction back into wild ex situ conservation and translocation of individuals to suitable habitats to create additional populations military thumb left dickin medal for pigeon royal cher ami was awarded croix de guerre pigeon
