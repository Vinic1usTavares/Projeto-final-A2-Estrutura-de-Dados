thumb upright 1 3 right page from manuscript of requiem in paradisum m 413 bibliotheque nationale paris gabriel faure composed his requiem in d minor op 48 between 1887 and 1890 choral orchestral setting of shortened catholic mass for dead in latin is best known of his large works its focus is on eternal rest and consolation faure s reasons for composing work are unclear but do not appear to have had anything to do with death of his parents in mid 1880s he composed work in late 1880s and revised it in 1890s finishing it in 1900 in seven movements work is scored for soprano and baritone soloists mixed choir orchestra and organ different from typical requiem settings full sequence is omitted replaced by its section final movement is based on a text that is not part of liturgy of funeral mass but of burial faure wrote of work everything i managed to entertain by way of religious illusion i put into my requiem which moreover is dominated from beginning to end by a very human feeling of faith in eternal rest steinberg 132 133 quote s cited date is 1921 piece premiered in its first version in 1888 in la madeleine in paris for a funeral mass a performance takes about 35 minutes history faure s reasons for composing his requiem are uncertain one possible impetus may have been death of his father in 1885 and his mother s death two years later on new year s eve 1887 however by time of his mother s death he had already begun work about which he later declared my requiem wasn t written for anything for pleasure if i may call it that letter from faure to composer maurice emmanuel quoted in nectoux 1991 p 116 english translation by roger nichols in original french faure s words were some english versions translate as for fun see steinberg p 135 earliest composed music included in requiem is libera me which faure wrote in 1877 as an independent work duchen p 81 thumb upright 1 1 organ by aristide cavaille coll in la madeleine paris where first version of requiem was first performed in 1887 88 faure composed first version of work which he called rutter p 3 with five movements and and but did not include his this version was first performed on 16 january 1888 for funeral of joseph lesoufache an architect at la madeleine paris composer conducted his work treble soloist was louis aubert in 1889 faure added portion of offertory and in 1890 he expanded offertory and added 1877 this second version was premiered on 21 january 1893 again at madeleine with faure conducting church authorities allowed no female singers and insisted on boy treble and alto choristers and soloists faure composed work with those voices in mind and had to employ them for his performances at madeleine but in concert hall unconstrained by ecclesiastical rules he preferred female singers for upper choral parts and solo in pie jesu nectoux 1991 p 122 in 1899 1900 score was reworked for full orchestra this final version was premiered at trocadero in paris on 12 july 1900 during exposition universelle paul conducted forces of 250 performers nectoux 1991 p 514 composer said of work everything i managed to entertain by way of religious illusion i put into my requiem which moreover is dominated from beginning to end by a very human feeling of faith in eternal rest he told an interviewer in 1924 requiem in its full orchestral version was performed at faure s own funeral it was not performed in united states until 1931 at a student concert at curtis institute of music in philadelphia it was first performed in england in 1936 steinberg p 135 text most of text is in latin except for kyrie which is koine greek as had become customary faure did not set gradual and tract sections of mass he followed a french baroque tradition by not setting requiem sequence only its section he slightly altered texts of introit kyrie pie jesu and but substantially changed text of offertory described below he did not set conclusion of and added two texts from order of burial and in paradisum nectoux pp 117 120 faure made changes to text of offertory at beginning he adds an o he changed deliver souls of all faithful departed to simply deliver souls of departed he replaced deliver them at beginning of next verse with a repetition of and he omitted third verse beginning he concludes with an added amen park 192 195 structure and scoring composition is

faure s work bears striking similarity to that of by brahms although faure set latin liturgical texts to music whereas brahms chose german bible quotations both works have seven movements both employ a baritone and a soprano soloist baritone singing with choir in movements 2 and 6 soprano in a central movement movement 4 in faure movement 5 in brahms where she appears with choir in both works four remaining movements are sung by choir alone whereas verdi for example has soloists sing several arias and ensembles in his requiem introit et kyrie thumb right introit and kyrie thumb copy of manuscript showing bars 4 7 of introit and kyrie similar to mozart s requiem work begins slowly in d minor after one measure of just d in instruments choir enters in six parts on d minor chord and stays on it in homophony for entire text eternal rest in gradual progression of harmony and a sudden a first climax is reached on and lasting light diminishing on a repeated may shine for them tenors repeat prayer alone for eternal rest on a simple melody sopranos continue similarly that praise is due in jerusalem then all voices exclaim hear kyrie begins with same melody that tenor sang before but now in unison of soprano alto and tenor repeated in following four measures in four part harmony call christe is strong and urgent first time repeated more softly a few more times final call appears pianissimo offertoire thumb right offertoire offertoire begins in b minor with a canon of alto and tenor in short succession on a simple modal melody with little ambitus in a prayer o lord jesus christ king of glory to free souls of departed from eternal punishment and deep lake ending in unison sequence is repeated beginning one step higher for next line and again one step higher for following more urgent call to jesus enforced by basses voices add only softly broken by rests what prayer is about that they may not fall into darkness baritone enters with offerings brought with praises beginning on one repeated note but asking with more melody make them lord transcend from death to life choir repeats first line of text on same motif as in beginning but in more elaborate polyphony in four parts concluded by an uplifting amen in b major sanctus thumb right sanctus holy in contrast with other compositions of mass and requiem where it is often illustrated with great vocal and instrumental forces particularly verdi s requiem is here expressed in extremely simple form sopranos sing softly in a very simple rising and falling melody of only three notes which male voices repeat accompanied by arpeggios on harp and a dreamy rising melody in violins sometimes just a solo violin pattern appears several times with melodies increasing in ambitus and volume reaching forte on highest orchestra changes tone dreamy accompaniment is replaced by firm and powerful major chords with a horn fanfare marked forte and male voices declare praise in highest this is answered by sopranos in diminuendo and music softens and reverts to dreamy harp arpeggios that it began with as violin melody floats upwards to final note in e flat major and full choir repeats with altos finally joining pie jesu thumb right pie jesu solo soprano or treble sings prayer to good jesus for everlasting rest one line of text is repeated three times first two times asking for requiem rest then intensified for requiem everlasting rest first call is a modal melody in b flat major of six measures second call is similar but reaching up higher words begin with more expansion but reach alternating between only two notes on two repetitions of last call begins as first and leads again to alternating between two notes in even lower range until last requiem has a gentle upward motion agnus dei thumb right agnus dei agnus dei in many settings of mass and requiem set with dark expression begins in f major with a fluent expansive melody in orchestra after six measures tenors sing a melody to it that gently rises and falls and repeats it almost same way then while motion in orchestra stays same key changes to minor mode and lamb of god is asked for rest in chords of daring harmonic progression then tenors without instrumental introduction repeat first line leading to a peaceful sopranos alone begins following section light eternal shine for them with a long then choir divided in six parts lets that light shimmer choir closes with a reprise of introit opening of mass requiem aeternam before orchestra picks up melody to close movement libera me thumb right libera me baritone soloist sings first section alone on a bass in an ostinato rhythm of two quarter notes a rest and upbeat to next two quarters he sings text free me lord from eternal death on that terrible day when heavens will move and earth when you come to judge world with fire embarking on a melody of wide range with some sharp leaps text is continued by choir in four parts in homophony i am trembling in more motion day of wrath is expressed by fortissimo chords giving way to prayer for rest in same motion but piano with a crescendo on but suddenly softening on a last then choir repeats opening statement of baritone fully in unison soloist then choir end movement softly repeating in paradisum thumb right in paradisum text of last movement is taken from order of burial may angels lead you to paradise rests on a continuous shimmering motion in fast broken triads in orchestra sopranos sing a rising expressive melody enriched by chords of other voices divided in six parts on final jerusalem a second thought is again sung by sopranos filled on last words by others versions faure revised and enlarged requiem in years between its first performance in 1888 and publication of final version in 1901 latter is scored for full orchestra since 1970s attempts have been made by several faure scholars to reconstruct composer s earlier versions scored for smaller orchestral forces first version five of seven sections of requiem were completed by january 1888 and performed that month at madeleine for funeral of architect joseph lesoufache nectoux 1991 p 116 this version lacked and which faure added at some time in following decade nectoux 1991 p 117 predates rest of requiem having been composed eleven years earlier as a baritone solo forces required for original 1888 version were a choir about forty in number consisting of boys and men madeleine did not admit female choristers solo boy treble harp timpani organ strings solo violin divided violas divided cellos and basses for a performance at madeleine in may 1888 faure added horn and trumpet parts shrock p 431 1893 version faure continued to work intermittently on requiem and by 1893 he judged score ready to be published although proposed publication fell through several attempts have been made to reconstruct score as it was in 1893 faure specialist jean michel nectoux began working on it in 1970s langham smith richard review requiem 1893 version by gabriel faure ed john rutter music letters vol 71 no 1 february 1990 pp 143 144 but first edition to be published was by english conductor john rutter in 1989 nectoux s edition jointly edited with roger delage was published in 1994 they had advantage of access to important source material unavailable to rutter a set of orchestral parts discovered in 1968 in madeleine and a score made in 1890s by a bass in madeleine choir and annotated by faure music and letters judged rutter edition makeshift and lacking in standards of scholarship one expects from a university press musical times considered nectoux and delage edition invaluable thomson andrew review faure s requiem 1893 version ed jean michel nectoux roger delage musical times vol 136 no 1834 december 1995 pp 670 671 faure s own manuscript survives but as critic andrew thomson puts it waters were muddied by his on original mss adding two bassoons and two more horns and trumpets together with modifications of cello and bass parts reviewing nectoux and delage edition thomson wrote of several pleasant surprises including restoration of urgent timpani rolls underlining christe eleison and ethereal harp chords which so enhance spiritual atmosphere of lux aeterna for 1893 version a baritone solo two bassoons four horns and two trumpets are added to original scoring when possible faure employed a mixed choir and a female soprano soloist partly because soprano lines particularly solo in are difficult to sing and demand excellent breath control easier for adult women than for boys duchen p 83 final version at end of 1890s faure s publisher julien hamelle suggested that composer should requiem for performance in concert halls intimate sound of earlier versions was effective in liturgical performances but for large concert venues and large choral societies of time a larger orchestra was required autograph of resulting 1900 version does not survive and critics have speculated whether faure who was not greatly interested in orchestration delegated some or all of revision to one of his pupils many details of augmented score differ from faure s own earlier amendments to original 1888 manuscript new score was published in 1901 at same time as a vocal score edited by one of faure s favourite pupils jean roger ducasse thomson and duchen p 125 and some critics have speculated that he reorchestrated full score at faure s instigation ford pp 299 302 others have questioned whether so skilled an orchestrator as roger ducasse would have perpetrated such pointlessly inconspicuous doublings or left uncorrected many misprints in 1901 edition alan blyth speculates that work may have been done by someone in hamelle s firm blyth p 217 misprints have been corrected in later editions notably those by roger fiske and paul inwood 1978 and nectoux 2001 gilbert david review of requiem op 48 pour soli choeur et orchestre symphonique version de concert 1900

only in two bassoons four horns two trumpets only in kyrie and three trombones timpani only in harp organ strings with only a single section of violins but divided violas and cellos as before nectoux has expressed view that what he terms church 1893 and concert 1900 1901 versions of requiem should both be performed choice of edition being dictated by size of venue it is not clear whether composer favoured either version over other blyth comments all of his comments about requiem ring truer as descriptions of 1888 and 1894 sic versions than of published text of 1901 faure however complained in
