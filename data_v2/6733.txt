two aircraft carriers were built for imperial japanese navy ijn in late 1930s completed shortly before start of pacific war in 1941 they have been called arguably best aircraft carriers in world when built peattie p 243 with exception of battle of midway they participated in every major naval action of pacific war including attack on pearl harbor indian ocean raid battle of coral sea and guadalcanal campaign their inexperienced air groups were relegated to airfield attacks during attack on pearl harbor but they later sank two of four fleet carriers lost by united states navy during war in addition to one elderly british light carrier sister ships returned to japan after battle of coral sea one to repair damage and other to replace aircraft lost during battle so neither ship participated in battle of midway in june 1942 after catastrophic losses of four carriers during that battle they formed bulk of ijn s carrier force for rest of war as such they were primary counterattack force deployed against american invasion of guadalcanal in battle of eastern solomons in august two months later they attempted to support a major offensive by imperial japanese army to push united states marines off guadalcanal this resulted in battle of santa cruz islands where they crippled one american carrier and damaged another in exchange for damage to and a light carrier neither attempt succeeded and japanese withdrew their remaining forces from guadalcanal in early 1943 using air group from to provide cover for next year sisters trained before moving south to defend against any american attempt to retake mariana islands or philippines shokaku was sunk by an american submarine during battle of philippine sea in june 1944 as americans invaded marianas and zuikaku was sacrificed as a decoy four months later during battle of cape engano background and description thumb left right elevation and plan view of shokaku in 1942 two shokaku class carriers were ordered in 1937 as part of 3rd naval armaments supplement program no longer restricted by provisions of washington naval treaty which had expired in december 1936 and with relaxed budgetary limitations ijn sought qualitative superiority over their foreign counterparts drawing on experience with their existing carriers navy general staff laid out an ambitious requirement for a ship that equaled 96 aircraft capacity of and speed of and defensive armament of kaga new ship was also to have superior protection and range over any of existing carriers lengerer p 90 basic design section of navy technical department decided upon an enlarged and improved hiryu design with island on port side amidships after construction of ships began naval air technical department natd began having second thoughts about location of island because it thought that portside location of island on hiryu and akagi had an adverse impact on airflow over flight deck another issue identified was that amidships position shortened available landing area which had potential to be problematic in future as aircraft landing speeds increased with their growing weight to verify these assumptions natd filmed hundreds of takeoffs and landings aboard akagi in october november 1938 and decided to move island over to starboard side and further forward about one third of length from bow shokaku was furthest advanced by this point and supporting structure for bridge had already been built rebuilding it would have delayed construction so it was left in place changes that had to be made consisted of a widening of flight deck opposite island and a corresponding narrowing on starboard side and addition of of ballast on port side to re balance ship lengerer pp 91 93 ships had a length of overall a beam of a draft of at deep load and a moulded depth of they displaced at deep load based on hydrodynamic research conducted for s shokaku class received a bulbous bow and twin rudders both of which

ten transverse arrestor wires were installed on flight deck that could stop a aircraft if aircraft missed those it could be stopped by one of three crash barricades although space and weight were allocated for two aircraft catapults their development was not completed before shokaku class ships were sunk ships were designed with two superimposed hangars upper hangar was about long and had a width that varied between it had a height of while lower hangar was high and only usable by fighters lower hangar was about shorter than upper one and its width ranged from together they had a total area of lengerer pp 93 95 97 98 each hangar could be subdivided by five or six fire curtains and they were fitted with fire fighting foam dispensers on each side lower hangar was also fitted with a

transported between hangars and flight deck by three elevators that took 15 seconds to go from lower hangar to flight deck forward elevator was larger than others to allow aircraft that had just landed to be moved below without folding their wings and measured other elevators were narrower lengerer p 94 ships mounted a crane on starboard side of flight deck abreast rear elevator when collapsed it was flush with flight deck dickson p 17 shokaku class carriers were initially intended to have an air group of 96 including 24 aircraft in reserve these were envisioned as 12 mitsubishi

mounts on each side of flight deck gun was standard japanese light aa weapon during world war ii but it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it largely ineffective according to historian mark stille weapon had many faults including an inability to handle high speed targets because it could not be trained or elevated fast enough by either hand or power its sights were inadequate for high speed targets it possessed excessive vibration and muzzle blast stille 2007 p 51 these guns had an effective range of and a ceiling of at an elevation of 85 degrees effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute because of frequent need to change 15 round magazines campbell p 200 type 96 guns were controlled by six type 95 directors one for every pair of mounts in june 1942 shokaku and zuikaku had their anti aircraft armament augmented with six more triple 25 mm mounts two each at bow and stern and one each fore and aft of island bow and stern groups each received a type 95 director in october another triple 25 mm mount was added at bow and stern and 10 single mounts were added before battle of philippine sea in june 1944 after battle zuikakus anti aircraft armament was reinforced with 26 single mounts for 25 mm type 96 gun bringing total of 25 mm barrels to 96 60 in 20 triple mounts and 36 single mounts these guns were supplemented by

ducol steel lengerer p 100 shokakus were first japanese carriers to incorporate a torpedo belt system based on model experiments that began in 1935 it consisted of a liquid loaded sandwich of compartments outboard of torpedo bulkhead experiments showed that a narrow liquid loaded compartment was necessary to distribute force of a torpedo or mine s detonation along torpedo bulkhead by spreading it across full width of bulkhead and to stop splinters created by detonation outboard of this were two compartments intended to dissipate force of gases of detonation including watertight compartment of double bottom two innermost compartments were intended to be filled with fuel oil that would be replaced by water as it was consumed torpedo bulkhead itself consisted of an outer ducol plate thick that was riveted to a plate ijn expected torpedo bulkhead to be damaged in an attack and placed a thin holding bulkhead slightly inboard to prevent any leaks from reaching ships vitals
