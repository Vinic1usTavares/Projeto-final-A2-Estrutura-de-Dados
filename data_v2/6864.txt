apart from these allegations reibey s wife s health had been declining his property had been declining in value and he wrote that he had been considering relinquishing for a while macfarlane p 6 after only a few years lack of funds provided left only one person working on site all work ceased in 1870 by which time walls were unfinished and building still lacked a roof though church was incomplete both reibey and his wife catherine were buried in a graveyard at building s rear macfarlane p 7 church remained incomplete for over ninety years by 1957 anglican services were being held in st stephens a wooden church next to apparent ruin around this time some in church showed interest in completion of old structure partly due to approaching centenary of construction beginning in april of

assistant bishop of tasmania church of good shepherd p 6 original architects plans had been preserved though they were close to disintegration and were largely followed in subsequent construction work

feather inn red feather inn is a heritage listed building in hadspen s main street it was built as a coaching inn and in 21st century has been used for a restaurant and accommodation building s frontage is a substantial sandstone single storey building land falls away sharply from street and building s rear has two storeys rising affluence in 1840s had enabled growth of coach transport industry when built red feather inn was first horse change point on road from launceston away to deloraine and it was one of colony s earliest coaching inns it was built starting in 1842 for local police magistrate charles arthur it was built by john also builder of macquarie house in launceston s civic square using convict hewn sandstone blocks dyer p 5 inn was first licensed in 1844 and was at first successful in only a few decades its fortunes declined when a rail line was built from launceston reaching nearby carrick in 1869 g s o t p vi economy of rail transport took goods and passengers away forcing wagons from road this reduced demand for coaching inns and led to a general decline in traffic through and business in town as of 2004 it was run as a restaurant and after a 2008 refurbishment has been used for accommodation and a cooking school bridges thumb site of reibey s ford and subsequent bridges flooding of south esk river and need for a river crossing have constrained transport in town for much of its history south esk now crossed by a bridge on meander valley highway separates town from settlements further west and unusually high floods can cut highway on town s east when it is submerged at beams hollow river was first crossed by a ford known as reibey s ford near entally house due to variability in its flow this ford was frequently impassable requiring traffic to make significant detours until town s centre was bypassed via a concrete bridge flooding of ford or bridge required diversion as far as longford away thomas haydock reibey installed a punt at crossing in 1828 by a specially passed government act he was allowed to charge a toll for its use tenders were called for in 1836 for design and construction of a bridge at village of hadspen five years later colony s government passed reibey s ford act to facilitate construction of a bridge act specified that of ps1500 cost for bridge ps500 was to be paid by government and remainder by thomas haydock reibey to recover costs reibey was allowed to charge a toll assisted by a toll house and by turnpikes at bridge s ends on construction toll was mandated as 1d per person 1s per wagon or carriage 4d per unladen beast and 1 2d per calf sheep pig or lamb npws p 3 elder reibey died before bridge was completed and his son and executor thomas reibey acquired his father s rights collecting tolls after bridge was completed von stieglitz 1968 p 37 toll was to run for lesser of 30 years or whatever time it took to pay for original bridge construction costs plus an annual 15 interest von stieglitz 1968 p 38 wooden bridge was completed by november 1843 and within a little over a year tolls had raised 453 pounds it was known as reibey s bridge and was narrow fitting only a single wagon with a single chain each side for safety a fact that caused loss of at least one valuable horse kelly p 2 left thumb meander valley highway s bridge over south esk at hadspen 2012 bridge became noted for its insecure state lack of rails a particular issue and it was referred to as dangerous and unsightly bridge s safety problems were often reported in newspapers of day including cornwall chronicle on 15 and 25 september 1852 and 3 june 1854 a new bridge higher than one it replaced was under construction in 1878 this new structure was long had a wooden frame and deck standing on stone piers floods continued to overflow hadspen s only bridge floods in 1893 may have been above bridge s approach road s level both bridge and approach roads were extensively damaged and of guard rails were carried away by 1911 river was crossed on same site with a steel bridge this new structure had concrete buttresses and a wooden roadway in march of that year floods over topped it by approximately and five of bridge s seven spans went down girders were broken piers sheared through and some swept into river bridge was repaired later in year and stood for another half century over time particularly after floods there were calls for bridge to be raised though expense of work and only occasional nature of flooding was cited in defence of bridge s adequacy when river flooded bridge it also often flooded beams ford on other side of hadspen temporarily cutting off all road access to town minister for land and works had approved work on raising it in 1939 but this was postponed indefinitely due to world war ii raising or renewal of bridge was again being investigated in 1946 river again flooded over bridge in july 1952 first time since mid 1940s and timber deck was still being repaired into 1953 last and latest bridge was constructed as part of a bypass of centre of hadspen by 1978 bass highway crossed river further upstream and old main road was no longer a
