an implicature is something speaker suggests or implies with an utterance even though it is not literally expressed implicatures can aid in communicating more efficiently than by explicitly saying everything we want to communicate this phenomenon is part of pragmatics a of linguistics philosopher h p grice coined term in 1975 grice distinguished conversational implicatures which arise because speakers are expected to respect general rules of conversation and conventional ones which are tied to certain words such as but or therefore take for example following exchange a to passer by i am out of gas b there is a gas station round corner here b does not say but conversationally implicates that gas station is open because otherwise his utterance would not be relevant in context conversational implicatures are classically seen as contrasting with entailments they are not necessary consequences of what is said but are defeasible cancellable so b could continue without contradiction b but unfortunately it s closed today an example of a conventional implicature is donovan is poor but happy where word but implicates a sense of contrast between being poor and being happy later linguists introduced refined and different definitions of term leading to somewhat different ideas about which parts of information conveyed by an utterance are actually implicatures and which aren t conversational implicature grice was primarily concerned with conversational implicatures like all implicatures these are part of what is communicated in other words conclusions addressee draws from an utterance although they were not actively conveyed by communicator are never implicatures according to grice conversational implicatures arise because communicating people are expected by their addressees to obey maxims of conversation and overarching cooperative principle which basically states that people are expected to communicate in a cooperative helpful way standard implicatures simplest situation is where addressee can draw conclusions from assumption that communicator obeys maxims as in following examples symbol means implicates quality it is raining i believe and have adequate evidence that it is raining moore s paradox observation that sentence it is raining but i don t believe that it is raining sounds contradictory although it isn t from a strictly logical point of view has been explained as a contradiction to this type of implicature however as implicatures can be cancelled see below this explanation is dubious quantity i a well known class of quantity implicatures are scalar implicatures prototypical examples include words specifying quantities such as some few or many john ate some of cookies john didn t eat all of cookies here use of some semantically entails that more than one cookie was eaten it does not entail but implicates that not every cookie was eaten or at least that speaker does not know whether any cookies are left reason for this implicature is that saying some when one could say all would be less than informative enough in most circumstances general idea is that communicator is expected to make strongest possible claim implicating negation of any stronger claim lists of expressions that give rise to scalar implicatures sorted from strong to weak are known as horn scales all many some few four three two one cardinal number terms always often sometimes and or necessarily possibly hot warm etc negation reverses these scales as in this example she won t necessarily get job she will possibly get job not possibly is stronger than not necessarily and implicature follows from double negation she will not not possibly get job here are some further implicatures that can be classified as scalar i slept on a boat yesterday boat was not mine this is a common construction where indefinite article indicates that referent is not closely associated with speaker because stronger claim i slept on my boat yesterday is not made flag is green flag is completely green if this is strongest possible claim it follows that flag has no other features because flag is green and some other colour would be stronger in other words if it did contain other features this utterance would not be informative enough quantity ii second quantity maxim seems to work in opposite direction as first communicator makes a weaker claim from which a stronger one is implicated implicatures arising from this maxim enrich information contained in utterance he drank a bottle of vodka and fell into a stupor he drank a bottle of vodka and consequently fell into a stupor i lost a book yesterday book was mine there is extensive literature but no consensus on question which of two quantity maxims is in operation in which circumstances i e why i lost a book yesterday implicates that book was speaker s while i slept on a boat yesterday usually implicates that boat wasn t speaker s relation relevance that cake looks delicious i would like a piece of that cake this statement taken by itself would be irrelevant in most situations so addressee concludes that speaker had something more in mind introductory example also belongs here a i am out of gas b there is a gas station round corner gas station is open manner iv cowboy jumped on his horse and rode into sunset cowboy performed these two actions in this order being orderly includes relating events in order they occurred clashes of maxims sometimes it is impossible to obey all maxims at once suppose that a and b are planning a holiday in france and a suggests they visit their old acquaintance gerard a where does gerard live b somewhere in south of france b does not know where exactly gerard lives b s answer violates first maxim of quantity as it does not contain sufficient information to plan their route but if b does not know exact location she cannot obey this maxim and also maxim of quality hence implicature maxims can also be blatantly disobeyed or flouted giving rise to another kind of conversational implicature this is possible because addressees will go to great lengths in saving their assumption that communicator did in fact perhaps on a deeper level obey maxims and cooperative principle many figures of speech can be explained by this mechanism quality i saying something that is obviously false can produce irony meiosis hyperbole and metaphor when she heard about rumour she exploded as it is improbable that she really exploded and it is highly unlikely that speaker wanted to lie or was simply mistaken addressee has to assume utterance was meant to be metaphorical quantity i utterances that are not informative on surface include tautologies they have no logical content and hence no entailments but can still be used to convey information via implicatures war is war damning with faint praise also works by flouting first quantity maxim consider following testimonial for a student dear sir mr x s command of english is excellent and his attendance at tutorials has been regular yours etc implicature here is that student is no good since teacher has nothing better to say about him relation relevance b s answer in following exchange does not seem to be relevant so a concludes that b wanted to convey something else a mrs jenkins is an old don t you think b lovely weather for march isn t it watch out her nephew is standing right behind you or like manner iii this utterance is much more long winded than miss singer sang an aria from rigoletto and therefore maxim be brief miss singer produced a series of sounds corresponding closely to score of an aria from rigoletto what miss singer produced cannot really be described as an aria from rigoletto particularized versus generalized implicatures conversational implicatures that arise only in specific contexts are called particularized while those that are not or only slightly context dependent are generalized many of examples above rely on some context making them particularized implicatures thus war is war can refer to different properties of war or things expected to happen during war depending on situation in which it is uttered prototypical examples of generalized implicatures are scalar implicatures particularized implicatures are by far more common kind properties grice attributed a number of properties to conversational implicatures they are defeasible cancellable meaning that implicature may be cancelled by further information or context take examples from above that cake looks delicious i would like a piece of that cake versus that cake looks delicious but it looks too rich for me implicature defeated a did john eat some of cookies b he certainly did eat some of cookies in fact he ate them all they are usually non detachable in sense that they cannot be detached by rephrasing utterance as they are consequences of meaning and not wording obvious exception are implicatures following from maxim of manner which explicitly relies on phrasing thus following utterances have same implicature as above that fruit cake there looks dessert you brought is really mouthwatering conversational implicatures are calculable they are supposed to be formally derivable from literal meaning of utterance in combination with cooperative principle and maxims as well as contextual information and background knowledge they are non conventional that is they are not part of conventional lexical and logical meaning of a sentence lastly they can be context dependent as mentioned above opting out of cooperative principle cooperative principle and maxims of conversation are not mandatory a communicator can choose not to be cooperative she can opt out of cooperative principle by giving appropriate clues such as saying my lips are sealed or for example during a cross examination at court in such situations no conversational implicatures arise modifications to grice s maxims laurence horn various modifications to grice s maxims have been proposed by other linguists so called neo laurence horn s approach keeps maxims of quality and replaces other maxims with just two principles q principle make your contribution sufficient say as much as you can given quality maxims and r principle r principle make your contribution necessary say no more than you must given q principle q principle replaces first quantity maxim make your contribution as informative as is required and first and second manner maxims avoid obscurity and ambiguity and is taken to serve interests of hearer who wants as much information as possible it thus gives rise to classical scalar implicatures r principle subsumes second quantity maxim do not make your contribution more informative than is required maxim of relation and remaining manner maxims be brief and orderly and serves interests of speaker who wants to communicate with as little effort as possible these two principles have opposite effects analogous to grice s two maxims of quantity to determine which of two principles is used horn introduces concept of division of pragmatic labor unmarked shorter standard more lexicalized phrasings tend to r implicate a standard meaning and marked more wordy unusual less lexicalized phrasings tend to q implicate a nonstandard meaning she stopped machine she stopped machine in usual way r implicature a stronger more specific claim is implicated she got machine to stop she did not stop machine in usual way q implicature stronger claim is negated as with scalar implicatures horn s account has been criticised for misrepresenting speaker s and hearer s interests realistically hearer does not want a lot of information but just relevant information and speaker is more interested in being understood than in having little work to do furthermore as in grice s theory there is often no explanation for when which of two principles is used i e why i lost a book yesterday has q implicature or scalar implicature that book was speaker s while i slept on a boat yesterday r implicates that boat wasn t speaker s stephen levinson stephen levinson s approach is similar to horn s his q principle is basically same but its antagonist i principle only takes place of second quantity maxim there is a separate m principle more or less corresponding to third and fourth manner maxims as well as to horn s division of pragmatic labor but there is no replacement for maxim of relation m principle indicate abnormal situations by using marked expressions that contrast with those you would use to describe corresponding normal stereotypical situations levinson subsequently developed a theory of generalized conversational implicature gci based on q principle he argues that are distinct from particularized conversational implicatures in that they are inferred via a specialized set of principles and rules that are always in force independent of context if a gci does not arise in some specific situations this is because it is blocked under certain circumstances according to levinson criticism apart from mentioned problem with two opposing quantity maxims a number of issues with grice s conversational implicatures has been raised do implicatures contrast with entailments while grice described conversational implicatures as contrasting with entailments there has since been dissent a did you drive somewhere yesterday b i drove to london here b implicates via maxim of relation that he drove somewhere as this is fitting answer to a s question but this information is also entailed by his answer are quantity implicatures actually implicatures at least some scalar and other quantity implicatures seem not to be implicatures at all but semantic enrichments of utterance what is variously described as an explicature or in literature for example kent bach argues that a sentence like john ate some of cookies does not implicate john didn t eat all of cookies because latter isn t a claim separate from first rather speaker just has a single meaning in mind namely john ate some but not all of cookies likewise robyn carston considers cases like he drank a bottle of vodka and consequently fell into a stupor explicatures however she considers question of classical scalar implicatures some few many to be unsettled can metaphors only arise when first maxim of quality is flouted as experimental evidence shows it is not necessary to evaluate truth of an utterance s literal meaning in order to recognise a metaphor an example of a metaphor that is also literally true is a chess player telling his opponent in appropriate circumstances your defence is an impregnable castle are events always related in order apparent counterexamples to maxim be orderly have been found such as this a my wife wants me to remove our carpets she is afraid she might trip and hurt herself but i think she is just b well i don t know john broke his leg and he tripped over a doormat are there particularized and generalized implicatures carston observes that particularized and generalized conversational implicatures aren t separate categories rather there is a continuum from implicatures that are highly dependent on a specific situation which is unlikely to happen twice to ones that occur very frequently in her view distinction has no theoretical value since all implicatures are derived from same principles can implicatures only arise when communicator is cooperative take above example about gerard s place of residence if b knows where gerard lives and a knows this we also get an implicature although a different one a where does gerard live b somewhere in south of france b does not want to say where exactly gerard lives b does not want to visit gerard this contradicts grice s notion that implicatures can only arise when communicator observes cooperative principle implicature in relevance theory thumb right dan sperber who developed relevance theory together with deirdre wilson in framework known as relevance theory implicature is defined as a counterpart to explicature explicatures of an utterance are communicated assumptions that are developed from its logical form intuitively literal meaning by supplying additional information from context by ambiguous expressions assigning referents to pronouns and other variables and so on all communicated assumptions that cannot be obtained in this way are implicatures for example if peter says susan told me that her kiwis were too sour in context that susan participated in a fruit grower s contest hearer might arrive at explicature susan told peter that kiwifruit she susan grew were too sour for judges at fruit grower s contest now assume that peter and hearer both have access to contextual information that susan is ambitious if she loses at something she s pretty downcast and that peter intended hearer to activate this knowledge then this is an implicated premise hearer can now draw contextual implications that susan needs to be cheered up peter wants me to ring susan and cheer her up if peter intended hearer to come to these implications they are implicated conclusions implicated premises and conclusions are two types of implicatures in relevance theoretical sense there is no sharp cutoff between implicatures which are part of intentional meaning of an utterance and unintended implications addressee may draw for example there may be no consensus whether peter wants me to buy susan some chocolate to cheer her up is an implicature of above utterance we say this assumption is only weakly implicated while susan needs to be cheered up is essential for utterance to achieve relevance for addressee and is therefore strongly implicated principle of relevance both explicatures and implicatures follow from communicative principle of relevance which unlike grice s cooperative principle is not optional but is always in force whenever someone communicates it is descriptive of not prescriptive for communicative acts consequently implicatures can arise even if or precisely because communicator is uncooperative relevance theory can therefore effortlessly account for above example about gerard if b knows where gerard lives and somewhere in south of france is most relevant answer compatible with b s preferences it follows that b is unwilling to disclose his knowledge distinction from explicatures all pragmatically derived information including parts of explicatures that are supplied from context is calculable and defeasible therefore different criteria are needed in relevance theory to identify implicatures sperber and wilson originally assumed that implicatures can be sufficiently defined as communicated assumptions that are not developed from an utterance s logical form as noted above on this account loose language use saying this steak is raw to express that it is really undercooked is a case of implicature as are hyperbole and metaphor carston has argued for a more formal approach namely that an utterance s implicatures cannot entail any of its explicatures if they did resulting redundancies would cause unnecessary effort on part of addressee which would run against principle of relevance an example of pragmatically derived information that has traditionally been seen as an implicature but must be an explicature according to carston s reasoning has already been mentioned above he drank a bottle of vodka and fell into a stupor he drank a bottle of vodka and consequently fell into a stupor however there has since been found at least one example of an implicature that does entail an explicature showing that this test is not infallible a did jim go to party b i don t know but i can tell you that if anybody was there jim was there a somebody was there this i know for sure i saw john going there jim was there entails somebody was there another possible criterion is that explicatures but not implicatures can be embedded in negations if clauses and other grammatical constructions thus sentences susan did not tell peter that her kiwis were too sour if susan has told peter that her kiwis were too sour she was just fishing for compliments are equivalent to susan did not tell peter that kiwifruit she susan grew were too sour for judges if susan told peter that kiwifruit she susan grew were too sour for judges she was just fishing for compliments respectively showing embedded clause to be an explicature on other hand they are not equivalent to embeddings of mentioned implicature susan does not need to be cheered up if susan needs to be cheered up she is just fishing for compliments these embedding tests also show vodka bottle example to be an explicature however there is still no generally accepted criterion to reliably distinguish explicatures and implicatures poetic effects metaphors can be an efficient means to communicate a wide range of weak implicatures for example jane is my anchor in storm can weakly implicate that jane is reliable and stable in difficult circumstances helpful in calming speaker and so on even if speaker had no specific set of assumptions in mind this information can give addressee an idea of jane s significance to speaker s life speaking generally utterances convey poetic effects if they achieve all or most of their relevance through a range of weak implicatures for example repetition in my childhood days are gone gone does not add to utterance s explicature prompting addressee to search for implicatures to do so he has to activate contextual background information about childhood memories irony is seen as an entirely different phenomenon in relevance theory see relevance theory interpretation vs description for an explanation criticism levinson sees relevance theory as too reductionist as a single principle cannot account for large variety of implicatures in his view in particular he argues that this theory cannot account for generalized implicatures because it is inherently a theory of context dependency this argument is countered by carston as mentioned above also levinson asserts that relevance theory cannot explain how we arrive at implicated premises via creative processes foundations of relevance theory have been criticised because relevance in technical sense it is used there cannot be measured so it is not possible to say what exactly is meant by relevant enough and most relevant carston generally agrees with relevance theoretic concept of implicature but argues that sperber and wilson let implicatures do too much work mentioned embedding tests not only categorize utterances on likes of vodka bottle example as explicatures but also loose use and metaphors if your steak is raw you can send it back if jane is your anchor in storm you should let her help you now she does not explain metaphors wide range of effects with weak implicatures instead she advocates idea that meaning of words and phrases can be adapted to fit specific contexts in other words new concepts that differ from standard meaning can be constructed ad hoc during communication in above metaphor phrase anchor in storm has many slightly different ad hoc meanings and no specific one is exclusively communicated carston also discusses possibility that metaphors cannot be fully explained by communicated assumptions at all be they explicatures or implicatures but with other concepts such as evoking mental images sensations and feelings conventional implicature conventional implicatures briefly introduced but never elaborated on by grice are independent of cooperative principle and four maxims they are instead tied to conventional meaning of certain particles and phrases such as but although however nevertheless moreover anyway whereas after all even yet still besides verbs such as deprive spare and possibly also to grammatical structures such words and phrases are also said to trigger conventional implicatures in addition they are not defeasible but have force of entailments an example donovan is poor but happy this sentence is logically equivalent to that is it has same truth conditions as donovan is poor and happy in addition word but implicates a sense of contrast taken together sentence means approximately surprisingly donovan is happy in spite of being poor verbs deprive and spare also have same truth conditions but different conventional implicatures compare i have deprived you of my lecture attending my lecture would have been desirable for you i have spared you my lecture attending my lecture would not have been desirable for you thumb yewberry more accurately aril of european yew non restrictive supplements such as following adjective phrase have been argued to be grammatical structures that produce conventional implicatures yewberry jelly toxic in extreme will give you an awful stomachache implicature here is that yewberry jelly is toxic in extreme other such constructions are non restrictive relative clauses and as ravel as a frenchman nevertheless wrote spanish style music criticism because of mentioned differences to conversational and relevance theoretical implicatures it has been argued that conventional implicatures aren t implicatures at all but rather secondary propositions or entailments of an utterance under this view sentence about donovan would have primary proposition donovan is poor and happy and secondary proposition there is a contrast between poverty and happiness sentence about yewberry jelly contains two propositions yewberry jelly will give you an awful stomachache and yewberry jelly is toxic in extreme other analyses of but and similar words have been proposed takes above sentence to mean donovan is poor and i suggest this contrasts happy and calls it a tacit i e silent implied performative blakemore claims that but does not convey a proposition and does not work by encoding a concept at all but by constraining addressee s interpretation procedure in our example but indicates that donovan is happy is relevant specifically as a denial of an expectation created by donovan is poor and rules out possibility that it is relevant in any other way this expectation must be on lines of poor people are unhappy blakemore s idea that not only concepts but also procedures can be encoded in language has
