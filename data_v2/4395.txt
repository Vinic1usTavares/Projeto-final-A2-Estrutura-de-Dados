team to match their third division opponents torquay united for fighting spirit and to produce a 90 minute performance players complied leading 4 0 at half time they finished as comfortable 7 1 winners in fourth round leyton orient who had beaten birmingham at same stage four years earlier posed more of a potential problem in reality win was equally comfortable eddy brown added two goals to his hat trick at torquay a tight local derby game followed on a snow covered frozen pitch at hawthorns in first half goalkeeper gil merrick and his defence did well to keep west bromwich albion out trevor smith had to clear a ronnie allen header from under crossbar in second half birmingham wasted several chances before a one two with brown allowed peter murphy to score from edge of penalty area in sixth round birmingham faced arsenal on a muddy pitch in order to relieve tension on way to important matches manager turner used to encourage players to sing scotsman alex govan s contribution

first half goals from gordon astall and murphy birmingham went 3 0 up through brown with twenty minutes left two minutes later arsenal scored from birmingham were unsettled and merrick needed to make a fine save from vic groves to prevent a second arsenal goal turner felt motivation from such a powerful song played a significant part in day s victory semi final opponents sunderland found birmingham without hard man left half roy warhurst who had injured a thigh against arsenal but in jack badham they had an effective replacement club s official history describes this as probably finest team performance against top class opposition ever produced by a birmingham team they attacked from kick off and nullified sunderland s pressure and threat of len shackleton noel kinsey scored early and second goal came from a passing move down left side finished by astall as sunderland threw everyone forward which left them open at back brown picked up a long through ball and lobbed goalkeeper astall said afterwards that he was surprised they had not scored five matthews complete record p 28 and brown wrote in his newspaper column now sunderland found out how hard it is to score against this terrific defence of ours not for nothing have we scored 18 goals against two both of them freaks conceded in five ties all away from home what can i say to do justice to that brilliant goalkeeper gil merrick to wonderful young trevor smith and to matchless jeff hall and ken green once again they mixed old cement and constructed that brilliant wall of a defence sunderland would have needed to call in a firm of demolition contractors to destroy it birmingham city thus reached final without playing a single tie at home a feat which had never previously been accomplished build up 1956 final was second time that birmingham had reached showpiece match having lost 2 1 to west bromwich albion in 1931 manchester city were appearing in final for sixth time and for second consecutive year they had won cup twice previously in 1904 and 1934 and had been beaten in final three times in 1926 1933 and 1955 though birmingham had less pedigree in competition press viewed them as favourites daily telegraph contrasted birmingham s dazzling cup run with manner in which manchester city scraped through describing midlanders as firm favourites interviews with players were typically in tone manchester city s bobby johnstone opined that even an unbiased fan must regard manchester city with favour whereas birmingham s len boyd gauged opinion quite differently they say birmingham city are hottest cup favourites since wolves crashed to portsmouth in 1939 during 1950s fa cup final was only football match to be televised nationally resulting in heightened media attention for players and clubs involved players union successfully requested an additional ps5 per man for appearing in a televised match first time such appearance money had been paid birmingham s players signed

rowlands trautmann biography p 177 eight players who had played in previous year s final were selected in starting line up press speculation in run up to match pondered which of don revie and bobby johnstone would be selected as johnstone had been suffering from a calf problem bill leivers was also an injury doubt due to a twisted ankle and billy spurdle had a boil on his left arm lanced on eve of final consequently manchester city line up was not named until morning of match leivers was passed fit after having two pain killing injections but contrary to press expectations spurdle missed out this meant both revie and johnstone appeared in line up johnstone switching to outside right birmingham also had doubts over their selection captain len boyd had for some time been suffering from a debilitating back problem and relied on injections to keep him playing he missed five of last seven games of season matthews complete record p 191 but was passed fit on wednesday before game fellow

paul seized one last opportunity to stir emotion within players by stopping raising his fist and shouting if we don t fucking win you ll get some of this rowlands trautmann biography p 178 paul led his team into tunnel and they lined up with birmingham players he put fear of god into everyone including terrified opponents by suddenly stopping holding up his fist and shouting if we don t fucking win you ll get some of this match summary both teams employed formation typical of era two full backs a centre half two wing halves two outside forwards two inside forwards and a centre forward however their tactical approaches differed birmingham described by times as using iron determination powerful tackling and open direct methods employed traditional english approach of getting ball to outside forwards as quickly as possible whereas manchester city adopted tactics inspired by hungarian team which had soundly beaten england at wembley three years before system involved using don revie in a deeper position than a traditional centre forward in order to draw a defender out of position and was therefore known as revie plan as both teams first choice colours were blue each team wore their change strip to prevent confusion manchester city therefore wore maroon and birmingham city wore white birmingham won toss and manchester city kicked off birmingham goal came under pressure almost immediately within a minute a far post cross from roy clarke narrowly eluded hayes two corners followed second resulting in a shot by roy paul next attack in third minute resulted in opening goal revie began move exchanging passes with clarke and back heeling for unmarked hayes to sweep ball past gil merrick to put manchester city ahead birmingham s confidence was shaken resulting in a series of manchester city corners and a chance for hayes but they fought back to equalise in 15th minute astall slipped ball to brown who helped it forward it rebounded off a manchester city defender into path of welsh international inside forward noel kinsey who fired home via trautmann s far post for remainder of first half birmingham had most of play exerting pressure on manchester city full back leivers but were unable to make a breakthrough reprinted in though birmingham put ball in net twice brown was adjudged to be offside on both occasions with warhurst missing and boyd out of position and not fully fit birmingham s strength and balance was disrupted leaving them particularly vulnerable to manchester city s unconventional style during half time interval a row erupted between birmingham manager and some of his players about their fitness in manchester city dressing room a heated exchange took place between barnes and revie barnes had played defensively in first half to counter threat of peter murphy but revie urged him to play further forward wagg barnes this simple game pp 58 59 where fuck have you been ken you heard what les mcdowall said about me marking

immediately after half time saw few chances but then after just over an hour s play manchester city regained their stride and suddenly went two goals ahead a throw in to revie led to interplay on right wing involving barnes dyson and johnstone resulting in a through ball which put dyson clear of defence to score two minutes later trautmann collected ball at end of a birmingham attack and kicked ball long to dyson over heads of retreating birmingham players dyson flicked ball on to bobby johnstone who scored manchester city s third rowlands trautmann biography p 179 becoming first

referee stopped play immediately trainer laurie barnett rushed onto pitch and treatment continued for several minutes no substitutes were permitted so manchester city would have to see out game with ten men if trautmann was unable to continue captain roy paul felt certain that trautmann was not fit to complete match and wished to put roy little in goal instead manchester city greats p 21 however trautmann dazed and unsteady on his feet insisted upon keeping his goal he played out remaining minutes in great pain with manchester city defenders attempting to clear ball well upfield or into stand whenever it came near trautmann was called upon to make two further saves to deny brown and murphy second causing him to recoil in agony due to a collision with ewing which required trainer to revive him rowlands trautmann biography p 180 no further goals were scored and referee blew for full time with final score 3 1 to manchester city as players left field crowd sang a chorus of for he s a jolly
