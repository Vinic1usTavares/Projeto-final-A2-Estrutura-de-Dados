hms campania was a seaplane tender and aircraft carrier converted from an elderly ocean liner by royal navy early in first world war after her conversion was completed in mid 1915 ship spent her time conducting trials and exercises with grand fleet these revealed need for a longer flight deck to allow larger aircraft to take off and she was modified accordingly campania missed battle of jutland in may 1916 but made a number of patrols with elements of grand fleet she never saw combat and was soon relegated to a training role because of her elderly machinery in november 1918 campania was anchored with capital ships of grand fleet when a sudden storm caused her anchor to drag with no second anchor being laid she hit several of ships and collisions punctured her hull she slowly sank with no loss of life her officer of watch had failed to call captain and was dismissed from ship navy day by day 5 november early career originally built as a passenger liner for cunard line s service between liverpool and new york in 1893 was holder of blue riband award for speed early in her career in october 1914 she was sold to shipbreakers thos w ward as she was wearing out gardiner p 66 purchase and conversion royal navy purchased campania from shipbreakers on 27 november 1914 for ps32 500 initially for conversion to an armed merchant cruiser equipped with eight quick firing guns ship was converted by cammell laird to an aircraft carrier instead and two forward 4 7 inch guns were deleted in favour of a flying off deck two derricks were fitted on each side to transfer seaplanes between water and two holds amidships hold had capacity for seven large seaplanes forward hold underneath flight deck could fit four small seaplanes but flight deck had to be lifted off hold to access airplanes hms campania was commissioned on 17 april 1915 friedman pp 44 45 left thumb campania after being modified into an aircraft carrier note airplane at left first takeoff from flight deck did not occur until 6 august 1915 when a sopwith schneider floatplane mounted on a wheeled trolley maber p 102 used of flight deck while ship was steaming into wind at sopwith aircraft was lightest and highest powered aircraft in service with royal naval air service and close call in a favourable wind demonstrated that heavier aircraft could not be launched from flight deck friedman p 45 by october 1915 campania had exercised with grand fleet seven times but had only flown off aircraft three times as north sea was often too rough for her seaplanes to use her captain recommended that flying off deck be lengthened and given a steeper slope to allow gravity to boost aircraft s acceleration and ship was accordingly modified at cammell laird between november 1915 and early april 1916 forward funnel was split into two funnels and flight deck was extended between them and over bridge to a length of so that aircraft from both holds could use flight deck a canvas windscreen was provided to allow aircraft to unfold their wings out of wind and a kite balloon and all of its supporting equipment were added in aft hold campania now carried seven short type 184 torpedo bombers and three or four smaller fighters or scouts a type 184 made its first takeoff from flight deck on 3 june 1916 also using a wheeled trolley this success prompted admiralty to order world s first aircraft designed for carrier operations fairey campania ship received first of these aircraft in late 1917 where they joined smaller sopwith 1 1 2 strutter scouts at various times campania also carried sopwith baby and sopwith pup layman p 50 campania failed to receive signal to deploy when grand fleet departed scapa flow on 30 may 1916 en route to battle of jutland but she sailed two hours and fifteen minutes later even though she was slowly overtaking fleet early in morning of 31 may she was ordered to return to scapa flow as she lacked an escort and german submarines had been reported in area corbett pp b ship participated in some anti submarine and anti zeppelin patrols but she was later declared unfit for fleet duty because of her defective machinery and became a seaplane training and balloon depot ship in april 1918 campania along with grand fleet was transferred from scapa flow to rosyth maber p 103 sinking thumb campania sinking 5 november 1918 on morning of 5 november 1918 campania was lying at anchor off burntisland in firth of forth a sudden force 10 squall caused ship to drag anchor she collided first with bow of nearby battleship and then scraped along side of battlecruiser campanias hull was breached by initial collision with royal oak flooding her engine room and shutting off all main electrical power ship then started to settle by stern and sank some five hours after breaking free ship s crew were all rescued by neighbouring vessels a naval board of inquiry into incident held campanias watch officer largely responsible for her loss citing specifically failure to drop a second anchor once ship started to drift maber pp 103 107 wreck of hms campania was initially afforded protection under protection of wrecks act being designated in 2000 this designation was revoked in 2013 when site was re designated as a historic marine protected area under marine scotland act 2010 remains of four campania aircraft and seven 1 1 2 strutters that she had on board when she sank
