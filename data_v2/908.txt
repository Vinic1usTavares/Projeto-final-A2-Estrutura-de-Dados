forces with armies about 6 000 strong divided roughly into half infantry and half cavalry battle was an overwhelming victory of polish swedish faction led by swedish born king elect sigismund iii vasa over army of his rival to throne maximilian iii archduke of austria taking place near silesian town of pitschen modern byczyna then just a few kilometres outside territory of poland lithuania on 24 january 1588 sigismund s supporters were commanded by chancellor and great crown hetman jan zamoyski besides commanders notable participants included stanislaw stadnicki on maximilian s side and stanislaw zolkiewski on sigismund s army of polish austrian or habsburg faction was largely annihilated archduke was captured and his cause came to an abrupt end he subsequently renounced his claim to polish throne background in 1586 following death of previous polish king stefan bathory swedish duke sigismund iii vasa and habsburg maximilian iii archduke of austria took part in election to joint polish lithuanian throne each of two candidates had supporters in polish lithuanian commonwealth with two opposing sides gathered around pro sigismund chancellor and great crown hetman jan zamoyski and primate of poland stanislaw karnkowski on one side and pro zborowski family on other rivalry between zamoyski and zborowski family dated years past and tensions during elections ran high sigismund supported by zamoyski and former king s wife anna jagiellon was elected king of polish lithuanian commonwealth on 19 august 1587 and recognized as such by interrex primate karnkowski election was disputed however by maximilian and opponents of sigismund chose not to respect election outcome decreeing that maximilian was rightful monarch three days later on 22 august zborowski family called for rokosz legitimate right to rebel and election ended in chaos with several killed and many wounded for both zamoyski and zborowski family losing was not an option as they knew losing side would likely pay a severe price from confiscations and a loss of prestige to a possible death sentence for treason neither sigismund nor maximilian were present in commonwealth at that time after receiving news of election both sigismund and maximilan made haste for poland sigismund arrived at danzig gdansk on 28 september and after approximately two weeks he had departed to krakow where he arrived on 9 december and was crowned on 27 december maximilian attempted to resolve dispute by bringing a military force to poland thereby starting war of polish succession after a failed attempt to take krakow in late 1587 successfully defended by zamoyski he retreated to gather more reinforcements but was pursued by forces loyal to sigismund zamoyski at first wanted to avoid a large battle as he hoped for more reinforcements and supplies but when it became apparent that maximilian would be reinforced first he decided to press an attack he also received king s and royal permission to cross borders and attack maximilian in silesia zamoyski divided his army into several regiments that were able to march quickly at approximately 24 kilometers a day he reformed his army after a week near czestochowa in meantime on 22 january 1588 maximilian crossed border into his own territory towards byczyna pitschen opposing forces each side had comparable forces maximilan had about 6 500 men about half of which 3 290 were infantry his forces consisted primarily of silesians hungarians and moravians with artillery consisting of four heavy and a dozen or so lighter pieces zamoyski s forces numbered about 6 000 including 3 700 cavalry 2 300 infantry and several cannon maximilian s polish supporters included 600 cavalry under command of devil of stanislaw stadnicki another of maximilan s notable polish supporters at battle was poet adam overall maximilan s forces held advantage in infantry while zamoyski s was in cavalry poles favored cavalry which had supreme mobility and used effective charging tactics but also meant that their infantry was geared too much towards cavalry support battle on night of 24 january archduke s army took positions east of small town of byczyna on royal road leading into poland they felt secure in their camp on habsburg side of border and did not expect poles to cross zamoyski marshaled his forces into three lines and was able to position them at an angle to opponent s line exact position of polish army is unknown but part of polish right flank moving quietly in dense mist encircled maximilian s left flank after mist began to clear archduke realized his force was being flanked and his retreat to byczyna was threatened he ordered an attack but a miscommunication of his orders confused part of his army and hungarian regiment began to retreat polish left wing under command of future hetman stanislaw zolkiewski dispersed opposing units battle saw more infantry action than many others of commonwealth but even so polish cavalry polish winged hussars played a major part battle began with some duels between cavalry champions soon followed by polish cavalry charges on left flank and in center which did not result in any significant breakthroughs for either side zamoyski is said to have commanded battle very well turning it at several points eventually a polish hussar counterattack on left flank mauled maximilan s hungarian cavalry and forced his army to start giving ground bloody retreat quickly turned into a general rout during which archduke s army suffered heavy casualties entire battle lasted approximately one to two hours maximilian took refuge in byczyna but poles took control of his artillery and turned guns on town before polish forces began their assault maximilian surrendered and was taken prisoner battle therefore ended up being decisive victory for polish swedish faction aftermath exact casualties are unknown but archduke s army suffered heavier losses estimated at about 2 000 whereas poles lost about 1 000 men zolkiewski captured an enemy standard but received a knee wound which lamed him for life after intervention of a papal envoy maximilian was released but only after spending thirteen months as a guest of zamoyski in treaty of bytom and bedzin signed on 9 march 1589 maximilian was to renounce polish crown and rudolf ii holy roman emperor had to pledge not to make any alliances against poland with muscovy or sweden town of taken early in conflict by maximilian was returned to poland upon his return to vienna he failed to honor his pledge and renounce his claim to polish crown and would not do so until
