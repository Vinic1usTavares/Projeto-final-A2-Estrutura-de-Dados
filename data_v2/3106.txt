mediterranean squadron this period was occupied with training exercises and cruises in western mediterranean sea and atlantic she was moored near battleship when latter exploded accidentally in 1911 and she was damaged by flying debris following outbreak of war in july 1914 republique was used to escort troopship convoys carrying elements of french army from french north africa to face germans invading northern france she thereafter steamed to contain austro hungarian navy in adriatic sea taking part in minor battle of antivari in august increasing threat of austro hungarian u boats and unwillingness of austro hungarian fleet to engage in battle led to a period of monotonous patrols that ended with italy s entry into war on side of france which allowed french fleet to be withdrawn in 1916 republique was sent to cover withdrawal from gallipoli campaign and thereafter became involved in events in greece being stationed in salonika to put pressure on greek government to enter war on

would better resist flooding than shallow side armor used in earlier vessels republique was long overall and had a beam of and an average draft of she displaced at full load she was powered by three vertical triple expansion engines with twenty four niclausse boilers they were rated at and provided a top speed of coal storage amounted to which provided a maximum range of at a cruising speed of she had a crew of 32 officers and 710 enlisted men republiques main battery consisted of four canon de 305 mm modele 1893 96 guns mounted in two twin gun turrets one forward and one aft secondary

battery guns were protected by up to of armor on fronts of turrets while secondary turrets had of armor on faces conning tower had thick sides modifications tests to determine whether main battery turrets could be modified to increase elevation of guns and hence their range proved to be impossible but navy determined that tanks on either side of vessel could be flooded to induce a heel of 2 degrees this increased maximum range of guns from new motors were installed in secondary turrets in 1915 1916 to improve their training and elevation rates also in 1915 47 mm guns located on either side of bridge were removed and two on aft superstructure were moved to roof of rear turret on 8 december 1915 naval command issued orders that light battery was to be revised to just four of 47 mm
