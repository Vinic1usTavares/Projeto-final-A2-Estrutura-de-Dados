away as well as erin s outburst saying it was warranted but disingenuous dan forcella of tv fanatic awarded episode three and a half stars out of five and noted that return of andy s anger issues was a pleasant change of pace he concluded that episode s physical comedy elevated it ultimately making it certainly an improvement on last week s episode welcome party screencrave reviewer jeffrey hyatt

kelly and ravi s story i might have written this clumsy episode off entirely forcella enjoyed plot praising ending due to fact that it concluded with boos and hisses however he was confused with casting noting that why bring sendhil ramamurthy in for one scene he seems more like someone you bring in for a multi episode arc hyatt lauded scenes and wrote ryan kelly stuff i give a 10 10
