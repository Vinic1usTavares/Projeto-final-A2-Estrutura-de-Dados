american paddlefish polyodon spathula is a species of basal ray finned fish closely related to sturgeons in order acipenseriformes fossil records of paddlefish date back over 300million years nearly 50million years before dinosaurs first appeared american paddlefish are smooth skinned freshwater fish commonly called paddlefish but are also referred to as mississippi paddlefish spoon billed cats or spoonbills they are one of only two extant species in paddlefish family polyodontidae other is critically endangered chinese paddlefish psephurus gladius endemic to yangtze river basin in china american paddlefish are often referred to as primitive fish or relict species because they retain some morphological characteristics of their early ancestors including a skeleton that is almost entirely cartilaginous and a paddle shaped rostrum snout that extends nearly one third their body length they have been referred to as freshwater sharks because of their heterocercal tail or caudal fin which resembles that of sharks american paddlefish are a highly derived fish because they have evolved with adaptations such as filter feeding their rostrum and cranium are covered with tens of thousands of sensory receptors for locating swarms of zooplankton which is their primary food source american paddlefish are native to mississippi river basin and once moved freely under relatively natural unaltered conditions that existed prior to early 1900s paddlefish commonly inhabited large free flowing rivers braided channels backwaters and oxbow lakes throughout mississippi river drainage basin and adjacent gulf drainages their peripheral range extended into great lakes with occurrences in lake huron and lake helen in canada until about 90 years ago american paddlefish populations have declined dramatically primarily because of overfishing habitat destruction and pollution poaching has also been a contributing factor to their decline and will continue to be as long as demand for caviar remains strong naturally occurring american paddlefish populations have been extirpated from most of their peripheral range as well as from new york maryland virginia and pennsylvania current range of american paddlefish has been reduced to mississippi and missouri river tributaries and mobile bay drainage basin they are currently found in twenty two states in u s and those populations are protected under state federal and international laws taxonomy etymology and evolution thumb 260px an american paddlefish in a large aquarium tank american paddlefish are closely related to sturgeons in order acipenseriformes an order of basal ray finned fishes that includes sturgeon and paddlefish several species of which are now extinct paddlefish are among oldest of fishes as evidenced in fossil record which dates their first appearance approximately 300 to 400million years ago almost 50million years before dinosaurs fossils of a second extinct species p tuberculata which date back approximately 60million years ago were found in lower paleocene formation in montana in 1797 french naturalist bernard germain de lacepede established genus polyodon for paddlefish which today includes a single extant species polyodon spathula lacepede disagreed with pierre joseph bonnaterre s description in tableau encyclopedique et methodique 1788 which suggested paddlefish were a species of shark lacepede noted country and habits of this fish are still unknown when lacepede established binomial feuille he was unaware species had already been named in 1772 by taxonomist johann julius walbaum who described paddlefish as squalus spathula as a result of lacepede s inadvertent double naming polyodon spathula became preferred scientific name of american paddlefish and squalus spathula became synonym as one of two names applied to group walbaum 1792 is recognized and cited as authority family polyodontidae comprises five known taxa three extinct taxa from western north america and two extant taxa including american paddlefish polyodon spathula native to mississippi river basin in united states and critically endangered chinese paddlefish psephurus glades endemic to yangtze river basin in china american paddlefish are only living species in genus polyodon they are often referred to as primitive fish or relict species because of morphological characteristics they retain from some of their early ancestors as evidenced in fossil record which dates them back to late cretaceous 70 to 75million years ago some of their primitive characteristics include a skeleton composed primarily of cartilage and a deeply forked heterocercal caudal fin similar to that of sharks although they are not closely related fossil with recognizable rostrums date from upper cretaceous and paleocene periods 65million years ago an elongated rostrum is a morphological characteristic of polyodontidae but only genus polyodon p spathula and extinct p tuberculata have characteristics adapted specifically for filter feeding including jaw gill arches and cranium gill rakers of american paddlefish are composed of extensive comb like filaments believed to have inspired etymology of genus name polyodon a greek compound word meaning many toothed adult american paddlefish are actually toothless although numerous small teeth less than were found in a juvenile paddlefish measuring spathula references elongated paddle shaped snout or rostrum compared to chinese paddlefish and fossil genera american paddlefish and by extension a fossil relative p tuberculata are considered to be a highly derived species because of their novel adaptations chinese paddlefish are closest extant relative of american paddlefish they are currently listed as critically endangered on iucn red list several reports have suggested that chinese paddlefish may now be extinct primary reasons for their decline are similar to those of american paddlefish and include overfishing construction of dams and destruction of habitat unlike planktivorous american paddlefish chinese paddlefish are strong swimmers grow larger and are opportunistic piscivores that feed on small fishes and crustaceans some distinct morphological differences of chinese paddlefish include a narrower sword like rostrum and a protrusible mouth they also have fewer thicker gill rakers than american paddlefish last confirmed sighting of a live chinese paddlefish was made on river on january 24 2003 from 2006 to 2008 scientists conducted surveys in an effort to locate fish they used several boats deployed setlines 111 anchored setlines and 950 drift nets covering on upper yangtze river most of which lies within protected area of upper yangtze national nature reserve they did not catch a single fish they also used equipment to monitor active sound in water sonar but were unable to confirm presence of paddlefish description thumb 260px general morphology of american paddlefish thumb 260px thumbtime 0 20 paddlefish ram suspension feeding zooplankton in aquarium american paddlefish are among largest and longest lived freshwater fishes in north america they have a shark like body average in length weigh and can live in excess of thirty years for most populations median age is five to eight years and maximum age is fourteen to eighteen years age of american paddlefish is best determined by dentary studies a process which usually occurs on fish harvested during snagging season a popular sport fishing activity in certain parts of u s dentary is removed from lower jawbone cleaned of any remaining soft tissue and cross sectioned to expose annual rings dentary rings are counted in much same way a tree is aged dentary studies suggest that some individuals can live 60 years or longer and that females typically live longer and grow larger than males american paddlefish are smooth skinned and almost entirely cartilaginous their eyes are small and directed laterally they have a large tapering operculum flap a large mouth and a flat paddle shaped rostrum that measures approximately one third of their body length during initial stages of development from embryo to hatchling american paddlefish have no rostrum it begins to form shortly after hatching rostrum is an extension of cranium not of upper and lower jaws or olfactory system as with long snouts of other fishes other distinguishing characteristics include a deeply forked heterocercal caudal fin and dull coloration often with mottling ranging from bluish gray to black dorsally grading to a whitish underbelly feeding ecology and physiology scientists began to debate function of american paddlefish s rostrum when species was described in late 1700s they had once believed it was used to excavate bottom substrate or functioned as a balancing mechanism and navigational aid however laboratory experiments in 1993 that utilized advanced technology in field of electron microscopy have established conclusively that rostrum of american paddlefish is covered with tens of thousands of sensory receptors these receptors are morphologically similar to ampullae of lorenzini of sharks and rays and are indeed passive type electroreceptors used by american paddlefish to detect plankton clusters of electroreceptors also cover head and operculum flaps american paddlefish s diet consists primarily of zooplankton their electroreceptors can detect weak electrical fields which signal not only presence of zooplankton but also individual feeding and swimming movements of zooplankton appendages when a swarm of zooplankton is detected paddlefish swims forward continuously with their mouth wide open forcing water over gill rakers to filter out prey such feeding behavior is considered ram suspension feeding further research has indicated that their electroreceptors may also serve as a navigational aid for obstacle avoidance american paddlefish have small undeveloped eyes that are directed laterally unlike most fishes american paddlefish hardly respond to overhead shadows or changes in illumination electroreception appears to have largely replaced vision as a primary sensory modality which indicates a reliance on electroreceptors for detecting prey however rostrum is not their only means of food detection some reports suggest a damaged rostrum would render american paddlefish less capable of foraging efficiently to maintain good health but laboratory experiments and field research indicate otherwise as well as electroreceptors on rostrum american paddlefish have sensory pores covering nearly half of skin surface extending from rostrum to top of head down to tips of operculum flaps studies have indicated that american paddlefish with damaged or abbreviated rostrums are still able to forage and maintain good health reproduction and life cycle thumb 260px development of paddlefish from embryo to larval stage thumb 260px stages of rostrum development right american paddlefish are long lived sexually late maturing pelagic fish females do not begin spawning until they are seven to ten years old some as late as sixteen to eighteen years old females do not spawn every year rather they spawn every second or third year males spawn more frequently usually every year or every other year beginning around age seven some as late as nine or ten years of age american paddlefish begin their upstream spawning migration sometime during early spring some begin in late fall they spawn on silt free gravel bars that would otherwise be exposed to air or covered by very shallow water were it not for rises in river from snow melt and annual spring rains that cause flooding although availability of preferred spawning habitat is essential there are three precise environmental events that must occur before american paddlefish will spawn water temperature must be from lengthened photoperiod which occurs in spring triggers biological and behavioral processes that are dependent on increasing day length and there must be a proper rise and flow in river before a successful spawn can occur historically american paddlefish did not spawn every year because precise environmental events only occurred once every 4 or 5 years american paddlefish are broadcast spawners also referred to as mass spawners or synchronous spawners gravid females release their eggs into water over bare rocks or gravel at same time males release their sperm fertilization occurs externally eggs become sticky after they are released into water and will attach to bottom substrate incubation varies depending on water temperature but in water eggs will hatch into larval fish in about seven days after hatching larval fish drift downstream into areas of low flow velocity where they forage on zooplankton young american paddlefish are poor swimmers which makes them susceptible to predation therefore rapid first year growth is important to their survival fry can grow about per week and by late july fingerlings are around long their rate of growth is variable and highly dependent on food abundance higher growth rates occur in areas where food is not limited feeding behavior of fingerlings is quite different from that of older juveniles and adults they capture individual plankton one by one which requires detection and location of individual daphnia on approach followed by an intercept maneuver to capture selected prey by late september fingerlings have developed into juveniles and are around long after 1st year their growth rate slows and is highly variable studies indicate that by age 5 their growth rate averages around per year depending on abundance of food and other environmental influences habitat and distribution thumb 260px map of united states showing distribution of paddlefish american paddlefish are highly mobile and well adapted to living in rivers they inhabit many types of riverine habitats throughout much of mississippi valley and adjacent gulf slope drainages they occur most frequently in deeper low current areas such as side channels oxbows backwater lakes bayous and tailwaters below dams they have been observed to move more than in a river system american paddlefish are endemic to mississippi river basin historically occurring from missouri and yellowstone rivers in northwest to ohio and allegheny rivers of northeast headwaters of mississippi river south to its mouth from san jacinto river in southwest to tombigbee and alabama rivers of southeast they were extirpated from new york maryland and pennsylvania as well as from much of their peripheral range in great lakes region including lake huron and lake helen in canada in 1991 pennsylvania implemented a reintroduction program utilizing hatchery reared american paddlefish in an effort to establish self sustaining populations in upper ohio and lower allegheny rivers in 1998 new york initiated a stocking program upstream in allegheny reservoir above kinzua dam and a second stocking in 2006 in creek a relatively unaltered section of their historic range reports of free ranging adults captured by gill nets have since been documented in pennsylvania and new york but there is no evidence of natural reproduction they are currently found in 22 states in us and are protected under state and federal laws there are 13 states that allow commercial or sport fishing for american paddlefish human interaction propagation and culture thumb 260px caesarean section surgery to extract roe fertilize and incubate blind pony hatchery in missouri 1995 artificial propagation of american paddlefish began with efforts of missouri department of conservation during early 1960s and focused primarily on maintenance of sport fishery however it was growing importance of american paddlefish for their meat and roe that became catalyst for further development of culture techniques for aquaculture in united states artificial propagation requires broodstock which because of late sexual maturation of american paddlefish are initially obtained from wild and brought into a hatchery environment fish are injected with lh rh hormone to stimulate spawning number of eggs a female may produce depends on size of fish and can range anywhere from 70 000 300 000 eggs unlike most teleosts oviduct branches of american paddlefish and sturgeons are not directly attached to ovaries rather they open dorsally into body cavity to determine status of progression toward maturation ova staging is performed process begins with a minor procedure that involves a small abdominal incision from which to extract a few sample oocytes oocytes are boiled in water for a few minutes until yolk is hardened and then they are cut in half to expose nucleus exposed nucleus is examined under a microscope to determine stage of maturity once maturation is confirmed one of three procedures is used to extract eggs from a female paddlefish three procedures are 1 traditional hand stripping method considered to be time consuming and laborious 2 caesarean section a relatively quick surgical method of extracting eggs through a abdominal incision considered faster than hand stripping suturing can be time consuming and incision may result in muscular stress and poor suture retention which lowers survival rate and 3 mist minimally invasive surgical technique which is fastest of three procedures because it requires less handling of fish and eliminates need for suturing a small internal incision is made in dorsal area of oviduct which allows direct stripping of eggs from body cavity through gonopore bypassing funnels a male indicates successful production of mature spermatozoa which results in release of large volumes of milt over course of three to four days milt is collected by inserting a short plastic tube with syringe attached into urogenital opening of male and applying light suction with syringe to draw milt collected milt is diluted in water just prior to adding it to eggs and combination is gently stirred for about a minute to achieve fertilization fertilized eggs are adhesive and demersal therefore if incubation is to take place in a flow through hatching jar eggs must be treated to prevent clumping incubation usually takes anywhere from five to twelve days global commercial market thumb 260px tin of freshly processed paddlefish caviar right advancements in biotechnology have created a global commercial market for polyculture of american paddlefish in 1970 american paddlefish were stocked in several rivers in europe and asia introduction began when five thousand hatched larvae from missouri hatcheries in united states were exported to former ussr for utilization reproduction was successful in 1988 and 1989 and resulted in exportation of juveniles to romania and hungary american paddlefish are now being raised in ukraine germany austria czech republic and plovdiv and vidin regions in bulgaria in may 2006 specimens of different sizes and weights were caught by professional fisherman near prahovo in serbian part of danube river in 1988 fertilized american paddlefish eggs and larvae from missouri hatcheries were first introduced into china since that time china imports approximately 4 5million fertilized eggs and larvae every year from hatcheries in russia and united states some american paddlefish are polycultured in carp ponds and sold to restaurants while others are cultured for brood stock and caviar production china has also exported american paddlefish to cuba where they are farmed for caviar production sport fishing american paddlefish are a popular sport fish where their populations are sufficient to allow such activity areas where there are no self sustaining populations rely on state and federal restocking programs to maintain a viable fishery a 2009 report includes following states as allowing american paddlefish sport fishing per their respective state and federal regulations arkansas illinois indiana iowa kansas kentucky mississippi missouri montana nebraska north dakota oklahoma south dakota and tennessee since american paddlefish are filter feeders they will not take bait or lures and must be caught by snagging official state record in kansas is a american paddlefish snagged in 2004 montana a american paddlefish snagged in 1973 and in north dakota a american paddlefish snagged in 2010 largest american paddlefish on record was captured in west okoboji lake iowa in 1916 by a spear fisherman and measured long and weighed an estimated population declines thumbnail 260px angler landing a large paddlefish overfishing and habitat destruction american paddlefish populations have declined dramatically primarily as a result of overfishing and habitat destruction in 2004 they were listed as vulnerable vu ver 3 1 on iucn red list of threatened species they are currently proposed for listing as vu 3de throughout their range as result of a u s fish wildlife service assessment assessment concluded that an overall population size reduction of at least 30 may occur within next 10 years or three generations due to actual or potential levels of exploitation and effects of introduced taxa pollutants competitors or parasites american paddlefish are filter feeding pelagic fish that require large free flowing rivers with braided channels backwater areas oxbow lakes that are rich in zooplankton and gravel bars for spawning series of dams on rivers such as those constructed on missouri river have impounded large populations of american paddlefish and blocked their upstream migration to spawning shoals channelization and groynes or wing dykes have caused narrowing of rivers and altered flow destroying crucial spawning and nursery habitat as a result most impounded populations are not self sustaining and must be stocked to maintain a viable sport fishery zebra mussels zebra mussel infestations in mississippi river great lakes and other midwest rivers are also negatively affecting american paddlefish populations zebra mussels are an invasive species well adapted for explosive population growth as a result of high rates of fecundity and recruitment as filter feeders zebra mussels rely on plankton and can filter significant amounts of phytoplankton and zooplankton from water altering availability of an important food source for paddlefish and native a few days after fertilization of zebra mussel eggs a microscopic larva emerges called a veliger during this initial stage of development which usually lasts a few weeks veligers are able to swim freely in water column with other microscopic animals comprising zooplankton veligers are poor swimmers making them susceptible to predation by any animal that feeds on zooplankton however natural predation of zebra mussels at any stage of development has not made a significant contribution to long term reduction of zebra mussel populations poaching poaching has been a contributing factor to declining populations of american paddlefish in states where they are commercially exploited particularly while demand for caviar remains strong since 1980s a trade embargo on iran restricted imports of highly sought after and most expensive beluga caviar from caspian sea limiting u s sources of caviar most sought after caviar is produced by sturgeons in northern caspian sea but overfishing and poaching have exhausted supply american sturgeon and paddlefish populations were targeted as likely substitutes roe of american paddlefish can be processed into caviar similar in taste color size and texture to sevruga sturgeon caviar from caspian sea several cases of mislabeled american paddlefish roe sold as caspian sea caviar have been prosecuted by u s fish and wildlife service usfws state and federal regulations restricting harvest of american paddlefish populations in wild and illegal trafficking of their roe are strictly enforced related violations such as illegal transport of american paddlefish roe have resulted in convictions with substantial fines and prison sentences paddlefish are also protected under cites convention on international trade in endangered
