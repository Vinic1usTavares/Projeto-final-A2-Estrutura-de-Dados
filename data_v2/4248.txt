byzantine venetian treaty of 1268 was an agreement between byzantine empire and republic of venice that brought to a temporary end hostilities between two powers which had erupted after byzantine recovery of constantinople by emperor michael viii palaiologos in 1261 venice had enjoyed a privileged position in constantinople based latin empire and palaiologos had allied with venice s main commercial rival republic of genoa against them loss of constantinople to palaiologos was a heavy blow to venice s political and commercial position in east as it cut off access to black sea and gave genoese privileged access instead a naval war against genoa and byzantium followed but despite a significant venetian victory at battle of settepozzi in 1263 it failed to produce decisive results nevertheless palaiologos became dissatisfied with genoese military performance and two allies grew increasingly mistrustful towards each other leading byzantine emperor to seek a rapprochement with venice a first treaty was concluded in 1265 but not ratified by venice finally rise of charles of anjou in italy and his hegemonic ambitions in wider region which threatened both venice and byzantines provided additional incentive for both powers to seek an accommodation a new treaty was concluded in april 1268 with terms and wording more favourable to byzantines it provided for a mutual truce of five years release of prisoners and readmitted and regulated presence of venetian merchants in empire many of trading privileges they had previously enjoyed were restored but on considerably less advantageous terms to venice than what palaiologos had been willing to concede in 1265 byzantines were forced to recognize venetian possession of crete and other areas captured after fourth crusade but succeeded in avoiding a full rupture with genoa while removing for a time threat of a venetian fleet assisting charles of anjou in his plans to capture constantinople background in aftermath of sack of constantinople by fourth crusade in 1204 republic of venice which had provided crusaders with their fleet received many of spoils of fallen byzantine empire three eighths of byzantine capital constantinople and numerous strategically positioned colonies including crete this event opened black sea to venetian trade while venetian influence in constantinople ensured that throughout newly established latin empire venetians gained a privileged position which secured their ascendancy over their old commercial rivals fellow italian maritime republics of pisa and genoa byzantine genoese

in 1261 and re establishment of byzantine empire under palaiologos dynasty was a major blow to position and interests of venice furthermore to counter mighty venetian fleet palaiologos had allied with genoese in treaty of nymphaeum and genoese were at war with venice this agreement not only gave genoese great privileges but also assigned them former quarters and property of venetians in constantinople and threatened to exclude venetians from black sea trade initially venetians supported exiled latin emperor baldwin ii in his efforts to form a new crusade and reclaim his throne and venetian diplomacy henceforth served to bind together latin projects to retake capital in words of deno geanakoplos barred from black sea and constantinople by her rival venice now followed a two pronged strategy of using papacy and threat of excommunication to pry genoese away from byzantines and of obtaining assistance of other western powers like manfred of sicily for a campaign against palaiologos in meantime venetian naval activity in aegean sea did not provide any concrete results in summer of 1262 venetians ordered a 37 galley fleet into aegean which met genoese fleet of 60 ships at thessalonica but genoese refused to engage a piratical foray by nobles of negroponte allied with venice into marmara sea was confronted and defeated by a byzantine genoese squadron in 1263 however battle of settepozzi ended in a clear venetian victory and much diminished value of genoese alliance in eyes of palaiologos who was furthermore annoyed by genoese captains preference for attacking venetian shipping for booty rather than assisting in supplying his forces fighting in morea and concerned at growth of genoese influence in his own capital as they threatened to acquire even more of a stranglehold on commerce than venetians had ever possessed soon after battle michael viii dismissed sixty genoese ships from his service both sides became increasingly mistrustful of each other and michael began to delay payments for crews of genoese ships byzantine genoese rift widened further in 1264 when genoese podesta in constantinople was implicated in a plot to surrender city to manfred of sicily whereupon emperor expelled genoese from city to heraclea perinthus unratified treaty of 1265 palaiologos then sent a venetian prisoner of war arrigo trevisano as his envoy to venice doge reniero zeno sent trevisano back to constantinople along with benedetto who in turn were replaced by jacopo and jacopo contarini on 18 june 1265 a first treaty of truce was signed by palaiologos and venetian envoys in constantinople its terms were highly advantageous to venetians and would in opinion of geanakoplos almost restore to her position she had enjoyed before 1261 greek and latin texts of treaty are preserved in collection of venetian diplomatic documents compiled by gottlieb tafel and georg thomas and published by imperial academy of sciences in vienna its main provisions were cession to venice of designated quarters for her colonists in constantinople thessalonica and other byzantine cities with recognition of a venetian bailo as chief venetian official in empire venetian merchants were exempted from all taxes in empire genoese were to be entirely expelled from empire and any future byzantine treaties with genoa would require consent of venice venice would remain at peace with byzantines even if a friendly power papacy france sicily castile aragon england charles of anjou pisa and ancona were explicitly mentioned should attack constantinople if genoese should attack constantinople venice would come to aid of city with a fleet of equal size to that of genoa venetian possession of crete and two outposts of modon and coron on morea were recognized by palaiologos palaiologos received a free hand against latin lords of negroponte while venetian citizens there were prohibited from aiding them in exchange for a guarantee of their own properties and position on island other latin territories in aegean captured after fourth crusade including feudatories of principality of achaea were to be returned to palaiologos treaty was not ratified by doge for unclear reasons according to geanakoplos either venetians interpreted palaiologos concessions as a sign of weakness or mistrusted his ultimate intentions since his desire to restore byzantine empire to its pre 1204 boundaries was obvious and directly affected their own possessions in area furthermore as donald nicol points out zeno still cherished title conferred in 1204 of lord of one quarter and one eighth of empire of romania dominus partis et totius imperii and would be loath to accept a treaty that recognized him merely as doge of venice and lord of croatia dalmatia and other places and islands subject to his authority and that effectively diminished his standing and reverted relations between venice and constantinople to status quo before 1204 venice may have hoped to secure or even augment her position in area with aid of either manfred of sicily or new and ambitious contender for supremacy in italy charles of anjou whose ultimate designs on constantinople were common knowledge hence his inclusion in draft treaty by palaiologos rise of charles of anjou thumb coronation of charles of anjou as king of sicily 14th century miniature his imperial ambitions forced palaiologos to seek an accommodation with venice following his decisive victory over manfred at battle of benevento in february 1266 charles of anjou now master of italy began to plan for realization of his ambitions against constantinople his plans were made public with treaty of viterbo in may 1267 concluded between charles exiled latin emperor baldwin papacy and principality of achaea charles pledged to assist baldwin in recovering his capital and territories that had once belonged to latin empire in exchange for several territorial concessions in aegean and western balkans and suzerainty over achaea in an effort to lure cautious venetians into pact they were promised full restoration of rights they had enjoyed after 1204 concerned over charles ambitions and with his previous treaty with venice null and void palaiologos turned again to genoa allowing establishment of a genoese colony in suburb of galata across golden horn from constantinople these developments venetians as well their trade with east had suffered considerably following byzantine alliance with genoa while charles of anjou s imperial ambitions in adriatic and greece were a potential threat to venice s own freedom of access to mediterranean consequently on 1 november 1267 doge reniero zeno sent two plenipotentiary ambassadors marco bembo and pietro zeno to negotiate a treaty with palaiologos treaty of 1268 byzantine venetian treaty was concluded on 4 april 1268 at constantinople palaiologos position vis a vis venice had improved in years since 1265 as a result terms of new treaty were considerably less advantageous to venetians who furthermore felt compelled to recognize palaiologos with title imperator et moderator romanorum emperor and governor of romans rather than graecorum of greeks as in 1265 and with flattering appellation new constantine which palaiologos had adopted after recovering constantinople treaty was ratified by doge zeno on 30 june but he died a few days later palaiologos quickly sent ambassadors to venice george tzimiskes and george who were able to secure its recognition by zeno s successor lorenzo tiepolo on 30 july terms latin text of treaty is published in collection of venetian documents by tafel and thomas terms of treaty were a truce of five year duration on both land and sea beginning from 4 april 1268 between republic of venice and empire of romania venice pledged not to attack byzantium or any territory subject to it nor to ally with any power against it a clear reference to charles of anjou nor to allow any venetian ships captains or nobles to engage with other kings princes barons or counts in designs against byzantine territories nor would venice allow venetian ships to be used to carry troops against emperor s territories all greek prisoners held at crete modon and coron negroponte or other places would be released immediately and be free to either stay in same locations or depart to wherever they wished palaiologos promised to do same with any venetians incarcerated in byzantine territory and prohibit manufacture and sale of weapons for use against venetians likewise emperor pledged on true and venerable cross according to customs of greeks and holy gospels of god to observe same terms to ensure that no harm would befall venetians on crete or any other of their possessions and to remove any of his men from crete where byzantine troops had been sent in support of revolt of brothers likewise palaiologos pledged to not attack venetian possessions of modon and coron and venetian islands of aegean and to respect treaty between venice and prince of achaea concerning negroponte venetians would be allowed to settle in constantinople and any other part of empire this would no longer be in designated quarters provided by emperor but they would be free to rent their own houses baths and bakeries on fixed terms and would have right to use their own weights and measures and have their own latin rite churches obligation to pay rent was new but venetian merchants would again as before be exempt from any taxes in empire genoese could remain in empire in a marked departure from treaty of 1265 on understanding that both genoese and venetians would not engage in mutual hostilities between abydos on entrance of dardanelles and northern entrance to bosporus on black sea if either side broke this arrangement emperor would act as arbiter if any venetian were to die on byzantine territory then disposition of his goods should be entrusted to venetian rectors or bailo or by other venetians without interference from byzantine authorities any venetian vessel or crew suffering shipwreck would receive any assistance possible from byzantine authorities to recover their goods venetian ships were allowed to purchase grain anywhere in empire and export it without restriction except to lands hostile to empire for as long as its price remained at 50 gold hyperpyra to 100 if price should rise then export would be allowed only under explicit license by emperor in case of a venetian accused of killing a byzantine or another venetian in constantinople case would be judged by emperor but another offense against a byzantine or a murder against another venetian outside constantinople would be judged by a venetian rector or bailo any damage incurred on byzantine territories by venetian corsairs would be by bailo who would also be responsible for bringing them to trial venice also promised not to provide any assistance to or even harbour corsairs acting against empire acts by venetians ruling some of aegean islands who were not subject to republic were explicitly exempted from this agreement notably no reference was made to byzantine corsairs in agreement despite their active presence across region byzantine merchants would have right to come to venice and trade in whatever merchandise they wished without impediment aftermath treaty quickly bore fruit for byzantines in september 1269 charles of anjou sent achaean knight erard d and abbot of monte cassino as envoys to venice to enlist republic in his designs against palaiologos but doge declined citing truce venetian stance reflected both their satisfaction for time being with having again secured commercial access in byzantine empire as well as their disquiet at charles policies in adriatic including a recent agreement with hungary traditionally a rival of venice in dalmatia in 1272 as truce neared its expiration envoys from charles baldwin and palaiologos were all present in venice byzantine ambassadors brought with them 500 venetian prisoners apparently they had been seized in euboea during campaigns of byzantine admiral alexios doukas philanthropenos against lombard lords of negroponte in previous years despite truce between venice and byzantium they had been crewing lombards galleys amidst intense diplomatic manoeuvring including repeated warnings by pope gregory x not to renew truce doge preferred to cautiously wait out developments accordingly truce remained tacitly in force even if it was not officially renewed nevertheless venetians had reason to be dissatisfied as treaty s provisions regarding free and safe movement of venetian merchants and their goods were not scrupulously observed by byzantines in 1278 doge submitted more than 300 cases of injury done to venetian ships merchants and goods since 1268 at hands of emperor s subjects many of them pirates in imperial employ but also including soldiers customs officials and local governors and even on one occasion a sebastokrator possibly palaiologos half brother constantine who had murdered and robbed a venetian archdeacon captured on a ship off morea in 1270 an anti angevin coalition took power in genoa and in 1272 palaiologos renewed his alliance with city now directed against charles of anjou palaiologos diplomatic offensive continued with his rapprochement with papacy which alone could either decisively further by declaring his campaign against constantinople a crusade or thwart charles plans terms posed by pope were harsh emperor and eastern church would have to confess their errors and accept supremacy of pope faced with angevin build up of naval forces and alliances palaiologos had to concede and union of churches was proclaimed at second council of lyon in 1274 although union proved deeply unpopular among byzantine church and populace it was a diplomatic triumph for palaiologos as pope recognized him as legitimate emperor of constantinople and forbade charles to attack him meanwhile palaiologos used opportunity to attack his greek and latin rivals in greece although venetian representatives at lyon had vociferously protested that venice still claimed its rights in romania advantage lay with palaiologos and new doge jacopo contarini in 1276 sent envoys to constantinople to renegotiate 1268 treaty this resulted in an agreement concluded between palaiologos and venetian envoy marco bembo on 19 march 1277 notably this agreement was not phrased as a treaty but rather as a chrysobull a deed of grant from emperor to venice given volatile international situation however its duration was limited to two years after its expiration it was not renewed and in 1281 venetians in treaty of orvieto entered charles anti byzantine coalition with april 1283 as projected starting date for expedition against constantinople however charles designs were fatally interrupted by outbreak of sicilian vespers in march 1282 and consequent war of sicilian vespers by terms of treaty of orvieto a state of war existed between venice and byzantium outbreak of vespers had ruined venetian chances to recover their privileged position and for duration of state of war their trade with east was interrupted much to advantage of genoese after long negotiations a final ten year peace treaty essentially renewing 1277 agreement was concluded in july 1285 references citations sources
