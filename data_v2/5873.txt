a crinoline is a stiff or structured petticoat designed to hold out a woman s skirt popular at various times since mid 19th century originally crinoline described a stiff fabric made of horsehair crin and cotton or linen which was used to make underskirts and as a dress lining by 1850s term crinoline was more usually applied to fashionable silhouette provided by horsehair petticoats and to hoop skirts that replaced them in mid 1850s in form and function these hoop skirts were similar to 16th and 17th century farthingale and to 18th century panniers in that they too enabled skirts to spread even wider and more fully steel hooped cage crinoline first patented in april 1856 by r c milliet in paris and by their agent in britain a few months later became extremely popular steel cage crinolines were mass produced in huge quantity with factories across western world producing tens of thousands in a year alternative materials such as whalebone cane gutta percha and even inflatable caoutchouc natural rubber were all used for hoops although steel was most popular at its widest point crinoline could reach a circumference of up to six yards although by late 1860s crinolines were beginning to reduce in size by early 1870s smaller crinolette and bustle had largely replaced crinoline crinolines were worn by women of every social standing and class across western world from royalty to factory workers this led to widespread media scrutiny and criticism particularly in satirical magazines such as punch they were also hazardous if worn without due care thousands of women died in mid 19th century as a result of their hooped skirts catching fire alongside fire other hazards included hoops being caught in machinery carriage wheels gusts of wind or other obstacles crinoline silhouette was revived several times in 20th century particularly in late 1940s as a result of christian dior s new look of 1947 nylon and net petticoats worn in 1950s and 1960s to poof out skirts also became known as crinolines even when there were no hoops in their construction in mid 1980s vivienne westwood designed mini crini a mini length crinoline which was highly influential on 1980s fashion late 20th and early 21st century designers such as john galliano and alexander mcqueen have become famous for their updated crinoline designs since 1980s and well into 21st century

pre 1850 crinoline was not first garment designed to support wearer s skirts in a fashionable shape whilst bell shaped skirts seen on statuettes from ancient minoan civilization are often compared to crinolines particularly under assumption that hoops were required to retain their shape there is no evidence to confirm this and theory is usually dismissed p p davies llewellyn jones p 125 crinoline s ancestors are more typically recognised as spanish later known as farthingale widely worn in europe from late 15th century to early 17th century and side hoops and panniers worn throughout 18th century watt p p 44 horsehair fabric called crinoline was first noted by 1829 when it was offered for lining and dress making cunnington p 89 that year rudolph ackermann s repository of fashions described new textile as a fine clear stuff not unlike in appearance to leno but of a very strong and durable description it is made in different colours grey and colour of cambric are most in favour petticoats made of horsehair crinoline appeared around 1839 proving so successful that name crinoline began to refer to supportive petticoats in general rather than solely to material waugh p 181 by 1847 crinoline fabric was being used as a stiffening for skirt linings although english women preferred separate crinoline fabric petticoats which were beginning to collapse under increasing weight of skirts cunnington p 145 one alternative to horsehair crinoline was quilted petticoat stuffed with down or feathers such as that reportedly worn in 1842 by lady aylesbury cunnington cunnington p 147 however quilted skirts were not widely produced until early 1850s in about 1849 it was possible to buy stiffened and corded cotton fabric for making petticoats marketed as crinoline and designed as a substitute for horsehair textile cunnington pp 165 169 artificial crinoline with hoops did not emerge until 1850s late 19th century thumb upright cage crinoline with steel hoops 1865 lacma 1850s 60s

milliet had already patented a de femme in paris on 24 april 1856 which was described as comprising elastic extensible circles joined together by vertical bands following its introduction women s rights advocate amelia bloomer felt that her concerns about hampering nature of multiple petticoats had been resolved and dropped dress reform as an issue d p 243 diana de marly in her biography of couturier charles frederick worth noted that by 1858 there existed steel factories catering solely to crinoline manufacturers and shops that sold nothing else but crinolines de marly p 76 one of most significant manufacturers of crinolines was that of thomson co founded by an american with branches across europe and united states at height of their success up to four thousand crinolines were produced by thomson s london factory in a day whilst another plant in saxony manufactured 9 5 million crinolines over a twelve year period gernsheim p 46 in 1859 new york factory which employed about a thousand girls used 300 000 yards of steel wire every week to produce between three and four thousand crinolines per day while rival douglas sherwood factory in manhattan used a ton of steel each week in manufacturing hoop skirts wosk p 45 thumb left inflatable crinoline 1857 caricature by john leech for punch s pocket book crinoline needed to be rigid enough to support skirts in their accustomed shape but also flexible enough to be temporarily pressed out of shape and spring back afterwards other materials used for crinolines included whalebone gutta percha and caoutchouc natural rubber crinoline and whales dublin university magazine pp 537 538 idea of inflatable hoops was short lived as they were easily punctured prone to collapse and due to use of brimstone in manufacture of rubber they smelled unpleasant although hard rubber hoops of gutta percha worked satisfactorily at first they were brittle and easily crushed without recovering their form despite objections that sharp points of snapped steels were hazardous lightweight steel was clearly most successful option it reduced number of petticoats and their weight and offered increased freedom of movement of legs however hasty or careless movements in a hoop skirt could lead to accidentally revealing more than intended an advertisement published in lady s newspaper in 1863 for a cage crinoline with waved hoops attempted to reassure potential customer that while wearing it activities such as climbing stairs passing to her theatre seat dropping into and leaning against furniture would be possible without hindrance either to herself or to others around her lady s newspaper 1863 cited by johnston thumb comic photograph c 1860 despite some claims such as that by historian max von boehm that largest crinolines measured up to ten yards 30 feet around photohistorian alison gernsheim concluded that maximum realistic circumference was in fact between five and a half and six yards gernsheim p 47 whilst a loosely gathered skirt draped over a large hoop would certainly require a higher yardage gernsheim noted that ten yard hems were highly improbable gernsheim p 48 staged photographs showing women wearing exaggeratedly large crinolines were quite popular such as a widely published sequence of five views showing a woman dressing with assistance of several maids who require long poles to lift her dress over her head and other ingenious means of navigating her enormous ginsburg p 45 such photographs which re enacted contemporary caricatures rather than accurately reflecting reality were aimed towards voyeur s market however it was a fact that size of crinoline often caused difficulties in passing through doors boarding carriages and generally moving about by late 1860s many crinolines were of a significantly reduced size as noted by a victoria and albert museum curator observing sizes of cage crinolines in museum s collection thumb left two english crinolettes 1872 75

combination with separate bustles rather than in isolation koda pp 130 133 during 1880s cage crinoline was revived with hoop petticoats designed to accommodate extremely large bustles of period and support skirt hems one of mid 1880s styles was called lobster pot due to its resemblance to a lobster trap due to extreme weight of fabrics of decade hoops of crinolines were crossed over each other

critical articles on crinoline were published by hungarian journal az 1858 and bulgarian journalist slaveykov in 1864 in 1850s welsh poet dafydd jones wrote a ballad decrying fashion a similar sentiment was expressed by a russian song published in 1854 where singer complains about his wife having assumed fashion in 1855 an observer of queen victoria s state visit to paris complained that despite number of foreigners present western fashions such as crinoline had diluted national dress to such an extent that everyone whether turkish scottish spanish or tyrolean dressed alike blau p 154 victoria herself is popularly said to have detested fashion inspiring a song in punch that started long live our gracious queen who won t wear crinoline gernsheim p 44 nb gernsheim misquotes rhyme as god save our gracious queen gernsheim has noted that queen was often photographed in crinolines and suggests that this misunderstanding came from a request made by victoria that female guests attending her daughter s marriage in 1858 should leave their hoops off due to limited space in chapel royal at st james s palace crinoline was perceived as a signifier of social identity with a popular subject for cartoons being that of maids wearing crinolines like their mistresses much to higher class ladies disapproval barnard p 111 questions of servants in crinoline and related social concerns were raised by george routledge in an etiquette manual published in 1875 where he criticised london for wearing hoops at work routledge p 127 as girls knelt to scrub doorsteps routledge described how their hoops rose to expose their lower bodies inspiring street harassment from errand boys and other male passers by routledge firmly opined that servants ought to save their fashionable garments for their leisure periods and dress appropriately for their work however this was challenged by some servants who saw attempts to control their dress as equivalent to controlling their liberty and refused to work for employers who tried to forbid crinolines upright thumb sara forbes bonetta by camille 1862 arthur observed that in barbarous locality of wigan sight of a female

associated with garment such as its size problems and hazards associated with wearing and moving about in it and fact that it was worn so widely by women of all social classes were frequently exaggerated and parodied in satirical articles and illustrations such as those in punch alexander maxwell has summarised crinoline mockery as expressing male authors insecurity and fears that women whose crinolines took up enough space for five would eventually conquer mankind julia thomas observing extent of punch s anti crinoline sentiment and mockery noted that magazine s attacks rather than
