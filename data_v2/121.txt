clearout was necessary to introduce plausible powerful new characters as part of new serial format much more of characters personal lives were explored but as marquess put it viewers still don t go home with them change also allowed bill to become more reflective of modern policing with introduction of officers from ethnic minorities most notably new superintendent adam okaro it also allowed coverage of relationship of homosexual sergeant craig gilmore and pc luke ashton a storyline which marquess was determined to explore before rival merseybeat in 2005 johnathan young took over as

station from first series police station consisted of a set of buildings in artichoke hill wapping east london lynch t 1992 bill boxtree london however these buildings were next to news international plant and during winter of 1985 86 there was much industrial action which resulted in some altercations between strikers and what they thought were real police but were actually actors working on bill working conditions got so dire that production team realised they needed to find another base to set sun hill police station second location was an old record distribution depot in barlby road north kensington in north west london filming began here in march 1987 in 1989 owners of barlby road site ordered bill out due to their redevelopment plans for area after an extensive search two sites were selected favourite being a disused hospital in clapham however this fell through and second option was chosen an old wine distribution warehouse in merton south west london move was made in march 1990 and was disguised on screen by ongoing refurbishment of sun hill police station and then finally explosion of a terrorist car bomb in station car park which ended up killing pc ken melvin filming for series took place all over london mainly in south london and particularly london borough of merton where sun hill set was located locations used when show was filmed on a housing estate included

hill road sun hill canley e1 carlton television 2006 bill official case book carlton books london which corresponds to real life areas of whitechapel and stepney production details when filming bill some scenes were re enacted indoors with microphones surrounding actors and extra sounds being dubbed on later some of more aggressive scenes were also filmed indoors either for dubbing or safety reasons sirens used in series were added later in dubbing suite as bill did not have permission to use them while on location however police uniforms used in series were genuine again making bill unique amongst police dramas when series ended london s metropolitan police service after talks with production company bought 400 kilograms of police related paraphernalia including flat caps and stab vests etc to prevent them falling into hands of criminals after programme s production ceased bill uniforms bought up by metropolitan police bbc london news bill is unique amongst police dramas in that it takes a serial format focusing on work and lives of a single shift of police officers rather than on one particular area of police work also unique is that bill adapted to this format after several series whereas comparable series started with serial format broadcast in united kingdom during its initial broadcast bill was always shown on itv in 2009 stv itv s regional franchise in

that bill is not editorially bound to police despite better relations with police bill was still not without controversy it was sometimes criticised for high levels of violence especially prior to
