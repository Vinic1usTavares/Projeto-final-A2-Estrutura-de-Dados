in graph theory de bruijn erdos theorem relates graph coloring of an infinite graph to same problem on its finite subgraphs it states that when all finite subgraphs can be colored with colors same is true for whole graph theorem was proved by after whom it is named de bruijn erdos theorem has several different proofs all depending in some way on axiom of choice its applications include extending four color theorem and dilworth s theorem from finite graphs and partially ordered sets to infinite ones and reducing hadwiger nelson problem on chromatic number of plane to a problem about finite graphs it may be generalized from finite numbers of colors to sets of colors whose cardinality is a strongly compact cardinal definitions and statement an undirected graph is a mathematical object consisting of a set of vertices and a set of edges that link pairs of vertices two vertices associated with each edge are called its endpoints graph is finite when its vertices and edges form finite sets and infinite otherwise a graph coloring associates each vertex with a color drawn from a set of colors in such a way that every edge has two different colors at its endpoints a frequent goal in graph coloring is to minimize total number of colors that are used chromatic number of a graph is this minimum number of colors for these basic definitions see pp 1 2 four color theorem states that every finite graph that can be drawn without crossings in euclidean plane needs at most four colors however some graphs with more complicated connectivity require more than four colors p 5 it is a consequence of axiom of choice that chromatic number is well defined for infinite graphs but for these graphs chromatic number might itself be an infinite cardinal number a subgraph of a graph is another graph obtained from a subset of its vertices and a subset of its edges if larger graph is colored same coloring can be used for subgraph therefore chromatic number of a subgraph cannot be larger than chromatic number of whole graph de bruijn erdos theorem concerns chromatic numbers of infinite graphs and shows that again assuming axiom of choice they can be calculated from chromatic numbers of their finite subgraphs it states that if chromatic numbers of finite subgraphs of a graph have a finite maximum value then chromatic number of itself is exactly on other hand if there is no finite upper bound on chromatic numbers of finite subgraphs of then chromatic number of itself must be infinite theorem 1 p 2 applications original motivation of erdos in studying this problem was to extend from finite to infinite graphs theorem that whenever a graph has an orientation with finite maximum out degree it also has a coloring for finite graphs this follows because such graphs always have a vertex of degree at most which can be colored with one of colors after all remaining vertices are colored recursively infinite graphs with such an orientation do not always have a low degree vertex for instance bethe lattices have but arbitrarily large minimum degree so this argument requires graph to be finite but de bruijn erdos theorem shows that a coloring exists even for infinite graphs see in particular p 137 where de bruijn erdos theorem is first announced but not proven with a hint that konig s lemma can be used for countable graphs thumb a seven coloring of plane and four chromatic moser spindle drawn as a unit distance graph in plane providing upper and lower bounds for hadwiger nelson problem another application of de bruijn erdos theorem is to hadwiger nelson problem which asks how many colors are needed to color points of euclidean plane so that every two points that are a unit distance apart have different colors this is a graph coloring problem for an infinite graph that has a vertex for every point of plane and an edge for every two points whose euclidean distance is exactly one subgraphs of this graph are called unit distance graphs a seven vertex unit distance graph moser spindle requires four colors in 2018 much larger unit distance graphs were found that require five colors whole infinite graph has a known coloring with seven colors based on a hexagonal tiling of plane therefore chromatic number of plane must be either 5 6 or 7 but it is not known which of these three numbers is correct value de bruijn erdos theorem shows that for this problem there exists a finite unit distance graph with same chromatic number as whole plane so if chromatic number is greater than five then this fact can be proved by a finite calculation de bruijn erdos theorem may also be used to extend dilworth s theorem from finite to infinite partially ordered sets dilworth s theorem states that width of a partial order maximum number of elements in a set of mutually incomparable elements equals minimum number of chains totally ordered subsets into which partial order may be partitioned a partition into chains may be interpreted as a coloring of graph of partial order this is a graph with a vertex for each element of order and an edge for each pair of incomparable elements using this coloring interpretation together with a separate proof of dilworth s theorem for finite partially ordered sets it is possible to prove that an infinite partially ordered set has finite width if and only if it has a partition into chains theorem 5 6 p 60 in same way de bruijn erdos theorem extends four color theorem from finite planar graphs to infinite planar graphs every finite planar graph can be colored with four colors by four color theorem de bruijn erdos theorem then shows that every graph that can be drawn without crossings in plane finite or infinite can be colored with four colors more generally every infinite graph for which all finite subgraphs are planar can again be four colored states same result for five color theorem for countable planar graphs as four color theorem had not yet been proven when he published his survey and as proof of de bruijn erdos theorem that he gives only applies to countable graphs for generalization to graphs in which every finite subgraph is planar proved directly via godel s compactness theorem see de bruijn erdos theorem may also be used to answer a question of fred galvin concerning an intermediate value theorem for graph chromatic numbers for every two finite numbers and every graph with chromatic number there is a subgraph of with chromatic number to see this find a finite subgraph of with same chromatic number as itself and then delete vertices one by one until target chromatic number is reached however situation for infinite chromatic numbers is more complicated it is consistent with set theory that there exists a graph with vertices and with chromatic number but with no subgraph of chromatic number where and are first and second uncountable aleph numbers proofs original proof of de bruijn erdos theorem by de bruijn used transfinite induction provided following very short proof based on tychonoff s compactness theorem in topology suppose that for given infinite graph every finite subgraph is colorable and let be space of all assignments of colors to vertices of regardless of whether they form a valid coloring then may be given a topology as a product space where denotes set of vertices of graph by tychonoff s theorem this topological space is compact for each finite subgraph of let be subset of consisting of assignments of colors that validly color then system of sets is a family of closed sets with finite intersection property so by compactness it has a nonempty intersection every member of this intersection is a valid coloring of gottschalk states his proof more generally as a proof of theorem of that generalizes de bruijn erdos theorem a different proof using zorn s lemma was given by lajos posa and also in 1951 ph d thesis of gabriel andrew dirac if is an infinite graph in which every finite subgraph is colorable then by zorn s lemma it is a subgraph of a maximal graph with same property one to which no more edges may be added without causing some finite subgraph to require more than colors binary relation of in is an equivalence relation and its equivalence classes provide a coloring of however this proof is more difficult to generalize than compactness proof jensen and toft attribute to gert observation that gottschalk s proof is easier to generalize gives same proof via zorn s lemma rediscovered in 2005 by undergraduate student dmytro theorem can also be proved using or non standard analysis gives a proof for graphs with a countable number of vertices based on konig s infinity lemma dependence on choice all proofs of de bruijn erdos theorem use some form of axiom of choice some form of this assumption is necessary as there exist models of mathematics in which both axiom of choice and de bruijn erdos theorem are false more precisely showed that theorem is a consequence of boolean prime ideal theorem a property that is implied by axiom of choice but weaker than full axiom of choice and showed that de bruijn erdos theorem and boolean prime ideal theorem are equivalent in axiomatic power for this history see for a simplified proof of s theorem by mycielski see de bruijn erdos theorem for countable graphs can also be shown to be equivalent in axiomatic power within a theory of second order arithmetic to konig s infinity lemma for a counterexample to theorem in models of set theory without choice let be an infinite graph in which vertices represent all possible real numbers in connect each two real numbers and by an edge whenever value is a rational number equivalently in this graph edges exist between all real numbers and all real numbers of form where is any rational number each path in this graph starting from any real number alternates between numbers that differ from by a rational number plus an even multiple of and numbers that differ from by a rational number plus an odd multiple of this alternation prevents from containing any cycles of odd length so each of its finite subgraphs requires only two colors however in solovay model in which every set of real numbers is lebesgue measurable requires infinitely many colors since in this case each color class must be a measurable set and it can be shown that every measurable set of real numbers with no edges in must have measure zero therefore in solovay model infinite chromatic number of all of is much larger than chromatic number of its finite subgraphs at most two pp 541 542 generalizations proves following theorem which may be seen as a generalization of de bruijn erdos theorem let be an infinite set for instance set of vertices in an infinite graph for each element of let be a finite set of colors additionally for every finite subset of choose some particular coloring of in which color of each element of belongs to then there exists a global coloring of all of with property that every finite set has a finite superset on which and agree in particular if we choose a coloring for every finite subgraph of an infinite graph then there is a coloring of in which each finite graph has a larger supergraph whose coloring agrees with coloring of whole graph for this connection between rado s lemma and de bruijn erdos theorem see e g discussion following theorem a of if a graph does not have finite chromatic number then de bruijn erdos theorem implies that it must contain finite subgraphs of every possible finite chromatic number researchers have also investigated other conditions on subgraphs that are forced to occur in this case for instance chromatic graphs must also contain every possible finite bipartite graph as a subgraph however they may have arbitrarily large odd girth and therefore they may avoid any finite set of non bipartite subgraphs de bruijn erdos theorem also applies directly to hypergraph coloring problems where one requires that each have vertices of more than one color as for graphs a hypergraph has a coloring if and only if each of its finite sub has a coloring it is a special case of compactness theorem of kurt godel stating that a set of first order sentences has a model if and only if every finite subset of it has a model p 171 it is straightforward to prove de bruijn erdos theorem using compactness theorem for first order logic more specifically de bruijn erdos theorem can be interpreted as compactness of first order structures whose non logical values are any finite set of colors and whose only predicate on these values is inequality theorem may also be generalized to situations in which number of colors is an infinite cardinal number if is a strongly compact cardinal then for every graph and cardinal number has chromatic number at most if and only if each of its subgraphs of cardinality less than has chromatic number at most this follows immediately from definition of a strongly compact cardinal as being a cardinal such that every collection of formulae of logic each of length smaller than that is satisfiable for every subcollection of fewer than formulae is globally satisfiable see e g original de bruijn erdos theorem is case of this generalization since a set is finite if and only if its cardinality is less than however some assumption such as one of being a strongly compact cardinal is necessary if generalized continuum hypothesis is true then for every infinite cardinal there exists a graph of cardinality such that chromatic number of is greater than but such that every subgraph of whose vertex set has smaller power than has chromatic number at most characterizes infinite graphs that obey a generalization of de bruijn erdos theorem in that their chromatic number is equal to maximum chromatic number of their strictly smaller subgraphs notes references see especially chapter ii 5 de bruin erdos reduction to finite sets and results near lower bound pp 39 42 and chapter v 26
