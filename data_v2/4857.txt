profound transformation in french government and society reign of king charles x ended in 1830 when a wave of agitation and dissent forced him to abdicate he was replaced by louis philippe who named himself king of french rather than standard king of france an indication that he answered more to nascent bourgeoisie than aristocratic ancien regime change in government took place while economy in france was moving from mercantilism to industrial development this opened new opportunities for individuals hoping to acquire wealth and led to significant changes in social norms members of aristocracy for example were forced to relate socially to nouveau riche usually with tense results democratic spirit of french revolution also affected social interactions with a shift in popular allegiance away from church and monarchy robb pp 172 and 315 316 mishra p 185 in mid 19th century a new style of novel became popular in france serial format known as roman feuilleton presented stories in short regular installments often accompanied by melodramatic plots and stock characters although balzac s la vieille fille old maid 1836 was first such work published in france bellos bette

friends eugene sue and alexandre dumas pere bellos criticism p 19 stowe p 102 balzac disliked their serial writing however especially sue s socialist depiction of lower class suffering bellos bette pp 76 77 balzac wanted to dethrone what he called les faux dieux de cette litterature false gods of this bastard literature quoted in hunt p 375 he also wanted to show world that despite his poor health and tumultuous career he was plus jeune plus frais et plus grand que jamais younger fresher and greater than ever his first efforts to render a quality feuilleton were unsuccessful even though et miseres des a harlot high and low published in segments from 1838 to 1847 was celebrated by critics balzac complained to mme hanska that he was doing pure sue quoted in stowe p 102 he tried again in

maurois p 498 robb p 105 writing intensively he produced entire novel named la cousine bette after main character in two months this was a significant accomplishment owing to his bad health but its

proofs he received from printer when creating la cousine bette however he submitted work to his editor piece by piece without viewing a single proof book was serialized in le constitutionnel from 8 october to 3 december and balzac rushed to keep up with newspaper s rapid printing schedule he produced an average of eight pages each day but was struck by unexpected enormity of story as it evolved

an earlier contest in which adulterous baron hulot had won attentions of singer josepha also favored by crevel mme hulot rejects crevel s advances baron has so completely lavished money on josepha that he has borrowed heavily from his uncle johann and unable to repay money baron instead arranges a war department post in algeria for johann with instructions that johann will be in a situation in that job to embezzle borrowed money hulots daughter hortense has begun searching for a husband their son victorin is married to crevel s daughter celestine mme hulot s cousin bette also called lisbeth harbors a deep but hidden resentment of her relatives success especially of hortense stealing bette s intended sweetheart a peasant woman with none of physical beauty of her cousin bette has rejected a series of marriage proposals from middle class suitors who were clearly motivated by her connection to hulots and remains unmarried at age of 42 one day she comes upon a young unsuccessful polish sculptor named wenceslas steinbock attempting suicide in tiny apartment upstairs from her own as she nourishes him back to health she develops a maternal and romantic fondness for him at beginning of story bette is living in a modest apartment in a lodging house shared by marneffe couple both of whom are ambitious and amoral bette befriends valerie young and very attractive wife of a war

happiness is shattered when at end of introduction hortense hulot marries wenceslas steinbock crushed at having lost steinbock s as her intended spouse bette swears vengeance on hulot family her strategy is to work on baron hulot s demonstrated weakness for acquiring and lavishing more money than he has on young mistresses soon baron is completely besotted and financially over extended with valerie and completely compromised by repeatedly promoting her husband within baron s section of war department before long bette has already contrived to have crevel and steinbock also ensnared by valerie s charms hortense discovers steinbock s infidelity and returns to her mother s home before long baron s misconduct becomes known to war department uncle johann is arrested in algeria and commits suicide baron is forced to retire suddenly his brother a famous war hero saves him from prison and then quickly dies of shame over family disgrace baron deserts his family and hides from his creditors it appears that valerie soon a widow will marry crevel and thus gain entrance to hulot family as celestine s mother in law in short family is devastated by these repeated blows and bette s machinations are completely concealed from them characters and inspirations thumb left death of marshal hulot has been called one of most moving in all of balzac pugh p 426 balzac had written more than seventy novels when he began la cousine bette and populated them with recurring characters many of characters in novel therefore appear with extensive back stories and biographical depth for example celestin crevel first appeared in balzac s 1837 novel cesar working for title character having accumulated a considerable fortune in that book crevel spends his time in la cousine bette enjoying spoils of his labor another important recurring character is marshal hulot who first appeared as a colonel in les chouans in years between that story and la cousine bette he became count of forzheim in a letter to constitutionnel balzac described how marshal hulot gained this title presence of crevel and marshal hulot among others in la cousine bette allows a continuation of each character s life story adding emphasis or complexity to earlier events hunt p 378 stowe p 104 pugh pp 423 426 pugh notes that balzac planned a full retelling of how marshal hulot earned forzheim title for a story in scenes de la vie militaire section of la comedie humaine other recurring characters appear only briefly in la cousine bette previous appearances however give deep significance to characters presence this is case with vautrin criminal mastermind who tutors young eugene de rastignac in balzac s 1835 novel le pere goriot when he resurfaces in la cousine bette he has joined police and introduces hulot family to his aunt mme nourrison who offers a morally questionable remedy for their woes although vautrin s presence in la cousine bette is brief his earlier adventures in le pere goriot provide instant recognition and emotional texture elsewhere balzac presents an entire world of experience by including characters from a particular sphere of society for example several scenes feature artists like jean jacques who first appeared in 1837 s les employes and in many other books thereafter world of parisian nightlife is quickly brought to mind with inclusion of several characters from les sans le savoir 1846 and bianchon appears as always when a doctor is needed pugh pp 425 426 balzac reportedly called for bianchon on his deathbed for more information about characters see bellos bette pp 87 92 balzac s use of recurring characters has been identified as a unique component of his fiction it enables a depth of characterization that goes beyond simple narration or dialogue when characters reappear notes critic samuel rogers they do not step out of nowhere they emerge from privacy of their own lives which for an interval we have not been allowed to see rogers 182 bellos makes a similar point in criticism on p 21 some readers however are intimidated by depth created by these interdependent stories and feel deprived of important context for characters detective novelist arthur conan doyle said that he never tried to read balzac because he did not know where to begin quoted in robb p 254 see generally pugh characterization in la cousine bette is considered especially skillful anthony pugh in his book balzac s recurring characters says that technique is employed for most part without that feeling of self indulgence that mars some of balzac s later work almost every example arises quite naturally out of situation pugh p 424 biographer noel gerson calls characters in la cousine bette among most memorable balzac ever sketched gerson

muttered lisbeth oh adeline you shall pay for this i will make you uglier than i am her cruelty and lust for revenge lead critics to call her demonic affron p 69 and one of balzac s most terrifying creations p 328 he notes that french critic andre lorant insisted that bette s desire for vengeance was based on imaginary insults from her family because of her willingness to manipulate people around her bette has been compared to iago in william shakespeare s play othello jameson p 248 saintsbury p xi her fierce persona is attributed partly to her peasant background and partly to her virginity which provides according to balzac une force diabolique ou la magie noire de la volonte diabolical strength or black magic of will balzac p 111 original french is at french wikisource mcguire p 174 hunt p 380 in a letter to mme hanska balzac indicated that he based character of bette on three women from his life his mother mme hanska s aunt rosalie rzewuska and poet marceline

with louise breugniot and advantage she gains from his devotion to mme hanska is similar in some ways to valerie s manipulation of steinbock bellos bette pp 79 80 critics also connect pride and anguish felt by balzac during mme hanska s pregnancy and miscarriage to same emotions felt by baron hulot when valerie conceives and loses her child oliver p 193 although he never ascribed to mme hanska any of traits in valerie s treacherous character he felt a devotion similar to that of hulot he once wrote to her je fais pour mon eve toute les folies qu un hulot fait pour une marneffe je te mon sang mon honneur ma vie i commit for you all follies that a hulot commits for madame marneffe i give you my blood my honor my life quoted in prendergast p 324 hector and adeline hulot baron hector hulot is a living manifestation of male sexual desire unrestrained and unconcerned with its consequences for man or his family as novel progresses he becomes consumed by his libido even in a physical sense when valerie tells him to stop dyeing his hair he does so to please her his financial woes and public disgrace lead him to flee his own home by end of book he is an elderly decrepit shell of a man baron hulot is so overcome by his taste for female flesh that he even asks his wife without irony if he can bring home his fifteen year old mistress affron p 72 jameson p 249 hunt p 381 adeline hulot on other hand is mercy personified like her cousin bette she comes from a peasant background but has internalized ideals of 19th century womanhood including devotion grace and deference she reveals in first scene that she has known for years about her husband s infidelities but refuses to condemn him adeline s forgiving nature is often considered a significant character flaw some suggest that she is partly to blame for hulot s wandering affection c a prendergast for example calls her forgiveness an inadequate and even positively disastrous response to her situation prendergast p 321 he further suggests that adeline by choosing role of quiet and dutiful wife has excised from herself erotic power to which baron is drawn o ne could at very least offer tentative speculation that hulot s obsessional debauchery is in part result of a certain poverty in adeline that terrible logic of hulot s excess is partially shaped by a crucial deficiency in his wife prendergast p 323 others are less accusatory adeline s nearly infinite mercy they say is evidence of foolishness critic herbert j hunt declares that she shows more than christian patience hunt p 386 and david bellos points out that like her husband she is driven by passion albeit of a different kind adeline s desire for good for family for hector for god is so radically different from motivating desires of other characters that she seems in their context to be without desire bellos bette p 67 stowe makes a similar point on p 106 balzac s inspiration for characters of hector and adeline remain unclear but several critics have been eager to speculate three officers named hulot were recognized for their valor in napoleonic wars and some suggest that balzac borrowed name of comte hector d aure none of these men however were known for sort of philandering or thievery exhibited by baron hulot in novel instead balzac may have used himself as model his many affairs with women across social spectrum lead some to suggest that author found much of hulot in himself maurois p 499 balzac s friend victor hugo meanwhile was famously discovered in bed with his mistress in july 1845 similarity of his name to hector hulot and that of his wife s maiden name adele foucher to adeline fischer has been posited as a possible indication of characters origins hunt pp 381 382 maurois pp 498 499 wenceslas

many fair men he looked five or six years younger his youth had faded under fatigue and stress of life in exile balzac p 62 original french is at french wikisource polish sculptor wenceslas steinbock is important primarily because of bette s attachment to him he offers bette a source of pride a way for her to prove herself worthy of her family s respect when hortense marries steinbock bette feels as though she has been robbed prendergast insists that incident must literally be described as an act of theft prendergast p 331 steinbock s relevance also lies in his background and profession illustrating balzac s conception of polish people as well as himself having spent more than a decade befriending mme hanska and visiting her family in poland balzac believed he had insight into national character as he felt about most groups he observed thus descriptions of steinbock are often laced with commentary about polish people soyez mon amie dit il avec une de ces demonstrations si aux polonais et qui les font accuser de be my sweetheart he added with one of caressing gestures familiar to poles for which they are unjustly accused of servility balzac p 67 original french is at french wikisource oliver p 194 saintsbury p xii oliver points out on p 158 that balzac had himself been something of a poor relation of hanska family critics also consider steinbock important because of his artistic genius like louis lambert and lucien in illusions perdues he is a brilliant man just as balzac considered himself to be before he is nurtured and directed by bette however steinbock s genius under his own inertia and he attempts suicide later when he leaves bette s circle of influence he fails again thus he demonstrates balzac s conviction that genius alone is useless without determination gilroy p 111 bellos organizes steinbock and bette into a duality of weakness and strength whereas polish artist is unable to direct his energies into productive work bette draws strength from her virginity and thus becomes powerful by denying lust to which steinbock falls prey bellos bette pp 9 17 steinbock s drive is further eroded by praise he receives for his art which gives him an inflated sense of accomplishment one critic refers to artist s downfall as vanity spoiled by premature renown besser pp 59 and 102 style if balzac s goal was as he claimed to write a realist novel from his own old pen rather than mimic style of eugene sue history and literary criticism have declared him successful william stowe calls la cousine bette a masterpiece of classical realism stowe p

balzac biographer v s pritchett even refers to a representative excerpt as bad writing pritchett p 240 most critics however consider moralistic elements of novel deceptively complex and some point out that roman feuilleton format required a certain level of titillation to keep readers engaged bellos bette pp 63 64 others indicate that balzac s interest in theatre was an important reason for inclusion of melodramatic elements stowe p 117 thumb left emile zola said that balzac s fiction was le compte rendu brutal de ce que l ecrivain a observe uniquely brutal report of what writer has

crosses a significant moral boundary when he agrees to fund mme nourrison s plan to eradicate valerie as one critic puts it victorin s decision marks a point in novel where scheme of right versus wrong immediately dissolves into a purely amoral conflict of different interests and passions regulated less by a transcendent moral law than by relative capacity of different parties for cunning and ruthlessness prendergast pp 318 319 cruelties of hulot children are brief but significant owing as much to their obliviousness intentional in case of victorin who asks not to learn details of mme nourrison s scheme as to malicious forethought prendergast pp 330 331 question of adeline s virtue is similarly complicated although she is forgiving to point of absurdity she is often considered more of a dupe than a martyr some have compared her to balzac s title character in le pere goriot who sacrifices himself for his daughters hunt p 385 as bellos puts it adeline s complicity with hector certainly makes her more interesting as a literary character but it undermines her role as symbol of virtue in novel bellos bette p 66 this complicity reaches an apex when she unsuccessfully attempts to sell her affections to crevel who has since lost interest in order to repay her husband s debts her flirtation with prostitution is sometimes considered more egregious than valerie s overt
