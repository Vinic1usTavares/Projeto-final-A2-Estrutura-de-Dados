tale of mac da tho s pig old irish scela da tho is a legendary tale from early irish literature written primarily in prose and heroic saga form and placed within ulster cycle story s composition in its present form can probably be attributed to an unknown author of leinster c ad 800 and survives in at least six manuscripts written between 12th and 18th centuries three most important of these primary sources are held in trinity college dublin and british library story tells of a dispute between connachta led by ailill and medb and ulaid led by conchobar mac nessa over acquisition of hound of leinster ailbe dispute is ultimately resolved through plan of king of leinster mac da tho to hold a feast at his hostel at which a fight breaks out over assignment of curadmir or champion s portion story deals with themes of provincial rivalry between ulster and connacht communal feasting and heroic contest over curadmir and includes elements which show parallels with older gaulish and pan celtic traditions although apparently quintessential ulster cycle story in many respects tale s composition also displays a sophisticated satiric quality as a parody of genre story was apparently popular in middle ages and later times and became subject of a number of independent poems central figure of pig has parallels with great boars of welsh language literature and matter of britain particularly twrch trwyth in 11th century welsh story of culhwch and olwen sources and composition thumb a page from book of leinster tale of mac da tho s pig survives in at least six manuscripts chadwick p 81 earliest and best form of story is preserved in three texts book of leinster in paper leaves of h 3 18 in trinity college dublin and in harley 5280 manuscript in british library formerly british museum thurneysen p i earliest of these is book of leinster written c ad 1160 harley 5280 manuscript was written in first half of 16th century whereas h 3 18 was written c 1700 thurneysen pp i ii in two of these manuscripts h 3 18 and harley 5280 story is called scela m ei c datho tidings of pig of in book of leinster story is similarly entitled incipit mucci m ei c datho these texts are independent of each other but are believed to be derived from a common source linguistically this source is believed to be a lost 10th or 11th century transcript of a previous version dating to c 800 thurneysen p iv scene of story and its familiarity with area of modern county kildare suggests a leinster authorship though it appears that south west of ireland was also not unknown to author thurneysen p v a fourth version is recorded in 15th century ms rawlinson b 512 now in bodleian library which is less accurate and conservative than first three in this redaction story is designated ocus connacht im m ei c da tho ocus imma separation of ulstermen and on account of dog of mac da tho and his pig manuscript does not preserve original text with any accuracy but contains innovations expansions and other deviations in almost every section thurneysen p ii this might date to 11th or 12th century text is written by same scribe as baile in which he took from 11th century book of dub da leading celticist kuno meyer to conclude rawlinson b 512 version was derived from same source linguistically text of rawlinson b 512 is similar to harley 5280 especially at beginning and there are also innovations in common with book of leinster showing that redactor clearly had more than one manuscript at his disposal thurneysen p iii in one instance diction seems to come closer to form of original than any other surviving manuscript an interpolation concerning cu roi points to this version s origin in munster in spite of some miscomprehension of story on part of revisionist scribe literary style as a whole is somewhat smoother than in earlier version which rudolf thurneysen points out is of help for understanding of tale thurneysen pp ii iii last two manuscripts containing story are ms xxxvi in national library of scotland and h 6 8 in trinity college dublin written 1690 1691 and c 1777 respectively these represent a modernisation of story that might have been made in 15th or 16th century chadwick p 82 two manuscripts differ from each other in some respects and spelling is very poor william j watson notes that text of ms xxxvi was based on redaction contained in rawlinson b 512 but not upon that specific manuscript changes are so considerable in these modernisations that they are of no value for reconstructing original text summary plot story opens with mac da tho a famous legendary king of leinster who possessed a hound called ailbe gantz p 180 ailbe defends entire province to point that his fame spreads throughout entire island of eriu ireland ailill and medb king and queen of connacht send messengers to mac da tho demanding dog but at same time so does conchobar mac nessa king of ulaid warriors of province of ulster messengers from connacht offer an immediate tribute of 160 milch cows a chariot and two of finest horses of connachta and same tribute to be paid to leinster again following year gantz p 181 messengers of ulster in turn offer mac da tho jewellery and cattle and everything else from north and an alliance through great friendship that would result these events trouble mac da tho greatly such that he goes three days without food drink or sleep however his wife devises for him a plan that he should give dog to both parties and let them fight for it pleased by this scheme mac da tho takes each delegation aside in private and intimates to both that he had awarded hound to them after much deliberation gantz p 182 unknowingly both parties agreed separately that their people should come on same day to a feast in leinster to claim ailbe formally feast is to take place at mac da tho s hostel one of five famed legendary hostels or feasting halls in ireland at time hostel itself has seven entrances seven cauldrons full of beef and salted pork and seven hearths and fifty paces between each pair of doorways ulaid and connachta arrive at door of hostel at same time to collect hound mac da tho feigns innocence as to immediately apparent inconsistency yet invites both provinces inside to feast nevertheless though hostel is by no means small it is nonetheless filled with tension as warriors who had previously done each other injury sit opposite each other mac da tho has his pig slaughtered for feast an animal which had been nourished by 60 milch cows for seven years and which had 40 oxen spread across it for its enormous size pig immediately attracts attention of ulaid and connachta who must decide over how it is to be divided up and to whom shall be awarded curadmir or hero s portion it is agreed that warriors shall challenge each other to boast their past exploits in battle gantz pp 182 183 at length connacht warrior cet mac magach manages to his ulster counterparts a narrative pattern follows whereby cet demands a challenge an ulster warrior rises and ulaid cry out name of challenger cet then proceeds to shame that warrior by recounting one of his deeds against him as above cet shames challenger oengus son of lam gabuid by recounting how he had cut off lam gabuid s hands in battle gantz pp 183 184 he shames eogan son of king of by recounting how he put out his eye in a cattle raid gantz p 184 he reminds son of how he had taken his son s head as a trophy not six days earlier mend son of how he had cut off his father s foot son of how he had castrated him with his spear gantz pp 184 185 and even conchobar s son cuscraid mend how he had pierced his neck with a spear during cuscraid s first feat of arms in ignominious circumstances which led to abandonment a third of cuscraid s retinue in a cowardly retreat gantz p 185 in each case challenging warriors are compelled to retake their seats in shame just as cet is in his victory over full warrior contingent of ulster present ulster hero conall cernach enters hostel and leaps into middle of hall to roars of welcome from ulaid cet and conall acknowledge each other in an exchange of archaic rhetorical verses and cet concedes that conall is a better warrior than he gantz p 185 186 cet adds that his brother anluan would best conall in a contest it is our misfortune that he is not in house oh but he is said conall and taking anluan s head from his wallet he threw it at cet s breast so that a mouthful of blood spattered over lips gantz p 186 thumb emain macha seat of ulaid where women of ulster must sing to connachta charioteer fer loga in shame cet leaves pig to conall who rightfully claims belly as his portion a burden for nine men leaving only fore trotters to connachta dissatisfied with their meagre share connachta rise against ulaid and a drinking bout breaks out in hostel and spills out into courtyard outside gantz pp 186 187 fergus rips up a great oak tree from ground by roots gantz p 187 mac da tho unleashes ailbe to see which side it would choose ailbe sides with ulaid and precipitates rout of connachta dog itself is decapitated by s charioteer fer loga at mag nailbi as hosts sweep westward across mide fer loga hides in heather and leaps into chariot of conchobar as it passes seizing king s head from behind conchobar promises him any ransom he wishes fer loga asks to be taken to emain macha capital of ulster where women of ulaid and their nubile daughters are to sing to him each evening in chorus fer loga is my darling a year later at end of tale fer loga rides westward across ath with two of conchobar s horses and golden bridles for them both dindsenchas final portion of plot contains an example of dindsenchas or onomastic folklore a touch of antiquarianism dear to ancient irish chadwick p 87 episode in which fer loga spits head of ailbe upon his chariot pole is used as an explanation for placename of mag nailbi ailbe s plain valley plain bordering river barrow from county laois and county carlow to county kildare thurneysen p 66 tradition and criticism narrative style in assessment of celticist nora chadwick tale is told with brilliant narrative power its humour and laconic brevity is reminiscent of best of icelandic sagas chadwick p 88 dialogue is particularly masterly in its understatement and crisp repartee with utmost condensation and economy in its choice of words i n few remarks made by mac da tho to his visitors all his previous train of thought all his cunning and address are suggested in a few brief words intended by him to hide his true designs from his guests while suggesting to ourselves his hidden intention in spite of literary finish of surviving written versions tale remains one to be told orally story is characterised by a total absence of reflection not a word is wasted no statement is expanded events of narrative are expressed with swift movement aiming to arouse and excite interest and attention of hearer rather than to stimulate thought of reader story teller makes use of element of surprise of quick developments and dramatic moments he seeks to impress by rapid crescendo to a startling climax and a shock as when cet first reluctantly yields to conall cernach in absence of anluan then is unexpectedly and abruptly shamed in full view of warriors of ireland by conall suddenly hurling head trophy of anluan at breast of his opponent with such violence that a gush of blood burst through cet s lips chadwick pp 88 89 chadwick identifies a story calculated to appeal to men rather than women a stark contrast with refined and delicately handled story of eochaid and etain and their supernatural adventures with god with poetical beauty of story of deirdre and sons of indeed even with later heroic tales of finn cycle stories of life in open of hunting and romance and of magic and prowess of a simpler and less organised society than that of mac da tho s feast chadwick p 89 gulf separating tale from this broad range of genres may be used to illustrate impressive range of theme which early irish story tellers had at their command in chadwick s final assessment theme and antiquity thumb feasting remained an important part of gaelic irish society even into tudor period when harley 5280 version of tale was composed tale of mac da tho s pig has been referred to as one of most brilliantly told of early irish sagas which purports to give a picture of old heroic life in ireland and its warlike spirit chadwick pp 80 81 central theme of narrative is curadmir right of greatest champion at a feast to receive hero s portion from a great central cauldron containing communal supply wherever a great body of heroes was gathered together this right was determined by boasting contests between contenders to assert right to hero s portion a claimant must first produce his credentials by boasting his heroic exploits and then shame his opponents by quashing their objections and counter claims in event that this unsuccessful and distinction between heroes present unclear matter would be taken to arbitration as in similar ulster cycle tale fled chadwick suggests that this arbitration may be parodied when mac da tho releases ailbe to see which province hound would side with first chadwick argues that antiquity of tale s theme feasting is probably most anciently attested of all celtic stories heroic communal feast was apparently central to celtic tradition and classical ethnographers of tradition notably 2nd century athenaeus give accounts of gaulish feasts which closely parallel their insular counterparts chadwick pp 82 83 similarly in 1st century bc greek ethnographer diodorus siculus describes in detail how gauls honour distinguished men with best portions of meat and how disputes often lead to challenges in which they set about glorifying valour of their forefathers and boasting of their own prowess and at same time they deride and belittle their opponent and try by their speeches to rob him of courage he has in his heart chadwick p 83 a secondary theme which drives contest for champion s portion is rivalry between royal provinces of connacht and ulster resolved in contest of two heroes cet mac magach and conall cernach presentation of this rivalry is coloured by author s peculiar leinster viewpoint chadwick p 80 he turns both provinces to ridicule by cunning of mac da tho king of leinster in particular author s political sympathies favour connacht and remain hostile to ulster to end chadwick pp 80 84 88 to heroes assembled mac da tho boasts that all food provided for feast is a mere trifle for leinstermen thurneysen p 26 it is tempting to conclude that inspiration of story is claim of leinster to supersede both ulster and connacht chadwick p 84 however it is apparent that by time of tale s composition even story teller does not take political issues very seriously using theme instead as a vehicle for a good story an unusual element is that tale draws its characters from essentially same cast as tain bo cuailnge making mention of some thirty heroes from that narrative yet never once mentions cu chulainn chadwick pp 83 84 chadwick suggests this is probably an indication of antiquity of tradition of story s tradition predating development of cu chulainn s story within ulster cycle some of rhetorical verse elements are old and obscure but certain seemingly parodic elements of genre at least suggest a later composition of present form satiric elements while tale of mac da tho s pig appears to be quintessential ulster cycle story in theme and narrative there are certain unusual elements of extant forms which suggest it may have a more satiric quality parodying heroic genre of ulster cycle eponymous pig of mac da tho may be mythic in origin but its highly exaggerated size may also be satiric in tain bo cuailnge ulaid and connachta go to war over a mythic best finest bull in ireland whereas here they come to blows over a dog in an passage of compressed humour mac da tho promises dog to both parties then feigns ignorance when both arrive on same day chadwick p 85 during bragging contest heroes of ulaid are not merely shamed but are made to look ridiculous hyperbole is used to humorous effect when conall flings head of anluan at his opponent cet thurneysen notes that in harley 5280 manuscript mutual slaying of guests is referred to as performing a good drinking round so a somewhat coarse joke that was revised or omitted in other manuscripts because apparently copyists did not understand it thurneysen p 29 gantz notes that fer loga s demand that nubile women of ulaid sing fer loga is my darling to him every night is so comical that its inclusion cannot possibly be inadvertent gantz pp 180 181 in chadwick s assessment story is a glorious travesty of ancient world by one who honoured and laughed at its traditions tale s composition in early period of viking age in ireland may have done something to substitute laconic humour and a spirit of ripe burlesque for dignity and poetical beauty of other treasures of irish sagas to call tale a parody would not be entirely accurate instead it seems that a literary genius has presented us with a well preserved heroic tradition seen through prismatic lens of a later age he brings to his theme a ripe sophistication a concentrated irony and a gay and lighthearted hyperbole chadwick pp 92 93 associated traditions story appears to have been well known in literary circles chadwick p 90 a variant of tale is apparently mentioned in a poem by flannacan mac in yellow book of lecan flannacan is said to have been killed by vikings in 896 another apparent reference to an orgain mic da tho slaughter of mac da tho is included in a 10th century list of primary stories or chief stories which professional poetic class used to relate to kings mac da tho s hostel is also one of a number cited in a poem on feasting halls or hostels of ancient ireland chadwick pp 90 91 clearly tradition predates our oldest surviving copy that of book of leinster tale was also apparently popular in later times and became subject of a number of independent poems none appears to have been directly based on surviving text however suggesting that other versions of same tale served as their inspiration chadwick p 91 first poem is appended to old text in book of leinster harley 5280 and h 3 18 its author used opportunity to display his knowledge of names of irish heroes in general in which he does not confine himself to characters of story second poem follows first in harley 5280 and appears also in three other manuscripts book of lecan laud 610 in library and lastly in stowe manuscript collection thumb in original version of story mac da tho s pig may have been protagonist showing parallels with wild boar hunts of arthurian legend in these two poems real hero is not dog ailbe but pig latter being practically a panegyric on pig although story s title implies this may have been an original feature in unusual choice of a pig as main protagonist story becomes associated with a broader celtic tradition including wild boar motif of arthurian legend wild boar twrch trwyth for example causes considerable difficulty for men of arthur s court in 11th century welsh story of culhwch and olwen while exposition of geographical details of ailbe s route in rout of connachta in irish tale has parallels with route taken by twrch trwyth in welsh hunt indeed thurneysen notes that in relation to mac da tho s pig poets use words torc boar and muc pig interchangeably thurneysen p 30 55 62 poetic versions of story allude to additional matter within tradition of mac da tho s pig including names of mac da tho s wife maine athrai of his two sons and of his grandson lena according to these accounts lena first found pig in slieve bloom and was responsible for its nourishment until it had seven inches of fat on its snout maine athrai needed pig for her husband s great feast lena refused but he was killed when pig grubbed up earth with its snout burying him alive in his sleep in this version of tale which shows how much may have been omitted from narrow version of saga mac da tho s dutifully delivers pig to his master s feast in laud 610 and stowe manuscripts poem in praise of mac datho s pig forms an appendix to dindsenchas of mag lena a plain and heath in county offaly thurneysen pp v 66 explanation in prose and verse of plain of lena is as imaginative as could be expected from medieval etymologies in reality mag lena simply means plain of meadows similarly an associated though dubious etymological tradition in another saga somewhat later than original tale of mac da tho s pig equates name of mac da tho to mac da tua son of two silent persons his parents having been deaf mutes though spurious at best this explanation has been accepted nevertheless by some poets and redactors such as that of rawlinson b 512 who write da with
