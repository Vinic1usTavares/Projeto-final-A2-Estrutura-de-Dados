times in top ten rankings of their respective media while tv tokyo has announced that first gin tama anime was responsible for high sales overseas along with anime adaptation from naruto publications for manga anime and others have commented on gin tama manga positive responses have focused on comedy and characters from series as well as its overarching plot and action choreography plot story is set in an alternate history late edo period where humanity is attacked by aliens called edo japan s samurai fight to defend earth but shogun cowardly surrenders when he realizes aliens power he agrees to an unequal contract with aliens placing a ban on carrying swords in public and allowing invaders to enter country samurai s swords are confiscated and tokugawa bakufu shogunate becomes a puppet government series focuses on an eccentric samurai gintoki sakata who works as an odd jobs freelancer he helps a teenager named shinpachi shimura save his sister tae from an alien group who want to send her to a brothel impressed by gintoki shinpachi becomes his freelance apprentice to pay bills and learn more about enigmatic samurai when pair rescues a teenage alien girl with super strength kagura from a yakuza group they accept her into their freelancing business and three become known as while working they regularly encounter shinsengumi police force who often ally with gintoki when work involves dangerous criminals trio also meets gintoki s former comrades from amanto invasion including revolutionary kotaro katsura who is friendly toward them despite his terrorist activities against alien controlled government although story is mostly episodic a few story arcs and recurring antagonists develop for example gintoki s former comrade shinsuke takasugi is a major antagonist who regards gintoki and his other former comrades as enemies and seeks to destroy shogunate over time takasugi gains allies including kagura s brother kamui and elite fighting unit to prepare for his large scale coup d etat after true antagonist immortal utsuro is introduced gintoki works with both friends and enemies to stop utsuro from destroying both universe themes and style hideaki sorachi s main focus in gin tama is use of gags during manga s second year of serialization he started to add more drama to story while still keeping comedy various jokes from manga are comments regarding cliches from other shonen series for example in first chapter after gintoki fights a group of aliens to protect shinpachi and tae shinpachi complains that he only fought for one page and gintoki replies shut up one page is a long time for a manga artist gintoki s exaggerated desire to read weekly shonen jump which causes him to fight other readers in order to get it also makes fun of shonen since during those parts characters quote them other types of comedic situations are more general so that reader must know about japanese culture to understand them humour is described by publications as being bizarre and weird it is also described as being divided between two categories sci fi comedy and a samurai comedy with former referring to aliens it tends to point out an irritating about modern society including celebration days or famous mythical figures additionally there are references to several historical figures with a few characters from story being based on them besides series comedy aliens invasion of japan brings several social issues between them and humans with most recurring one being lack of social equality as a result one of main themes involves society trying to preserve their own way of living rather than fulfilling a dream like in other shonen series production thumb left cover of first issue of weekly shonen jump magazine that featured manga in 2003 hideaki sorachi was an up and coming manga artist who had already created two one shots for weekly shonen jump magazine although he was preparing to write his first serialized series his editor suggested he create a manga series based on shinsengumi mostly inspired by an upcoming tv drama about 1860s troupe as depicted by idol actors sorachi attempted to create this series since he admitted to liking shinsengumi but ultimately failed to get anything off ground instead of abandoning idea completely he remained focused on historical japanese era but began to create his own story adding in elements of science fiction and many of figures from era to create a story more to his own liking original title of series was meant to be but it did not have any impact on sorachi after great debate he decided to go with name gin tama after discussing it with his family deciding on a name that sounded close to edge without being completely off it although sorachi considered one shot to be very poor setting of such one shot served as base for gin tama such as addition of alien characters sorachi liked bakumatsu and sengoku periods due to how both were eras of change and thus presented positive and negative points of humanity series was then set in an alternate bakumatsu to give a bigger significance to characters bushido as in that time samurais were at low point of their lives main character of series was originally meant to be toshiro hijikata as sorachi was a fan of shinsengumi most notably from hijikata toshizo shinsengumi who was base for one of gin tama after he saw film burn sword when sorachi could not shake off hijikata s initial design he decided not to use him as lead character but added him along with shinsengumi to story pilot chapter from series had a different plot to one from serialization shinpachi already met gintoki in story and there were more shinsengumi to story such as one based on harada sanosuke as all these new shinsengumi were older than most of recurring characters from series sorachi removed them thinking they were not entertaining when asked by a fan sorachi mentioned that most characters from series are based on real life edo citizens while gintoki s character is roughly based on folk hero sakata no when starting serialization manga was unpopular and was close to being cancelled although sorachi was pleased with first tankobon selling all of its copies he later learned shueisha was afraid of poor sales which resulted in minimum printed in order to increase its popularity author introduce new characters shinsengumi who felt memorable to his assistants sorachi had little hope on manga s popularity as he noted that people used to tell him manga would not surpass number of two tankobon volumes however once third volume was released sorachi found that he did not have any fresh material to use during first year of series sorachi believed that source of popularity of gin tama was partially connected to shinsengumi drama while drama ran during first year of series when manga was mostly shorter stories that established characters and world he felt uncomfortable of making things related to drama by second year and beyond he became more daring in his stories and concepts creating longer storylines that included more drama while keeping his sense of humor and of modern japan by way of his fictionalized past gin tama serialization ended on june 20 2019 when working on a chapter of gintama sorachi sometimes has problems finishing manuscript leaving his supervisor to take it before he can revise it he figures out what to write by staying in his room or going for a walk although he commented that some of his ideas are random he focuses on fact that they are all related to manga and when he has problems coming up with ideas sorachi is often helped by his editor thinking of gin tama as a non sense manga before writing a chapter sorachi decides whether it should be a comedy or a drama sorachi defines gin tama as a science fiction human drama pseudo historical comedy when sorachi is illustrating gin tama he usually uses a felt tip pen a fountain pen a brush tip pen and a multiliner but for major characters he only uses a felt tip pen and a fountain pen and does their outlines with a multiliner 0 8 media manga manga chapters of gin tama are written and illustrated by hideaki
