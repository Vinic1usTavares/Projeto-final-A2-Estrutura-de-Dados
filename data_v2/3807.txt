of england as youngest member of 17 man squad he was more than six and a half years younger than next youngest players of team arthur morris and bill johnston cashman pp 118 153 174 176 215 216 speaking about harvey s selection his captain and one of three team selectors donald bradman opined he has brilliance and daring of youth and likelihood of rapid improvement early tour thumb upright 1 2 while on tour harvey wrote letters to his mother every sunday australia traditionally fielded its first choice team in tour opener which was customarily against worcestershire despite scoring a century in australia s most recent test harvey was made 12th man and it appeared that he was not initially in bradman s test plans australia promptly crushed hosts by an innings fingleton p 42 harvey made his debut on english soil in second tour match against leicestershire batting at no 5 he came in at 3 316 and made 12 struggling against local spinners fingleton p 50 as australia collapsed to end on 448 before winning by an innings harvey played a key role in australia s victory in next match against yorkshire in bradford on a damp pitch that suited slower bowling fingleton pp 53 55 harvey took two catches in home side s first innings of 71 he made seven in first innings as australia replied with 101 after hosts were bowled out for 89 in their second innings australia collapsed to 4 20 in pursuit of 60 for victory no sooner had harvey walked out to bat at no 6 stand in captain lindsay hassett bradman rested himself for match top edged a pull shot and was caught to leave australia at 5 20 to make matters worse sam loxton was injured and could not bat so australia were effectively six wickets down and faced their first loss to an english county since 1912 fingleton p 55 harvey had scored a solitary run when he hit a ball to len hutton at short leg who dived forwards and grabbed it with both hands before dropping it harvey then swept next ball for a boundary colin mccool was out at 6 31 before harvey and wicket keeper don tallon steadied australia harvey was reprieved on 12 he took several steps down pitch to bowling of frank smailes and missed but wicketkeeper fumbled stumping opportunity harvey then hit winning runs by lifting smailes for a six over sightscreen ending unbeaten on 18 not out fingleton p 56 australians travelled to london to play surrey at oval harvey scored seven and struggled in contrast to rest of australians who prospered to total 632 laying foundation for an innings victory harvey took three catches in match including two leaping catches in second innings with his hands above his head his feats prompted local spectators to say that such acrobatic catches had never been seen at oval fingleton p 62 home team s captain stuart surridge lofted a drive down ground and harvey ran 25 m from wide long on and leapt in air to catch ball which would have cleared boundary perry 2008 p 53 harvey managed only 16 before being run out while batting with bill brown as australia piled on 4 414 declared and defeated cambridge university by an innings in following match harvey was then rested as australia crushed essex by an innings and 451 runs its largest winning margin for summer during this match other batsmen set a world record for most first class runs scored in one day s play adding 721 on opening day fingleton pp 65 67 harvey returned for innings victory against oxford university but scored only 23 as australia amassed 431 in their only opportunity at batting crease next match was against marylebone cricket club at lord s mcc fielded seven players who would represent england in tests and were basically a full strength test team while australia fielded their first choice team it was a chance to gain a psychological advantage and given harvey s early struggles in english conditions and his failure to pass 25 in his first six innings he was overlooked as australia amassed 552 and won by an innings after asking bradman about reason for his difficulties with bat harvey was told that these were caused by rash shot selection and a tendency to hit ball in air bradman said he was technically perfect in his shot production he was batting well enough and simply getting out early harvey adapted his style and improved his performance in next match he scored 36 and 76 not out on a turning pitch against lancashire at old trafford in manchester putting on an unbroken century partnership with ron hamence in second innings as match ended in a draw perry 2008 pp 79 82 harvey was rested for following match against nottinghamshire which was also drawn harvey returned in next fixture against hampshire and made one as australia were dismissed for 117 in reply to home side s 195 it was first time tourists had conceded a first innings lead on tour however harvey did not get another chance with bat as australia recovered to win by eight wickets test omission harvey had one last chance to make his case for test selection in match at hove against sussex it was final county fixture before first test at trent bridge he came to crease at 3 360 and put on stands of 93 and 97 with ray lindwall and hamence respectively to finish unbeaten on 100 in only 115 minutes australia declared at 5 549 when harvey reached three figures and went on to complete an innings victory former australian test batsman jack fingleton described harvey s innings as a superb century rich in youthful daring and stroke production fingleton p 79 harvey later rated it his best innings of tour excluding test matches perry 2008 p 94 up to this point reserve opener brown had scored 800 runs on tour at an average of 72 72 with a double century three other centuries and 81 not out and was on his third tour of england in contrast harvey had totalled only 296 runs at 42 29 despite his unbeaten 100 against sussex brown thus gained selection for first test batting out of position in middle order while sid barnes and morris opened whereas harvey was dropped despite making a century in australia s most recent test against india perry 2002 p 100 this was exact situation that had unfolded in worcestershire and mcc matches when australia fielded their first choice team harvey did not play and brown batted out of position in middle order there was a chance of harvey receiving a last minute call up when barnes was ill with food poisoning in week leading up to test but opener recovered perry 2008 p 96 despite his omission harvey spent a large amount of test substituting as twelfth man for paceman ray lindwall who succumbed to a hamstring injury in first innings lindwall was nevertheless able to jog between wickets when australia batted without needing a runner but he did not take field in second innings fingleton said that harvey was by far most brilliant fieldsman of both sides and that australia gained a substantial advantage through his presence on ground fingleton p 96 england captain norman yardley was sceptical as to whether lindwall was sufficiently injured to be unable to field but he did not formally object to presence of harvey former australian test cricket bill o reilly said that lindwall was demonstrably not incapacitated and that yardley must be condemned for carrying his concepts of sportsmanship too far o reilly p 42 o reilly decried benefit that australia derived through substitution agreeing with fingleton that harvey was tourists best fielder by far english commentator john arlott went further calling harvey best fielder in world arlott p 41 australia went on to defeat england by eight wickets although brown made only 17 between tests harvey was called in for match against northamptonshire scoring only 14 while brown was rested as australia won by an innings in second match before next test which was against yorkshire harvey made 49 and 56 while brown made 19 and 113 as an opener harvey hit ball to all parts of ground and fingleton opined that harvey probably gained respect of this most discerning crowd more quickly than any other cricketer in recent years fingleton p 193 however brown retained his middle order position for second test at lord s ahead of harvey australia fielded an unchanged team o reilly criticised retention of brown who had appeared to be noticeably uncomfortable in unfamiliar role he said that despite fact that brown had made an unbeaten double century on his previous test at lord s in 1938 loxton and harvey had better claims to selection o reilly p 59 bradman s men went on to a crushing win by 409 runs although brown made only 24 and 32 in middle order next match was against surrey and started day after second test brown injured a finger while fielding in first innings so he was not able to bat in australia s first innings in which harvey made 43 before being run out in second innings harvey caught surrey captain errol holmes from a leaping catch ball as it flew through a flock of pigeons fingleton p 196 on final day australia wanted to finish run chase quickly so they could watch australian john bromwich play in wimbledon tennis final harvey volunteered to play as a makeshift opener alongside sam loxton and promised bradman that he would reach target quickly australia chased down 122 runs needed for victory in just 58 minutes to complete a 10 wicket win in just 20 1 overs harvey ended unbeaten on 73 and australians arrived at wimbledon in time for championship deciding match for following match against gloucestershire before third test brown did not play harvey came to crease at 3 304 and put on 164 for fourth wicket before his partner morris was out for 294 he put on another 63 with loxton before falling for 95 during his innings harvey repeatedly advanced out of crease to attack spinners perry 2008 p 154 loxton ended on 159 not out as australia reached 7 774 declared their highest score of tour which underpinned a dominant innings victory harvey and other australian batsmen repeatedly left their crease to charge and attack off spin of tom goddard who ended with 0 186 goddard had been touted as a possible england selection because bowlers used in first two tests had failed to challenge supremacy of australia s batsmen but tourists attack ended his prospects fingleton p 199 loxton s innings earned him brown s middle order position for third test at old trafford which was a rain affected draw fourth test thumb upright 1 2 loxton congratulates harvey with his first century in a test against england during drawn third test barnes was injured and ian johnson was used as a makeshift opener because morris was only specialist opener left in team after omission of brown in meantime barnes s injury had opened up a vacancy for fourth test harvey managed only ten and brown only eight as australia defeated middlesex by ten wickets in their only county match between tests despite his low score in preceding match against middlesex harvey was called into team for fourth test at headingley at expense of barnes perry 2002 p 101 selectors had overlooked brown as a replacement for barnes s opening position instead vice captain hassett would move from middle order to accompany morris at top of innings while harvey would slot into middle order england batted first and amassed 496 australia began their reply on second afternoon and bradman and hassett saw tourists to stumps at 1 63 next morning hassett and bradman fell in one dick pollard over to leave australia at 3 68 with two new batsmen at crease harvey came in bareheaded at no 5 to join cavalier all rounder keith miller australia were more than 400 behind and if england were to remove pair they would expose australia s lower order and give themselves an opportunity to take a large first innings lead upon arriving in middle harvey told his senior partner what s going on out here eh let s get stuck into em perry p 245 fingleton p 161 harvey got off mark by forcing ball behind point for a single fingleton pp 161 162 pair launched a counterattack with miller taking lead he hoisted off spinner jim laker s first ball over square leg for six miller shielded harvey from laker as young batsman was struggling against off breaks that were turning away from him especially one ball that spun and bounced beating his outside edge fingleton p 162 miller drilled an off drive from laker for four and then hit another flat over his head almost for six into sightscreen this allowed australia to seize initiative and harvey joined fightback during next over hitting consecutive boundaries against laker second of which almost cleared playing area he then took another boundary to reach 44 with miller on 42 fingleton p 163 miller then lifted laker for a six over long off and a four over long on from yardley to reach 54 miller drove next ball through cover for four yardley responded by stacking on side with outfielders and bowling outside leg stump challenging miller to another hit for six batsman obliged but edged ball and was caught at short fine leg for 58 perry p 246 arlott pp 108 109 partnership yielded 121 runs in 90 minutes and was likened by wisden to a hurricane fingleton said that he had never known a more enjoyable hour of delectable cricket fingleton pp 162 163 o reilly said that miller and harvey had counter attacked with such joyful abandon that it would have been difficult if not absolutely impossible to gather from their methods of going about it that they were actually retrieving a tremendously difficult situation o reilly p 124 arlott said that two of greatest innings of all test cricket were being played during partnership arlott p 108 at 4 189 loxton came in to join harvey who continued to attack bowling unperturbed by miller s demise ken cranston came on to bowl and harvey square drove and then hooked to deep square leg for consecutive boundaries yardley then moved a man from fine leg to where hook had gone harvey responded by glancing a ball to fielder s former position collecting three more runs australia thus went to lunch at 4 204 with harvey on 70 fingleton p 164 after lunch australia scored slowly as loxton struggled yardley took new ball in an attempt to trouble batsmen with livelier bowling but instead loxton began to settle in he lofted pollard to leg side almost for six and then hit three boundaries off another over harvey accelerated as well and 80 minutes into middle session reached his century to a loud reception as australia passed 250 harvey s knock had taken 177 minutes and included 14 fours fingleton p 165 loxton then dominated scoring and brought up his 50 with a six partnership yielded 105 in only 95 minutes harvey was eventually out for 112 from 183 balls bowled by laker while playing a cross batted sweep his shot selection prompted bradman to throw his head back in disappointment fingleton p 166 nevertheless it was an innings noted for powerful driving on both sides of wicket and high rate of scoring helped to swing match back from england s firm control cashman pp 117 119 perry 2005 p 247 harvey fell at 5 294 and australia slumped to 8 355 before a counterattack by ray lindwall saw them to 458 restricting england s lead to 38 pollard 1990 p 14 o reilly said that harvey s innings was one of no inhibitions and that it was completely unspoiled by any preconceived plan to eliminate any particular shot he added that it was very mirror of truth in batting art delightfully untrammeled by scourge of good advice or any other handicapping influence and that harvey s innings was most pleasing he had seen since stan mccabe s 232 at trent bridge in 1938 o reilly p 125 england then progressed to 0 129 in their second innings before harvey intervened on 65 cyril washbrook attempted a hook from bill johnston connecting with middle of bat he imparted much power on ball which flew flat and never went more than six metres above ground but harvey quickly ran across ground and bent over to catch ball at ankle height while still on run jack fingleton said that it was catch of season or indeed would have been had harvey not turned on several magnificent aerial performances down at oval against surrey fingleton p 170 o reilly doubted whether any other player on either side could have made distance to get to ball let alone make a neat catch of it o reilly pp 133 134 he added that hook was a beauty and catch was a classic o reilly p 134 later in day captain yardley was caught by a leaping harvey while attempting a lofted shot from johnston fingleton p 172 after five minutes on final morning yardley declared at 8 365 batting into final day allowed yardley to ask groundsman to use a heavy roller which would help to break up wicket thereby causing more uneven bounce and making surface more likely to spin declaration left australia to chase 404 runs for victory at time this would have been highest ever fourth innings score to result in a test victory for batting side australia had only 345 minutes to reach target and local press wrote them off predicting that they would be dismissed by lunchtime on a deteriorating wicket expected to favour spin bowlers perry 2001 pp 84 89 however morris partnered bradman in a stand of 301 in 217 minutes to set up win although they were helped by england s fielders who missed several catching and stumping chances harvey came to crease at 3 396 and got off mark by hitting winning boundary perry 2002 pp 101 102 immediately after headingley test harvey made 32 in a fleet footed cameo attack against local spinners as australia amassed 456 and defeated derbyshire by an innings perry 2008 p 211 in next match against glamorgan he came to crease at fall of third wicket and made nine runs before rain ended match in second innings harvey then made a duck bowled by a big turning leg break from eric hollies in first innings as australia defeated warwickshire by nine wickets he was not required to bat in second innings perry 2008 p 216 harvey was then rested as australia faced and drew with lancashire for second time on tour he returned for non first class match against durham scoring two out of australia s 282 in a rain affected draw which ended after first day without reaching second innings fifth test although he had only scored 41 runs in four innings between tests harvey was retained for fifth and final test at oval england elected to bat on a rain affected pitch precipitation in week leading up to match had delayed start fingleton p 183 and yardley s decision to bat was regarded as a surprise as weather suggested that bowlers would enjoy conditions this proved to be correct as australia cut england down for 52 on first day with lindwall 6 20 in particular managing to make ball bounce at variable heights australia had already passed england by close of play reaching 2 153 next day harvey came to crease at 4 243 and quickly displayed exuberance of youth he hit jack young for a straight driven four and then pulled him for another harvey then succumbed to eric hollies for 17 hitting a catch to young leaving australia at 5 265 fingleton p 188 warwickshire spinner noticed this and delivered a topspinner that dipped more than usual and batsman mistimed his off drive which went in air towards mid off o reilly p 153 australia finished at 389 and then bowled england out for 188 to complete victory by an innings and 149 runs and seal series 4 0 later tour matches seven matches remained on bradman s quest to go through a tour of england without defeat australia batted first against kent and harvey made 60 including a 104 run stand with brown before falling at 4 283 part of a collapse in which australia lost their last seven wickets for 89 to end at 361 despite stumbling with bat tourists completed an innings victory in next match against gentlemen of england harvey was rested as australia amassed 5 610 and won by an innings he returned for match against somerset putting on 187 for second wicket with hassett in 110 minutes harvey hit 14 fours and 2 sixes both of which came in one over in top scoring with a glorious 126 as australia compiled 5 560 declared and won by an innings and 374 runs perry 2008 p 153 fingleton p 208 harvey performed a similar feat in following match against south of england coming in at 3 237 and scoring 110 adding 175 in 110 minutes in conjunction with hassett who also made a second successive century as australia declared at 7 522 harvey reached his century in just 90 minutes perry 2008 p 256 match was washed out but not before harvey bowled for first time during tour and took his only first class wicket for season that of trevor bailey he ended with 1 15 australia s biggest challenge in post test tour matches was against leveson gower s xi during last australian tour in 1938 leveson gower s team was effectively a full strength england outfit but this time bradman insisted that only six current england test players be allowed to play fingleton pp 207 209 bradman then fielded a full strength team perry 2005 pp 253 254 with only difference from fifth test team being inclusion of ian johnson at expense of doug ring harvey made 23 before being bowled by freddie brown as match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays for entire first
