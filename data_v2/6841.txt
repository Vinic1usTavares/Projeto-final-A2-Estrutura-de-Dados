1997 atlantic hurricane season was a below average season and is most recent season to feature no tropical cyclones in august typically one of most active months season officially began on june 1 and lasted until november 30 these dates conventionally delimit period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in atlantic basin 1997 season was inactive with only seven named storms forming with an additional tropical depression and an unnumbered subtropical storm it was first time since 1961 season that there were no active tropical cyclones in atlantic basin during entire month of august a strong el nino is credited with reducing number of storms in atlantic while increasing number of storms in eastern and western pacific basin to 19 and 29 storms respectively as is common in el nino years tropical cyclogenesis was suppressed in tropical latitudes with only two becoming tropical storms south of 25degn first system an operationally unnoticed subtropical storm developed north of bahamas on june 1 and dissipated by following day without impact tropical storm ana developed offshore south carolina on june 30 and dissipated on july 4 after causing minor affects in north carolina hurricane bill was a short lived storm between that lasted from july 11 to 13 and produced light rainfall in newfoundland as bill as dissipating tropical storm claudette developed and caused rough seas in north carolina most devastating storm was hurricane danny which caused extensive flooding particularly in southern alabama danny resulted in 9 fatalities and about 100 million 1997 usd in damage outer bands of hurricane erika brought rough seas and gusty winds to lesser antilles causing two deaths and 10 million in losses precursor to tropical storm grace caused minor flooding in puerto rico tropical depression five and tropical storms fabian did not impact land collectively storms of 1997 atlantic hurricane season resulted in 12 fatalities and approximately 111 46 million in damage seasonal forecasts pre season forecasts predictions of tropical activity in 1997 31 high activity28157record low activity10 tie 0actual activity 8 3 1 forecasts of hurricane activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane experts such as dr william m gray and his associates at colorado state university csu a normal season as defined by national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa has eleven named storms of which six reach hurricane strength and two major hurricanes may 1997 forecast stated that eleven storms would form and that seven would reach hurricane status in addition it was predicted that three of seven hurricanes would intensify into a major hurricane a category 3 rating on saffir simpson hurricane scale seasonal summary atlantic hurricane season officially began on june 1 and an unnamed subtropical storm developed on same day 1997 was least active hurricane season in above average era of tropical cyclogenesis which began in 1995 only nine tropical depressions formed eight of depressions attained tropical storm status and just three of these attained hurricane status there was only one tropical cyclone to reach major hurricane status which was slightly below 1950 2005 average of two per season only danny made landfall at hurricane strength during season although hurricane erika and tropical storm grace also caused damage and fatalities those three cyclones collectively caused 11 deaths and 111 46 million in damage last storm of season tropical storm grace dissipated on october 17 over a month before official end of season on november 30 1997 atlantic hurricane season had a very active beginning in june two tropical cyclones developed unnoticed subtropical storm and tropical storm ana an unusual four tropical cyclones formed in month of july three of which reached tropical storm intensity and two of them became hurricanes despite active start other months of season featured record low activity especially in august and september both of which combined produced only one tropical cyclone as a result of active start and subsequent lack of activity it showed that early season activity has no correlation to entire season lone tropical cyclone during period was hurricane erika which developed on september 3 in october two short lived tropical cyclones developed fabian and grace tropical cyclogenesis ceased after grace transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on october 17 season s activity was reflected with a low accumulated cyclone energy ace rating of 41 ace is broadly speaking a measure of power of hurricane multiplied by length of time it existed so storms that last a long time as well as particularly strong hurricanes have high aces ace is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34 knots 39 mph 63 km h or tropical storm strength although officially subtropical cyclones such as unnamed storm are excluded from total figure above includes periods when storms were in a subtropical phase systems unnamed subtropical storm a cluster of thunderstorms developed over florida in late may a shortwave trough brought it to northeast enhancing convection around a developing center of circulation low pressure area which formed on may 31 developed into a subtropical depression on june 1 operationally it was treated as a frontal low but post analysis suggested it remained separate throughout its lifetime and was classified as an unnamed subtropical storm it reached subtropical storm strength six hours later as it moved rapidly parallel to east coast of united states convection continued to wrap around center and despite unfavorable conditions from an approaching cold front it continued to intensify late on june 1 it reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph 85 km h while off coast of north carolina storm turned to east and transitioned extratropical late on june 2 southeast of massachusetts shortly thereafter remnants of storm merged with a cold front tropical storm ana a frontal low pressure system off coast of south carolina developed into tropical depression one at 1200 utc on june 30 it moved slowly eastward and attained tropical storm status on july 1 after becoming a tropical storm ana slightly intensified early on july 2 ana attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph 85 km h and a minimum central pressure of later on july 2 a shortwave trough forced ana to northeastward into a region of increasing vertical wind shear simultaneously ana began to weaken as it was moving into an area of decreasing sea surface temperatures sst by late on july 3 ana weakened to a tropical depression storm also lost tropical characteristics and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone early on july 4 over western atlantic ocean extratropical remnants persisted until dissipating about twenty four hours later minimal impact was reported as a result of ana other than rip currents in coastal north carolina due to rough seas 14 rescues and one serious injury occurred at carolina beach in addition five rescues were made at kure beach and at least one person was hospitalized however there were no fatalities at either location hurricane bill a large upper level low separated from a trough north of puerto rico in early july convection increased on july 7 after a surface trough developed and a low pressure area formed east of bahamas once upper level low retreated to southwest wind shear decreased across region allowing convection to increase and organize and it is estimated system developed into a tropical depression on july 11 about 330 miles 530 km southwest of bermuda after developing cyclone moved northeastward in advance of an approaching cold front it quickly intensified into tropical storm bill and briefly threatened to pass near bermuda as a result a tropical storm warning was issued although it was quickly dropped there was no impact on island from bill bill quickly intensified as it continued northeastward by midday on july 12 an eye feature was observed on satellite images which suggested that bill intensified into hurricane status at a relatively high latitude bill had in fact intensified into a hurricane and storm had attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph 120 km h minimum pressure of after only 12 hours at hurricane status bill weakened back to tropical storm status and on july 13 was absorbed by cold front about south of cape race newfoundland bill dropped very light rainfall on newfoundland peaking at slightly less than 1 inch 25 mm tropical storm claudette frontal system that influenced track of hurricane bill spawned a non tropical low off southeast united states on july 11 low remained nearly stationary as front dissipated and it developed into tropical depression three on july 13 about south southeast of wilmington north carolina depression quickly intensified into tropical storm claudette based on reconnaissance aircraft data it moved northeastward passing southeast of outer banks despite presence of wind shear it developed banding features on july 14 storm reached peak winds of thereafter claudette turned eastward ahead of a frontal system its associated thunderstorm activity was sporadic and relatively disorganized and storm weakened to a tropical depression on july 16 claudette briefly re intensified into a tropical storm before becoming extratropical later that day shortly thereafter it merged with a cold front while remnants were last noted near azores on july 23 tropical storm claudette had minimal effects on land severe rip currents from claudette in north carolina caused several rescues and one person was injured although no fatalities occurred some residents of coastal north carolina were even disappointed that claudette was to remain offshore as region was suffering from dry conditions hurricane danny a tropical low over northern gulf of mexico developed into tropical depression four on july 16 depression headed slowly east northeastward and intensified into tropical storm danny on following day danny continued east northeastward and reached hurricane strength just before landfall near buras louisiana because of narrowness of that piece of land most of danny remained over water and it lost little strength danny re emerged into gulf of mexico and strengthened slightly making two landfalls in alabama as a low end category 1 hurricane on july 19 after remaining stationary for a day danny moved northward and weakened to a tropical depression heading northward across alabama danny turned to east and crossed over southeastern united states while centered over north carolina danny interacted with a developing trough which caused it to re intensify into a tropical storm shortly thereafter danny emerged over atlantic ocean near north carolina virginia border on july 24 danny took a northward turn and came within of nantucket island on july 26 it then turned out to sea and was absorbed by a front on july 27 although danny was a hurricane upon landfall strong winds were confined to a small area with only portions of extreme eastern louisiana reporting hurricane force winds danny also dropped torrential amounts of rain in louisiana peaking at in buras triumph flooding occurred in portions of state due to heavy rainfall floods and high winds produced by danny damaged over 300 houses and more than 170 businesses in louisiana alone in mississippi danny dropped heavy rainfall on southern portion of state resulting in minor street and house flooding as danny crossed dauphin island alabama on july 19 it dropped of rain this made danny wettest tropical cyclone on record in alabama hurricane force winds were reported on dauphin island and western shores of mobile bay in same area many buildings had sustained roof damage in addition many homes on fowl and fish rivers reported significant damage further north in south carolina and virginia danny spawned several tornadoes some of them caused significant damage heavy rainfall also occurred in some isolated areas in central north carolina between 8 12 inches 200 300 mm of rain was reported danny eventually affected massachusetts bring light rainfall and tropical storm force winds to southeastern portions of state overall danny caused nine fatalities and approximately 100 million in damage tropical depression five a tropical wave emerged into atlantic ocean from west coast of africa on july 11 wave moved westward across tropical atlantic and finally began to show consistent evidence of a cloud system center deep convection associated with wave became concentrated on satellite images on july 17 and it is estimated that disturbance became tropical depression five around 0600 utc on that day while centered about east of barbados tropical depression moved west northwestward and started showing signs of falling apart on july 18 early on following day depression degenerated into a tropical wave recon observations before storm fell apart suggested that it may have briefly reached tropical storm strength tropical wave continued westward without regenerating and lost its identity on july 23 over eastern gulf of mexico hurricane erika a tropical wave which would later also develop hurricane nora developed into tropical depression six while it was centered about 1 150 miles 1 850 km east of southernmost lesser antilles on september 3 later that day depression intensified enough to be upgraded to tropical storm erika it moved west northwestward and steadily intensified to attain hurricane status on september 4 erika passed a short distance to north of lesser antilles and later turned to north in response to an approaching trough hurricane quickly strengthen to reach peak winds of 125 mph 195 km h on september 8 and after maintaining peak strength for 24 hours erika weakened over cooler waters it turned to east weakened to a tropical storm and became extratropical after passing near azores on september 15 hurricane produced light rainfall and winds throughout northern lesser antilles passage of erika brought a cloud of ash to antigua from eruption of soufriere hills volcano on montserrat a rare occurrence strong waves from hurricane produced beach erosion and coastal flooding in northern puerto rico and killed two surfers moderate wind gusts in puerto rico left thousands without power and hurricane resulted in 10 million in damage to caribbean territory of united states erika also produced gusty winds and light rain in azores later in its duration storm brought hurricane force wind gusts and rainfall to azores though no damage was reported erika was only tropical cyclone in atlantic basin in month of september in this year first such occurrence in a hurricane season since 1929 tropical storm fabian a tropical wave emerged into atlantic ocean from west coast of africa near dakar senegal on september 22 wave traveled westward with minimal tropical cyclogenesis and reached lesser antilles about a week later while passing through islands heavy rainfall and strong winds were reported eventually system developed into a broad area of low pressure and acquired a low level circulation however upper level wind shear resulted in no immediate further organization after crossing puerto rico and virgin islands wind shear decreased since low was moving in same direction as upper level winds at 1800 utc october 4 it is estimated that system developed into tropical depression seven while north of puerto rico however national hurricane center did not initiate advisories until 1500 utc on october 7 depression strengthened and about 24 hours after forming it became tropical storm fabian later on october 5 no further significant change in intensity occurred for remainder of its duration as fabian had peaked with winds of 40 mph 65 km h storm began losing tropical characteristics and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone at 1200 utc on october 8 tropical storm grace an extratropical low formed just north of hispaniola on october 14 and on following day it attained gale force winds in addition system was also acquiring tropical characteristics and was classified as tropical storm grace on october 16 at 0000 utc strong vertical wind shear prevented further intensification and grace immediately peaked with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph 75 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of though grace was classified as a tropical cyclone it still held onto some extratropical characteristics thereafter grace steadily weakened and eventually degenerated into an extratropical low on october 17 precursor disturbance of grace dropped moderate to heavy rainfall across puerto rico peaking at in as a result flash flooding occurred throughout island of puerto rico while landslides caused damage to roads and bridges in addition numerous rivers overflowed their banks which forced 37 people to seek shelter across island one fatality occurred and damage amounted to 1 46 million in addition extratropical system produced light to moderate rainfall in u s virgin islands and precipitation reached along western sides of islands storm names following names were used for named storms that formed in north atlantic in 1997 in spring of 1998 no names were retired so it was used again in 2003 season this is same list used for 1991 season except for bill which replaced bob a storm was named bill for first time in 1997 names that were not assigned are marked in ana bill claudette danny erika fabian grace season effects this is a table of all of storms that formed in 1997 atlantic hurricane season it includes their duration names landfall s denoted by bold location names damages and death totals deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident but are still
