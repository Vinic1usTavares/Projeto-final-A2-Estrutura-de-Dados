elected to episcopate at worcester before becoming a bishop he wrote theological works and sermons some of which have survived as a bishop baldwin came to attention of king henry ii of england who was so impressed he insisted that baldwin become archbishop in that office baldwin quarrelled with his cathedral clergy over founding of a church which led to imprisonment of clergy in their cloister for more than a year baldwin spent some time in wales with gerald of wales preaching and raising money for third crusade after coronation of king richard i new king sent baldwin ahead to holy land where he became embroiled in politics of kingdom of jerusalem baldwin died in holy land while participating in crusade his long running dispute with his clergy led one chronicler to characterise baldwin as more damaging to christianity than saladin ecclesiastical career born in exeter around 1125 baldwin was son of hugh d eu archdeacon of totnes and a woman of unknown name who later became a nun gervase of canterbury s story that he was from an even humbler background has been shown by modern scholarship to stem from bias on medieval chronicler s part holdsworth baldwin oxford dictionary of national biography it is possible that he studied at bologna in 1150s with future pope urban iii bartlett england under norman and angevin kings p thomas becket p 37 robert warelwast who was bishop of exeter

substantiated by any contemporary record morey bartholomew of exeter pp 105 109 in 1150 or 1151 pope eugene iii appointed him tutor to eugene s nephew by 1155 baldwin seems to have returned to england

influence bishop to increase his support and not to sign any appeal by english bishops against becket knowles episcopal colleagues p 103 other letters from john dealt with rumours concerning roger bishop of worcester who john had heard was speaking badly of becket john s purpose seems to have been to have baldwin pass along a warning from becket to roger about his behaviour john was a supporter of becket s during latter s exile cheney roger of worcester p 36 in 1169 baldwin was once again peripherally involved in becket dispute when he objected to becket s excommunication of a number of noblemen and clergy for opposing becket s cause baldwin s objection was not so much that they were excommunicated but that no warning had been given that such an action was contemplated baldwin became

domesday book to magna carta p 221 and felt that they profited too much from cult of thomas becket barlow thomas becket p 271 dispute escalated when baldwin deprived monks of some of revenues of their monastic estates after that baldwin proposed to establish a church dedicated to becket in canterbury itself staffed by secular rather than monastic clergy monks of cathedral chapter saw this proposed foundation as first step in an attempt to change see of canterbury from a monastic cathedral chapter a peculiarity of english church to more normal pattern of secular clergy it is not clear if baldwin himself intended such a plan but other bishops supported effort as contemporary writers made clear baldwin sought advice of hugh bishop of lincoln who advised baldwin to abandon plan as it would only cause distress to all parties controversy was long and involved and at one point monks were imprisoned within their own buildings for a year and a half from january 1188 to august 1189 this led to suspension of liturgy in cathedral eventually all prominent ecclesiastics and monastic houses of europe were forced into choosing sides in dispute in october 1189 in an attempt to gain control baldwin appointed roger norreys as chapter s prior an appointment widely acknowledged by contemporaries as putting a useless individual into office his plan for financing church involved soliciting contributions from donors by promising a one third reduction in penances for annual donations little religious poverty p 32 thumb right king henry ii of england service to king henry in 1188 king

efforts in wales tyerman england and crusades p 161 although he also suggested that baldwin mainly embarked on tour to avoid his dispute with canterbury monks tyerman god s war p 393 a side effect of baldwin s tour of wales was implied assertion of royal authority in a section of henry s domains that had always been somewhat fractious baldwin was also asserting his ecclesiastical authority over welsh bishops especially when he made a point of celebrating mass at every welsh cathedral he was first archbishop of canterbury to celebrate mass at st asaph s cathedral baldwin excommunicated only welsh prince who refused to appear before him and take cross owain cyfeiliog tyerman god s war p 385 baldwin was with king henry shortly before latter s death taking part in unsuccessful efforts to

he was going to found proposed church at lambeth and then join richard on crusade both richard and baldwin agreed to appoint norreys to evesham abbey as previous abbot of evesham adam of evesham had recently died this appointment eventually led after baldwin s death to case of evesham knowles monastic order pp 331 333 in august 1189 baldwin objected to marriage of prince john later king john to

nonant in march 1190 for holding secular office as sheriff but baldwin wrote to fitzneal after his departure that nonant had agreed to relinquish his secular offices franklin nonant hugh de oxford dictionary of national biography baldwin and his group arrived at tyre on 16 september 1190 richard did not arrive in syria until 1191 bartlett england under norman and angevin kings p 115 it is unclear exactly why they were sent ahead of king perhaps it was to look out for king s interests while richard took a more leisurely route or perhaps to rid king s entourage of a family grouping around glanvill that king did not trust baldwin was not a member or close associate of glanvill faction so most likely he was sent ahead to look after king s interests whatever reasons for inclusion of his companions another concern may have been to get help to kingdom of jerusalem as quickly as possible after king learned of frederick barbarossa s death on way to holy land tyerman god s war p 441 when baldwin arrived at acre on 12 october 1190 muslim forces in city were under siege by frankish forces led by king guy of lusignan and queen sibylla of jerusalem tyerman god s war pp 409 410

july from an epidemic ravaging siege camp where they were living this left guy without a legal claim to kingdom as he had held kingship through his wife heiress to kingdom was sibylla s half sister isabella she was already married to humphrey iv of toron but he was loyal to guy and seems to have had no ambition to be king a more promising candidate for throne was conrad of montferrat uncle of last undisputed king baldwin v conrad had saved kingdom from destruction by leading successful defence of tyre and had support of isabella s mother maria comnena and stepfather balian of ibelin maria and balian abducted isabella from humphrey and compelled her to seek an annulment so that she could be married to conrad and enable him to claim kingship gillingham richard i pp 148 149 baldwin supported guy s claim but ubaldo archbishop of pisa philip of dreux bishop of beauvais and patriarch of jerusalem supported conrad isabella and humphrey s marriage was forcibly annulled baldwin

distributed rest of money to poor tyerman england and crusades p 63 writings and studies de sacramento altaris dealing with eucharist and passover is baldwin s longest surviving work in 12 manuscripts

been authored by baldwin but do not survive these include carmen which was seen by john bale at glastonbury abbey in 16th century other lost works were a commentary on biblical books of samuel and kings de which existed at christ church priory in 13th century and de fidei which was seen by john leland at christ church in 16th century some of baldwin s letters existed in manuscript form although they appear never to have circulated as a collection but they are no longer extant one of his letters is mentioned in a rievaulx abbey catalogue and leland mentions others in his works besides baldwin s own writings there is a decretal collection known as still extant in manuscript ms form it now resides in british library as royal ms 10 a ii this collection may have belonged to baldwin it was probably compiled at worcester cathedral before december 1184 when baldwin went to canterbury and besides a basic collection of pope alexander iii s decretals it includes a number of letters from papacy addressed to baldwin as bishop of worcester and as archbishop of canterbury although main contents are unexceptional compiler of work numbered books and capitula into which work was divided an innovation that allowed for much more efficient use of collection it is likely that compiler was one of baldwin s clerks and that this testified to baldwin s continuing interest in canon law cheney
