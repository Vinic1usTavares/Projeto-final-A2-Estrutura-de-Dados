concussion also known as mild traumatic brain injury mtbi is typically defined as a head injury that temporarily affects brain functioning symptoms may include loss of consciousness loc memory loss headaches difficulty with thinking concentration or balance nausea blurred vision sleep disturbances and mood changes any of these symptoms may begin immediately or appear days after injury it is not unusual for symptoms to last 2 weeks in adults and 4 weeks in children fewer than 10 of sports related concussions among children are associated with loss of consciousness common causes include motor vehicle collisions falls sports injuries and bicycle accidents risk factors include drinking alcohol and a prior history of concussion mechanism of injury involves either a direct blow to head or forces elsewhere on body that are transmitted to head this is believed to result in neuron dysfunction as there is increased glucose requirements but not enough blood supply diagnosis requires less than 30 minutes of loc memory loss of less than 24 hours and a glasgow coma scale score of 13 to 15 otherwise it is considered a moderate or severe traumatic brain injury prevention of concussions includes use of a helmet when bicycling or treatment generally involves physical and cognitive rest for a day or two with a gradual return to activities prolonged periods of rest may slow recovery and result in greater depression and anxiety paracetamol acetaminophen or nsaids may be recommended to help with a headache physiotherapy may be useful for persistent balance problems cognitive behavioral therapy may be useful for mood changes evidence to support use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy and chiropractic therapy is lacking worldwide concussions are estimated to affect more than 3 5 per 1 000 people a year concussions are classified as mild traumatic brain injuries and are most common type of tbis males and young adults are most commonly affected outcomes are generally good another concussion before symptoms of a prior concussion have resolved is associated with worse outcomes repeated concussions may also increase risk in later life of chronic traumatic encephalopathy parkinson s disease and depression thumb upright 1 3 video explanation of concussions in children signs and symptoms concussions are associated with a variety of symptoms which typically occur rapidly after injury early symptoms usually subside within days or weeks number and type of symptoms any one individual has varies severity of initial symptoms is strongest predictor of recovery time physical headaches are most common mtbi symptom others include dizziness vomiting nausea lack of motor coordination difficulty balancing or other problems with movement or sensation visual symptoms include light sensitivity seeing bright lights blurred vision and double vision tinnitus or a ringing in ears is also commonly reported in one in about seventy concussions concussive convulsions occur but seizures that take place during or immediately after a concussion are not post traumatic seizures and unlike post traumatic seizures are not predictive of post traumatic epilepsy which requires some form of structural brain damage not just a momentary disruption in normal brain functioning concussive convulsions are thought to result from temporary loss or inhibition of motor function and are not associated either with epilepsy or with more serious structural damage they are not associated with any particular sequelae and have same high rate of favorable outcomes as concussions without convulsions cognitive and emotional cognitive symptoms include confusion disorientation and difficulty focusing attention loss of consciousness may occur but is not necessarily correlated with severity of concussion if it is brief post traumatic amnesia in which events following injury cannot be recalled is a hallmark of concussions confusion another concussion hallmark may be present immediately or may develop over several minutes a person may repeat same questions be slow to respond to questions or directions have a vacant stare or have slurred or incoherent speech other mtbi symptoms include changes in sleeping patterns and difficulty with reasoning concentrating and performing everyday activities a concussion can result in changes in mood including loss of interest in favorite activities or items and displays of emotion that are inappropriate to situation common symptoms in concussed children include restlessness lethargy and irritability mechanism thumb rotational force is key in a concussion punches in boxing can deliver more rotational force to head than typical impact in american football forces brain is surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid which protects it from light trauma more severe impacts or forces associated with rapid acceleration may not be absorbed by this cushion concussion may be caused by impact forces in which head strikes or is struck by something or impulsive forces in which head moves without itself being subject to blunt trauma for example when chest hits something and head snaps forward forces may cause linear rotational or angular movement of brain or a combination of them in rotational movement head turns around its center of gravity and in angular movement it turns on an axis not through its center of gravity amount of rotational force is thought to be major component in concussion and its severity studies with athletes have shown that amount of force and location of impact are not necessarily correlated with severity of concussion or its symptoms and have called into question threshold for concussion previously thought to exist at around 70 75 g parts of brain most affected by rotational forces are midbrain and diencephalon it is thought that forces from injury disrupt normal cellular activities in reticular activating system located in these areas and that this disruption produces loss of consciousness often seen in concussion other areas of brain that may be affected include upper part of brain stem fornix corpus callosum temporal lobe and frontal lobe angular accelerations of 4600 or 7900 rad s2 are estimated to have 25 50 or 80 risk of mtbi respectively pathophysiology in both animals and humans mtbi can alter brain s physiology for hours to years setting into motion a variety of pathological events as one example in animal models after an initial increase in glucose metabolism there is a subsequent reduced metabolic state which may persist for up to four weeks after injury though these events are thought to interfere with neuronal and brain function metabolic processes that follow concussion are reversible in a large majority of affected brain cells however a few cells may die after injury included in cascade of events unleashed in brain by concussion is impaired neurotransmission loss of regulation of ions deregulation of energy use and cellular metabolism and a reduction in cerebral blood flow excitatory neurotransmitters chemicals such as glutamate that serve to stimulate nerve cells are released in excessive amounts resulting cellular excitation causes neurons to fire excessively this creates an imbalance of ions such as potassium and calcium across cell membranes of neurons a process like excitotoxicity at same time cerebral blood flow is relatively reduced for unknown reasons though reduction in blood flow is not as severe as it is in ischemia thus cells get less glucose than they normally do which causes an energy crisis concurrently with these processes activity of mitochondria may be reduced which causes cells to rely on anaerobic metabolism to produce energy increasing levels of byproduct lactate for a period of minutes to days after a concussion brain is especially vulnerable to changes in intracranial pressure blood flow and anoxia according to studies performed on animals which are not always applicable to humans large numbers of neurons can die during this period in response to slight normally innocuous changes in blood flow concussion involves diffuse as opposed to focal brain injury meaning that dysfunction occurs over a widespread area of brain rather than in a particular spot it is thought to be a milder type of diffuse axonal injury because axons may be injured to a minor extent due to stretching animal studies in which rodents were concussed have revealed lifelong neuropathological consequences such as ongoing axonal degeneration and in subcortical white matter tracts axonal damage has been found in brains of concussion sufferers who died from other causes but inadequate blood flow to brain due to other injuries may have contributed findings from a study of brains of deceased nfl athletes who received concussions suggest that lasting damage is done by such injuries this damage severity of which increases with cumulative number of concussions sustained can lead to a variety of other health issues debate over whether concussion is a functional or structural phenomenon is ongoing structural damage has been found in mildly traumatically injured brains of animals but it is not clear whether these findings would apply to humans such changes in brain structure could be responsible for certain symptoms such as visual disturbances but other sets of symptoms especially those of a psychological nature are more likely to be caused by reversible pathophysiological changes in cellular function that occur after concussion such as alterations in neurons biochemistry these reversible changes could also explain why dysfunction is frequently temporary a task force of head injury experts called concussion in sport group met in 2001 and decided that concussion may result in neuropathological changes but acute clinical symptoms largely reflect a functional disturbance rather than structural injury using animal studies pathology of a concussion seems to start with mechanical shearing and stretching forces disrupting cell membrane of nerve cells through this results in potassium outflow from within cell into extracellular space with subsequent release of excitatory neurotransmitters including glutamate which leads to enhanced potassium extrusion in turn resulting in sustained depolarization impaired nerve activity and potential nerve damage human studies have failed to identify changes in glutamate concentration immediately post mtbi though disruptions have been seen 3 days to 2 weeks post injury in an effort to restore ion balance sodium potassium ion pumps increase activity which results in excessive atp adenosine triphosphate consumption and glucose utilization quickly depleting glucose stores within cells simultaneously inefficient oxidative metabolism leads to anaerobic metabolism of glucose and increased lactate accumulation there is a resultant local acidosis in brain and increased cell membrane permeability leading to local swelling after this increase in glucose metabolism there is a subsequent lower metabolic state which may persist for up to 4 weeks after injury a completely separate pathway involves a large amount of calcium accumulating in cells which may impair oxidative metabolism and begin further biochemical pathways that result in cell death again both of these main pathways have been established from animal studies and extent to which they apply to humans is still somewhat unclear diagnosis red flags are warning signs that may indicate a more serious problem red waking recognizing people or neurological usual self thumb upright 1 3 unequal pupil size can be a sign of a brain injury possibly more serious than a concussion head trauma recipients are initially assessed to exclude a more severe emergency such as an intracranial hemorrhage this includes abcs airway breathing circulation and stabilization of cervical spine which is assumed to be injured in any athlete who is found to be unconscious after head or neck injury indications that screening for more serious injury is needed include worsening of symptoms such as headaches persistent vomiting increasing disorientation or a deteriorating level of consciousness seizures and unequal pupil size those with such symptoms or those who are at higher risk of a more serious brain injury may undergo brain imaging to detect lesions and are frequently observed for 24 48 hours a brain ct or brain mri should be avoided unless there are progressive neurological symptoms focal neurological findings or concern of skull fracture on exam diagnosis of mtbi is based on physical and neurological examination findings duration of unconsciousness usually less than 30 minutes and post traumatic amnesia pta usually less than 24 hours and glasgow coma scale mtbi sufferers have scores of 13 to 15 neuropsychological tests exist to measure cognitive function and international consensus meeting in zurich recommended use of test such tests may be administered hours days or weeks after injury or at different times to demonstrate any trend increasingly athletes are also being tested pre season to provide a baseline for comparison in event of an injury though this may not reduce risk or affect return to play if glasgow coma scale is less than 15 at two hours or less than 14 at any time a ct is recommended in addition a ct scan is more likely to be performed if observation after discharge is not assured or intoxication is present there is suspected increased risk for bleeding age greater than 60 or less than 16 most concussions without complication cannot be detected with mri or ct scans however changes have been reported on mri and spect imaging in those with concussion and normal ct scans and post concussion syndrome may be associated with abnormalities visible on spect and pet scans mild head injury may or may not produce abnormal eeg readings a blood test known as brain trauma indicator was approved in united states in 2018 and may be able to rule out risk of intracranial bleeding and thus need for a ct scan for adults concussion may be under diagnosed because of lack of highly noticeable signs and symptoms while athletes may minimize their injuries to remain in competition a retrospective survey in 2005 suggested that more than 88 of concussions are unrecognized diagnosis can be complex because concussion shares symptoms with other conditions for example post concussion symptoms such as cognitive problems may be misattributed to brain injury when in fact due to post traumatic stress disorder ptsd classification no single definition of concussion minor head injury or mild traumatic brain injury is universally accepted in 2001 expert concussion in sport group of first international symposium on concussion in sport defined concussion as a complex pathophysiological process affecting brain induced by traumatic biomechanical forces it was agreed that concussion typically involves temporary impairment of neurological function that heals by itself within time and that neuroimaging normally shows no gross structural changes to brain as result of condition however although no structural brain damage occurs according to classic definition some researchers have included injuries in which structural damage has occurred and national institute for health and clinical excellence definition includes physiological or physical disruption in brain s synapses also by definition concussion has historically involved a loss of consciousness however definition has evolved over time to include a change in consciousness such as amnesia although controversy continues about whether definition should include only those injuries in which loss of consciousness occurs this debate resurfaces in some of best known concussion grading scales in which those episodes involving loss of consciousness are graded as being more severe than those without definitions of mild traumatic brain injury mtbi were inconsistent until world health organization s international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems icd 10 provided a consistent authoritative definition across specialties in 1992 since then various organizations such as american congress of rehabilitation medicine and american psychiatric association in its diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders have defined mtbi using some combination of loss of consciousness loc post traumatic amnesia pta and glasgow coma scale gcs concussion falls under classification of mild tbi but it is not clear whether concussion is implied in mild brain injury or mild head injury mtbi and concussion are often treated as synonyms in medical literature but other injuries such as intracranial hemorrhages e g intra axial hematoma epidural hematoma and subdural hematoma are not necessarily precluded in mtbi or mild head injury as they are in concussion mtbi associated with abnormal neuroimaging may be considered complicated mtbi concussion can be considered to imply a state in which brain function is temporarily impaired and mtbi to imply a pathophysiological state but in practice few researchers and clinicians distinguish between terms descriptions of condition including severity and area of brain affected are now used more often than concussion in clinical neurology grading systems at least 41 systems measure severity or grade of a mild head injury and there is little agreement about which is best in an effort to simplify 2nd international conference on concussion in sport meeting in prague in 2004 decided that these systems should be abandoned in favor of a simple or complex classification however 2008 meeting in zurich abandoned simple versus complex terminology although participants did agree to keep concept that most 80 90 concussions resolve in a short period 7 10 days and although recovery time frame may be longer in children and adolescents in past decision to allow athletes to return to participation was frequently based on grade of concussion however current research and recommendations by professional organizations including national athletic trainers association recommend against such use of these grading systems currently injured athletes are prohibited from returning to play before they are symptom free during both rest and exertion and until results of neuropsychological tests have returned to pre injury levels three grading systems have been most widely followed by robert cantu colorado medical society and american academy of neurology each employs three grades as summarized in following table comparison of historic concussion grading scales not currently recommended for use by medical professionals guidelines grade i grade ii grade iii cantu post traumatic amnesia 30 minutes no loss of consciousness loss of consciousness 5 minutes or amnesia lasting 30 minutes 24 hours loss of consciousness 5 minutes or amnesia 24 hours colorado medical society confusion no loss of consciousness confusion post traumatic amnesia no loss of consciousness any loss of consciousness american academy of neurology confusion symptoms last 15 minutes no loss of consciousness symptoms last 15 minutes no loss of consciousness loss of consciousness iiia coma lasts seconds iiib for minutes prevention prevention of mtbi involves general measures such as wearing seat belts using airbags in cars and protective equipment such as helmets for high risk sports older people are encouraged to reduce fall risk by keeping floors free of clutter and wearing thin flat shoes with hard soles that do not interfere with balance protective equipment such as helmets and other headgear and policy changes such as banning of body checking in youth hockey leagues have been found to reduce number and severity of concussions in athletes secondary prevention such as a return to play protocol for an athlete may reduce risk of repeat concussions new head impact telemetry system technology is being placed in helmets to study injury mechanisms and may generate knowledge that will potentially help reduce risk of concussions among american football players educational interventions such as handouts videos workshops and lectures can improve concussion knowledge of diverse groups particularly youth athletes and coaches strong concussion knowledge may be associated with greater recognition of concussion symptoms higher rates of concussion reporting behaviors and reduced body checking related penalties and injuries thereby lowering risk of mtbi self reported concussion rates among u 20 and elite rugby union players in ireland are 45 48 half of these injuries go unreported changes to rules or enforcing existing rules in sports such as those against head down tackling or spearing which is associated with a high injury rate may also prevent concussions treatment after exclusion of neck or head injury observation should be continued for several hours if repeated vomiting worsening headache dizziness seizure activity excessive drowsiness double vision slurred speech unsteady walk or weakness or numbness in arms or legs or signs of basilar skull fracture develop immediate assessment in an emergency department is needed after this initial period has passed there is debate as to whether it is necessary to awaken person several times during first night as has traditionally been done or whether there is more benefit from uninterrupted sleep physical and cognitive rest should be continued until all symptoms have resolved with most 80 90 concussions resolving in seven to ten days although recovery time may be longer in children and adolescents cognitive rest includes reducing activities which require concentration and attention such as school work video games and text messaging it has been suggested that even leisure reading can commonly worsen symptoms in children and adolescents and proposals include time off from school and attending partial days since students may appear normal continuing education of relevant school personnel may be needed those with concussion are generally prescribed rest including adequate nighttime sleep as well as daytime rest rest includes both physical and cognitive rest until symptoms clear and a gradual return to normal activities at a pace that does not cause symptoms to worsen is recommended education about symptoms their management and their normal time course can lead to an improved outcome for persons participating in athletics 2008 zurich consensus statement on concussion in sport recommends that participants be symptom free before restarting and then progress through a series of graded steps these steps include complete physical and cognitive rest light aerobic activity less than 70 of maximum heart rate sport specific activities such as running drills and skating drills non contact training drills exercise coordination and cognitive load full contact practice full contact games only when symptom free for 24 hours should progression to next step occur if symptoms occur person should drop back to previous asymptomatic level for at least another 24 hours emphasis is on remaining symptom free and taking it in medium steps not on steps themselves medications may be prescribed to treat sleep problems and depression analgesics such as ibuprofen can be taken for headaches but paracetamol acetaminophen is preferred to minimize risk of intracranial hemorrhage concussed individuals are advised not to use alcohol or other drugs that have not been approved by a doctor as they can impede healing activation database guided eeg biofeedback has been shown to return memory abilities of concussed individual to levels better than control group about one percent of people who receive treatment for mtbi need surgery for a brain injury observation to monitor for worsening condition is an important part of treatment health care providers recommend that those suffering from concussion return for further medical care and evaluation 24 to 72 hours after concussive event if symptoms worsen athletes especially intercollegiate or professional are typically followed closely by team athletic trainers during this period but others may not have access to this level of health care and may be sent home with minimal monitoring people may be released after assessment from hospital or emergency room to care of a trusted person with instructions to return if they display worsening symptoms or those that might indicate an emergent condition such as change in consciousness convulsions severe headache extremity weakness vomiting new bleeding or deafness in either or both ears prognosis people who have had a concussion seem more susceptible to another one particularly if new injury occurs before symptoms from previous concussion have completely gone away it is also a negative process if smaller impacts cause same symptom severity repeated concussions may increase a person s risk in later life for dementia parkinson s disease and depression mtbi has a mortality rate of almost zero symptoms of most concussions resolve within weeks but problems may persist these are seldom permanent and outcome is usually excellent about 75 of children recover within three months overall prognosis for recovery may be influenced by a variety of factors that include age at time of injury intellectual abilities family environment social support system occupational status coping strategies and financial circumstances people over age 55 may take longer to heal from mtbi or may heal incompletely similarly factors such as a previous head injury or a coexisting medical condition have been found to predict longer lasting post concussion symptoms other factors that may lengthen recovery time after mtbi include psychological problems such as substance abuse or clinical depression poor health before injury or additional injuries sustained during it and life stress longer periods of amnesia or loss of consciousness immediately after injury may indicate longer recovery times from residual symptoms for unknown reasons having had one concussion significantly increases a person s risk of having another having previously sustained a sports concussion has been found to be a strong factor increasing likelihood of a concussion in future other strong factors include participation in a contact sport and body mass size prognosis may differ between concussed adults and children little research has been done on concussion in pediatric population but concern exists that severe concussions could interfere with brain development in children a 2009 study found that individuals with a history of concussions might demonstrate a decline in both physical and mental performance for longer than 30 years compared to their peers with no history of brain trauma sufferers of concussion exhibited effects including loss of episodic memory and reduced muscle speed post concussion syndrome in post concussion syndrome symptoms do not resolve for weeks months or years after a concussion and may occasionally be permanent about 10 to 20 of people have post concussion syndrome for more than a month symptoms may include headaches dizziness fatigue anxiety memory and attention problems sleep problems and irritability there is no established treatment and rest a recommended recovery technique has limited effectiveness symptoms usually go away on their own within months but may last for years question of whether syndrome is due to structural damage or other factors such as psychological ones or a combination of these has long been subject of debate cumulative effects cumulative effects of concussions are poorly understood especially effects on children severity of concussions and their symptoms may worsen with successive injuries even if a subsequent injury occurs months or years after an initial one symptoms may be more severe and changes in neurophysiology can occur with third and subsequent concussions studies have had conflicting findings on whether athletes have longer recovery times after repeat concussions and whether cumulative effects such as impairment in cognition and memory occur cumulative effects may include psychiatric disorders and loss of long term memory for example risk of developing clinical depression has been found to be significantly greater for retired american football players with a history of three or more concussions than for those with no concussion history three or more concussions is also associated with a fivefold greater chance of developing alzheimer s disease earlier and a threefold greater chance of developing memory deficits cte chronic traumatic encephalopathy or cte is an example of cumulative damage that can occur as result of multiple concussions or less severe blows to head condition was previously referred to as dementia pugilistica or punch drunk syndrome as it was first noted in boxers disease can lead to cognitive and physical handicaps such as parkinsonism speech and memory problems slowed mental processing tremor depression and inappropriate behavior it shares features with alzheimer s disease second impact syndrome second impact syndrome in which brain swells dangerously after a minor blow may occur in very rare cases condition may develop in people who receive second blow days or weeks after an initial concussion before its symptoms have gone away no one is certain of cause of this often fatal complication but it is commonly thought that swelling occurs because brain s lose ability to regulate their diameter causing a loss of control over cerebral blood flow as brain swells intracranial pressure rapidly rises brain can herniate and brain stem can fail within five minutes except in boxing all cases have occurred in athletes under age 20 due to very small number of documented cases diagnosis is controversial and doubt exists about its validity a 2010 pediatrics review article stated that there is debate whether brain swelling is due to two separate hits or to just one hit but in either case catastrophic football head injuries are three times more likely in high school athletes than in college athletes epidemiology thumb right annual incidence of mtbi by age group in canada most cases of traumatic brain injury are concussions a world health organization who study estimated that between 70 and 90 of head injuries that receive treatment are mild however due to under reporting and to widely varying definitions of concussion and mtbi it is difficult to estimate how common condition is estimates of incidence of concussion may be artificially low for example due to under reporting at least 25 of mtbi sufferers fail to get assessed by a medical professional who group reviewed studies on epidemiology of mtbi and found a hospital treatment rate of 1 3 per 1000 people but since not all concussions are treated in hospitals they estimated that rate per year in general population is over 6 per 1000 people age young children have highest concussion rate among all age groups however most people who suffer a concussion are young adults a canadian study found that yearly incidence of mtbi is lower in older age groups graph at right studies suggest males suffer mtbi at about twice rate of their female counterparts however female athletes may be at a higher risk of suffering a concussion than their male counterparts sports up to five percent of sports injuries are concussions u s centers for disease control and prevention estimates that 300 000 sports related concussions occur yearly in u s but that number includes only athletes who lost consciousness since loss of consciousness is thought to occur in less than 10 of concussions cdc estimate is likely lower than real number sports in which concussion is particularly common include football and boxing a boxer aims to knock out i e give a mild traumatic brain injury to opponent injury is so common in latter that several medical groups have called for a ban on sport including american academy of neurology world medical association and medical associations of uk us australia and canada history thumb upright hippocratic corpus mentioned concussion hippocratic corpus a collection of medical works from ancient greece mentions concussion later translated to commotio cerebri and discusses loss of speech hearing and sight that can result from commotion of brain this idea of disruption of mental function by shaking of brain remained widely accepted understanding of concussion until 19th century in 10th century persian physician muhammad ibn zakariya razi was first to write about concussion as distinct from other types of head injury he may have been first to use term cerebral concussion and his definition of condition a transient loss of function with no physical damage set stage for medical understanding of condition for centuries in 13th century physician lanfranc of milan s magna described concussion as brain commotion also recognizing a difference between concussion and other types of traumatic brain injury though many of his contemporaries did not and discussing transience of post concussion symptoms as a result of temporary loss of function from injury in 14th century surgeon guy de pointed out relatively good prognosis of concussion as compared to more severe types of head trauma such as skull fractures and penetrating head trauma in 16th century term concussion came into use and symptoms such as confusion lethargy and memory problems were described 16th century physician ambroise pare used term commotio cerebri as well as shaking of brain commotion and concussion thumb lef upright guillaume dupuytren distinguished between concussion and unconsciousness associated with brain contusion until 17th century a concussion was usually described by its clinical features but after invention of microscope more physicians began exploring underlying physical and structural mechanisms however prevailing view in 17th century was that injury did not result from physical damage and this view continued to be widely held throughout 18th century word concussion was used at time to describe state of unconsciousness and other functional problems that resulted from impact rather than a physiological condition in 1839 guillaume dupuytren described brain contusions which involve many small hemorrhages as cerebri and showed difference between unconsciousness associated with damage to brain parenchyma and that due to concussion without such injury in 1941 animal experiments showed that no macroscopic damage occurs in concussion society and culture costs due to lack of a consistent definition economic costs of mtbi are not known but they are estimated to be very high these high costs are due in part to large percentage of hospital admissions for head injury that are due to mild head trauma but indirect costs such as lost work time and early retirement account for bulk of costs these direct and indirect costs cause expense of mild brain trauma to rival that of moderate and severe head injuries terminology terms mild brain injury mild traumatic brain injury mtbi mild head injury mhi and concussion may be used interchangeably although term concussion is still used in sports literature as interchangeable with mhi or mtbi general clinical medical literature uses mtbi instead since a 2003 cdc report outlined it as an important strategy in this article concussion and mtbi are used interchangeably term concussion is from latin to shake violently or action of striking together research minocycline lithium and n acetylcysteine show tentative success in animal models measurement of predictive visual tracking is being studied as a screening technique to identify mild traumatic brain injury a head mounted display unit with eye tracking capability shows a moving object in a predictive pattern for person to follow with their eyes people without brain injury will be able to track moving object with smooth pursuit eye movements and correct trajectory while it is hypothesized that those with mild traumatic brain injury cannot see also concussions in american football concussion in rugby union head injury criterion helmet
