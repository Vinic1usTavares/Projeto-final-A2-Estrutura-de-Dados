kimberella is an extinct genus of bilaterian known only from rocks of ediacaran period slug like organism fed by scratching microbial surface on which it dwelt in a manner similar to gastropods although its affinity with this group is contentious specimens were first found in australia s ediacara hills but recent research has concentrated on numerous finds near white sea in russia which cover an interval of time from as with many fossils from this time its evolutionary relationships to other organisms are hotly debated paleontologists initially classified kimberella as a type of jellyfish but since 1997 features of its anatomy and its association with scratch marks resembling those made by a radula have been interpreted as signs that it may have been a mollusc although some paleontologists dispute its classification as a mollusc it is generally accepted as being at least a bilaterian classification of kimberella is important for scientific understanding of cambrian explosion if it was a mollusc or at least a protostome protostome and deuterostome lineages must have diverged significantly before even if it was a bilaterian but not a mollusc its age would indicate that animals were diversifying well before start of cambrian etymology thumb left restoration genus is named after mr john kimber student teacher and collector who lost his life during an expedition to central australia in 1964 originally it was described with name kimberia dr n h ludbrook pointed out that name kimberia was already used for a turtle subgenus accordingly new name kimberella was proposed by mary wade in 1972 occurrence kimberella has been found both in ediacara hills of south australia and in ust formation in white sea region of russia white sea fossils are often associated with ediacaran animals tribrachidium and dickinsonia meandering trace fossil trails possibly made by kimberella and algae beds in white sea succession have been dated to and by radiometric dating using uranium lead ratios in found in volcanic ash layers that are sandwiched between layers that contain kimberella fossils kimberella fossils are also known from beds older and younger than this precisely dated range fossils from ediacara hills have not been dated precisely description thumb 350px left history of kimberella quadrata reconstruction m wade 1972 m a fedonkin b waggoner 1997 m a

of sediments and variety of circumstances in which specimens were preserved provide detailed information about kimberella s external form internal anatomy locomotion and feeding style all of fossils are oval in outline elongated specimens illustrate that organism was capable of stretching in an anterior posterior direction perhaps by as much as a factor of two only type of symmetry visible in white sea specimens is bilateral there is no sign of any of kinds of radial symmetry that are normal in cnidaria group that includes jellyfish sea anemones and hydras australian fossils were originally described as a type of jellyfish but this is inconsistent with bilateral symmetry in fossils white sea fossils and surrounding sediments also show that kimberella lived on surface of sea floor kimberella had a dorsal integument that has been described as a non mineralized shell in larger specimens this reached up to 15 cm in length 5 to 7 cm in width and was 3 to 4 cm high smallest specimens are only about 2 3 mm long shell was stiff but flexible and appears to have been non mineralized becoming tougher as it grew larger and presumably thicker in more mature specimens deformation observed in elongated and folded specimens illustrates that shell was highly malleable perhaps rather than a single integument it consisted of an aggregation of mineralized sclerites at its highest point was a hood like structure forming what is thought to be front in some specimens inner surface of shell bears stripes spanning width of creature these may represent attachment sites of muscles similar stripes around edge of shell may have been connected to muscles involved in retracting muscular foot into shell long axis of organism is marked by a raised ridge middle axis is slightly humped kimberella s body had no visible segmentation but had a series of repeated modules each module included a well developed band of dorso ventral muscles running from top to single broad muscular foot and smaller transverse ventral muscles from side to side on underside of body combination of bands of dorso ventral and transverse ventral muscles enabled kimberella to move by making foot ripple body also had a frilled fringe that may have been part of animal s respiratory system performing a function similar to that of gills fact that fringe extended well beyond shell may indicate that kimberella s gills were inefficient and needed a large area or that there were no effective predators on kimberella and shell s main function was to provide a platform for muscles ecology kimberella dwelt in shallow waters up to tens of meters in depth sharing calm well oxygenated sea floor with photosynthetic organisms and microbial mats assemblages bearing kimberella often also bear fossils of dickinsonia tribrachidium and suggesting that it lived alongside these organisms kimberella probably grazed on microbial mats but a selective predatory habit cannot be ruled out fedonkin reckons that as it ate it moved backwards trail thus created was destroyed by subsequent grazing activity conversely gehling et al claim that it moved forwards fans of grooves are often found radiating from head end of organism these indicate that organism stayed in one place and raked surface of microbial mat towards it by extension of its head which bore two teeth gehling et al reconstruct kimberella as having a long neck that operated like arm of a digger rotating about an axis perpendicular to sea floor in order to produce sweep of fan and rotating towards and away from animal to scrape food from substrate to mouth lack of evidence of asexual reproduction suggests that organisms reproduced sexually budding or fission has never been observed waters in which kimberella dwelt were occasionally disturbed by sandy currents caused when sediments were whipped up by storms or meltwater discharge and washed over creatures in response to this stress organisms appear to have retracted their soft parts into their shells apparently they could not move fast enough to outrun currents some organisms survived current and attempted to burrow out of sand that had been deposited above them some unsuccessful attempts can be seen where juveniles were fossilised at end of a burrow a few centimetres long preservation kimberella fossils are generally preserved on top of clay rich beds and beneath sandy beds all fossils are preserved as depressions in bases of beds implying that organism although not mineralised was firm enough to resist being crushed as sediment accumulated above it as soft parts of organism decayed soft muds underneath would be squeezed up into shell preserving shape of organism preservation of most specimens was made possible by fast sedimentation that quickly cut organism off from seawater it may also have been enhanced by decay products of rotting organism which could have helped overlying sediment to and harden it has been suggested that a mucus trail produced by organism may have assisted its preservation but experiments suggest that mucus disintegrates too easily to play a role in binding sediment together classification thumb 175px left kimberichnus grazing traces of kimberella all kimberella fossils found so far are assigned to one species k quadrata first specimens were discovered in australia in 1959 they were originally classified as jellyfish by martin glaessner and mary wade in 1966 and then as box jellyfish by wade in 1972 a view that remained popular until fossils of white sea region were discovered these prompted a reinterpretation research on these specimens by mikhail a fedonkin initially with benjamin m waggoner in 1997 led to kimberella being recognised as oldest well documented triploblastic bilaterian organism not a jellyfish at all so far kimberella fossils show no sign of a radula toothed chitinous tongue that is diagnostic feature of modern molluscs excluding bivalves since radulae are very rarely preserved in fossil molluscs its absence does not necessarily mean that k quadrata did not have one rocks in immediate vicinity of kimberella fossils bear scratch marks that have been compared to those made by radulae of molluscs as they graze on microbial mats these traces named and kimberichnus have been interpreted as circumstantial evidence for presence of a radula in conjunction with shell this has been taken to indicate kimberella was a mollusc or very closely related to molluscs in 2001 and 2007 fedonkin suggested that feeding mechanism might be a retractable proboscis with hook like organs at its end kimberella s feeding apparatus appears to differ significantly from typical mollusc radula and this demonstrates that kimberella is at best a stem group mollusc notably scratch marks indicate that teeth were dragged towards organism not pushed away as in molluscs and that maximum impact on sediment was when mouthpart was furthest from organism direction of grazing is also backwards as opposed to forwards as in molluscs furthermore constant width of grooves implies a trait that is very derived in molluscs it has been argued that shape of feeding traces is incompatible with a radula and that despite molluscan body form lack of a radula places kimberella well outside molluscan crown group butterfield points out that plenty of other groups of organisms bear structures capable of making similar marks taken together sceptics doubt that available evidence is enough to reliably identify kimberella as a mollusc or near mollusc and suggest that it is presumptuous to call it anything more than a possible mollusc or even just a probable bilaterian theoretical importance cambrian explosion is an apparently rapid increase in variety of basic body structures of animals in early cambrian period starting after and finishing before a few of early cambrian fossils were already known in mid 19th century and charles darwin saw apparently sudden appearance and diversification of animals as one of main objections that could be made against his theory of evolution by natural selection majority of animals more complex than jellyfish and other cnidarians are split into two groups protostomes and deuterostomes mollusc like features of kimberella strongly suggest that it was a member of protostomes if so this means that protostome and deuterostome lineages must have split some time before kimberella appeared at least and hence well before start of cambrian even if it is not a protostome it is widely accepted as a member of more inclusive bilaterian clade since fossils of rather modern looking cnidarians have been found in lagerstatte cnidarian and bilaterian lineages would have diverged well over see also list
