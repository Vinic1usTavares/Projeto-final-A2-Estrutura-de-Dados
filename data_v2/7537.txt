it i liked idea i thought it was spectacular so we went i gave her song and she liked it we recorded it in one day she seemed like a fine lady to me very humble with a great voice according to beyonce s publicity material she grew up in a texas area where spanish was a popular language and heard it all time she studied language as a child but forgot it as she grew up and rose to fame beyonce was planning to take spanish lessons because she had learned language again and then song by imitating sounds she stated i had best coach i did it phonetically every sentence i recorded maybe four times a making of video was created while beyonce was recording song with fernandez while creating song beyonce had producer rudy perez coach her in her spanish as she did not want to misrepresent language

beyonce as well as rudy perez labelled as inappropriate for those under age of 14 song features negative stereotyping of romani or gypsy people entire song is sung in spanish english translation of title is gypsy love song contains hints of flamenco pop and strong lyrics dominate entire track after opening with traditional flamenco sounds and generic gypsy kings style guitarra riffs amor gitano adds hints of pop music as song progresses it transcends into a ballad demonstrating romance excitement and extreme emotions amor gitano is completely dominated by flamenco guitars which is interlaced with alternating vocals with what has been described as a thrilling blend of stars by james p steyer of common sense media both beyonce and fernandez exchange heated declaration of love and passion
