well as a turret mini game as of july 2010 warhawk game space has been removed from playstation home due to lack of players actually using space game modes warhawk supports six separate game modes compatible with all variations of all of maps deathmatch every man for himself game ends when a player reaches score limit or when time expires team deathmatch same rules as a deathmatch except player is automatically assigned to either chernovan red or eucadian blue teams game ends when combined score limit is met or when time expires dogfight a variation on deathmatch team deathmatch where you play only in warhawk nemesis planes hero a version of team deathmatch where a hero is randomly selected on both sides for one minute or until hero dies hero gets a health boost damage boost and every weapon in game which hero can keep if he survives one minute key difference between hero and tdm is that in tdm all enemy kills are counted to team total whereas in hero only when killing hero or when hero kills an enemy are they counted towards total capture flag this mode of game play is by far most popular among warhawk players in this mode each team has a flag at their base which they must defend while attempting to capture second flag in their opponent s base you can only capture flag if your flag remains at base collection this mode features four cores scattered along map object is to collect as many cores as possible once a core has been collected a new one will respawn in same spot as where player got it if a player dies all cores are lost and an enemy or nearby team mate can collect them zones object of this mode is to capture various control points on map each control point has three levels for each team and a neutral level a player can do this in other game modes except deathmatch to earn points for yourself but in zones their team gains points for number of zones player has and how many levels each one has player will only be able to capture levels if area around it is clear or captured by their team game ends when time runs out score limit is reached or if player is able to capture all control points http www com warhawk php development warhawk was first
