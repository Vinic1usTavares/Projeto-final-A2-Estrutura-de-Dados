was given credit for seven poitier s removal from series was rumored to be due to budget issues thomas who said he conceive d show as a one year mystery decided that he needed to introduce and eliminate several characters to be able to create an equally fascinating mystery for series second season thomas felt that he could not bring back kanes and echolls and have them all involved in a new mystery he needed new blood second season saw introduction of tessa thompson as jackie cook a romantic interest of wallace and daughter of a famous baseball player previous recurring characters dick

election production conception rob thomas originally wrote veronica mars as a young adult novel for publishing company simon schuster prior to his first television job on dawson s creek thomas sold two novel ideas one of these was provisionally titled untitled rob thomas teen detective novel which formed basis for series novel had many elements similar to veronica mars though protagonist was male thomas s father was a vice principal at westlake high school near austin texas and main character attended a thinly disguised version of school as thomas had begun writing for film and television he did not resume his teen detective idea for several years writing a novel could take months for thomas whereas a television script only took several weeks knowing that television scripts paid more thomas wrote television version of teen detective project as a spec script before it became a novel since no studio or network had asked him to write it and he would not get paid unless it sold thomas said that it was never a very pressing project for me tinkering with it from time to time thomas wrote project notes a year before he actually started writing television script most of his original ideas made it into script but some changed drastically thomas wanted to use flashbacks and he had to shorten timeline so that murder could happen in a recent time thomas changed gender of protagonist because he thought a noir piece told from a female point of view would be more interesting and unique casting right thumb teddy dunn who portrayed duncan kane originally auditioned for role of logan echolls kristen bell was chosen to play veronica mars from more than 500 women who auditioned for role bell felt that it was just luck that rob thomas saw that i have some sass to me and that s exactly what he wanted bell thought that it was her cheerleader looks and an outsider s attitude that set her apart from other women who auditioned jason dohring who played logan originally auditioned for role of duncan teddy dunn originally auditioned for logan but ended up portraying duncan dohring felt that his audition for duncan was a little dark and he was told by producers that it was not really right producers asked dohring to read for role of logan dohring acted one scene from pilot in which he shattered headlights of a car with a crowbar during final auditions dohring read two times with bell and met with studio and network when reading with bell dohring acted whole scene as if he had raped her and tried to give character an evil and fun feel at time of dohring s audition for logan character was only going to be a guest star in pilot percy daggs iii auditioned for role of wallace fennel two times and took three tests with studio and network executives during his first audition daggs read four scenes from pilot just before his studio test daggs read with bell and had a great conversation he said that she made me feel comfortable about auditioning and was a big reason why he became more comfortable playing wallace as season went on thomas described amanda seyfried who portrayed murdered lilly kane as biggest surprise of year when casting a series regular he was able to see all best actors in town mainly because they all wanted to be a series regular when casting lilly kane who would only appear from time to time as dead girl thomas did not receive same level of actors thomas said that he had never had a more cut and dried audition than he did with seyfried he said that she was about 100 times better than anyone else that we saw she was just spectacular he continued by saying that she ended up being so good in series that he used her three or four more times than he initially planned writing and format to service a 22 episode mystery you have to have a large playing field to service a 9 episode mystery we can keep that tighter more focused instead of having 12 people who can be in running for villain there might be five in one of those mysteries i think it will be much cleaner i think it will also give a new audience more jumping in points series creator rob thomas on change of format for third season episodes have a distinct structure veronica investigates a different case of week while trying to solve a larger mystery that spans several episodes or a whole season first two seasons of veronica mars have a season long mystery arc which is introduced in first episode of season and solved in finale third season takes on a different format focusing on two smaller mystery arcs that last course of nine and six episodes respectively final five episodes of season feature stand alone mysteries during first season thomas was unsure if success of series was attributed to case of week each episode or overarching story he realized that fans were cool with case of week but came back for ongoing mystery thomas felt that bell had been overworked in first season and mystery involving logan and weevil in second season was an attempt to give her some time off he said that mystery arcs of second season had way too many suspects way too many red herrings and that third season needed a change third season was initially planned to include three separate mysteries that would be introduced and resolved in a series of non overlapping story arcs thomas realized by talking to cw entertainment president dawn ostroff that viewers got too confused by his original format and new format would allow new viewers to start watching at any point in season inspired by improvised thriller bubble thomas started laying subtle motives for second mystery during first one so that fans would have a theory on whodunit when it occurred first mystery took place over first nine episodes originally second mystery was to be seven episodes long and third mystery was to occur over last six episodes of season this was changed when cw ordered a 20 episode season instead of usual 22 episodes second mystery arc was shortened from seven episodes to six and third mystery was first changed from a six episode arc to a five episode arc after an eight week hiatus for series was announced final mystery was changed to five stand alone episodes designed to be friendlier to new viewers final mystery was originally going to be unlike any of others we ve done before previously nice characters like wallace and mac had always been absent from big mystery because no one was going to believe them as a suspect for third mystery thomas had wanted to present a situation where wallace and mac could be fully involved key players with really interesting stuff to do filming alt thumb oceanside california worked as a stand in for neptune while filming series original pilot was darker in tone than one aired thomas intended to take script to fx hbo or showtime but gave upn credit as they only wanted it a bit lighter to match their standards and practices a lengthy debate considered whether veronica could be a rape victim upn eventually consented in aired pilot lilly was found by pool in same spot where she was murdered however thomas stated that lilly s body was originally going to be found in ocean and he had a plan for events that led there thomas pitched idea to upn but network felt that it was too dark and creepy for jake to dispose of his daughter s body to protect his son and idea was changed many of series scenes were filmed at stu segall productions in san diego california producer paul kurta said that most of neptune scenes were filmed in oceanside california kurta liked that it was a seaside town that still feels like middle class people live there most of seaside towns feel resort driven it was estimated that series spent 44 million a year shooting each season in san diego comprising more than half of revenue generated by film production there in 2006 neptune high setting was also in oceanside school oceanside high school was paid 7 750 by stu segall productions for use of campus and extras series third season setting of hearst college was mostly filmed on campuses of san diego state university university of san diego and university of california san diego filming locations were chosen by director and by production designer alfred sole sole reportedly really liked look and feel of school and san diego state university invited series with open arms taping at university led to financial and employment benefits for university and its students alumni worked as crew members while students worked as actors half of third season extras were students from university s film department music we used to be friends by dandy warhols was used as series theme song composer josh kramon was originally going to produce a noir version of a 1980s song for theme however rob thomas was pretty much set on finding a song and we used to be friends was chosen right from beginning tv critic samantha holloway considered this theme to be one of five most recognizable sing along able memorable and best theme songs in third season theme song was remixed in a softer piano style with dark and vibrant electronic beats to reflect more noir influenced opening credits kramon wrote original background music to convey film noir themes for pilot thomas wanted a really atmospheric kind of modern noir type of vibe and kramon used sounds similar to that of air and zero 7 kramon used traditional sounds for series but also processed and filtered them among instruments used were piano vibraphone and guitar when using an acoustic piano kramon would use compression so that it did not sound like a traditional piano live bass and percussion was also used as kramon did not like to program them main instrument used was guitar but kramon felt that piano was by far most important instrument for working on tv shows especially when you re doing everything yourself a week before choosing sounds for episodes crew had a spotting session where they would discuss with thomas and producers which type of music was going to be featured kramon did not decide songs to be featured but composed and created whole score since there was little orchestral music and kramon could play guitar piano bass and drums he played all parts without another musician veronica mars original television soundtrack a song compilation from series first and second seasons was released by nettwerk records on september 27 2005 thomas revealed that primary goal for soundtrack was to get more publicity which will in turn hopefully get more viewers for show cancellation film and revival cancellation upright thumb enrico colantoni who played veronica s father keith mars expressed interest in film adaption of series in january 2007 dawn ostroff announced that while she was pleased with gradual ratings improvement of veronica mars series would be put on hiatus after february sweeps to air a new reality series pussycat dolls present when hiatus ended series returned for last five episodes of season at 2007 cw upfront ostroff announced that veronica mars was not part of new primetime lineup and was not coming back thomas created a trailer that took place four years after third season finale with working title veronica in fbi and released it on third season dvd when asked if fbi concept could happen ostroff said that series was probably completely gone in any form ostroff also said that kristen bell and rob thomas might collaborate on another project for cw network in june 2007 tv guide writer michael ausiello confirmed that cancellation of veronica mars was official potential film progress thomas stated that he was interested in writing a feature film based on series in interest of providing closure to story lines and character arcs in september 2008 michael ausiello writing for entertainment weekly reported that thomas had met with bell to discuss plot which would likely involve veronica solving crime in college rather than as an fbi agent thomas felt that fbi scenario was more of a what if aimed at getting a fourth season and that he would want to bring back our key players and it would be tough to believe that fbi stationed veronica in neptune ausiello later reported that enrico colantoni would be involved in project colantoni said that he was fully aware of talks taking place adding cult shows have translated well into film arena nothing s official but they re talking about it in addition to feature film possibility thomas had a meeting with dc comics to talk about a veronica mars comic book series in september 2008 thomas told entertainment weekly that i thought i had idea broken but i ve hit a wall in final act that i haven t quite figured out thomas explained that he had been very busy writing for cupid and party down both of which he created in january 2009 tv guide reported that film was thomas first priority after cupid thomas noted that as well as writing script someone would need to pay for film but indicated that producer joel silver was ready to green light film in june 2009 bell said i don t think it will ever happen and here s why series creator rob thomas and i had a powwow and we were both 100 percent on board we took our proposal to warner bros and joel silver told us that there is no enthusiasm there to make a veronica mars movie and that is unfortunately a roadblock we cannot compete with at 2010 tca winter press tour rob thomas stated that movie wouldn t be happening i would write it if anyone would finance it if anyone s interested in making that movie i am available kristen s bell available i would love to do it i think closest we came was joel silver pushing it at warner bros and they didn t bite it has sort of gone away in april 2010 thomas insisted it s not dead i continue to want to do it we re still looking into it in june 2010 silver was less optimistic about film happening we analyzed all these areas about it i talked to home video people because a movie like that would be driven by video season dvds didn t do that well so they didn t feel there was a need or an audience kickstarter project on march 13 2013 rob thomas and kristen bell launched a kickstarter fundraiser in an attempt to get film made with help of fans to reach goal of 2 million campaign offered various incentives to those who donated more than 10 thomas and bell stated that they approached warner bros with idea and

squad described third season as disappointing mainly because episodes offered nothing new most fans of veronica mars felt that season three was clearly its weakest eric goldman of ign said that main issue was shift in overall tone with a lighter feeling than previous seasons he felt that logan had been most affected by tone change robbed of his darker aspects and changed into an increasingly extraneous character goldman felt that despite concerns over final five episodes series ended with three very strong episodes with lots of strong dialogue and veronica proving again just how tough she can be and what a strong character she is goldman concluded that although third season was very choppy it still had plenty of witty dialogue and a continually engaging performance by kristen bell as title character pittsburgh post gazette opined that veronica mars had taken a dive creatively from version of its theme song to stalled storylines reviewer felt that arcing mysteries had grown less convincing and compelling as time went on and were too drawn out fox news channel s bridget byrne pointed out that veronica had gone from punky to dare we say preppy in third season byrne further
