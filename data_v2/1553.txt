is what really interests me yes cinema and people in my life and my family are most important but ultimately as you get older there s got to be more silence is just something that i m drawn to in that way it s been an obsession it has to be done it s a strong wonderful true story a thriller in a way but it deals with those questions in 2009 with production beginning to coalesce scorsese and a production crew went to nagasaki japan visiting original sites that served as setting for endo s novel additional location scouting was conducted in canada however silence entered a state of development hell soon afterwards and scorsese decided to work on shutter island and hugo instead in december 2011 scorsese stated that silence would be his next film by march although he originally

taipei and in and around taipei and taiwan we found great great locations prices were very cheap and we were able to make it for a price winkler disclosed that tight budget forced many of cast and crew including himself to work for minimum pay and all actors liam neeson adam driver everybody worked for scale marty worked for scale i worked for under scale we gave back money james martin a jesuit priest and published catholic scholar as well as catholic scholar liam worked closely with filmmakers to ensure an accurate portrayal of jesuits legal claims scorsese s complex filmmaking commitments to multiple film projects resulted in an early legal challenge before filming of silence could be initiated in august 2012 cecchi gori pictures sued scorsese over an alleged breach of contract agreements related to silence according to company in 1990 scorsese signed a written agreement to direct silence scorsese was supposed to shoot film following 1997 s kundun and cecchi gori pictures had apparently invested more than 750 000 for this purpose however scorsese chose to make bringing out dead gangs of new york and aviator first in 2004 scorsese purportedly signed deals to postpone film further in order to direct departed and shutter island in 2011 scorsese ostensibly agreed to one more deal delaying silence to direct hugo cecchi gori pictures asserted that scorsese agreed to pay substantial compensation and other valuable benefits in order to first direct departed shutter island and hugo company said fees were 1 million to 1 5 million per film plus up to 20 percent of scorsese s backend compensation complaint was founded on company s allegation that scorsese failed to pay fees agreed upon for hugo and that he breached contract s terms by filming wolf of

parties last year he also denounced lawsuit as a media stunt and a meritless action lawsuit was settled on january 17 2014 terms of settlement are sealed writing this film marks second adaptation of

screenplay as finally filmed was assessed in critical review as an accurate depiction of novel as written by endo religious historian haruko ward has indicated that inclusion of small crucifix in deceased priest s hand at end of film was an auteur decision made by scorsese not included in endo s original book casting beginning in 2009 and into 2010 daniel day lewis benicio del toro and gael

incident occurred in one of backlots of production when a ceiling collapsed which resulted in death of one contracted employee and injury of two others scorsese and cinematographer rodrigo prieto drew inspiration from painters from baroque period when determining color palettes of film using blue and cyan tones at beginning and later a golden yellow hue which in prieto s opinion gave film a sense of progression in color while prieto shot landscapes and actors using film stock he resorted to digital when it came to night scenes prieto found some difficulties when shooting film with weather constantly changing he would have inconsistencies in terms of lighting that he solved by filming some sequences at night time that would be lit for either dusk or sunset to simulate moonlight for many of night scenes prieto used a rig of blue green lights called ufo and hung them on a crane music music for film was composed by kim allen kluge former music director at quad city symphony orchestra and kathryn kluge much of soundtrack includes ambient nocturnal and ocean sounds repeated over several of tracks a 51 minute soundtrack of 25 tracks was released on february 17 2017 by recording

theaters in its four day mlk opening weekend it ended up debuting to 1 9 million a four day total of 2 3 million finishing 15th at box office deadline hollywood attributed film s low opening to its 161 minute runtime and lack of major award nominations to create buzz similarly hollywood reporter noted that unlike some of other films released silence was playing in fewer cinemas and had been

based on 270 reviews and an average rating of 7 49 10 site s critical consensus reads silence ends martin scorsese s decades long creative quest with a thoughtful emotionally resonant look at

favorable reviews audiences polled by cinemascore gave film an average grade of a on an a to f scale several critics have referred to film as being among finest films of scorsese s career matt zoller seitz of rogerebert com gave film four out of four stars stating that silence is a monumental work and a punishing one it puts you through hell with no promise of enlightenment only a set of questions and propositions sensations and experiences this is not sort of film you like or don t like it s a film that you experience and then live with richard roeper awarded film four out of four stars saying when ferreira finally appears and we learn truth about where he s been all this time it further serves scorsese s central theme about conflict between adhering to one s sacred vows and traditional beliefs and doing right thing prudent thing moral thing on a very pragmatic level thumb dante ferretti received praise from reviewer justin chang for his set designs used in film several reviewers such as justin chang and mark kermode emphasized scorsese s collaboration with his production crew and with his actors as contributing to film s quality writing for los angeles times justin chang called film an anguished masterwork for scorsese stating working with such sterling past collaborators as editor thelma schoonmaker production designer dante ferretti and cinematographer rodrigo prieto scorsese has done more than resurrect a vision of feudal japan silence feels less like a feat of adaptation than an act of artistic submission mark kermode writing for guardian indicated exemplary performances by range of japanese supporting actors in cast stating real stars however are japanese cast from yosuke kubozuka s enigmatic wretch kichijiro to yoshi oida s devout elder ichizo to whose village these priests bring both salvation and suffering as a smiling silver tongued interpreter tadanobu asano is a superb foil to inquisitor inoue played with fly menace by a wheedling issey ogata apart from narrative qualities of film filmmaking was also praised for depth and thoroughness of its thematic content peter travers of rolling stone who assigned it 3 1 2 stars out of four wrote that silence offers frustratingly few answers but all right questions and argued that it is among director s most spiritually moving films to date in slant jesse cataldo argued tapping into vast pool of vagueness and uncertainty that exists beneath veneer of a rigid righteous belief scorsese crafts a versatile multifaceted work that encourages serious reflection and contemplation alissa wilkinson of vox wrote that silence is beautiful unsettling and one of finest religious movies ever made john ehrett of federalist praised film highly saying silence is a must see masterpiece about paradoxes of faith ehrett further added complex yet reverent silence explores meanings and dilemmas of christian faith and decisively sets a new benchmark for religious films some reviewers cited legacy aspects of film for scorsese and compared scorsese to such established directors as ingmar bergman ty burr of boston globe said movie s being promoted as third in director s unofficial trilogy of faith after last temptation of christ 1988 and kundun 1997 and it feels like a self conscious masterpiece a summing up from a filmmaker who at 74 may be thinking of his legacy joshua rothkopf of time out london gave film five stars out of five saying scorsese has hit rare heights of filmmakers like ingmar bergman and carl theodor dreyer artists who find in religion a battleground that leaves even strongest in tatters compromised and broken emma green of atlantic gave film high praise stating this is what makes scorsese s film so radical and so unlike many movies about religion it s actually art robbie collin of telegraph gave film five stars out of five stating scorsese s brutal spiritual epic will scald and succor your soul collin further added it s kind of work a great filmmaker can only pull off with a lifetime s accrued expertise behind him brian truitt of usa today gave film three and a half stars stating with religious historical drama silence martin scorsese proves he s as masterful a filmmaker with men of god as he is with gangsters truitt also argued that film marks one of deeper and most thoughtful projects in scorsese s career film also garnered criticism writing for variety peter debruge found major flaws with film writing though undeniably gorgeous it is punishingly long frequently boring and woefully unengaging at some of its most critical moments it is too subdued for scorsese philes too violent for most devout and too abstruse for great many moviegoers who such an expensive undertaking hopes to attract john patterson of guardian stated in his review i fear that silence expired in womb during that long gestation period it is beautiful to look at but feels inert humourless and overly devout to say nothing of over long masahiro shinoda s 1971 adaptation got endo s 1966 novel on to film using 30 fewer minutes than scorsese perhaps that leap toward devout is needed to savour it fully and i found i couldn t make it top ten

top 10 listed alphabetically not ranked stephen whitty star ledger industry reception silence received an academy award nomination for best cinematography at 89th academy awards in addition to other competitive awards for which film received accolades american film institute selected silence as one of its ten movies of year analysis scorsese has stated in interviews that among most difficult aspects of film to represent were spiritual themes presented in endo s original book used for film first version of script he attempted to write with his co writer jay cocks only managed to get midway through material before being set aside as insufficiently sensitive to spiritual aspects of book it took scorsese many years to envision a way to approach an accurate and informed filming of scenes involving spiritual transitions among actors in film caesar a of university of notre dame published a theological assessment of spiritual themes in film concentrating on act of priestly renunciation depicted towards end stating this climactic scene of rodrigues trampling fumi e makes clear that silence is as much about object of christian faith as it is experience of that faith as ambient and live sound are washed out entirely rodrigues hears voice of christ telling him to trample that it was to be trampled upon that christ came into world object of faith becomes a christ who is a hero of pity who takes up weakness and suffering of humankind as his cross rather than a hero of triumphant resolve jesus of silence is one of utter kenosis self emptying and one who in mercy of that kenosis radically sympathizes with weakness and frailty of human beings even ones like judas and kichijiro aaron baker in his book a companion to martin scorsese discussed aspects of theological themes in film stating that according to an analysis of film by japanese american theologian it pivots on idea that silence of god is in fact message of god being not silence of nihil or nothingness but rather accompaniment for forsaken and suffering and concomitant silence of christians quietly hoping for salvation implicit here is what matsuoka terms an element of uncertainty a possibility that nihil of emptiness meaninglessness and hopelessness will eventually prevail uncertainty about fate of soul or self for secularists lies at heart of human experience injecting many a mind with existential fear trembling and sickness unto death of which soren kierkegaard vividly wrote see also silence 1971 film a japanese film adaptation of shusaku endo s novel directed by masahiro shinoda references
