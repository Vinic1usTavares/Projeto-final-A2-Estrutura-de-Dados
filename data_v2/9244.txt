hostage and st john s version of character was really todd s identical twin brother victor lord jr conditioned to assume todd s place todd was initially a short term villain but his popularity with audience and critics inspired writers to forgo killing him or permanently sending him to prison like most soap operas had done with rapists in past while keeping aspects of his personality dark or violent they had todd exhibit a conscience and compassion they took steps to redeem him and made him an integral part of oltl canvas despite howarth s objections to a redemption storyline with use of literary techniques for redemptive arc writers borrowed from nineteenth century melodrama and gothic traditions and literature such as frankenstein todd became product of an affair between his father victor lord and his mother irene manning which provided him a fortune and ties to other major characters including his sisters tina and victoria lord an important aspect of character became his appearance most notably scar on his right cheek which emerged as synonymous with him and served to remind him of his past misdeeds against marty music and use of humor were also key to todd s development although he formed many relationships including with his wives blair cramer and tea delgado and fathered children a defining characteristic of his personality was his resistance to close relationships and sexual intimacy drive to redeem todd eventually drew howarth who always saw todd as a villain to leave show for a year he was uncomfortable with redemption storyline and with many fans positive reactions to todd recasting todd years later with st john was generally considered successful by viewers and critics st john instead of imitating howarth s portrayal brought his own spin

to be a short lived role but howarth s portrayal of character inspired notable fan reaction which prompted creators to layer todd s personality and showcase him regularly within series hayward p 175 michael malone todd s creator said fleshing out character reminded him of what he loved about soap operas adding story telling is a genuine collaboration not just among writers but by actors malone felt he could not take full credit for development of todd from marty saybrooke s gang rapist to what he later became and also noted howarth s impact in creation of todd manning no one played a larger role than remarkably talented josh griffith first associate head writer then co head writer during my stay at one life josh loved lived and breathed todd and fought passionately for his position on show second todd never would have evolved from first frat boy to major cast member he became without powerful talent of roger howarth because of roger s ability to convey complexity of todd hurt as well as anger insecurity as well as bluster brains yearning sexiness tenderness nastiness we were able to explore both deeply dark side of this character effort to destroy marty to cover rape attempted revenge on his lawyer nora attack on luna and at same time slowly uncover his growing struggle usually a failed struggle towards some kind of redemption romantic leads have often begun their careers playing villains valentino clark gable humphrey bogart among them these characters appeal because they make women feel both thrill of bad and lure of hidden good they can lead man to change through love i ll save him fans loved todd from beginning because he always had that appeal malone originally scripted todd as a serial rapist as part of 1993 rape storyline it was disclosed that todd raped a woman named carol swift a year or two before raping marty and that there were hints he raped other young women before carol howarth considered todd s rationale for raping marty to be complex todd was in love with marty he said when marty rejects todd s romantic advances after their one night stand it is because he was cold to her that same night after they had sex marty s rejection upsets todd and it when he fails an exam after she tutors him he blames her for failure and begins attributing her as reason for his problems howarth called todd privileged and very rich because todd was used to getting what he wanted he did not know how to cope with marty rejecting him although todd is product of an affair between victor lord and irene manning malone gave him last name manning without knowing name of victor s mistress an oversight that allowed writers to later reveal him as tina and victoria lord s brother he is at first presented as 18 years old but over years his age has been changed based upon occasional rapid aging of his children malone stated that making todd heir to lord fortune gave writers huge story that helped howarth s character evolve from a short term role to a major cast member which malone attributed to howarth s powerful talent peter manning who todd thought was his father had died todd receives letters written by his adoptive mother disclosing that he is lord heir and worth almost 30 million developing todd not only as victoria s unwanted sibling whom she was horrified to discover was her blood but as her professional rival who used a splashy tabloid newspaper to wipe out her venerable newspaper banner appealed to malone executive producer susan bedsow horgan when speaking of todd s psychological motivations reported that peter manning degraded him verbally and abused his adoptive mother whom todd loved but who abandoned and disappointed him leaving todd with wounds that influenced his later behavior author gerry waggett stated that peter manning had physically abused todd his entire life waggett p 47 signature scar hair and facial cues thumb 300px a young howarth with todd s vintage long haired look left a makeup artist applying todd s scar to howarth right scar stretches in a curve across character s right cheek and appears a thin medium red in its significantly healed version in late 1993 in order to make todd look more menacing he was given a scar to his right cheek by marty s friend luna moody when she hit him in his face with a crowbar while preventing his attempt to rape marty for a second time camera would often close in on and emphasize todd s scar which later became synonymous with character to casting director howard meltzer todd wears scar like a badge it s a warning to others don t mess with me meltzer felt howarth underplayed todd todd did not have to rant to incite fear meltzer added he gets a lot more from raising of an eyebrow than raising volume of his voice most of todd s performance is reacting to environment around him and thanks to howarth s expressiveness viewers can see wheels turning scar also served to remind todd of his past villainy against marty it was applied by glue with a little makeup to make it look more authentic and usually took ten minutes to apply todd s long hair was also integral to character it was described by soap opera magazine as enigmatic with an air of innate authority hair was said to demonstrate todd s lack of pretense and to convey an i don t care attitude todd s overhanging brow seemed threatening but instead concealed intense vulnerable eyes underneath features that contrasted well with character s pouty sensual mouth features which conferred a charming boyish quality could sometimes convey that todd was less dangerous than he actually was photographer robert milazzo believed howarth s hair softened todd s character you don t expect that intensity because of it he said and felt that it made todd more intriguing milazzo also stated that combination of todd s soft hair and intensity made todd a very complex character to look at an interviewer concluded that howarth was physically attractive and that this may have contributed to character s magnetism howarth replied i know what convention of a good looking person is and i know that for some reason skinny white guys are big now i guess you could blame it on that roger howarth other side of evil april 5 1994 soap opera update in november 2008 during st john s portrayal of character todd is given a new scar by john mcbain during a physical altercation in which john beats todd with a gun scar symbolized todd s second rape of marty and was considered a poetic nod to todd s history scar was significantly smaller than original but placed in same spot it was gone by january 2009 st john stated i know it s too bad i honestly have no idea why they wouldn t keep that reminder on todd s face it might be an economical thing you know it costs to apply that kind of makeup each day most important aspect of todd s appearance for st john was his character s hair his preference was that todd s hair was a little shorter he told soap opera weekly sow that he thought that todd s hair was too shaggy which was not his personal style and that he hoped writers and producers would let him trim off a bit when he first got role st john s hair resembled howarth s shorter chin length haircut which was initially worn from 2000 to 2003 and st john was told by writers and producers not to change his hair until further notice st john made creative choice to let himself go because todd s not really right in old noggin and gained weight for role todd s theme and related music thumb right composer david nichtern who wrote much of one life to live s music for todd one life to live s producers stated that most of show s music was custom written suitable for situation and what characters in scene might actually play for todd his volatile nature was represented with powerfully dark theme music which producers and fans called todd theme music consisted of ominous low chords and signaled that todd was about to commit a vicious dangerous or threatening act composer david nichtern who created todd s theme music said he loved character and enjoyed implementing different versions of todd theme while describing music that marked todd s prominent 1996 return from dead storyline which documented his return to town after being presumed dead nichtern addressed broader aspect of his composition for character all of todd s music has had a certain vibe to it especially since character is so well drawn he stated it also has seemed particularly well suited to my guitar style so i ve enjoyed becoming todd musically key is always to represent his dark side but with possibility of redemption and power behind whole thing nichtern added that s what makes him such an interesting character todd s cues are always custom made so to speak so there is energy and attention going toward getting exact flavor of what current story line is saying about his journey three primary musical themes were played throughout todd s evolution original todd theme from 1993 to 1996 encompassed todd s rape of marty and his early misdeeds second theme was heard throughout 1998 and 2000 and third theme was first heard in 2001 todd and marty rape scene was aided primarily by rock songs heard at a low volume in background hard rock songs assist moments building up to rape they intensify otherwise implicitly tense aggressive atmosphere and set a chilling tone for viewers when todd is certain that he will rape marty right before going upstairs to kevin s room where she rests volume of a song in background head like a hole is increased which emphasizes lyrics i d rather die than give you control this use of background music allowed todd s motivation for rape to significantly register with viewers menacing chords which played as todd stalked and terrorized nora in 1993 for mishandling his trial and sending him to prison were todd s theme there have been additional musical themes for todd for example during his romance with rebecca in 1994 an all encompassing romantic theme with tragic nuances which was at times intermixed with his ominous music were heard his rescue of marty and two children from a car crash and todd and tea romance also have their own musical themes for mid 1994 plot point where todd rescues marty and children music was changed to reflect his decision to be a better person it becomes his dominant theme and is assisted by a tuneful forward moving melody this music is primarily a part of todd s 1994 redemption storyline and storyline when he is lord heir in 1995 according to nichtern music for todd and tea which he composed with his friend keyboardist kevin bents was as close as we get to todd romantic music with possibility of a little sensuality and romance for todd returns from dead 1996 storyline demented sounding on edge music signifies that todd s psyche has worsened this theme accompanied todd s emotional breakdown and revenge scheme after discovering his wife blair having sex with patrick personality at time of todd s introduction to oltl he was a competitive athlete his fraternity was most important part of his life howarth stated that todd was under intense pressure from male figures in his life he felt that key to understanding todd was his concern about his status and how others perceived him he thought that todd mistreated people because it made him feel better about himself and that he did not want to appear vulnerable so his defense mechanisms spun out of control howarth during an april 1994 soap opera update interview said that only thing that he admired about todd was his clothing style his interviewer called todd s early fashion sense grunge salvation army like rags and howarth described todd s later wardrobe as all ralph lauren and d r l 80 dollar pants and a 400 and something dollar jacket st john as todd s second portrayer described character as kind of both good and bad he s got his good side with his kids and yet he is conniving and vicious and all those negative things show s writers presented todd s personality as a combination of dark humor uncouth behavior and essence of a tortured soul he often delivers one liners that range from humorous to sadistic soap opera columnist jenn bishop stated that todd s personality is violent gentle caring apathetic smart obsessive crazy irrational devilish heroic angst filled comical etc and that he loves but he feels he s unworthy of true love because of things he s done he doesn t love himself and projects a facade of a confident arrogant playboy but underneath it all he s someone who seeks an unattainable love columnist jill berry who saw todd as self centered in extreme said that although todd desperately wants to be loved he is unable to give or receive it and when he is loved he will destroy it she did acknowledge todd s capability of loving his children which he expressed by doing crazy and illegal things to prove it but felt that much of difficulty he experiences is brought on by himself and that he is incapable of learning from his mistakes even when they hurt people he loves she said todd is in need of intensive therapy which will never work because he refuses to change for example as portrayed by st john in 2006 he fights for custody of his son sam but he is motivated by anger that he has been lied to and revenge more than by a desire to recover his child for several years on series a defining characteristic of todd s personality was his resistance to close relationships and sexual intimacy which were due to his mistreatment by others especially his adoptive father who may have raped him when he was fourteen dutta p disagrees with dutta that todd was raped by peter manning waggett p 47 it was also due to his horrific past misdeeds including his rape of marty and dysfunctional aspects of his relationship with blair surviving a near death experience and being presumed dead in 1995 and upon his return in 1996 finding blair having sex with patrick made todd bitter seeing blair with another man sexually soon after his presumed death caused him to shut down emotionally writers made todd s fear of intimacy into a prominent obstacle for his relationship with his second wife tea when she at one point attempts to seduce todd by stripping down naked in front of him and pleading with him to make love to her he rejects her explaining that he no longer trusts himself to be intimate in that way he subsequently throws her out practically naked into middle of a snowstorm bishop stated though viewers were given an explanation for his repulsive actions lots and lots of childhood trauma his crime was never excused or glossed over todd began to care for people rebecca then blair and later tea something missing in his earlier sociopathic characteristics soap opera commentator barnett stated that todd s dark edges had been softened over a period of many years by blair viki and starr todd s deep love for his sister viki was partly demonstrated by him supporting her during her battle with cancer her difficulties with her daughter and his niece jessica and by defending viki to her enemies berry enjoyed vulnerability viki brought out of todd and felt that his self hatred demonstrated itself in many ways including when he refused to name his son jack after himself because his name carried too much baggage in 1998 storyline where he fakes dissociative identity disorder split personalities to avoid a prison sentence for hostage and threat charges he is given four personalities that represent his core being a childlike personality named tom italian playboy rod parental figure miss perkins and abusive pete personality responsible for his worst misdeeds revelation that he is faking personalities devastates viki who had actually suffered from disorder it also brings out remorse in todd and causes him to reflect on his mistakes storyline ends with implication that personalities may not have been as fabricated as todd believed them to be writers also made it so that his difficulties are manifested in his nightmares which give him insomnia and are designed as a look into his psyche at multiple points within series tea attempts to help todd by encouraging him to open up to her about them which he eventually does his opinions on his enemies are conveyed clearly he remains one step ahead of them and consistently out smarts police family and others he targets sometimes using weapons casting and portrayals general following howarth s 1992 casting as todd manning he occasionally vacated role his 2003 departure was his longest absence from oltl he did not return to series until 2011 todd was recast in 2003 with st john and howarth joined as world turns as paul ryan until it was cancelled in 2010 malone stated that because of todd s appeal which he credited to howarth network was therefore happy to have him return to llanview whenever roger would come back and happy to have him move into story in major ways in april 2011 after several months of speculation oltl confirmed howarth s return although it was unclear if he would portray todd manning he stated i am looking forward to returning to one life to live executive producer frank valentini said we are thrilled to have roger return to one life to live it was eventually revealed that st john s version of character was really victor lord jr todd s twin brother conditioned to believe that he was todd and assume todd s identity while real todd howarth was held hostage for eight years oltl was cancelled in early 2012 howarth brought todd to general hospital gh along with his co stars kristen alderson as starr and michael easton as john mcbain all three actors were forced to briefly leave gh when prospect park company that bought rights to oltl and aired an online version of show in 2013 sued abc for breach of contract prospect park argued that abc sabotaged its efforts by killing off two characters starr s boyfriend cole and her young daughter hope both st john and howarth appeared on online version as victor and todd but suit prevented abc from continuing to feature howarth alderson and easton as their original characters on gh abc s solution was to create new characters for actors online version of oltl was cancelled after one season howarth malone credited howarth s versatility with reason he was cast as todd during a february 1993 interview with soap opera digest sod howarth stated he was surprised he won part i really don t know how i made it he said he met a one life to live casting director two years previously while performing in a new york play but when role of todd opened up he auditioned just like everybody else he made it to callbacks and he got part howarth said i was hired to plant drugs in jason webb s jacket all i knew was that my first name was todd i don t know what happened next they called me in again and suddenly i had a last name manning then i get called to read another day howarth stated i was happy to get part of todd but it was furthest thing from fabric of my personality in an interview later that year with soap opera weekly he when reminded of what he had said and commented what a totally self involved pretentious thing to say he clarified his previous statement saying that although he seemed to be consistently cast as a bad guy and as a greek frat brother type both his upbringing and experiences in college were different than those of todd and his other roles for example howarth was not in a fraternity in college and unlike todd and his previous soap opera roles kent in loving and jory on guiding light status was unimportant to him although howarth was familiar with campus fraternity life while attending george washington university he did not base todd or his other roles on anyone he knew when asked about his roles he was unable to explain why he was consistently cast as a bad guy but said that he enjoyed it i would never want to come in now and play a nice guy for three months that would be dreadfully boring this suits me fine it s just as easy to pretend i m a bad guy as it is to pretend i m a good guy howarth said playing a rapist was like playing any other role because he knows it s all make believe he was perplexed by writers need to redeem villains todd s a pretty interesting character just way he is howarth said in late 1994 there s no need to fix it if it s not broken i don t know where whole notion of redeeming characters comes from people used to say to me i hope you get redeemed so you can stay on show well todd hasn t been redeemed and he s still on show he added i don t love character i play if i met todd on street i wouldn t say hi to him but i do love playing this character howarth said of starring on a soap opera every actor at one time passes through daytime i wouldn t have said yes to offer if i didn t want to stay a while on daytime he added i don t crave fame it s kind of goofy i didn t want to be a public figure i wanted to be an actor not a movie star but i love rock n roll there i d rather be a rock star that would be cool he said that like all soap actors he sticks with script majority of time but every now and then he goes off page commenting you get to direct yourself you come up with a little bit it s improvisational maybe you re doing it just for your castmates but audience catches on in 1997 and 1998 todd was given comedic partners similar to set up in comedy teams in which funny guy usually has a straight man who either sets up joke or simply does not understand it todd s first partner was charlie briggs portrayed by actor robert j hogan hogan was first seen as briggs in 1995 working for rival publication banner before todd steals him away to work at his newspaper hogan said briggs had been on show for 17 years but they never showed him scenes between todd and briggs typically involved todd issuing some bizarre order to briggs or todd asking briggs a way out question that was often way out of line during these scenes briggs would often respond with a stupefied look on his face though briggs appeared lost at some of todd s comments todd was sometimes unable to realize that joke was about him hogan felt briggs was more than a match for todd you look at a kid yelling at you he said and you can t take him seriously thumb howarth on set with todd s pet parrot moose bird was portrayed by two south american blue and gold macaws another of todd s comedic pairings is his friendship with a parrot he names moose todd is closer to moose than he is to most humans he tells bird his private thoughts and secrets which causes conflict and antagonism between moose and his wife at time tea florencia lozano tea s portrayer stated my character has a very adversarial relationship with bird it s sort of jealous of me i m jealous of bird we re both trying to get close to todd bird was portrayed by two south american blue and gold macaws named flash and lucky and an animal planet documentary stated that they had developed an impressive resume by time they appeared on oltl they were trained by ed richman who had worked with birds for fifteen years in tv shows such as magnum p i and jake and fatman richman stated that howarth caught on real quick regarding his interaction with flash and lucky and said that he was best actor he had worked with in industry parrots were used for different purposes for intimidating scenes where it looked like moose was going to kill somebody richman used flash and lucky was used for loving very caring physically close portrayal of moose like other actors parrots were able to connect in character with their fellow castmembers and achieve comedic timing with them voice actor ron gallop was hired to deliver moose s lines which were crafted to help demonstrate todd s train of thought signified todd and moose s close bond and consisted of funny or insulting remarks aimed at anyone causing problems for todd st john howarth s departure from series motivated oltl writers and producers to do what many considered impossible recast todd waggett p 35 during michael malone s second stint as head writer of oltl he had to decide if todd would remain malone said that he and other creators could not allow todd to permanently leave show s canvas so they chose to recast role they offered role to easton who had portrayed vampire caleb morley on soap opera port charles but he turned it down because he did not want to be affiliated with a role played by another established actor waggett p 54 malone said that st john s audition was extraordinary and that although a committee was involved in recast everyone agreed he was todd malone felt that they made a risky decision but st john made it work and that he had made character his own initially st john in his first role in daytime television was introduced as walker laurence younger brother of mitch laurence waggett p 36 author gerry waggett stated that walker was reinvented as todd with plastic surgery after show s viewers accepted st john as a part of cast soap opera press and fans speculated for several months that todd had been recast with st john website soap central com stated that despite executive producer frank valentini neither confirming nor denying it st john s character exhibited todd like behavior tv guide confirmed speculation and reported that st john when asked about it stated that would be fascinating though i don t see how it would work and added todd had a different voice and height but this is a soap world and anything can happen st john s version of todd had undergone plastic surgery after being severely beaten during a murder attempt on his life ordered by mitch laurence while recovering in hospital todd conducts research and learns mitch has a brother named walker also portrayed by st john who goes by name flynn laurence todd pays flynn for information on mitch and has extensive plastic surgery in order to physically resemble flynn and get revenge on as well as protect his family from mitch writers revealed walker s true identify slowly allowing walker to develop as a new character before hinting that he could be todd st john was unaware that malone and producers of oltl were considering him as todd but had no strategy in his performance once he won role when speaking of recast he stated it s nice because i had instant concrete relationships he liked that he could consult old scripts and his fellow castmembers to gain information about his character resources he did not have when playing walker he was able to use these resources to figure out his relationship to other characters which helped him analyze how to play a scene st john stated that as an actor he let audience interpret character and believed in exploring and portraying moment as it was written in script he said todd is already written on page so it s my job to bring him to life in that moment st john was instructed by show s directors to watch about fifteen episodes of howarth s performances of todd because they wanted him to portray todd like howarth did st john reported that he watched two episodes but never tried to mimic howarth s style because he felt that it was limiting uncreative and destructive he said i needed to get a sense of who todd was first and that has to happen organically he did not care if marlon brando portrayed role before him and said that even actors who portray hamlet do it differently adding i don t care what other guy did that s his time st john felt that it was up to him to decide how to perform todd i know that sounds very arrogant and overconfident he stated but it would be no fun to try to mimic somebody unlike how most actors are trained st john believed that it was not up to performer to interpret character but that a character existed regardless of how an actor played him which he realized was an unusual way to approach acting he also thought that playing todd was fun and never boring to watch because todd although popular with audience is an unlikable character st john told branco that when people asked him if todd was capable of harming his loved ones like his long time love blair or daughter starr st john would say that todd was capable of anything even being sexually attracted to starr or one of her friends because to state otherwise meant that he was limiting character he added todd is a marvelous character to play because he could commit genocide or find a cure for aids he s full of possibilities good and bad see as an actor that always gives you conflict to play and that subtext enriches a performance early writing and literary analysis archetypes and rape howarth said writers go with a recognizable archetype when creating soap opera characters writer jennifer hayward felt same stating that like 19th century melodrama and serials soap operas draw on powerful archetypes hayward p 175 writer dianne l brooks states that storyline conforms to many of same conventions of how rape has been presented in soap operas brooks p 115 according to hayward oltl writers had a terrific time camping up todd as embodiment of evil hayward p 175 she said that writers who created todd s first major storyline gang rape of marty saybrooke and its aftermath treated rape like most soap operas had done in past by using archetypes such as fight between good and evil and contrast between weak and strong author gerry waggett said close ups of rapists faces during assault distorted to capture marty s scared and drunken perspective rank among show s most graphic images an attempt was made to dramatize rape and present it differently than typical voyeuristic perspective and scenes were designed to disturb audience brooks p 116 waggett added marty s subsequent quest to bring her rapists to justice dominated show throughout summer of 1993 waggett p 27 up to this point soap operas used rape and its related archetypes to like their nineteenth century melodrama counterparts critique power relationships especially oppression of poor by rich and of women by men hayward believes that storyline was initially flawed because two of rapists todd and zach were demonized which oversimplified rape and failed to capture complex power relations underlying violence towards women perpetrators were simply evil or out control so they and their mindsets they represented could be rejected hayward p 174 three characters represented three archetypes of rapist evil instigator todd good resister powell and mediator between these polarized figures zach but also represented a departure from how rape was treated in soap operas brooks called rapists a complicated alternative to standard soap opera rapist because they had a different relationship with their victim than in previous rape narratives and because they were multiple todd whom brooks called evil other was leader and most villainous of group and had a previous physical relationship with marty hayward said what becomes especially clear is that for these characters act of rape is not about sex about women or even about marty it is about what takes place between men like serials throughout history soap operas use unstable identity as a literary device which is evidenced by genre s use of mistaken identities evil twins and characters that suffer from multiple personality disorder and whom come back from dead identity is used in rape storyline as well before rape todd was crude yet still human but afterwards he became a dehumanized embodiment of rage demonstrated by todd s bizarre and dangerous behavior after his conviction powell lord whose name is full of same kind of symbolism dickens used when choosing his characters names and who initially urges his friends to let marty go yet ultimately gives into peer pressure is a relative good character as compared to todd s absolute evil identity hayward pp 174 175 in hayward s opinion show also departs from rape paradigm not only by insisting on essential goodness of powell lord but even more startlingly by redeeming evil todd initially increasingly guilt ridden powell is only rapist who has a conscience he attempts to convince todd and zach to confess their crime and comes close to confessing to his lawyer hayward p 158 hayward calls powell like todd redeemed hayward p 170 but unlike todd was so guilt ridden that he attempted suicide was forgiven by marty and received a much lighter jail sentence than zach or todd hayward pp 175 176 redeeming todd initially todd as described by hayward was written as unequivocally bad sullen remorseless charmless as todd s popularity grew with audience mostly due to howarth s abilities to portray todd as more than a one dimensional rapist malone and executive producer susan bedsow horgan chose controversial option of redeeming todd rather than killing him off or permanently sending him to prison which is what soap operas had usually done with irredeemable rapists in past writers began to redeem todd or change him so that he could be incorporated into show in spring of 1994 a year after rape hayward states that it required a whole arsenal of symbolic weaponry something that had never happened in soap operas before malone was intrigued by crafting story in this way and saw it as spiritual journey of a man who wanted forgiveness for his past misdeeds malone stated that todd believes that he does not deserve forgiveness which contributes to him embracing his worst qualities something malone felt worked better due to howarth s acting choices which prevented todd from acquiring redemption easily malone felt most important part of todd s redemption was to have him re confront marty in order to better deal with fact he initiated her rape as well as having todd risk his freedom from prison and save marty from a car crash todd donates his own blood to marty to ensure she survives a year later he risks his life to save patrick marty s lover from death this act leads to todd s presumed death despite having character yearn to be thought of as a decent human being writers felt his good deeds should never make him feel any less horrible for having raped marty initially howarth disagreed and did not consider storylines to be redemptive todd s not being redeemed at all he said todd as i see it is looking for a way to overcome this rage so he can live in society again from now on his menace will be on surface not exploding it s more interesting if his violence is on surface and that he play against it that s where subtlety is hayward stated that writers turned todd from a realistic soap opera character into villain appropriated from nineteenth century melodrama and gothic fiction traditions hayward p 177 after todd is sent to prison for marty s rape he vows he will escape and does so by drugging himself and forcing himself to wake up from a coma which allows him to escape from a speeding ambulance he returns to llanview to stalk and terrorize nora lawyer who threw his court case who had gone temporarily blind he tries to rape marty for third time later inadvertently kills marty s boyfriend suede during a scuffle kidnaps evangelist rebecca lewis and is shot by police but survives writers also began to deepen his character by emphasizing his tenderness towards rebecca and showing flashbacks of abuse he experienced from his adoptive father which hayward states does not problem but simply removes cause of violence one step laurie stone of village voice commented that howarth s performance steered todd away from cartoon villainy heightening character s wildness as a dodge from sentimentality and high mindedness instead of killing todd off as other soap operas had done to other unrepentant rapists oltl chose as stone put it to renovate genre maintaining todd as a rapist while enlarging his human dimension stone addressed how writers kept todd on oltl canvas stating characters as dangerous as todd go up in flames on soaps you can see little coffins on their eyelids leaving only one question how will fiend get stone said that todd was this close to being but howarth made that choice laughable rampaging through fictional llanview he injected ambiguity into dialogue his sneers averting cynicism to reveal depression and humor and transformed todd into a soul wrenched lucifer his rage ripped from abuse and bathed in vengeful glee his sexiness rising off his instinct for survival and his outlaw impulse to disrupt she added even ragged scar he acquired on one cheek only heightened his animal appeal no soap would jettison such gold and electricity a figure simultaneously furious ironic melancholy and horny writers used strong imagery to redeem todd malone who had been a novelist and was known for his dickensian plots on oltl was influenced by nineteenth century literature hayward p 178 malone told stone that he compared rebecca s decision to marry powell instead of todd to cathy s decision to marry edgar linton instead of heathcliff in wuthering heights according to stone todd is a classical character a soap character of unprecedented psychological complexity a being whose feelings are intrinsically mixed and mostly unresolvable hayward stated that malone and his team of writers used four techniques drawn from conventions of victorian sentimental fiction to redeem todd his unhappy childhood with an aloof but caring mother and abusive father sending todd to church to confess his past sins and present impulses his love for rebecca an innocent and highly religious virgin and his friendship with two children c j and sarah roberts hayward pp 178 179 hayward calls rebecca with her open mouthed passivity and pre raphaelite curls almost a caricature of dicken s more sentimental and less felicitous heroines hayward p 179 she believes that many of todd s scenes with rebecca are heavily iconic with symbolic representations of virgin mary and freudian images of todd s own feminization thumb show s writers used aspects of frankenstein to add more depth to todd and to make him more sympathetic to audience hayward compares todd to mary shelley s monster frankenstein s monster especially his friendship with c j and sarah shelley s monster watches two children playing and saves a young girl from drowning similarly todd rescues c j and sarah s cousin jessica from being manhandled by an older boy this leads to him meeting c j and sarah like shelley s monster todd observes family s happy moments from afar and wishes to be part of their lives he uses his time alone to make toys for children once they accidentally discover him he manipulates them into keeping his whereabouts a secret by telling them he is a genie on run from an evil master hayward said stories he tells them function as clear metaphors for his feelings about his father stone added that todd s counseling sessions in prison were writers attempts to redeem todd and both she and hayward include one of final techniques writers used todd s rescue of marty jessica and c j soon after a car crash hayward p 181 hayward calls writers attempts to use powerful narrative and visual techniques to redeem todd dubious at best hayward p 182 writer mary d dutta believed that oltl in order to assuage moral qualms associated with a sympathetic rapist added mitigating reasons for todd s sexual abuse of marty namely that he was raped at age of fourteen by his adoptive father peter manning though whether or not he was raped is disputed dutta feels that gang rape storyline invokes many of rape myths that have appeared in literature since 18th century which includes only bad girls get raped women ask for it and women cry rape only when they ve been jilted or have something to cover up dutta also includes myth of reformed rake or rapist redeemed by woman who loves him not uncommonly same woman he raped which deny or reduce perceived injury or blame victims for their own victimization dutta p 35 dutta states todd s redemption begins with his rescue of marty and two children from a car wreck and ends with discovery that he is rightful heir to a huge fortune reception and impact general popularity todd s impact is varied rape storyline inspired feminist studies and in 1994 oltl was awarded several daytime emmys in writing and acting for all principles involved brooks p 114 michael malone and josh griffith s team won an emmy for writing susan haskell won an emmy for outstanding supporting actress in a drama series and hillary b smith was awarded daytime emmy award for outstanding lead actress in a drama series howarth won daytime emmy award for outstanding younger actor in a drama series waggett p 219 in 1995 howarth was nominated for an outstanding supporting actor in a drama series and soap opera digest sod named him outstanding leading actor sod also named him outstanding villain in 1998 while howarth has been called a fan favorite and one of best actors in soaps todd has been called one of greatest characters of all time and howarth s portrayal of him has been called iconic hollywood reporter stated that even though todd was a convicted rapist he was most popular character and howarth was most popular actor on oltl according to waggett rape storyline propelled todd onto list of oltl most despicable villains waggett p xvii he said that due to storyline and to howarth s talent todd became show s next centerpiece villain and eventually show s male lead waggett p 26 howarth appeared on several interview shows following his emmy win in 1994 including phil donahue show in may with six other male soap stars and later that month on live with regis and kathie lee host regis philbin commented on fact that howarth was receiving more fan mail than any other american soap opera star waggett confirmed that howarth had received more fan mail than his castmembers stating during height of todd manning phenomenon one of secretaries at abc would sort mail into two large bags one for roger howarth and one for rest of cast waggett p 187 and called him a terrible villain who s become a heartthrob to thousands of wildly adoring fans tv guide referred to todd as a breakout character thumb susan haskell marty and hillary b smith nora who along with howarth won acting emmys in 1994 for their roles in gang rape storyline at height of todd s popularity which was called todd mania and todd manning phenomenon howarth was disturbed that so many women were attracted to todd and that show s writers had begun to redeem character in a september 1995 interview with hollywood reporter publication stated that howarth was troubled that his villainous character became such a fan favorite in october 1995 howarth told sod people have come up to me and said my 7 year old loves you what do i say to that i m not going to tell them don t let your 7 year old watch tv but i have to say it s disturbing he gave credit to show s writers for todd s popularity saying that rapists trial was well constructed and added i think right now we re just riding wave of something that started last summer beyond that i don t really know why people like todd todd s rampant popularity intruded on howarth s life it s really starting to frustrate me because i can t just go to work anymore he said he stopped doing a lot of press interviews after female fans screamed rape me todd at fan events and because of his disagreement with todd s redemption arc his comings and goings from time to time throughout years even though role of todd had been re cast with st john were greeted with anticipation excitement and speculation from fans at one point in 2000 howarth returned for a week accompanied by significant fanfare in order to assist with departure of florencia lozano tea during ten years he was on show rumors of his departures were reported sometimes weekly by soap opera press soap opera magazine attributed success of todd to howarth s face and skill as an actor in february 1998 magazine stated although scar that traverses his face while he plays llanview s dark prince isn t real menacing intensity roger howarth can so effortlessly convey with his eyes and furrowed brow are frighteningly authentic soap opera weekly called his presence hypnotic and stated that his eyes relayed his focus magazine added that howarth has given todd such a deliciously frightening edge we hope he wreaks more havoc in llanview marla hart of chicago tribune stated that it has been an unexpected pleasure to watch actor roger howarth as a lost soul in search of spiritual redemption hart speculated that darkness howarth brought to role made him interesting to watch and was responsible for his emmy win in 1994 st john and writers received praise for recast and for successfully re integrating todd into show s canvas soap opera weekly stated they said it couldn t be done one life to live s todd previously played by roger howarth could not be recast but with an appealing actor and right pacing one life to live may just have done it magazine stated that writers revealed todd s identity slowly letting walker develop as a character before dropping hints that he might be todd by time he disclosed who he really was to his daughter starr audience had already suspected truth soap opera weekly called reveal scene between st john and alderson who played starr one of those great and these days rare must see moments soap opera digest said that despite recast a difficult situation in and of itself st john aptly distinguished between walker who s really todd as well as flynn who pretended to be walker magazine stated that st john revealed glimmers of todd to audience we could see todd when walker lowered his eyes while holding back from telling his sister viki with fiancee blair walker s gaze was always shifting making sure nothing could clue her in to his secret article also credited st john with maintaining uniquely scheming relationship of todd and starr and for keeping their scenes touching and delightful on may 29 2006 in what soap opera section of sheknows described as one of most memorable moments for oltl and breathtaking nerve racking heart wrenching st john portrayed todd being executed for a crime he did not commit at last moment after lethal injection has been administered john mcbain rushes in declaring todd s innocence with proof woman todd is accused of killing margaret cochran is at his side clearly still alive todd is revived soon afterward during execution episode a montage a little over four minutes in length was shown while a song played in background song was called forsaken or todd s song and written by michal towber especially for show montage included reaction shots of those witnessing execution shots of starr crying in presence of a lynch mob outside prison and flashbacks of todd s children and of blair during both st john and howarth s tenures as todd with howarth s face unseen scenes were called unbearable by viewers and their responses were varied much of audience was infuriated by blair s unwillingness to believe that todd was innocent many viewers thought that todd s death was permanent soap opera digest speculated that this was due to limited internet access or to a lack of interest in spoilers although fans and st john s co workers felt that he deserved an emmy nomination for his death row performances he did not receive one but oltl received a nomination for outstanding drama series by submitting episode one soap opera website criticized st john s emmy snub stating that it was incongruous that show s best show nomination was due in large part to st john s performance soap opera commentators nelson branco and michael fairman called st john s execution performances best on any daytime drama in early 2000s towber and other composers for show were nominated for outstanding achievement in music direction and composition for a drama series controversy and fan debate rape and redemption although gang rape storyline was well received it was also criticized jennifer hayward in her literary analysis of rape and its similarity to nineteenth century melodrama stated that this storyline not only polarized gap between rapists and raped but also figure of rapist himself and that insisting on essential goodness of powell lord implied that peer pressure could be an adequate or even physiologically possible excuse for rape scholar mary buhl dutta arguing that storyline perpetuated rape myths commented on how series especially used marty who fulfilled stereotype of bad girl who was rape victim dutta stated that marty had once cried rape when rev andrew carpenter rebuffed her romantic overtures falsely accusing him of sexually abusing a boy he was counseling after she was actually raped she falsely yet unintentionally accuses kevin buchanan who was innocent marty according to dutta is a bad girl because she had a one night stand with todd before rape bolstering his later claim she asked for it in their second sexual encounter critics have wondered why todd is popular soap opera journalist marlena de lacroix who acknowledged that she neither liked nor understood todd expressed her inability to understand his popularity among so many fans even during his several hiatuses from show she asked why has show devoted years of storyline time to him and all but made a hero out of a criminal hayward who said that her own response to todd s redemption was ambivalent called writers attempt to redeem todd controversial and stated that role of rebecca woman writers paired todd with during redemption process seems to encourage both female and male fantasies about power of a good woman to save a man from his own violent impulses in his book behold man dotson suggested that viewers accepted todd s redemption because he was physically attractive dotson stated were todd an ugly man he would have never been forgiven and female fans would not crowd studio s backdoor shouting his name soap opera commentator jenn bishop said she found it difficult to explain todd s popularity and that if she is perplexed about her feelings regarding him it is understandable that others would be as well if i were to give a surface level assessment of todd i d say he s an abhorrent character with little to no redeeming qualities she said his actions which span from immoral to criminal can be downright heinous i wouldn t want to know todd let alone be around him in real life nor would i want any woman to have any sort of relationship with him instead of seeing todd as an antihero she saw him as more of an anti anti hero and stated that what added to his appeal was that his rape storyline was authentic while todd is not first or last soap character to have committed this crime realness of this particular storyline didn t leave a lot of room for rewrites bishop commented for example luke s rape of laura on general hospital was rewritten and for years was referred to as a seduction there was no grey area this todd s rape of marty could not be dismissed as simply behavior of a romantic rogue to bishop end result of this aspect and that writers had todd generally pay for his crimes was development of a dynamic unpredictable multi faceted character with many traits that conflict with one another and a ll this makes for one messed up guy intriguing to viewers and one i can t help but like hayward categorized writing team involved in todd s redemption as an usually high number of male writers and as an unusual situation because historically most soap opera writers have been women in a june 1994 interview with tv guide in an article about trend during early 1990s of redeemed rapists on soap operas head writer malone commented that t he bond between woman and violator is a great historical tradition in fiction and films and said that rudolph valentino humphrey bogart kirk douglas and clark gable all began as totally irredeemable villains although he did not think that most women want to be raped or are drawn to violence he said that viewers are responding to intensity of passion and an actor who lets you inside torment some women believe they can be swept up in that passion and still turn it good they think with me he d be different author of article michael logan supported malone s statements and commented let s call a spade a spade there is a large contingent of american female soap viewers who find something very attractive about rapists hayward reported that many female viewers were furious that logan had described them this way and stated that their attraction to todd was due to skill of actor portraying him thumb kirk douglas who started out playing irredeemable villains like todd howarth said he had no desire to portray a redeemed todd and that show would be better off finding a todd who won t object to material he subsequently left series for a year in october 24 1995 soap opera digest issue he stated in beginning character of todd was successful i ll always be proud of this story because it was result of a real team effort it was one of those spectacular times when writer producer director grips engineers and actors were all on same wavelength everybody was working toward a common goal my task at time was to show humanity of someone who was basically inhuman todd wasn t one dimensional but he was definitely a serious psychopath todd was a serial rapist he raped carol swift then he raped marty saybrooke and that rape was brutal intense violent and realistic there were innuendos he had raped other women before he stalked nora he stalked and tried to rape luna then executive producer linda gottlieb told me with reasonable certainty that one life to live would not try to redeem todd so i didn t think character would change then about a year ago it became clear to me they were taking character on a different path they were redeeming him in my mind i d been hired to play todd manning a very realistic serious psychopath but now powers that be wanted me to play todd lord and story of todd lord is not realistic it s a fairy tale i thought it would be best for show if i were to leave that s when i tendered my resignation howarth also stated that todd and marty suddenly bonding even if reluctantly did not make sense and that he could not in good conscience support todd s redemption by continuing to play him as todd lord who had become a likable character since rape was as he called it so in depth and so brutal he viewed todd and marty doing something like having drinks with each other bizarre entertainment weekly reported that one life to live agreed to let howarth go on condition he would not appear on another soap opera for twelve months indy week said todd was partially redeemed into a self destructive antihero who remained popular until show s end but his portrayer and many critics were wary of having him becoming a romantic lead merchandising in 2002 as part of abc s push to sell merchandise from its soap operas network began selling a doll in todd s likeness on its website but were thwarted by a backlash modeled after cartoon versions of manning family that starr would sometimes imagine doll sold for 19 95 waggett stated one life to live became first soap opera to incorporate animation into its story line producer gary tomlin put a spin on daydream convention by presenting starr manning s kristen alderson varied fantasies as cartoons waggett p 34 according to description on site it was an all cloth doll with brown felt hair and blue eyes he is 20 inches standing he wears a blue shirt and black pants doll s face also included todd s scar even though several years had passed since gang rape and todd had since settled down and had become a more sympathetic character rape victim advocate groups thought that selling doll glorified sexual assault so abc removed doll from its online store pictures of doll were pulled from internet and doll was blocked from being available at ebay or any other online store controversy began when industry newsletter jack myers report harshly criticized abc for selling doll and other news outlets reported snafu bob tedeschi of new york times stated in charge toward e commerce revenues abc learned a useful lesson last week don t try to sell cuddly rag dolls depicting homicidal rapists angela shapiro president of abc said i was insensitive and take total responsibility for it i should have been sensitive to history of character and i wasn t another abc executive stated we didn t exercise proper sensitivity to history of character of todd we have re evaluated and decided not to sell doll a doll of todd s daughter starr remained in abc stores richard roeper of chicago sun times commented i suppose abc didn t have much of a choice but to pull product but i have to wonder about people who voiced those protests he added it was a stupid sock doll based on a soap opera character if you re offended by that how do you get through day without succumbing to fits of hysterical outrage every five minutes recasting when todd was recast with st john after howarth s departure many fans felt that like roles of luke spencer anthony geary on general hospital and erica kane susan lucci on all my children todd should be portrayed only by actor who had originated role waggett pp 35 36 as soap opera digest put it few recasts caused more uproar soap opera digest also stated that while there were fans who will only consider howarth to be their beloved todd st john won over many fans by putting a lighter spin on character soap opera weekly stated that they were on board with st john soap opera digest agreed commenting that st john made transition believable while adding new facets to character magazine also stated that todd s new appearance aided in his continuing redemption soap opera columnist jill berry expressed her approval for recast stating trevor s todd continues to impress me he has given some sweetness to todd that i find totally appealing in late 2006 st john and howarth simultaneously began contract negotiations with their respective shows which caused rumors that st john was departing from oltl leaving room for howarth who was with soap opera as world turns at time to return as todd tv guide sought to clear up matter and questioned executive producer frank valentini who stated that although he was not able to comment on contracts producers were doing our best to make sure that we do right by audience in 2007 tv guide received official confirmation howarth would not be returning to series magazine conducted a poll on its website tv guide com and found that 82 percent of show s viewers wanted to see howarth return daniel r coleridge of tv guide com disagreed with results stating perhaps i m in minority but i absolutely adore trevor st john whose portrayal of todd he found very cocky arrogant and humorous in a sexy way in 2009 following announcement that as world turns would be cancelled in 2010 rumors that howarth would return to oltl regained momentum rumors were further fueled by an august 2010 episode of oltl in which howarth s picture was shown and a delirious tea stated that current todd st john was not todd manning this resulted in what dan kroll of website soap opera central com described as fans rac ing to their computers to figure out meaning of scene kroll speculated that scene was crafted merely to get fans talking or was it a hint to viewers something big was coming down pike soap opera network citing unnamed sources and pointing to 2010 episode reported on their website that they had learned exclusively howarth would indeed be returning to series in near future soap opera digest columnist carolyn hinsey dismissed report stating on her facebook page seriously stop with howarth misinformation here please he is not coming back to oltl case closed some fans were convinced that st john s character was an impostor while others were not although howarth eventually returned as todd in 2011 his return was initially accompanied with fan debate regarding what role he would play todd manning or a new character violence towards teenagers according to nelson branco of tv guide oltl aired some of most explosive and ugliest scenes ever broadcast on daytime television in march 2008 when todd beat up teenager cole thornhart his daughter s boyfriend and marty s son and slapped starr and cole s friends rivera and langston wilde todd barges in on starr and cole in bed together for first time jumping to conclusion that cole had raped her and beats son of his rape victim relentlessly at least one soap opera blogger was outraged and wanted todd to be punished in branco s opinion head writer ron carlivati wanted to use storyline to return todd to his dark roots by showing him as a monster again stating carlivati chose to do something unique bold and risky with one of his marquee characters demonstrating todd s damaged personality and calling into question his mental stability carlivati said that todd was convinced that starr s alleged rape was karmic payback even when starr insisted that she had not been raped branco postulated that todd s conclusion and strong reaction to seeing two in bed together was todd s inability to separate sex from violence stating todd in that instance became unhinged paranoid and out of control todd was in denial and even almost hit starr twice when she challenged his beliefs scenes were praised as riveting soap columnist marlena de lacroix a self described todd hater who felt that character was psychotic expressed hope that they were beginning of a storyline that will delve into todd s mind and enlighten viewers as to complexities of a character who is mentally ill de lacroix worried that although storyline had potential to be memorable it could be another way to build sympathy for todd marty deciding to revisit rape storyline in 2007 carlivati wrote a story in which marty is thrown from a van during a car crash later that year van explodes and she is presumed dead in june 2008 todd discovers her alive and finds that she is afflicted with amnesia and has been crippled since crash he starts to nurse her back to health lying to her about her identity and her importance to people she loves and he starts to develop romantic feelings for her abc promoted storyline by airing ads that called it story you thought you d never see carlivati defended storyline by assuring audience who was concerned about and resisted storyline that it would not have been written if marty had not lost her memories he stated that he was aware of how serious it was pairing characters romantically but did not feel like they were damaging marty s character carlivati was committed to having storyline progress slowly and to using actors and characters chemistry eventually todd and marty have sex todd insists that he has always been in love with marty and plots to steal his daughter s baby who is also marty s grandchild run off with marty and baby and raise baby with her according to branco show s past writing teams had proposed creating a marty and todd love story but it never happened mostly because haskell and howarth had refused to participate in branco s opinion push toward storyline was reason howarth eventually left oltl for as world turns by contrast at a fan gathering in 2008 st john joked about todd and marty bonding during carlivati storyline stating i m all for gang rape he later issued an apology for comment i should know better than to ever try and make a joke about such a serious subject i intended no s and apologize to anyone i offended de lacroix found carlivati s storyline disgusting stating that it was exploitative misogynistic insulting to audience and most phony stupidly contrived story i have ever seen she also felt that it was a severe to original storyline fans who were opposed to storyline called it re rape and abc aired public service announcements psas during todd and marty sex scene for their viewers berry supported abc s use of psas but felt that they were used to justify storyline and stated that it would have been better to not have presented it in first place lynn parrish a spokesperson for rape abuse incest national network rainn which was not consulted by show s writers spoke out against re rape storyline she told branco there is nothing romantic about rape and that whoever writes a romance between a rapist and its victim under any circumstances clearly doesn t understand rape nor violence and probably shouldn t be writing about it branco called original rape storyline gold standard of rape stories and stated that carlivati had changed it into a soap opera cliche carlivati s addition to characters histories left him feeling betrayed hurt depressed angry insulted and disgusted and he said that he had wasted almost 20 years investing in and believing in original rape storyline at re rape storyline s conclusion branco stated that payoff was worth tense moments however obscene or depraved riskiest storyline in recent memory was he said fallout has been shockingly riveting thanks to fact that head writer ron carlivati is playing all psychological beats of todd s self serving and criminal actions branco also gave credit to st john nominated for a 2009 soap opera spirit award as outstanding lead actor st john inarguably faced most challenging assignment of any actor in 2008 in any genre said branco and yet somehow st john made it work in a lesser actor s hands storyline most certainly would have resulted in career suicide for all involved notes references works cited
