plates and full series in album which contains 82 ignoring three small prisioneros disasters of war was not published during goya s lifetime possibly because he feared political repercussions from fernando vii s repressive regime hughes 2004 has been suggested that goya numbered initial set of 56 plates in 1814 during a few months of national optimism following end of war with intent of publishing them then however on 11 may 1814 fernando vii declared that war would be forgotten and nullified constitution making publication impossible sayre 128 129 some art historians suggest that he did not publish because he was sceptical about use of images for political motives and instead saw them as a personal meditation and release most however believe artist preferred to wait until they could be made public without censorship stoichita and coderch speculates these plates obviously had to be created by artist without any further thought about their ultimate purpose goya never intended them for publication during his lifetime licht 128 wilson bareau and hughes disagree see wilson bareau p 59 and passim in chapter 4 a further four editions were published last in 1937 so that in total

as midnight approached my master said isidro take your gun and come with me i obeyed him and where do you think we went to that hill where bodies of those poor people still lay my master opened his

terrible scene filled with dread my master drew it we returned home and next morning my master showed me his first print of la guerra which i looked at in horror sir i asked him why do you draw these which men commit he replied to warn men not to be barbarians ever again ferrari enrique licht et al 82 83 goya scholars are sceptical of account nigel glendinning described it as a romantic fantasy and detailed its many inaccuracies in a bbc television documentary glendinning said trueba is clearly romanticising artist making artist fearless and heroic i mean not to just observe through spy glass these terrible things that are happening but actually going to see them none of this corresponds at all to reality of shootings because we know shootings took place at four or five o clock in morning some modern experts point out it was also raining and so idea that goya is going out at midnight he s not going to see anything none of this fits with historical information we have

spanish art from dwarves of diego velazquez to pablo picasso s guernica 1937 reflecting on disasters of war biographer margherita abbruzzese notes that goya asks that truth be seen and shown to others including those who have no wish to see it and blind in spirit stay their eyes on outward aspect of things then these outward aspects must be twisted and deformed until they cry out what they are trying to say series follows a wider european tradition of war art and examination of effect of military conflict on civilian life probably mostly known to goya via prints this tradition is reflected especially in dutch depictions of eighty years war with spain and in work of 16th century german artists like hans baldung it is believed goya owned a copy of a famous set of 18 etchings by jacques

2004 295 goya abandons colour in series believing that light shade and shadow provide for a more direct expression of truth he wrote in art there is no need for colour give me a crayon and i will paint your portrait he uses line not so much to delineate shape but according to art historian anne hollander to scratch forms into existence and then splinter them as a squinting half blind eye might apprehend them to create distorting visual detritus that shudders around edge of things seen in agonized haste this graphic kind of clarity can be most sharp when it is most jagged hollander 254 immediacy of approach suited his desire to convey primitive side of man s nature he was not first to work in this manner rembrandt had sought a similar directness but did not have access to aquatint william blake and henry fuseli contemporaries of goya s produced works with similarly fantastical content but as hollander describes they muted its disturbing impact with exquisitely applied linearity lodging it firmly in safe citadels of beauty and rhythm hollander 254 55 in his 1947 book on goya s etchings english author aldous huxley observed that images depict a recurrent series of pictorial themes darkened archways more sinister than those even of s prisons street corners as settings for cruelty of disparities of class and silhouetted hilltops carrying dead sometimes featuring a single tree serving as gallows or repository for dismembered corpses and so record proceeds horror after horror by any of splendors which other painters have been able to discover in war for significantly goya never illustrates an engagement never shows us impressive masses of troops marching in column or deployed in order of battle all he shows us is war s disasters and without any of glory or even picturesqueness huxley 12 13 disasters of war is second of goya s four major print series which constitute almost all of his most important work in medium he also created 35 prints early in his career

incident it did not meet with critical or commercial success wilson bareau 61 64 and 67 while in france goya completed a set of four larger lithographs los toros de bulls of bordeaux wilson bareau 91

these were left in madrid apparently incomplete and with only a handful of proofs printed when goya went to france in 1823 one plate is known to have been etched in 1816 but little else is established about chronology of works or goya s plans for set wilson bareau 77 78 goya worked on disasters of war during a period when he was producing images more for his own satisfaction than for any contemporary audience goya s introspection late in this period can be witnessed in enigmatic black paintings which he painted directly onto walls of his house between 1819 and 1823 his work came to rely less on historical incidents than his own imagination many of later plates contain fantastical motifs which can be seen as a return to imagery of caprichos in this he is relying on visual clues derived from his inner life rather than anything that could be recognised from real events or settings hollander 253 interpretation in disasters of war goya does not excuse any purpose to random slaughter plates are devoid of consolation of divine order or dispensation of human justice licht 130 152 this in part a result of absence of melodrama or consciously artful presentation that would distance viewer from brutality of subjects as found in baroque martyrdom in addition goya refuses to offer stability of traditional narrative instead his composition tends to highlight most disturbing aspects of each work licht 132 142 left thumb la hanging a plate from french artist jacques callot s 1623 series les grandes miseres de la guerre it is likely that callot s etchings of a disorderly army were an influence on goya alt bodies of captive men hang from trees while soldiers and civilians look on a man to right comforts a woman plates are set spaces without fixed boundaries mayhem extends outside frames of picture plane in all directions thus they express randomness of violence and in their immediacy and brutality they have been described as analogous to 19th and 20th century photojournalism licht 130 133 143 144 according to robert hughes as with goya s earlier caprichos series disasters of war is likely to have been intended as a social speech satires on then prevailing hysteria evil cruelty and irrationality and absence of wisdom of spain under napoleon and later inquisition hughes 1990 63 it is evident goya viewed spanish war with disillusionment and despaired both for violence around him and for loss of a liberal ideal he believed was being replaced by a new militant unreason hughes believed goya s decision to render images through etchings which by definition are absent of colour indicates feelings of utter hopelessness his message late in life is contrary to humanistic view of man as essentially good but easily corrupted he seems to be saying that violence is innate in man forged in substance of what since freud we have called id hughes believed that in end there is only violated emptiness of acceptance of our fallen nature like painting of goya s dog whose master is as absent from him as god is from goya hughes 1990 64 disasters of war plates are preoccupied with wasted bodies undifferentiated body parts castration and female abjection there are dark erotic undertones to a number of works connell notes innate sexuality of image in plate 7 agustina de aragon s igniting a long cannon art historian lennard davis suggests that goya was fascinated with erotics of dismemberment shaw 485 while hughes mentions plate 10 in los disparates which shows a woman carried in grip of a horse s mouth to hughes woman s euphoria suggests among other possible meanings orgasm legacy despite being one of most significant anti war works of art disasters of war had no impact on european consciousness for two generations as it was not seen outside a small circle in spain until it was published by madrid s royal academy of san fernando in 1863 hughes 2004 304 since then interpretations in successive eras have reflected sensibilities of time goya was seen as a proto romantic in early 19th century and series graphically rendered dismembered carcasses were a direct influence on theodore gericault hughes 1990 51 best known for politically charged raft of medusa 1818 19 luis bunuel identified with goya s sense of absurd and referenced his works in such films as 1930 l age d or on which he collaborated with salvador dali and his 1962 exterminating angel series impact on dali is evident in soft construction with boiled beans premonition of civil war painted in 1936 in response to events leading to spanish civil war here distorted limbs brutal suppression agonised expressions and ominous clouds are reminiscent of plate 39 grande hazana con muertos a heroic feat with dead men in which mutilated bodies are shown against a backdrop barren landscape licht 151 in 1993 jake and dinos chapman of young british artists movement created 82 miniature toy like sculptures modelled on disasters of war works were widely acclaimed
