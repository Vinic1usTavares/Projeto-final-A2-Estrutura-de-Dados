magpie is an oil on canvas landscape painting by french impressionist claude monet created during winter of 1868 1869 near commune of etretat in normandy monet s patron louis joachim gaudibert helped arrange a house in etretat for monet s girlfriend camille doncieux and their newborn son allowing monet to paint in relative comfort surrounded by his family between 1867 and 1893 monet and fellow impressionists alfred sisley and camille pissarro painted hundreds of landscapes illustrating natural effect of snow de neige similar winter paintings of lesser quantity were produced by pierre auguste renoir gustave and paul gauguin art historians believe that a series of severe winters in france contributed to an increase in number of winter landscapes produced by impressionists for range of 63 major works produced from 1867 1893 see moffett et al 1999 this arbitrary time period was established for first impressionists in winter effets de neige exhibition based on historical reports of severe winters collected by curators magpie is one of approximately 140 snowscapes produced by monet his first snowscape a cart on snowy road at honfleur was painted sometime in either 1865 or 1867 followed by a notable series of snowscapes in same year beginning with road in front of saint simeon farm in winter magpie was completed in 1869 and is monet s largest winter painting it was followed by red cape 1869 1871 only known winter painting featuring camille doncieux moffett et al 1999 p 86 canvas of magpie depicts a solitary black magpie perched on a gate formed in a wattle fence as light of sun shines upon freshly fallen snow creating blue shadows painting features one of first examples of monet s use of colored shadows which would later become associated with impressionist movement monet and impressionists used colored shadows to represent actual changing conditions of light and shadow as seen in nature challenging academic convention of painting shadows black this subjective theory of color perception was introduced to art world through works of johann wolfgang von goethe and michel eugene chevreul earlier in century at time monet s innovative use of light and color led to its rejection by paris salon of 1869 today art historians classify magpie as one of monet s best snowscape paintings arts council of great britain 1957 p 43 perhaps monet s greatest snow landscape this monet s finest snowscape one of most magnificent snow scenes in his entire oeuvre painting was privately held until musee d orsay acquired it in 1984 it is considered one of most popular paintings in their permanent collection background in late 1850s french landscape painter eugene boudin 1824 1898 introduced monet 1840 1926 to art of painting en plein air in open air using natural light invention of collapsible metal paint tube 1841 and portable easel brought painting formerly confined to studios into outdoors boudin and monet spent summer of 1858 painting nature together like boudin monet came to prefer painting outdoors rather than in a studio convention of time if i have become a painter monet said i owe it to boudin thumb left a cart on snowy road at honfleur 1865 or 1867 monet s first snowscape landscape paintings of dutch painter johan barthold jongkind 1819 1891 influenced both boudin and monet and contributed to development of early impressionism after meeting jongkind in sainte adresse in 1862 monet began to cultivate an interest in jongkind s perspective on changing conditions of landscape from jongkind monet learned to substitute optical color for local color jongkind discovered how so called local color changes with seasons it suddenly came to him that for artist appearance not reality was determining factor only thing that did matter was atmospheric condition at a given moment he shared this revelation with monet who in turn experimented by making two paintings of a road in normandy from same vantage point first one under a cloudy sky and second when road was covered with snow complementing teaching i received from boudin jongkind was from that moment my true master monet later reminisced it was he who completed education of my eye this new way of seeing a shift from a conceptual to a perceptual approach formed basis for monet s haystacks 1890 1891 a series of 25 works showing effects of dynamic atmospheric conditions over time on a single haystack motif gustave courbet 1819 1877 had been painting effets de neige snow effects from as early as 1856 courbet gustave 1856 trees in snow national galleries of scotland in a landscape style preferred by japanese dutch and flemish artists influenced by courbet monet painted his first snowscape a cart on snowy road at honfleur 1865 or 1867 musee d orsay with this choice of theme monet was following in footsteps of courbet who had tackled snowscapes in a number of genre scenes but unlike older painter whose principal motif remained stag and hunter and who produced many anecdotal scenes monet painted an almost deserted landscape where cart and its occupant play a very minor role painting was originally dated 1865 by monet however correspondence by painter alexandre dubourg points to a later date of 1867 in eliza rathbone notes that date is disputed by scholars a journalist observed we have only seen him once it was in winter during several days of snow when communications were virtually at a standstill it was cold enough to split stones we noticed a foot warmer then an easel then a man swathed in three coats his hands in gloves his face half frozen it was m monet studying a snow effect published in october 1868 but anecdote is thought to refer to previous winter in a cart on snowy road at honfleur monet avoided usual hunting genre and motifs used by courbet instead he focused on light and color in a new way by reducing number of shades monet chose an earth tone color scheme and increased number of shades of blue to highlight reflections on snow monet followed a cart on snowy road at honfleur with a notable series of snowscapes in 1867 including road by saint simeon farm in winter first etretat campaign in 1867 monet s girlfriend camille doncieux 1847 1879 gave birth to their son jean in paris lacking money monet returned to his father s house in sainte adresse and lived with his aunt leaving doncieux and their child in paris monet married doncieux in 1870 mme louis joachim gaudibert an art collector became monet s first patron gaudibert helped monet rent a house in etretat for doncieux and jean in late 1868 recovering from an episode of depression monet joined doncieux and jean at house in etretat in october with doncieux in role of muse and life model by december monet was in great spirits surrounded by everything that i love and began to focus on painting in a letter to frederic bazille 1841 1870 monet wrote thumb 220px luncheon 1868 camille and son jean in etretat for an extended discussion of luncheon le dejeuner and how it fits into timeline of first etretat campaign see wagner anne m 1994 why monet gave up figure painting art bulletin 74 4 612 i spend my time out in open on shingle beach when weather is bad or fishing boats go out or i go into countryside which is very beautiful here that i find perhaps still more charming in winter than in summer and naturally i work all time and i believe that this year i am going to do some serious things see also george serge 1996 claude monet masterworks series books p 14 although he enjoyed living with camille and jean in etretat monet preferred to paint alone in countryside he told bazille don t you think that directly in nature and alone one does better i ve always been of this mind and what i do under these conditions has always been better one is too much taken up with what one sees and hears in paris however firm one may be and what i am painting here has at least merit of not resembling anyone because it will be simply expression of what i shall have felt i myself personally wildenstein i 425 26 letter 44 dec 1868 as quoted in isaacson 1994 during his time in etretat monet completed three paintings of fishing boats includes fishing

took advantage of most significant snowfalls his output of winter landscapes was often more sporadic with occasional bursts of activity followed by periods without production largest in its class myers 1998 his largest winter painting it is monet s largest and most ambitious snowscape an essay about light and shadow on snow exact location of snow scene depicted in magpie is unknown ralph t coe proposed that monet painted scene near farm saint simeon above seine estuary in honfleur rejection by salon monet submitted magpie and fishing boats at sea w 126 to salon of 1869 both paintings were rejected in april critic paul richard said that jurors rejected painting as too common and too coarse monet s experimental use of color and radical departure from descriptive academic style surprised public and probably contributed to its dismissal by jury musee d orsay claude monet magpie 2006 monet told french novelist arsene houssaye 1815 1896 this rejection has taken bread from my mouth and in spite of my low prices collectors and dealers turn their backs on me a century later magpie was acquired by musee d orsay in 1984 it became one of most popular paintings in their permanent collection visitor surveys and sales of postcard and reproductions indicate that it is most popular single image in museum also see critical analysis in painting a black magpie is perched on a gate in a wattle fence as sunlight falls on fresh white snow creating shadows with no human figures present bird on gate becomes focus katherine rothkopf in in absence of any human figure central feature of painting is black bird perched on gate which is filled with an almost magical significance michael howard of manchester metropolitan university called painting an extraordinary evocation of snow bound chill of a late winter s afternoon blueness of long shadows creates a delicate contrast with creamy whites of sky and landscape howard 1989 monet p 33 as quoted in curator lynn orr then of fine arts museums of san francisco noted monet s interest in changing light that depended on hour and vagaries of atmosphere qualities of light characteristic of different times of day and in different atmospheric conditions unusual weather phenomena such as snow and mist fascinated monet because they altered chromatic appearance of familiar topography in such paintings as magpie one of monet s early masterpieces form dissolves under combination of a greatly restricted color range aerial perspective and broken brushwork a virtuoso color performance painting is an essay on variations of white perceptible in reflection of sun on crisp new snow wonderfully abstract passages of flat color such as strong violet shades along fence are divorced from spatial realities of objects portrayed magpie is an early example of monet s investigation of colored shadows in this piece monet makes use of complementary colors of blue and yellow shadow produced by yellow sunlight shining on snow gives impression of a blue violet color effect of simultaneous contrast french impressionists popularized use of colored shadows which went against artistic convention of portraying shadows by darkening and color colored shadows can be directly observed in nature particularly in type of snow scene presented by monet in his study of impressionism art historian john observed that artists used snowscapes to investigate problem of shadows problem is summarized by fred s kleiner in gardner s art through ages after scrutinizing effects of light and color on forms impressionists concluded that local color an object s true color in white light becomes modified by quality of light shining on it by reflections from other objects and by effects juxtaposed colors produce shadows do not appear gray or black as many earlier painters thought but are composed of colors modified by reflections or other conditions using various colors and short choppy brush strokes monet was able to catch accurately vibrating quality of light monet s use of colored shadows arose from color theories that were popular in 19th century german scientist johann wolfgang von goethe 1749 1832 published one of first modern descriptions of colored shadows in his theory of colours 1810 goethe attempted to challenge theory of color propounded by isaac newton 1643 1727 in his treatise on 1704 goethe raised questions about subjective and objective color theory and perception but his intuitive non mathematical approach was criticized as unscientific and his attack on newton was dismissed as a polemic questions goethe raised about color persisted thirty years later french chemist michel eugene chevreul 1786 1889 expanded on goethe s theory with principles of harmony and contrast of colors 1839 goethe and chevreul s colour theory greatly influenced art world it is generally thought that vincent van gogh camille pissarro and monet incorporated elements of these theories into their work georges roque 1996 questions whether impressionists were aware of chevreul s law of simultaneous contrast aside from pissarro and seurat roque can find no evidence that impressionists knew chevreul s work directly however backhaus et al 1998 point out that it was possible early impressionists were familiar with work of eugene delacroix who was intimate with chevreul s color theories it is generally accepted that as early as 1860s monet was familiar with delacroix s work and was influenced by his use of color georges seurat 1859 1891 came to prominence in 1886 with his technique of chromatic division a style influenced by color scheme theories of chevreul and american physicist ogden rood 1831 1902 for more information about ogden rood and impressionists see kemp martin 2008 impressionists bible nature 453 p 37 related work monet s series of 11 paintings depicting bridge at argenteuil 1874 also explored use of colored shadows in its portrayal of blue and purple shadow on top portion of bridge over years monet became more and more obsessed with color and light when his wife was dying in september 1879 monet painted her in camille monet on her deathbed 1879 noting blue yellow grey tones monet told his friend french statesman georges clemenceau 1841 1929 that he spent time focusing on her temples and automatically analyzing succession of appropriately graded colors which death was imposing on her motionless face camille died from cancer at age of 32 after her death monet largely ceased painting people focusing instead on natural landscapes monet later returned to painting snow and colored shadows with snow effect 1891 derivative work in honor of 150th anniversary of monet s birth principality of monaco issued a stamp of magpie in 1990 designed by french engraver pierre
