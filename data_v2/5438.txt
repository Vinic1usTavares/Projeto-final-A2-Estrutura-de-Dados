woodpeckers are part of family picidae a group of near passerine birds that also consist of piculets wrynecks and sapsuckers members of this family are found worldwide except for australia new guinea new zealand madagascar and extreme polar regions most species live in forests or woodland habitats although a few species are known that live in treeless areas such as rocky hillsides and deserts and gila woodpecker specialises in exploiting cacti members of this family are chiefly known for their characteristic behaviour they mostly forage for insect prey on trunks and branches of trees and often communicate by drumming with their beak producing a reverberatory sound that can be heard at some distance some species vary their diet with fruits birds eggs small animals and tree sap they mostly nest and roost in holes that they excavate in tree trunks and their abandoned holes are of importance to other cavity nesting birds they sometimes come into conflict with humans when they make holes in buildings or feed on fruit crops but perform a useful service by their removal of insect pests on trees picidae are one of nine living families in order piciformes others being barbets comprising three families toucans toucan barbets and honeyguides which along with woodpeckers comprise clade pici and jacamars and puffbirds in clade galbuli dna sequencing has confirmed sister relationships of these two groups family picidae includes about 240 species arranged in 35 genera almost 20 species are threatened with extinction due to loss of habitat or habitat fragmentation with one bermuda flicker being extinct and a further two possibly being so general characteristics left thumb a black rumped using its tail for support woodpeckers range from tiny piculets measuring no more than in length and weighing to large woodpeckers which can be more than in length largest surviving species is great slaty woodpecker which weighs but probably extinct imperial woodpecker and ivory billed woodpecker were both larger plumage of woodpeckers varies from drab to conspicuous colours of many species are based on olive and brown and some are pied suggesting a need for camouflage others are boldly patterned in black white and red and many have a crest or tufted feathers on crown woodpeckers tend to be sexually dimorphic but differences between sexes are generally small exceptions to this are williamson s sapsucker and orange backed woodpecker which differ markedly plumage is moulted fully once a year apart from wrynecks which have an additional partial moult before breeding gorman 2014 pp 22 23 woodpeckers piculets and wrynecks all possess characteristic zygodactyl feet consisting of four toes first hallux and fourth facing backward and second and third facing forward this foot arrangement is good for grasping limbs and trunks of trees members of this family can walk vertically up tree trunks which is beneficial for activities such as foraging for food or nest excavation in addition to their strong claws and feet woodpeckers have short strong legs this is typical of birds that regularly forage on trunks exceptions are black backed woodpecker and american and eurasian three toed woodpeckers which have only three toes on each foot tails of all woodpeckers except piculets and wrynecks are stiffened and when bird perches on a vertical surface tail and feet work together to support it woodpeckers have strong bills for drilling and drumming on trees and long sticky tongues for extracting food insects and larvae winkler hans christie david a 2002 family picidae woodpeckers in del hoyo j elliot a sargatal j editors 2002 handbook of birds of world volume 7 jacamars to woodpeckers lynx edicions woodpecker bills are typically longer sharper and stronger than bills of piculets and wrynecks however their morphology is very similar bill s chisel like tip is kept sharp by pecking action in birds that regularly use it on wood beak consists of three layers an outer sheath called rhamphotheca made of scales formed from keratin proteins an inner layer of bone which has a large cavity and mineralised collagen fibers and a middle layer made of porous bone which connects two other layers furthermore tongue bone or hyoid bone of woodpecker is very long and winds around skull through a special cavity thereby cushioning brain combined this anatomy helps beak absorb mechanical stress species of woodpecker and flicker that use their bills in soil or for probing as opposed to regular hammering tend to have longer and more decurved bills due to their smaller bill size many piculets and wrynecks will forage in decaying wood more often than woodpeckers their long sticky tongues which possess bristles aid these birds in grabbing and extracting insects from deep within a hole in a tree it has been reported that tongue was used to spear grubs but more detailed studies published in 2004 have shown that tongue instead wraps around prey before being pulled out thumb diagram showing hyoid bone of dendrocopos major many of foraging breeding and signaling behaviors of woodpeckers involve drumming and hammering using bill to prevent brain damage from rapid and repeated powerful impacts woodpeckers have a number of physical features which protect brain these include a relatively small and smooth brain narrow subdural space little cerebrospinal fluid csf surrounding it to prevent it from moving back and forth inside skull during pecking orientation of brain within skull which maximises contact area between brain and skull and short duration of contact skull consists of strong but compressible sponge like bone which is most concentrated in forehead and back of skull another anatomical adaptation of woodpeckers is enormously elongated hyoid bone which subdivides passes on either side of spinal column and wraps around brain case before ending in right nostril cavity it plays role of safety belt computer simulations have shown that 99 7 percent of energy generated in pecking is stored in form of strain energy which is distributed throughout bird s body with only a small remaining fraction of energy going into brain pecking also causes woodpecker s skull to heat up which is part of reason why they often peck in short bursts with brief breaks in between giving head some time to cool during millisecond before contact with wood a thickened nictitating membrane closes protecting eye from flying debris these membranes also prevent retina from tearing nostrils are also protected they are often slit like and have special feathers to cover them woodpeckers are capable of repeated pecking on a tree at high decelerations in order of 1000 g some large woodpeckers such as dryocopus have a fast direct form of flight but majority of species have a typical undulating flight pattern consisting of a series of rapid flaps followed by a swooping glide many birds in genus melanerpes have distinctive rowing wing strokes while piculets engage in short bursts of rapid direct flight gorman 2014 p 27 distribution habitat and movements thumb upright use of cacti for breeding and roosting holes allows some woodpeckers to live in treeless deserts like ladder backed woodpecker which uses cacti for nesting global distribution woodpeckers have a mostly cosmopolitan distribution although they are absent from australasia madagascar and antarctica they are also absent from some of world s oceanic islands although many insular species are found on continental islands true woodpeckers subfamily picinae are distributed across entire range of family picumninae piculets have a pantropical distribution with species in southeast asia africa and neotropics with greatest diversity being in south america second piculet subfamily nesoctitinae has a single member antillean piculet which is restricted to caribbean island of hispaniola wrynecks jynginae are found exclusively in old world with two species occurring in europe asia and africa gorman 2014 p 15 majority of woodpeckers are sedentary but there are a few examples of migratory species such as rufous bellied woodpecker and yellow bellied sapsucker and eurasian wryneck breeds in europe and west asia and migrates to sahel in africa in winter more northerly populations of lewis s woodpecker northern flicker williamson s sapsucker red breasted sapsucker and red naped sapsucker all move southwards in fall in north america most woodpecker movements can be described as dispersive such as when young birds seek territories after fledging or eruptive to escape harsh weather conditions several species are altitudinal migrants for example grey capped woodpecker which moves to lowlands from hills during winter months woodpeckers that do migrate do so during day habitat requirements overall woodpeckers are arboreal birds of wooded habitats they reach their greatest diversity in tropical rainforests but occur in almost all suitable habitats including woodlands savannahs scrublands and bamboo forests even grasslands and deserts have been colonised by various species these habitats are more easily occupied where a small number of trees exist or in case of desert species like gila woodpecker tall cacti are available for nesting some are specialists and are associated with coniferous or deciduous woodland or even like acorn woodpecker with individual tree genera oaks in this case other species are generalists and are able to adapt to forest clearance by exploiting secondary growth plantations orchards and parks in general forest dwelling species need rotting or dead wood on which to forage gorman 2014 p 18 a number of species are adapted to spending a portion of their time feeding on ground and a very small minority have abandoned trees entirely and nest in holes in ground ground woodpecker is one such species inhabiting rocky and grassy hills of south africa and andean flicker is another swiss ornithological institute has set up a monitoring program to record breeding populations of woodland birds this has shown that deadwood is an important habitat requirement for black woodpecker great spotted woodpecker middle spotted woodpecker lesser spotted woodpecker european green woodpecker and eurasian three toed woodpecker populations of all these species increased by varying amounts in period 1990 to 2008 during this period amount of deadwood in forest increased and range of white backed woodpecker enlarged as it extended eastwards with exception of green and middle spotted woodpeckers increase in amount of deadwood is likely to be major factor explaining population increase of these species behaviour majority of woodpeckers live solitary lives but spectrum of behaviour ranges from highly antisocial species that are aggressive towards their own kind to species that live in groups solitary species will defend such feeding resources as a termite colony or fruit laden tree driving away other conspecifics and returning frequently until resource is exhausted aggressive behaviours include bill pointing and jabbing head shaking wing flicking chasing drumming and vocalisations ritual actions do not usually result in contact and birds may freeze for a while before they resume their dispute coloured patches may be flouted and in some instances these antagonistic behaviours resemble courtship rituals group living species tend to be communal group breeders in addition to these species a number of species may join mixed species foraging flocks with other insectivorous birds although they tend to stay at edges of these groups joining these flocks allows woodpeckers to decrease their anti predator vigilance and increase their feeding rate woodpeckers are diurnal roosting at night inside holes and crevices in many species roost will become nest site during breeding season but in some species they have separate functions grey and buff woodpecker makes several shallow holes for roosting which are quite distinct from its nesting site most birds roost alone and will oust intruders from their chosen site but magellanic woodpecker and acorn woodpecker are cooperative roosters gorman 2014 pp 19 20 drumming drumming is a form of non vocal communication used by most species of woodpecker and involves bill being repeatedly struck on a hard surface with great rapidity after a pause drum roll is repeated each species having a pattern which is unique in number of beats in roll length of roll length of gap between rolls and cadence drumming is mainly a territorial call equivalent to song of a passerine with male birds drumming more frequently than females gorman 2014 p 28 woodpeckers choose a surface that resonates such as a hollow tree and may use man made structures such as gutters and drumming serves for mutual recognition of conspecifics and plays a part in courtship rituals individual birds are thought to be able to distinguish drumming of their mates and that of their neighbours calls woodpeckers do not have such a wide range of songs and calls as do passerine birds and sounds they make tend to be simpler in structure calls produced include brief high pitched notes trills rattles twittering whistling chattering nasal screams and wails these calls are used by both sexes in communication and are related to circumstances of occasion these include courtship territorial disputes and alarm calls each species has its own range of calls which tend to be in 1 to 2 5 khz range for efficient transmission through forested environments mated couples may exchange muted low pitched calls and nestlings often issue noisy begging calls from inside their nest cavity wrynecks have a more musical song and in some areas song of newly arrived eurasian wryneck is considered to be harbinger of spring piculets either have a song consisting of a long descending trill or a descending series of two to six sometimes more individual notes and this song alerts ornithologists to presence of birds as they are easily overlooked diet and feeding thumb holes bored by feeding woodpeckers majority of woodpecker species live up to their name and feed on insects and other invertebrates living under bark and in wood but overall family is characterized by its dietary flexibility with many species being both highly omnivorous and opportunistic diet includes ants termites beetles and their larvae caterpillars spiders other arthropods bird eggs nestlings small rodents lizards fruit nuts and sap many insects and their grubs are taken from living and dead trees by excavation bird may hear sounds from inside timber indicating where it will be productive to create a hole other means are also used to garner prey some species such as red naped sapsucker sally into air to catch flying insects and many species probe into crevices and under bark or glean prey from leaves and twigs rufous woodpecker specialises in attacking nests of arboreal ants and buff spotted woodpecker feeds on and nests in termite mounds other species such as wrynecks and andean flicker feed wholly or partly on ground ecologically woodpeckers help to keep trees healthy by keeping them from suffering mass infestations family is noted for its ability to acquire wood boring grubs from trunks and branches whether timber is alive or dead having hammered a hole into wood prey is extracted by use of a long barbed tongue woodpeckers consume beetles that burrow into trees removing as many as 85 percent of emerald ash borer larvae from individual ash trees ability to excavate allows woodpeckers to obtain tree sap an important source of food for some species most famously sapsuckers genus sphyrapicus feed in this fashion but technique is not restricted to these and others such as acorn woodpecker and white headed woodpecker also feed on sap it was once thought that technique was restricted to new world but old world species such as arabian woodpecker and great spotted woodpecker also feed in this way breeding thumb a male black woodpecker attending its chicks all members of family picidae nest in cavities nearly always in trunks and branches of trees well away from foliage where possible an area of rotten wood surrounded by sound timber is used where trees are in short supply gilded flicker and ladder backed woodpecker excavate holes in cactus and andean flicker and ground woodpecker dig holes in earth banks campo flicker sometimes chooses termite mounds rufous woodpecker prefers to use ants nests in trees and bamboo woodpecker specialises in bamboos gorman 2014 p 20 woodpeckers also excavate nest holes in residential and commercial structures as well as wooden utility poles woodpeckers and piculets will excavate their own nests but wrynecks will not and need to find pre existing cavities a typical nest has a round entrance hole that just fits bird leading to an enlarged vertical chamber below no nesting material is used apart from some wood chips produced during excavation other wood chips are liberally scattered on ground providing visual evidence of site of nest gorman 2014 p 22 many species of woodpeckers excavate one hole per breeding season sometimes after multiple attempts it takes around a month to finish job and abandoned holes are used by other birds and mammals that are cavity nesters unable to excavate their own holes cavities are in great demand for nesting by other cavity nesters so woodpeckers face competition for nesting sites they excavate from moment hole becomes usable this may come from other species of woodpecker or other cavity nesting birds like swallows and starlings woodpeckers may aggressively harass potential competitors and also use other strategies to reduce chance of being usurped from their nesting site for example red crowned woodpecker digs its nest in underside of a small branch which reduces chance that a larger species will take it over and expand it members of picidae are typically monogamous with a few species breeding cooperatively and some polygamy reported in a few species polyandry where a female raises two broods with two separate males has also been reported in west indian woodpecker another unusual social system is that of acorn woodpecker which is a polygynandrous cooperative breeder where groups of up to 12 individuals breed and help to raise young young birds from previous years may stay behind to help raise group s young and studies have found reproductive success for group goes up with group size but individual success goes down birds may be forced to remain in groups due to a lack of habitat to disperse to a pair will work together to help build nest incubate eggs and raise their altricial young however in most species male does most of nest excavation and takes night shift while incubating eggs a clutch will usually consist of two to five round white eggs since these birds are cavity nesters their eggs do not need to be camouflaged and white color helps parents to see them in dim light eggs are incubated for about 11 14 days before they hatch it then takes about 18 30 days before chicks are fully fledged and ready to leave nest in most species soon after this young are left to fend for themselves exceptions being various social species and woodpecker where adults continue to feed their young for several months in general cavity nesting is a successful strategy and a higher proportion of young are reared than is case with birds that nest in open in africa several species of honeyguide are brood parasites of woodpeckers systematics and evolution picidae are just one of eight living families in order piciformes other members of this group such as jacamars puffbirds barbets toucans and honeyguides have traditionally been thought to be closely related to woodpecker family true woodpeckers piculets wrynecks and sapsuckers clade pici woodpeckers barbets toucans and honeyguides is well supported and shares a zygodactyl foot with galbuli puffbirds and jacamars more recently several dna sequence analyses have confirmed that pici and galbuli are sister groups family picidae was introduced by english zoologist william elford leach in a guide to contents of british museum published in 1820 although name of author is not specified in document leach was keeper of zoology at time phylogeny has been updated according to new knowledge about convergence patterns and evolutionary history most notably relationship of genera has been largely clarified and it was determined that antillean piculet is a surviving offshoot of proto woodpeckers genetic analysis supports monophyly of picidae which seems to have originated in old world but geographic origins of picinae is unclear picumninae is returned as paraphyletic morphological and behavioural characters in addition to dna evidence highlights genus hemicircus as sister group of all remaining true woodpeckers besides a sister group relationship between true woodpecker tribes dendropicini and malarpicini evolutionary history of this group is not well documented but known fossils allow some preliminary conclusions earliest known modern picids were piculet like forms of late oligocene about 25 million years ago mya by that time however group was already present in americas and europe and it is hypothesized that they actually evolved much earlier maybe as early as early eocene 50 mya modern subfamilies appear to be rather young by comparison until mid miocene 10 15 mya all picids seem to have been small or mid sized birds similar to a mixture between a piculet and a wryneck on other hand there exists a feather enclosed in fossil amber from dominican republic dated to about 25 mya which seems to indicate that nesoctitinae were already a distinct lineage by then stepwise adaptations for drilling tapping and climbing head first on vertical surfaces have been suggested last common ancestor of woodpeckers picidae was incapable of climbing up tree trunks or excavating nest cavities by drilling with its beak first adaptations for drilling including reinforced rhamphotheca frontal overhang and dorsalis evolved in ancestral lineage of piculets and true woodpeckers additional adaptations for drilling and tapping enlarged lateralis of quadrate and fused lower mandible have evolved in ancestral lineage of true woodpeckers hemicircus excepting inner pairs became stiffened and pygostyle lamina was enlarged in ancestral lineage of true woodpeckers hemicircus included which facilitated climbing head first up tree limbs genus hemicircus excepting tail feathers were further transformed for specialized support pygostyle disc became greatly enlarged and toe arrangement evolved these latter characters may have facilitated enormous increases in body size in some lineages prehistoric representatives of extant picidae genera are treated in genus articles an enigmatic

light they are viewed as interesting birds and fascinating to watch as they drum or forage however their activities are not universally appreciated gorman 2014 pp 30 32 many woodpecker species are known to excavate holes in buildings fencing and utility poles creating health and or safety issues for affected buildings and utility poles such activity is very difficult to discourage and can be costly to repair woodpeckers also drum on various reverberatory structures on buildings such as gutters chimneys vents and aluminium sheeting drumming is a less forceful type of pecking that serves to establish territory and attract mates houses with shingles or wooden boarding are also attractive as possible nesting or roosting sites especially when close to large trees or woodland several exploratory holes may be made especially at junctions of vertical boards or at corners of tongue and groove boarding birds may also drill holes in houses as they forage for insect larvae and pupae hidden behind woodwork woodpeckers sometimes cause problems when they raid fruit crops but their foraging activities are mostly beneficial as they control forest insect pests such as woodboring beetles that create galleries behind bark and can kill trees they also eat ants which may be tending sap sucking pests such as mealybugs as is case with rufous woodpecker in coffee plantations in india woodpeckers can serve as indicator species demonstrating quality of habitat their hole making abilities make their presence in an area an important part of ecosystem because these cavities are used for breeding and roosting by many bird species that are unable to excavate their own holes as well as being used by various mammals and invertebrates spongy bones of woodpecker s skull and flexibility of its beak both of which provide protection for brain when drumming have provided inspiration to engineers a black box needs to survive intact when a plane falls from sky and modelling

of accounts of founding of rome preserved in work known as gentis refers to a legend of a woodpecker bringing food to boys romulus and remus during time they were abandoned in wild thus enabling them to survive and play their part in history status and conservation thumb ivory billed woodpecker is classified as critically endangered by iucn and some authorities believe it may already be extinct in a global survey of risk of extinction faced by various bird families woodpeckers were only bird family to have significantly fewer species at risk than would be expected nevertheless several woodpeckers are under threat as their habitats are destroyed being woodland birds deforestation and clearance of land for agriculture and other purposes can reduce populations dramatically some species adapt to living in plantations and secondary growth or to open countryside with forest remnants and scattered trees but some do not a few species have even flourished when they have adapted to man made habitats there are few conservation projects directed primarily at woodpeckers but they benefit whenever their habitat is conserved red cockaded woodpecker has been focus of much conservation effort in southeastern united states with artificial cavities being constructed in longleaf pines they favour as nesting sites two species of woodpeckers in americas ivory billed woodpecker and imperial woodpecker are classified as critically endangered with some authorities believing them extinct though there have been possible but disputed ongoing sightings of ivory billed woodpeckers in united states and a small population may survive in cuba another critically endangered species is okinawa woodpecker from japan with a single declining population of a few hundred birds it is
