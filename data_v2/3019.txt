differences to previous incarnations kyo s role in printed media and other adaptations of series has often been criticized most notably in live action film a variety of kyo collectibles including key chains and figurines has been created conception and creation origin and influences thumb left early sketches of kyo when he was known as syo kirishima kyo kusanagi was created by artist shinichi morioka when designing characters for first king of fighters game developers wanted a new snazzy hero who would fight against characters from two other snk series fatal fury and art of fighting through most of his development kyo was named and was dressed in martial arts clothing common in fighting games of time his design was inspired by main character of katsuhiro otomo s manga and film akira kaneda late in production his name was changed to kyo kusanagi as a means of relating character to yamata no orochi legend which was basis of story arc of game name syo would later be used for kyo s another striker in king of fighters 2000 another planned name before syo was but no design was elaborated from it while in charge of designing character yuichiro hiraki sought to contrast kyo with street fighter character ryu as he believed latter was a popular character in international markets and that kyo s characterization and design could benefit from appealing to as broad a demographic as possible despite kyo originally being depicted as a lazy young adult he shows a notable character arc across games he develops a new fighting style on his own in king of fighters 2000 when making king of fighters 94 developers thought kyo would appeal to audiences by contrasting starkly with characters from fatal fury whose characters were much older and had more muscular bodies than kyo s kyo s girlfriend yuki was also created by morioka by next game snk introduced iori yagami as kyo s rival in contrast to kyo snk decided to keep iori s life as private as possible in order to differentiate two characters game s developers decided kyo s main abilities would be fire based alongside movesets of other characters in original japan team who were all inspired by manga and anime getter robo created by go nagai and ken ishikawa three members of japan team benimaru nikaido goro daimon and kyo had personalities similar to those of main characters from getter robo kyo was based on main character ryoma who had a fiery persona elements and personalities were also a homage to a japanese phrase about giving birth to fire lightning strikes earth which sparks flame according to morioka ikki s ashita no joe and nagai s devilman manga series were influences too artist nona said he found it difficult to design kyo as a heroic character due to his dark traits noting character was also inspired by akira fudo protagonist of devilman kyo s pixel art was created by hiraki who despite leaving snk to work on another project a few years later was asked by capcom s kaname fujioka to once again work on kyo s design for crossover game capcom vs snk millennium fight 2000 artist falcoon states that kyo has a strong attitude making him one of hardest characters to illustrate while also noting that his rivalry with iori yagami is strong enough to make duo likable development during early stages of development for king of fighters 99 snk planned to exclude kyo and iori from game because its story was centered on new protagonist k but they reversed this decision because they couldn t leave these popular characters in limbo kyo s repeated appearances in every game in series at insistence of snk executives for marketing purposes made story planning for each title challenging with hiroaki expressing a desire for his work to live up to shinkiro s which he said left a great impression on him several of series designers said kyo is one of most difficult characters to illustrate because of his popularity although kyo was redesigned for kof 99 some designers wanted to return to his iconic school uniform near end of production staff could not decide which uniform kyo clone should wear so project head decided to make two clones to save time project head drew designs for kyo 1 and kyo 2 on character roster same situation occurred during production of king of fighters 2002 designers created another clone of kyo called kusanagi to include his school uniform design
