justice league new frontier directed episode title of episode follows education of peter parker scheme greg weisman a developer and producer for spectacular spider man created naming scheme for second story arc of season one refers to economics there was a scene cut from episode after it was written recorded and storyboarded scene featured rhino looking in a phone book for individuals named peter parker in tri state area he storms into a peter james parker kevin michael richardson a blind elderly african american bassoon player accusing him of being peter parker he is looking for man is outraged and asks him do i look like i m a photographer rhino himself is furious as there are several peter parkers in tri state area weisman was upset that it was removed and called it just hilarious weisman and casting director jamie thomason each easily picked out clancy brown for role of rhino weisman explains we knew rhino would require a voice with strength and menace but rhino also isn t brightest bulb on marquee so we knew whoever we cast would also have to have acting chops and comic timing to take character beyond usual dumb goon they each had worked with brown previously and knew he would be able to nail it as he is able to give a tough low voice and turn on a dime between dangerous and comedic characterizations brown sought to reflect rhino s simplistic thinking style in his voice he believes quintessential thug was played by william bendix in glass key simpler character simpler thought process that means rhino s motivation is never too complicated he s very elemental he s mad or happy or angry or sad or hungry or whatever and it never gets beyond his appetites or ego brown considers that bendix s performance perfectly portrayed this type of character release and

fight sequences as well as unveiling of tombstone and mary jane goldman concluded his review by writing it s a testament to this show that it has it exactly right that peter parker s everyday unmasked persona is so integral to story and that i actually am very curious how this dance goes sean elliot of if magazine gave episode a b and wrote that it was a well thought out premise elliot was pleased with portrayal of rhino as an unintelligent brute he also enjoyed change of big man s identity from that of comics where he was a bugle reporter named frederic foswell and found it humorous to have
