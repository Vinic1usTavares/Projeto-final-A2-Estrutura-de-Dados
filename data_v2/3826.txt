large german speaking population within a few years of his arrival he experienced discrimination based on his sexual orientation when he was temporarily committed to a mental institution in 1917 for being homosexual with united states s entry into world war i gerber enlisted in united states army after war he served as a printer and proofreader with allied army of occupation in coblenz germany bullough p 25 from 1920 to 1923 katz 1983 p 554 during his time in germany gerber learned about magnus hirschfeld and work he and his scientific humanitarian committee were doing to reform anti homosexual german law especially paragraph 175 which criminalized sex between men hogan and hudson p 245 gerber traveled to berlin which supported a thriving gay subculture hogan and hudson p 246 on several occasions and subscribed to at least one homophile magazine gerber marveled at development of gay community in berlin and later wrote i had always bitterly felt injustice with which my own american society accused homosexual of immoral acts what could be done about it i thought unlike germany where homosexual was partially organized and where sex legislation was uniform for whole country united states was in a condition of chaos and misunderstanding concerning its sex laws and no one was trying to unravel tangle and bring relief to abused he was particularly impressed with work of a group called bund fur association for human rights and absorbed a number of hirschfeld s ideas including notion that homosexual men were naturally effeminate despite being naturally masculine and disliking company of women and effeminate men bullough p 32 gerber would continue to espouse idea of gay men s effeminacy writing in 1932 homosexual man does not shun women because he wants to flee from reality of normal sex life but because he himself is a woman and his normal sex life is directed to other sex another man collected in blasius and p 220 following his military service gerber returned to united states and went to work for post office in chicago founding society inspired by hirschfeld s work with scientific humanitarian committee gerber resolved to found a similar organization in united states he called his group society for human rights english translation of bund fur bianco p 75 and took on role of secretary gerber filed an application for a charter as a non profit organization with state of illinois on december 10 1924 application outlined goals and purposes of society t o promote and protect interests of people who by reasons of mental and physical abnormalities are abused and hindered in legal pursuit of happiness which is guaranteed them by declaration of independence and to combat public prejudices against them by dissemination of factors according to modern science among intellectuals of mature age society stands only for law and order it is in harmony with any and all general laws insofar as they protect rights of others and does in no manner recommend any acts in violation of present laws nor advocate any manner inimical to public welfare quoted in katz 1976 pp 386 course since sodomy was illegal in every state in 1924 any participation in or advocacy of sex with other men would constitute a recommendation of an act in violation of a present law illinois was first state to repeal its law but did not do so until 1962 hogan and hudson p 634 an african american clergyman named john t graves signed on as president of new organization and gerber graves and five others were listed as directors state granted charter on december 24 1924 making society oldest documented homosexual organization in nation hogan and hudson p 244 despite deliberately keeping goals of society vague and excluding any mention of homosexuality from its mission statement society members were still surprised that no one with state investigated any further before issuing charter society s newsletter friendship and freedom was first gay interest publication in united states however few society members were willing to receive mailings of newsletter fearing that postal inspectors would deem publication obscene under comstock act indeed all gay interest publications were deemed obscene until 1958 when supreme court ruled in one inc v olesen that publishing homosexual content did not mean content was automatically obscene murdoch and price p 47 two issues of friendship and freedom were written and produced entirely by gerber no copies of newsletter are known to exist bianco p 77 gerber formulated a three point strategy for winning what he referred to as homosexual emancipation engage in a series of lectures pointing out attitude of society in relation to their own behavior and especially urging against seduction of adolescents through a publication we would keep homophile world in touch with progress of our efforts through self discipline would win confidence and assistance of legal authorities and legislators in understanding problem that these authorities should be educated on futility and folly of long prison terms for those committing homosexual acts with this strategy gerber anticipated by some three decades strategies that would be adopted by such early homophile organizations as mattachine society one inc and daughters of bilitis each of these organizations organized lectures published nationally distributed magazines and sought legal reforms by exploiting disease model of homosexuality reasoning that homosexuals should not be punished for something over which they had no control bianco pp 136 37 143 loughery p 235 37 gerber set out to expand society s membership beyond original seven but had difficulty interesting anyone other than poorer gays in joining he was also unable to gain any financial support from more affluent members of chicago s gay community gerber sought out support of people in medical professions and sex education advocates and was frustrated when he was unable to secure it because of their fear of ruining their reputations through association with homosexuality contemplating this failure in 1962 gerber stated first difficulty was in rounding up enough members and contributors so work could go forward average homosexual i found was ignorant concerning himself others were fearful still others were frantic or depraved some were blase many homosexuals told me that their search for forbidden fruit was real spice of life with this argument they rejected our aims we wondered how we could accomplish anything with such resistance from our own people katz 1976 p 388 gerber shouldered all of labor and financial obligations for society and for production of friendship and freedom something he was willing to do in service of cause believing it possible he would be remembered as gay abraham lincoln for his effort bianco p 76 society sought affiliation with british society for study of sex psychology but british society declined afraid of being linked with any organization that was specifically for homosexuals katz 1983 p 420 demise gerber and graves decided to limit society membership to gay men and exclude bisexuals unknown to them society s vice president al weininger a man gerber described as an indigent laundry queen was married with two children weininger s wife reported society to a social worker in summer of 1925 loughery p 54 calling them degenerates and making claims of strange doings in front of her children police broke in on gerber in middle of night with a reporter from chicago examiner in tow interrogated him seized his personal papers and arrested him next morning gerber arrived in court to learn that graves weininger and weininger s male companion had also been arrested examiner reported story under headline strange sex cult exposed bullough p 27 paper erroneously reported that weininger and other members of society had performed sex acts in front of weininger s children and that society literature encouraged men to abandon their wives and children this latter statement was in direct contradiction to society s policy of only admitting men who were exclusively homosexual gerber was put through three separate trials before charges against him were finally dismissed because he was arrested without a warrant gerber s defense cost him his life savings bullough p 28 some of which may have been in form of bribes paid through his lawyer loughery p 55 police never returned gerber s personal papers his typewriter or his remaining copies of friendship and freedom despite a court order compelling their return only concrete record of newsletter s existence is a photograph of one issue in a german homophile magazine and a review of issue in a french homophile publication bullough p 26 although gerber avoided prosecution for obscenity under comstock act he lost his post office job for conduct unbecoming a postal worker weininger paid a 10 fine in 2013 dollars for disorderly conduct with gerber feeling he had hit a solid wall of ignorance hypocrisy meanness and corruption quoted in fone p 382 and unable to continue his financial support society dismantled and gerber was left embittered that none of wealthier gays of chicago had come to his aid for a cause he believed was designed to advance common good he left chicago for new york city where he re enlisted
