red capped parrot purpureicephalus spurius is a species of broad tailed parrot native to southwest western australia it was described by heinrich kuhl in 1820 with no subspecies recognised it has long been classified in its own genus owing to its distinctive elongated beak though genetic analysis shows that it lies within lineage of psephotellus parrots and that its closest relative is mulga parrot psephotellus varius not easily confused with other parrot species it has a bright crimson crown green yellow cheeks and a distinctive long bill wings back and long tail are dark green and underparts are purple blue adult female is very similar though sometimes slightly duller than male her key distinguishing feature is a white stripe on wing under surface juveniles are predominantly green found in woodland and open savanna country red capped parrot is predominantly herbivorous consuming seeds particularly of eucalypts as well as flowers and berries but insects are occasionally eaten nesting takes place in tree hollows generally of older large trees although red capped parrot has been shot as a pest and has been affected by land clearing population is growing and species is considered of least concern by international union for conservation of nature iucn it has a reputation of being anxious and difficult to breed in captivity taxonomy red capped parrot was first described in 1820 by german naturalist heinrich kuhl as psittacus spurius from an immature specimen collected in albany western australia on baudin expedition 1801 1803 and housed at national museum of natural history in paris specific epithet spurius is latin adjective meaning illegitimate and refers to markedly different adult and immature plumages hence appearing unrelated irish naturalist nicholas aylward vigors named species platycercus pileatus in 1830 from an adult male specimen that had been acquired by zoological society of london english artist edward lear illustrated live specimen in his 1830 work illustrations of family of or parrots it was placed in monotypic genus purpureicephalus as p pileatus by french biologist charles lucien bonaparte in 1854 generic name is an amalgam of latin purpureus purple and ancient greek kephale head in this generic combination current name is translated as bastard red head species name pileatus was generally used until german naturalist otto finsch followed kuhl in using specific name spurius calling it platycercus spurius in 1868 his countryman anton reichenow classified purpureicephalus as a subgenus of platycercus before placing it in genus later corrected to until 1912 when australian amateur ornithologist gregory mathews re established genus as purpureicephalus red capped parrot s elongated bill and its unusual coloration lack of cheek patches compared with platycercus are main reasons for its placement in its own genus no subspecies are recognised currently mathews tentatively described a subspecies carteri in 1915 from a specimen collected at on basis of darker upperparts and greener cheeks it was not considered distinct by later authors there is no known geographical variation five birds from esperance had smaller bills and tarsi than individuals from elsewhere in its range but sample was too small to draw any conclusions thumb left lear s 1832 illustration red capped parrot is related to other broad tailed parrots but relationships within group had been unclear in 1938 australian ornithologist dominic proposed that it was sole survivor of a lineage of eastern australian origin with no close living relatives in 1955 british evolutionary biologist arthur cain proposed that eastern lineage had vanished after being outcompeted by crimson rosella platycercus elegans and that its closest relative was horned parakeet cornutus of new caledonia which he concluded had adopted a much greener plumage of a wetter climate a 2011 genetic study including nuclear and mitochondrial dna found that red capped parrot was closely related to mulga parrot psephotellus varius two lineages having diverged in miocene combined lineage itself diverging from one giving rise to hooded parrot psephotellus dissimilis and golden shouldered parrot psephotellus red capped parrot has been designated official name by international ornithologists union ioc english ornithologist john gould used name red capped parakeet in 1848 based on vigors scientific name which also inspired old avicultural term pileated parrot it has also been called western king parrot to distinguish it from australian king parrot alisterus scapularis occurring in east purple crowned parrot grey parrot or for distinctive upper mandible name pileated parakeet potentially causes confusion among with south american pileated parrot gould also reported blue parrot as an early colonial name name king parrot has persisted in western australia english naturalist w b alexander commenting that it was always known by this name in a field note in 1917 reiterated this in a 2012 birding guide names in nyungar language spoken by people of southwest region have been recorded at perth rail bur tong and king george sound jul u up stirling range and southwest a recommended orthography and pronunciation list of nyungar names has proposed daryl char rill cha rail bore dang and cha awp description red capped parrot has a long bill and bright clear patterned plumage variously described as magnificent gaudy or coloured measuring in length with a wingspan and weighing adult red capped parrot is a distinctive and easily recognised medium sized parrot adult male has a crimson forehead and crown which extends from gape or base of lower mandible through eye and grey brown lores its hindneck and cheeks are green and its ear coverts are more yellow green in march and april crown feathers and ear coverts of birds with new plumage can have fine black edging feathers of head back and underparts have grey bases that are generally hidden upperparts including wings are dark green rump yellow green and tail is green with a dark blue tip underparts are purplish blue flanks green and red and iris dark brown with a dark grey eye ring bill is pale blue grey with a dark grey tip its upper mandible elongated to a slender hook thumb right adult female showing green spotting of red flanks colouring of female is similar to though slightly duller than that of male red of its plumage is not as intense and its red flanks are spotted with some green and yellow its breast is a more greyish shade of violet than purple in flight it has a whitish stripe visible on underside of wing female birds have white spots on seven or more underwing feathers although a few of both sexes lack spots entirely birds with white spots on fewer than seven wing feathers can be either female or subadult male male has a slightly wider and flatter head noticeable when birds are compared directly with each other as well as longer wings and tail adult moulting takes place in southern hemisphere summer and autumn red capped parrot perches and walks with a distinctive upright posture juveniles have greenish plumage overall before beginning their first moult around august their subsequent plumage much more closely resembles that of adult birds faintly seen markings of adult pattern begin as a dark green crown with a reddish frontal band grey violet of female breast and red underparts mottled green bill is more orange but turns pale blue grey of adult birds by two to five months of age juvenile birds with white spots on ten or fewer feathers on wing undersurface are male while those with more cannot be sexed male subadults often have residual white spots on their wing feathers rapidly repeated contact call has been transcribed as rak or uk while alarm call consists of a series of high pitched loud notes male birds chatter loudly when agitated or marking their nest territory but unlike rosellas not while feeding nestlings and fledglings up to two weeks post leaving nest make a high pitched two syllable food begging call distribution and habitat red capped parrot occurs in southwest australia ecoregion in dense to open forest and woodland and heathland in coastal regions distribution range is south from moore river to coast to esperance records of species extend inland from southern coast as far as gingin and within its range it is sedentary in areas of higher rainfall and locally nomadic in dryer areas red capped parrot mostly occurs within of coastline becoming sparser further inland usual habitat is eucalypt forest or woodlands but its distribution is mostly associated with marri corymbia calophylla this tree species provides a constant food source and has increased in range and population since settlement of europeans parrot can be found in vegetation dominated by other tree species such as jarrah eucalyptus marginata tuart e gomphocephala wandoo e wandoo yate e cornuta and peppermint a seed eating bird it is encountered in farmland orchards and suburban landscapes in perth it also occurs around remnant stands of marri conserved as shade trees on farmland in western wheatbelt and swan coastal plain it can be adversely impacted by land clearing and removal of trees red capped parrot uses large trees to roost in at night and retire to during middle of day it generally avoids blue gum eucalyptus globulus and pine plantations parrot is frequently observed at lake reserves in suburban areas on swan coastal plain within sight of waders charadriiformes occurring at freshwater to brackish wetlands it is common at forrestdale and lakes ramsar site lake and swamp wetland a region rich in avian species it is also found at dryandra woodland another species rich reserve with stands of jarrah and marri over sheoak allocasuarina and dryandra banksia ser dryandra that are known to be favoured red cap parrot is commonly sighted at two peoples bay nature reserve and along roadsides around stirling range and behaviour parrots are found in pairs or small groups of 4 to 6 individuals or occasionally in larger flocks of 20 30 birds rarely a flock of up to 100 birds may be encountered these are generally composed of juveniles birds may associate with australian ringneck parrots zonarius or western rosellas platycercus red capped parrot is shy and often retreats to upper canopy of trees if disturbed which has made study of its breeding and social behaviour difficult hence many aspects of these are poorly known red capped parrot is thought to be monogamous pairs forming long term bonds generally from around 20 months of age younger females have been recorded pairing with older males at 8 or 9 months old but do not appear able to breed at this age male initiates courtship by following female and making a contact call as well as performing a courtship display this involves it raising its crown feathers ruffling its crown and rump feathers lowering its wings to display its rump and raising and flaring its tail feathers female often stoops low and gives out a food begging call these displays begin before a nest site is chosen and continue through breeding season until around two weeks after young have fledged breeding left thumb juvenile in perth australia breeding season is august to december red capped parrot needs mature trees large enough to have hollows in trunk or branches these trees can be on road verges along water courses or in paddocks as well as forest or woodland nests are generally apart and pairs defend them vigorously from other birds particularly other red capped parrots for duration of nesting nest site is a tree hollow generally in an older large tree such as a marri jarrah tuart flooded gum eucalyptus rudis or paperbark melaleuca spp at a height between averaging around above ground and often north or east facing a lower entrance narrow with a larger hollow recorded at was considered exceptional there are often chew marks at entrance which is wide hollow is deep and is lined with wood dust at bottom female incubates her clutch of usually five occasionally six records up to nine milk white eggs size of each almost spherical egg is male attends her from a nearby tree signalling to leave nest for food he has brought information on incubation period is limited but is between 20 and 24 days nestlings are nidicolous they remain in nest initially weighing at birth and gaining on average a day at birth they are covered in white down which is soon replaced by grey down their eyes open by 9 11 days of age and primary quills appear by 9 15 days and primary feathers proper by 14 20 days they are fed by female alone for first two weeks then by both parents they fledge between 30 and 37 days generally all leaving nest on same day parents continue to feed them for another two weeks feeding thumb right adult feeding on grevillea seeds marri seeds are preferred diet but it also extracts seeds from karri eucalyptus diversicolor woody pear grevillea hakea dryandra banksia and sheoak casuarina allocasuarina banksia grandis as well as from grasses herbs or shrubs associated with marri dominated vegetation types beak of this parrot allows more precision to obtain seeds from a eucalypt s capsule tough case of marri is chewed through by ringneck parrot or cleaved by powerful beak of cockatoos species immature fruit of marri is also consumed a grass species wild oats avena and acacia are grazed for green seed records of feeding on acacia seed pods include acacia a a and a which occur in its range and stripping pods for small seed of cultivated acacia nectar filled blooms of kangaroo paws anigozanthos sp are also sought out although unlike honeyeater and spinebill their weight breaks long stalk when feeding any viable seed that is consumed may be undigested and dispersed although red capped parrot eats fewer introduced plant species than other parrots it does eat seeds of slender thistle sheep thistle c and variegated thistle silybum marianum species has also adapted to exploit introduction of orchard fruit such as apples and pears and gardens of suburban areas red capped parrot bites predominantly red skinned apples attempting to retrieve seed from inside it does not eat flesh but instead squeezes it to drink juice fruit of other cultivated introductions are also selected including almond olive peaches plums pomegranates and white cedar melia insects such as psyllids also form part of their diet insect larvae and lerp are also consumed particularly in late winter and spring during its breeding season red capped parrot primarily feeds on ground clasping capsule of eucalypts or cones of sheoak with one foot and extracting seed with their slender hooked beak dexterity it exhibits using its foot and beak to dislodge seeds is also shown by long billed black cockatoo calyptorhynchus two occur in same habitat both specialising in extracting marri s store of large seeds both species prise marri seeds out of their woody capsule by manipulating it with foot and lower mandible and inserting point of upper mandible at openings in seed dispersing valve marks left by lower mandible on marri s nut distinguish it from those fed on by other parrots and cockatoos red capped parrot leaves shallow marks around opening of capsule with little damage to husk species mainly feeds and manipulates objects with its left foot limited sampling of australian parrot species indicates that laterality is associated with larger size and many of these are left footed though two other broad tailed parrot species crimson rosella and australian ringneck are right footed and smaller species show no preference parasites and diseases a parasitic protozoan eimeria was isolated and described from a diseased bird in 2016 it is an intracellular parasite that lives in host s gastrointestinal system species of bird louse recorded on red capped parrot include forficuloecus and a member of genus beak and feather disease virus was isolated and sequenced from a fledgling in 2016 conservation due to damage to orchard crops these birds have been classified and shot as pests although 1985 fieldwork in orchards around showed that damage they inflicted was insignificant local government acts in agricultural districts of collie and west arthur proclaimed them vermin in 1943 despite this its population is growing possibly due to existing areas being degraded to a more favourable habitat on account of this and its large range it is considered to be a least concern species by international union for conservation of nature iucn though it has declined in shires north of perth as marri forests have vanished with urban development like most species of parrots red capped parrot is protected by convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora cites with its placement on appendix ii list of vulnerable species which makes import export and trade of listed wild caught animals illegal aviculture its attractive colours make red capped parrot a desirable species to keep although it has a reputation for being anxious in captivity and difficult to breed this may be because of historically high proportion of wild caught birds entering aviculture first record of successful reproduction in captivity was in england almost simultaneously by two aviculturalists in 1909 slightly earlier hatching of one brood saw mr astley awarded a medal by nation s avicultural society references cited texts red capped parrot category
