battle of masan was an engagement between united nations command un and north korean forces which took place early in korean war between august 5 and september 19 1950 in vicinity of masan and naktong river in south korea it was part of battle of pusan perimeter and was one of several large engagements fought simultaneously battle ended in a victory for un after large numbers of us army us and republic of korea army rok troops were able to repel repeated attacks of two north korean korean people s army kpa divisions operating as extreme southern flank of pusan perimeter us 25th infantry division placed its regiments around south korean city of masan with 24th infantry regiment and 5th regimental combat team based in haman and nearby sobuk san and 35th infantry regiment based along nam river to west of city throughout six week battle kpa 6th and 7th divisions attacked 25th division s regiments in an attempt to break through un forces and attack pusan an initial un counteroffensive out of masan proved ineffective in stopping kpa from advancing in subsequent fight 35th infantry was able to repel kpa at battle of nam river and were highly regarded for these actions however 24th infantry performed very poorly at battles of blue mountain and haman forcing 25th division to muster reserves to counter kpa gains against 24th background outbreak of war following 25 june 1950 invasion of south korea by north korea united nations decided to commit troops to conflict on behalf of south korea united states subsequently committed ground forces to korean peninsula with goal of fighting back kpa invasion and preventing south korea from collapsing however us forces in far east had been steadily decreasing since end of world war ii five years earlier and at time closest forces were 24th infantry division headquartered in japan division was understrength and most of its equipment was antiquated due to reductions in military spending regardless 24th division was ordered to south korea thumb left alt a city square filled with soldiers and civilians smoke is in sky in background behind a large building us forces retreat during battle of taejon 24th infantry division was first us unit sent into korea with mission to take initial shock of kpa advances delaying much larger kpa units to buy time to allow reinforcements to arrive division was alone for several weeks as it attempted to delay kpa making time for 1st cavalry and 7th and 25th infantry divisions along with other eighth united states army supporting units to move into position advance elements of 24th infantry division were badly defeated in battle of osan on july 5 first encounter with kpa forces for first month after that defeat 24th infantry division was repeatedly defeated and forced south by superior kpa numbers and equipment in engagements around chochiwon chonan and pyongtaek division made a final stand in battle of taejon where it was nearly destroyed but delayed kpa forces until july 20 by that time eighth army s force of combat troops were roughly equal to kpa forces attacking region with new un units arriving every day north korean advance with taejon captured kpa forces began surrounding pusan perimeter in an attempt to envelop it kpa 4th and 6th infantry divisions advanced south in a wide flanking maneuver two divisions attempted to envelop un s left flank but became extremely spread out in process they advanced on un positions with armor and superior numbers repeatedly pushing back un forces us forces finally halted kpa advance in a series of engagements in southern section of country forces of 3rd battalion 29th infantry regiment newly arrived in country were wiped out at hadong in a coordinated ambush by kpa forces on july 27 opening a pass to pusan area soon after kpa forces took chinju to west pushing back us 19th infantry regiment and leaving routes to pusan open for more kpa attacks us formations were subsequently able to defeat and push back kpa on flank in battle of notch on august 2 suffering mounting losses kpa force in west withdrew for several days to re equip and receive reinforcements this granted both sides a reprieve to prepare for attack on pusan perimeter battle thumb 300px alt a topographic map of several large battles us and kpa movements around masan during battle of pusan perimeter task force kean lieutenant general walton walker and eighth army began preparing a counteroffensive first conducted by un in war for august it would kick off with an attack by us reserve units in masan area to secure chinju from kpa 6th division followed by a larger general push to kum river in middle of month one of his goals was to break up a suspected massing of kpa troops near taegu area by forcing diversion of some kpa units southward on august 6 eighth army issued operational directive for attack by task force kean named for us 25th infantry division commander major general william b kean task force kean consisted of 25th division less 27th infantry regiment and a field artillery battalion with 5th regimental combat team 5th rct and 1st provisional marine brigade attached together this represented a force of about 20 000 men plan of attack required force to move west from positions held near masan seize chinju pass and secure line as far as nam river however offensive relied on

force surged forward to pansong inflicting another 350 casualties on kpa there they overran kpa 6th division s headquarters however rest of task force was slowed by kpa resistance task force kean pressed on chindong ni area resulting in a confused battle where fragmented force had to rely on air strikes and airdrops to keep it effective task force kean s offensive had collided with one being delivered simultaneously by kpa 6th division heavy fighting continued in area for three days by august 9 task force kean was poised to retake chinju task force aided by air power initially advanced quickly though kpa resistance was heavy on august 10 marines picked up advance inadvertently discovering kpa 83rd motorized regiment of 105th armored division f4u corsairs from 1st marine air wing strafed retreating column repeatedly inflicting 200 casualties and destroying about 100 of regiment s equipment vehicles however 1st provisional marine brigade elements were withdrawn from force on august 12 to be redeployed elsewhere on perimeter task force kean continued forward supported by naval and field artillery capturing area around chondong ni however eighth army requested several of its units to redeploy to taegu to be used elsewhere on front particularly at naktong bulge an attempt to move 25th infantry division s division trains through valley became mired in mud through night of august 10 11 and was attacked in morning by kpa who had driven american forces from high ground in confusion kpa armor was able to penetrate roadblocks and assault supporting artillery positions surprise attack was successful in wiping out most of 555th and 90th field artillery battalions with much of their equipment both kpa and us armor swarmed to scene and us marine aviation continued to provide air cover but neither side was able to make appreciable gains despite inflicting heavy casualties on one another us forces were unsuccessful in retaking positions where artillery was overrun suffering numerous casualties in several failed attempts to do so upon later inspection bodies of 75 men 55 from 555th field artillery and 20 from 90th field artillery were found executed when area again came under american control in what was later known as bloody gulch massacre task force kean was forced to withdraw back to masan unable to hold its gains and by august 14 it was approximately in same positions it had been in when it started offensive task force kean had failed in its objective of diverting north korean troops from north and also failed in its objective of reaching chinju pass however offensive is noted to have significantly increased morale among troops of 25th infantry division which performed extremely well in subsequent engagements kpa 6th division had been reduced to 3 000 4 000 and had to replenish its ranks with south korean conscripts from andong fighting in region continued for rest of month un battle lines walker then ordered us 25th infantry division

and us artillery emplaced in komam ni area could interdict road junction at chungam ni us 35th infantry regiment set up positions at sibidang komam ni in northern part of 25th infantry division defense line 35th regiment line extended from a point west of komam ni to nam river and then turned east along that stream to its confluence with naktong river it was a long regimental line about twice length a regiment was typically assigned 1st battalion 35th infantry held regiment s left flank west of komam ni while 2nd battalion held right along nam river 3rd battalion redesignated from 1st battalion 29th infantry regiment was in reserve on road south of chirwon from where it could move quickly to any part of line to south was us 24th infantry regiment and west of chindong ni 5th regimental combat team was on division s left flank on division orders 5th regimental combat team first held ground above chindong ni coastal road only as far as san kean soon decided however that 5th rct should close gap northward between it and 24th infantry when 5th rct sent a unit of 100 men under american officers to higher slope of sobuk san kpa troops already there drove them back kean then ordered 5th rct to take this ground but it was too late north korean consolidation meanwhile kpa 6th division was ordered to await reinforcements before continuing attack from north to south division had its 13th 15th and 14th regiments first replacements arrived at chinju on about august 12 approximately 2 000 unarmed south koreans conscripted in seoul area joined division by august 15 at chinju 6th division issued them grenades and told recruits they would have to pick up weapons from killed and wounded on battlefield another group of 2 500 replacements conscripted in seoul area joined 6th division on august 21 bringing division strength to approximately 8 500 men in last week of august and first week of september 3 000 more recruits conscripted in southwest korea joined division 6th division used this last body of recruits in labor details at first and only later employed them as combat troops south korean conscripts were often forcibly taken from their homes by kpa troops and typically had very poor morale north koreans realized they presented a weakness in lines but were unable to acquire men using other means kpa placed rearguard troops behind conscripts formations who would threaten to shoot them if they attempted to defect desert or surrender their positions as a part of kpa build up in south untried kpa 7th division also arrived near masan with another 10 000 men 7th division occupied key ports to protect 6th division against possible amphibious landings in its rear eventually though division was committed to combat in conjunction with other kpa units simultaneous attacks were hoped to overwhelm un lines north korean advance on august 17 kpa resumed their attack a battalion of kpa troops drove south korean national police out of t ongyong but did not hold it long un naval forces heavily shelled t ongyong as three companies of south korean marines from koje island made an amphibious landing near town rok force then attacked kpa and supported by naval gun fire drove them out kpa at t ongyong lost about 350 men survivors withdrew to chinju reinforced kpa had advanced on 25th infantry division defensive line and had begun a series of probing attacks that were to continue throughout month sometimes of battalion strength most of these attacks came in high mountains west of haman in battle mountain p il bong and sobuk san area there 6th

illuminating flares were also in short supply and reserve stocks had deteriorated to such a degree that only about 20 percent of supply issued to regiment was effective even when employed time lapse

battle c company 35th infantry and a company 29th infantry moved up astride komam ni road during morning of august 20 to bolster a and b companies on sibidang a large concentration of kpa advanced to renew attack us troops directed artillery fire on this force and called in an air strike observers estimated that artillery fire and air strike killed about 350 kpa troops half attack group kpa made another try on same position morning of august 22 kpa infantry started a very heavy attack against 1st battalion employing no artillery or mortar preparatory fires force cut barbed wire at perimeter and attacked at close quarters with small arms and grenades this assault engaged three american companies and drove one of them from its position after three hours of fighting a company

threats and physical force to get others back into position a in line north of p il bong existed in 24th infantry lines at close of day and an unknown number of kpa were moving into it on august 20 kpa 6th division intensified its efforts to attack battle mountain and began sending stronger attacks to capture two peaks in face of these all of c company except company commander and about 25 men abandoned their position on battle mountain upon reaching bottom of mountain those who had fled reported erroneously that company commander had been killed and their position surrounded then overrun by kpa on basis of this misinformation american artillery and mortars fired concentrations on c company s former position and fighter bombers in 38 sorties attacked crest of battle mountain using napalm fragmentation bombs rockets and machine guns this action forced company commander and his remaining 25 men off battle mountain after they had held it for 20 hours having declined a call to surrender from kpa a platoon of e company except for about 10 men also left its position on mountain as soon as attack progressed on regimental left an rok patrol from k company s position on sobuk

place both african american and white officers infuriated by disobedience wrote sworn statements implicating deserters situation was so severe that those who stayed in their positions were often given bronze star medals with valor devices because they were so far outnumbered in fighting battle mountain changed hands so often during august that there is no agreement on exact number of times intelligence sergeant of 1st battalion 24th infantry estimated peak changed hands 19 times from august 18 to end of month kpa troops attacked mountain every night peak often changed hands two or three times in a 24 hour period usual pattern was for kpa to take it at night and us 24th infantry to recapture it next day this type of fluctuating battle resulted in relatively high losses among artillery forward observers and their equipment during period of august 15 31 seven forward observers and eight other members of observer and liaison section of 159th field artillery battalion were casualties and they lost eight radios 11 telephones and two vehicles in process 24th infantry consistently captured battle mountain in same way artillery mortar and tank fire raked crest and air strikes

bridges and they were repaired overnight eighth army intelligence credited kpa with having moved one or two new divisions and about 20 tanks to hyopch on area on west side of naktong river opposite us 2nd division however us intelligence overestimated strength of these divisions on august 28 eighth army intelligence officer warned that a general offensive may be expected at any time along 2nd

overran 2nd battalion command post killing several men there and destroying much of battalion s equipment with 2nd battalion broken haman was open to direct attack as kpa encircled haman roberts 2nd battalion commander ordered an officer to take remnants of battalion and establish a roadblock at south edge of town although officer directed a large group of men to accompany him only eight did so 2nd battalion was no longer an effective fighting force pockets of its soldiers remained in place and fought fiercely but majority fled upon attack and kpa were able to move around uneven resistance they surrounded haman as 2nd battalion crumbled in disarray when kpa attack broke through 2nd battalion 1st battalion commander ordered his unit which was about south of haman on chindong ni road to counterattack and restore line roberts assembled all 40 men of disorganized 2nd battalion he could find to join in this counterattack which got under way at 07 30 upon contact with kpa 1st battalion

next week battalions companies and platoons cut off and isolated fought independently of higher control and help except for airdrops which supplied many of them airdrops also supplied relief forces trying to reach front line units tanks and armored cars drove to isolated units with supplies of food and ammunition and carried back critically wounded on return trips in general 35th infantry fought in its original battle line positions while at first one battalion and later two battalions of 27th infantry fought toward it through estimated 3 000 kpa operating in its rear areas although 25th division generally was under much less pressure after september 5 there were still severe local attacks heavy rains caused nam and naktong rivers to rise on september 8 and 9 reducing danger of new crossings however kpa attacks against 2nd battalion 35th infantry occurred nightly approaches to namji ri bridge one of their key targets to protect were mined at one time there were about 100 kpa dead lying in that area from september 9 to 16 there were limited attacks on 35th infantry s front but most of kpa momentum had been broken and they could not muster strong attacks against regiment again evacuation of masan civilians in masan posed an unexpectedly dangerous problem for un forces town had a large community of communist sympathizers and agents at peak of kpa offensive han gum jo manager of masan branch of korean press association confessed that he was chief of south korean labor party in masan and that he had been funneling information to kpa through a pusan headquarters additionally chief of masan prison guards was found to be head of a communist cell that included seven of his subordinates this and other counterintelligence information came to light at a time when most intense fighting was in progress only a few miles away kean considered situation so dangerous that he ordered masan evacuated of all people except police public officials railroad and utility

strongpoints existed on heights of battle mountain p il bong and sobuk san kean felt that division could advance along roads toward chinju only when mountainous center of division front was clear he therefore believed that key to advance of 25th division lay in its center where kpa held heights and kept 24th infantry regiment under daily attack 27th infantry on left and 35th infantry on right astride roads between chinju and masan held their positions and could not advance until situation in front of 24th infantry improved on september 19 un discovered kpa had abandoned battle mountain
