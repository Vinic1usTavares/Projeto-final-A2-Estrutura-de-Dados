requested a survey to be conducted to determine a feasible route to staunton by way of charlottesville ultimately this route which passed over mountains at rockfish gap was chosen as a better alternative than original plan to cross at swift run gap to north in 1847 charter was modified by assembly to provide for railroad s construction to eastern base of blue ridge virginia general

virginia general assembly in 1848 authorized extension of louisa railroad easterly through hanover and henrico counties to reach richmond this act was protested by rf p for violating earlier decree of assembly against a parallel competitor rf p s claim was originally overturned by a virginia state court which ruled that assembly retained right to authorize construction of other railroads between richmond and fredericksburg and that original charter of rf p only applied to transportation of passengers decision of court was appealed and eventually reached u s supreme court in richmond
