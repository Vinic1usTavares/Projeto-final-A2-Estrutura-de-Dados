cape lobster homarinus capensis is a species of small lobster that lives off coast of south africa from dassen island to haga haga only a few dozen specimens are known mostly regurgitated by reef dwelling fish it lives in rocky reefs and is thought to lay large eggs that have a short larval phase or that hatch directly as a juvenile species grows to a total length of and resembles a small european or american lobster it was previously included in same genus homarus although it is not very closely related to those species and is now considered to form a separate monotypic genus homarinus its closest relatives are genera thymops and thymopides distribution and ecology cape lobster is endemic to south africa it occurs from dassen island western cape in west to haga haga eastern cape in east a range of most of known specimens were regurgitated by fish caught on reefs at depths of this suggests that cape lobster inhabits rocky substrates and may explain its apparent rarity since such areas are not amenable to dredging or trawling and species may be too small to be retained by lobster traps description homarinus capensis is considerably smaller than large northern lobsters of atlantic ocean homarus gammarus european lobster and homarus americanus american lobster at total length or carapace length accounts of colouration of h capensis are very variable from tawny red or yellow to a rather dark olive similar to homarus gammarus homarinus and homarus are considered to be most plesiomorphic genera in family nonetheless cape lobster differs from homarus in a number of characters rostrum of cape lobster is flattened while that of homarus is rounded in section and curves upwards at tip three pairs of claws are covered with hairs in homarinus while those of homarus are hairless telson tapers along its length in homarus but has sides which are nearly parallel in homarinus although no egg bearing females have been collected gonopores openings of oviducts of female cape lobsters are much larger than those of homarus gammarus and homarus americanus this is thought to indicate that homarinus bears fewer larger eggs than homarus and that either larvae develop quickly into juveniles after hatching or that eggs hatch directly into juveniles taxonomy and evolution cape lobsters are elusive and rare with only fourteen specimens having been collected between 1792 date of its first description and 1992 these include five males in collections of south african museum cape town two in natural history museum london one in each of east london museum leiden and albany museum grahamstown and one male and one female in paris in 1992 a cape lobster was discovered at dassen island and publicity find generated resulted in more than 20 additional specimens being reported cape lobster was first described by johann friedrich wilhelm herbst in 1792 as cancer astacus capensis it was independently described in 1793 by johan christian fabricius as astacus flavus possibly based on same type specimen when friedrich weber erected genus homarus in 1795 he included fabricius species in it but this placement was not followed by later authors species reached its current classification in 1995 when monotypic genus homarinus was erected by irv kornfield austin b williams and robert s while analyses of morphology suggest a close relationship between homarinus and homarus molecular analyses using mitochondrial dna reveal that they are not sister taxa both genera lack ornamentation such as spines and carinae but are thought to have reached that state independently through convergent evolution closest living relative of homarus is nephrops norvegicus while closest relatives of homarinus are thymops and thymopides notes references external links category true lobsters category endemic crustaceans of south africa category crustaceans described in 1792
