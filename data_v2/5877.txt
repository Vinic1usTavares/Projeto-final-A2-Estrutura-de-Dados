one of oldest and largest palaces in crimea and is one of most popular tourist attractions on crimea s southern coast palace was built between 1828 and 1848 for russian prince mikhail semyonovich vorontsov for use as his personal summer residence at a cost of 9 million silver rubles it was designed in a loose interpretation of english renaissance revival style by english architect edward blore and his assistant william hunt building is a hybrid of several architectural styles but faithful to none among those styles are elements of scottish baronial indo saracenic revival architecture brett p and gothic revival architecture blore had designed many buildings in united kingdom and was later particularly well known there for completing design of buckingham palace in london once completed palace was visited by many members of russian empire s elite ruling class a great number of these vastly wealthy nobles were so taken with palace and its seaboard site that they were moved to create their own summer retreats in crimea by early 20th century not only many aristocrats but also members of imperial family including tsar himself had palaces in an assortment of architectural styles in vicinity an important feature of vorontsov palace is adjoining park ensemble which features of greenery and forestry arranged by german landscape gardener carolus keebach today vorontsov palace is a part of alupka palace park complex a national historical preserve including massandra palace in neighbouring massandra owing to its status as an important local tourist attraction and architectural monument vorontsov palace and its surrounding park complex were frequently featured in ukrainian and soviet cinema productions such as an ordinary miracle 1964 1976 crazy day or marriage of figaro

palladian residences in novorossiya primarily in odessa in period following napoleonic wars new city of odessa emerged as russia s southern capital with a vibrant cosmopolitan society centred on a handful of russian aristocrats and polish women such as zofia potocka and karolina rzewuska according to viceroy s court in odessa looked like a small capital of an imperial furst while many neoclassical buildings appeared in odessa crimea or as it was then better known was still perceived as a wild exotic hinterland mid 1820s saw appearance of highly popular romantic works celebrating its rugged beauty such as alexander pushkin s poem fountain of and adam mickiewicz s crimean sonnets both poets were fascinated with lord byron s oriental romances and pictured crimea as an exotic land of tartar muslim traditions which had flourished in khanate of crimea until its demise in 1783 mikhail vorontsov was appointed viceroy of novorossiya in may 1823 even before their arrival in odessa vorontsovs started buying up lands in southwest of crimea which was sparsely populated and little known at time alupka was bought in 1824 from colonel owner of livadia and oreanda e i v xix

vorontsov 1782 1856 commissioned palace for use as his own summer residence vorontsov palace was commissioned as a summer residence for governor general of novorossiya prince mikhail semyonovich vorontsov born 1782 died 1856 prince was a dedicated anglophile his father semyon vorontsov had been catherine great s ambassador to england and prince had been educated in london his sister catherine had married an english aristocrat and become chatelaine of one of england s grandest country houses wilton house on accession of paul i in 1796 semyon vorontsov fell from favour and his estates confiscated and not returned until 1801 after accession of alexander 1 it is therefore unsurprising that he chose to reside with his daughter in england until his death and that mikhail vorontsov was a frequent visitor to that country vorontsov had been purchasing land from local tartars for site of his new palace at alupka from 1823 however acquisition had been part of a deal which necessitated vorontsov to build a new mosque part of site had already been planted with fine trees in 1787 for prince potemkin by english landscape gardener william gould as part of potemkin s improvements to area in perpetration of a visitation by catherine great following potemkin s bloodless annexation of crimea to russia on acquiring ownership of site vorontsov immediately employed german gardener karl to further improve site and layout grounds and gardens for proposed new palace thumb right 350px thomas harrison s abandoned classical design for garden facade centred on an exedra this feature was to be retained in new plan in 1824 architect philip elson was commissioned to build a small house for vorontsov family to inhabit while new palace was under construction now much altered in form and known as asiatic pavilion this building still stands originally prince wanted a strictly classical design and plans for such a design were executed in chester by architect thomas harrison and modified on site by odessa architect francesco boffo two architects had previously worked together on design for vorontsov s official residence in odessa harrison s plans for he palace at alupka show a classical villa on site of present palace s corps de logis with bedroom floors below on what are now lower terraces of present palace on garden front facing sea plans show a large double height classical exedra vorontsov must have approved of this concept as it was only feature albeit transformed to an islamic style to be incorporated from harrison s plans into new plans construction began in 1828 however it was suspended in june 1831 before building has risen from its foundations this may have been because principal architect harrison had died previous year and boffo working alone may not have been an option his alterations to harrison s plans for governor s residence in odessa had been unfavourably received change of plan vorontsov had traveled widely in england and had doubtless seen newly emerging but retrospective style of architecture a hybrid revival styles based on english buildings of late 16th and early 17th centuries which in turn had been influenced by english renaissance style which had belatedly evolved from italian renaissance style of a century earlier vorontsov decided to review design in order to incorporate these new trends from western european architecture this major change from a classical design to a far more complex revival style little known in russia meant vorontsov had to find an alternative architect to execute a new design this was further complicated by vorontsov s desire to not only have a loose jacobean style but also to incorporate motifs from islamic architecture so as to highlight oriental strain evident in khan s palace fort and other local tatar architecture resulting design was to highlight crimea s position as a place where east and west meet it was a radical departure from neoclassical strain that dominated russian architecture of period as a result of expansion of british empire a similar approach was also gaining popularity in britain an anglicised interpretation of islamic architecture is exemplified by brighton royal pavilion completed in 1823 and house completed a few years earlier both these buildings drew heavily on islamic motifs which were later to be evident at vorontsov palace and were new and novel designs at time of prince s visit to england vorontsov decided upon british architect edward blore to redesign and complete building blore was a curious choice of architect though able his work has often been often considered bland and uninspired eminent architectural historian howard colvin claimed that a dull competence pervaded all his work while country house architectural expert mark girouard has described blore as a bit of a bore colvin p51 however blore s stolid and conventional designs were admired by english tory aristocracy a class to which vorontsov s sister belonged and for whom blore had worked at wilton anglophile vorontsov was also a great admirer and friend of sir walter scott for whom blore had worked at great scottish baronial country house abbotsford therefore it seems likely that these latter connections led vorontsov to blore blore had already worked on many grand british buildings and a couple of buildings in colonial australia blore himself did not visit town of alupka however he was well informed about area s mountainous landscape and terrain construction restarted in 1830 under supervision of blore s fellow architect william hunt architecture blore s new plan for corps de logis of house was constrained by vorontsov s wish to use footings and foundations which had been built for harrison s original design this severely restricted shape size and layout of palaces principal rooms however rather than erect a compact and low classical villa as harrison had designed blore s plan was radically different with strong english tudor renaissance features on northern side and an eclectic medley of western and islamic features on southern central bay of southern facade was inspired by delhi s masjid mosque which enabled classical exedra of harrison s design to be incorporated once given an islamic makeover harmoniously into design in places seemingly at odds architectural styles can be viewed simultaneously this is particularly so in chimney stacks which resemble islamic minarets these coupled with castellated parapets add what appears to be an almost moorish element to late english renaissance air of northern facade however it is southern garden facade which displays strongest of building s islamic influences it has a flat roof and is topped by two minaret style towers at its centre these minarets flank massive central bay this takes form of a projecting double height porch entered through a high islamic horseshoe arch interior of porch takes form of an exedra which is really an elaborately decorated open vestibule it has an inscribed shahada stating there is no god but allah in arabic porch is flanked by two short wings each of two bays and adorned with cast iron balconies and verandahs overlooking over terraces and their statuary while designs for corps de logis were confined by foundations of harrison s earlier plan secondary wings and precincts were not abandoning completely harrisons concept of bedrooms set in terraces beneath corp de logis blore s assistant architect hunt opted for typical vast sprawling wings and servants quarters of 19th century english country house these took full advantage of gradients and topography of site and with their courtyards came to resemble a small medieval fortified town of towers and high castellated walls nowhere is this more evident than shuvalov passage an enclosed carriage drive squeezed between high walls of two wings leading from castellated western gatehouse to forecourt before northern facade brett passage which twists and turn beneath high wall and towers and even passes under a bridge resembles street of a medieval town rather than approach to a country house thumb 300px right north forecourt accessed from shuvalov passage which emerges from arch serves as a cour d honneur to corps de logis to left to right can be part of vast service wings and stables construction vorontsov imported thousands of his serfs from moscow vladimir and voronezh governorates of russian empire to construct palace these unpaid workers performed all labour by hand aided only by primitive hand tools masons were also brought in to help with construction palace s ashlar blocks were made from a local greenish gray tinge diabase chosen for its unique colour to match colours of surrounding mountainous landscape and forest greenery all other building materials were imported from outside empire one of first of palace s many rooms to be completed was main dining room built from 1830 to 1834 principal central wing of mansion was constructed from 1831 to 1837 between 1841 and 1842 a billiard room was constructed adjoining dining room from 1838 through to 1844 guest wing east wing towers service wing and front entrance were completed final wing built of mansion was library wing this was under construction from 1842 to 1844 remaining four years of building works were spent on palace s interior decoration william hunt onsite architect employed to oversee blore s design while remaining faithful to blore s overall plans was not afraid to alter them most notably western gatehouse main approach to palace was intended to have octagonal towers but hunt redesigned gatehouse in an english 14th century castle style with solid round towers and machicolations nearly identical to towers at bodiam castle east sussex after completion of palace hunt remained at alupka working on an assortment of projects in and around estate building long carriage drives roads and structural improvements to gardens surrounding palace one of his largest projects was an extension to palace itself shuvalov wing which was to be summer retreat of vorontsov s daughter countess sofia shuvalova and her children countess was estranged from her husband this wing linked palace to western gatehouse and created enclosed shuvalov passage leading to main entrance hunt remained in prince s employ until his retirement in 1852 interior palace consists of a total of 150 rooms principal of which are panelled with wood block floors inside corps de logis it had been blore s intention to follow english 19th century tradition of distinct masculine and feminine suites of reception rooms with a library dining rooms and billiard room ensuite to left of central hall for men and a massive drawing room to right for women this layout of gender designated zones had become popular in victorian england however its intention was not to segregate sexes but more to define furnishings male zones tended to have heavy oak furniture and dark turkey carpets whereas female zones would have more delicate furnishings of rosewood carpets and chintz soft furnishings girouard life in english country house p292 however for unknown reasons this concept was never executed and female part of house was extended into male territory with intended billiard room becoming countess s boudoir while study became a further small sitting room for feminine use above these seaward facing rooms were family bedrooms following female claim to principal rooms of corps de logis library and dining room were relocated to a secondary wing not built until much later this secondary wing is linked to west of corps de logis by a large arcaded loggia originally open it is now glazed and known as winter garden a later secondary wing known as shuvalov wing named after vorontsov s son in law count shuvalov was not part of blore s original plan and designed by his assistant william hunt there is now a museum comprising several rooms most notable of which are blue room chintz room dining room and chinese cabinet museum covers first floor s first eight rooms featuring more than 11 000 exhibits including engravings of 18th century
