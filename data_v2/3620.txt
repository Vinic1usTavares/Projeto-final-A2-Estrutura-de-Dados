krajina being provided by yugoslav people s army jna inability of croatian police to cope with situation led to establishment of croatian national guard zng in may 1991 however development of zng into a military force was hampered by a un arms embargo introduced in september while military conflict in croatia continued to escalate battle of vukovar started on 26 august prelude an already tense situation in lika region following 1 april plitvice lakes incident when first fatalities of croatian war of independence occurred deteriorated further in june when croatia reaffirmed its sovereignty
