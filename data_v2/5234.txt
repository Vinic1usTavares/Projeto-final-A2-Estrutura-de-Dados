thumb a pythagorean tiling thumb street musicians at doorway of a house jacob ochtervelt 1665 as observed by nelsen floor tiles in this painting are set in pythagorean tiling a pythagorean tiling or two squares tessellation is a tiling of a euclidean plane by squares of two different sizes in which each square touches four squares of other size on its four sides many proofs of pythagorean theorem are based on it explaining its name it is commonly used as a pattern for floor tiles when used for this it is also known as a hopscotch pattern or pinwheel pattern a schematic diagram illustrating this floor tile pattern appears earlier on p 42 but it should not be confused with mathematical pinwheel tiling an unrelated pattern this tiling has four way rotational symmetry around each of its squares when ratio of side lengths of two squares is an irrational number such as golden ratio its cross sections form aperiodic sequences with a similar recursive structure to fibonacci word generalizations of this tiling to three dimensions have also been studied topology and symmetry pythagorean tiling is unique tiling by squares of two different sizes that is both unilateral no two squares have a common side and equitransitive each two squares of same size can be mapped into each other by a symmetry of tiling topologically pythagorean tiling has same structure as truncated square tiling by squares and regular octagons smaller squares in pythagorean tiling are adjacent to four larger tiles as are squares in truncated square tiling while larger squares in pythagorean tiling are adjacent to eight neighbors that alternate between large and small just as octagons in truncated square tiling however two tilings have different sets of symmetries because truncated square tiling is symmetric under mirror reflections whereas pythagorean tiling isn t mathematically this can be explained by saying that truncated square tiling has dihedral symmetry around center of each tile while pythagorean tiling has a smaller cyclic set of symmetries around corresponding points giving it p4 symmetry p 42 it is a chiral pattern meaning that it is impossible to it on top of its mirror image using only translations and rotations a uniform tiling is a tiling in which each tile is a regular polygon and in which every vertex can be mapped to every other vertex by a symmetry of tiling usually uniform tilings additionally are required to have tiles that meet edge to edge but if this requirement is relaxed then there are eight additional uniform tilings four are formed from infinite strips of squares or equilateral triangles and three are formed from equilateral triangles and regular hexagons remaining one is pythagorean tiling pp 73 74 pythagorean theorem and dissections thumb upright 1 5 left five piece dissections used in proofs by al nayrizi and thabit ibn qurra left and by henry perigal right this tiling is called pythagorean tiling because it has been used as basis of proofs of pythagorean theorem by ninth century islamic mathematicians al nayrizi and thabit ibn qurra and by 19th century british amateur mathematician henry perigal reprinted in see also p 94 if sides of two squares forming tiling are numbers a and b then closest distance between corresponding points on congruent squares is c where c is length of hypotenuse of a right triangle having sides a and b for instance in illustration to left two squares in pythagorean tiling have side lengths 5 and 12 units long and side length of tiles in overlaying square tiling is 13 based on pythagorean triple 5 12 13 by overlaying a square grid of side length c onto pythagorean tiling it may be used to generate a five piece dissection of two unequal squares of sides a and b into a single square of side c showing that two smaller squares have same area as larger one similarly overlaying two pythagorean tilings may be used to generate a six piece dissection of two unequal squares into a different two unequal squares aperiodic cross sections thumb upright 1 25 an aperiodic sequence generated from tilings by two squares whose side lengths form golden ratio although pythagorean tiling is itself periodic it has a square lattice of translational symmetries its cross sections can be used to generate one dimensional aperiodic sequences in klotz construction for aperiodic sequences klotz is a german word for a block one forms a pythagorean tiling with two squares whose sizes are chosen to make ratio between two side lengths be an irrational number x then one chooses a line parallel to sides of squares and forms a sequence of binary values from sizes of squares crossed by line a 0 corresponds to a crossing of a large square and a 1 corresponds to a crossing of a small square in this sequence relative proportion of 0s and 1s will be in ratio x 1 this proportion cannot be achieved by a periodic sequence of 0s and 1s because it is irrational so sequence is aperiodic if x is chosen as golden ratio sequence of 0s and 1s generated in this way has same recursive structure as fibonacci word it can be split into substrings of form 01 and 0 that is there are no two consecutive ones and if these two substrings are consistently replaced by shorter strings 0 and 1 then another string with same structure results related results according to keller s conjecture any tiling of plane by congruent squares must include two squares that meet edge to edge truth of his conjecture for two dimensional tilings was known already to keller but it was since proven false for dimensions eight and above for a recent survey on results related to this conjecture see none of squares in pythagorean tiling meet edge to edge but this fact does not violate keller s conjecture because tiles have different sizes so they are not all congruent to each other pythagorean tiling may be generalized to a three dimensional tiling of euclidean space by cubes of two different sizes which also is unilateral and equitransitive attila calls this three dimensional tiling rogers filling he conjectures that in any dimension greater than three there is again a unique unilateral and equitransitive way of tiling space by hypercubes of two different sizes see also which includes an illustration of three dimensional tiling credited to rogers but cited to a 1960 paper by richard k guy burns and rigby found several prototiles including koch snowflake that may be used to tile plane only by using copies of prototile in two or more different sizes an earlier paper by danzer grunbaum and shephard provides another example a convex pentagon that tiles plane only when combined in two sizes figure 3 of although pythagorean tiling uses two different sizes of squares square does not have same property as these prototiles of only tiling by similarity because it also is possible to tile plane using only squares of a single size application an early structural application of pythagorean tiling appears in works of leonardo da vinci who considered it among several other potential patterns for floor joists this tiling has also long been used decoratively for floor tiles or other similar patterns as can be seen for instance in jacob ochtervelt s painting street musicians at doorway of a house 1665 it has been suggested that seeing a similar tiling in palace of polycrates may have provided pythagoras with original inspiration for his theorem see in particular pp 15 16 references category euclidean tilings
