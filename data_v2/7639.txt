giganotosaurus is a genus of theropod dinosaur that lived in what is now argentina during early cenomanian age of late cretaceous period approximately 98 to 97 million years ago holotype specimen was discovered in candeleros formation of patagonia in 1993 and is almost 70 complete animal was named giganotosaurus carolinii in 1995 genus name translates as giant southern lizard and specific name honours discoverer ruben d carolini a dentary bone a tooth and some tracks discovered before holotype were later assigned to this animal genus attracted much interest and became part of a scientific debate about maximum sizes of theropod dinosaurs giganotosaurus was one of largest known terrestrial carnivores but exact size has been hard to determine due to incompleteness of remains found so far estimates for most complete specimen range from a length of a skull in length and a weight of dentary bone that belonged to a supposedly larger individual has been used to extrapolate a length of some researchers have found animal to be larger than tyrannosaurus which has historically been considered largest theropod while others have found them to be roughly equal in size and largest size estimates for giganotosaurus exaggerated skull was low with rugose rough and wrinkled nasal bones and a ridge like crest on lacrimal bone in front of eye front of lower jaw was flattened and had a downwards projecting process or chin at tip teeth were compressed sideways and had serrations neck was strong and pectoral girdle proportionally small part of family carcharodontosauridae giganotosaurus is one of most completely known members of group which includes other very large theropods such as closely related mapusaurus and carcharodontosaurus giganotosaurus is thought to have been homeothermic a type of warm bloodedness with a metabolism between that of a mammal and a reptile which would have enabled fast growth it may have been relatively fast moving with a calculated maximal running speed of it would have been capable of closing its jaws quickly capturing and bringing down prey by delivering powerful bites chin may have helped in resisting stress when a bite was delivered against prey giganotosaurus is thought to have been apex predator of its ecosystem and it may have fed on juvenile sauropod dinosaurs description alt left thumb upright 1 5 size green compared to that of other large theropods giganotosaurus is thought to have been one of largest theropod dinosaurs but incompleteness of its remains have made it difficult to estimate its size reliably it is therefore impossible to determine with certainty whether it was larger than tyrannosaurus for example which has been considered largest theropod historically different size estimates have been reached by several researchers based on various methods and depending on how missing parts of skeleton have been reconstructed length estimates for holotype specimen have varied between with a skull between long a femur thigh bone between long and a weight between fusion of sutures joints in braincase indicates holotype specimen was a mature individual a second specimen consisting of a dentary bone part of lower jaw from a supposedly larger individual has been used to extrapolate a length of a skull long and a weight of some writers have considered largest size estimates for both specimens exaggerated giganotosaurus has been compared to an oversized version of well known genus allosaurus skull thumb left partial holotype skull white parts are reconstructed with left dentary in background ernesto bachmann palaeontological museum though incompletely known skull of giganotosaurus appears to have been low maxilla of upper jaw had a long tooth row was deep from top to bottom and its upper and lower edges were almost parallel maxilla had a pronounced process projection under nostril and a small ellipse shaped fenestra opening as in allosaurus and tyrannosaurus nasal bone was very rugose rough and wrinkled and these rugosities continued backwards covering entire upper surface of this bone lacrimal bone in front of eye had a prominent rugose crest or horn that pointed up at a backwards angle crest was ridge like and had deep grooves postorbital bone behind eye had a down and backwards directed jugal process that projected into orbit eye opening as seen in tyrannosaurus abelisaurus and carnotaurus supraorbital bone above eye that contacted between lacrimal and postorbital bones was eave like and similar to that of abelisaurus quadrate bone at back of skull was long and had two pneumatic air filled foramina holes on inner side thumb partial teeth ebpm skull roof formed by frontal and parietal bones was broad and formed a shelf which overhung short supratemporal fenestrae at top rear of skull jaw articulated far behind occipital condyle where neck is attached to skull compared to other theropods condyle was broad and low and had pneumatic cavities giganotosaurus did not have a sagittal crest on top of skull and jaw muscles did not extend onto skull roof unlike in most other theropods due to shelf over supratemporal fenestrae these muscles would instead have been attached to lower side surfaces of shelf neck muscles that elevated head would have attached to prominent supraoccipital bones on top of skull which functioned like nuchal crest of tyrannosaurs a latex endocast of brain cavity of giganotosaurus showed that brain was similar to that of related genus carcharodontosaurus but larger endocast was long wide and had a volume of dentary of lower jaw expanded in height towards front by mandibular symphysis where it was also flattened and it had a downwards projection at tip which has been referred to as a chin lower side of dentary was concave outer side was convex in upper view and a groove ran along it which supported foramina that nourished teeth inner side of dentary had a row of interdental plates where each tooth had a foramen meckelian groove ran along lower border curvature of dentary shows that mouth of giganotosaurus would have been wide it is possible that each dentary had twelve alveoli tooth sockets most of alveoli were about 3 5 cm 1 3 in long from front to back teeth of dentary were of similar shape and size except for first one which was smaller teeth were compressed sideways were oval in cross section and had serrations at front and back borders which is typical of theropods teeth were sigmoid shaped when seen in front and back view one tooth had nine to twelve serrations per millimetre 0 039 in side teeth of giganotosaurus had curved ridges of enamel and largest teeth in premaxilla front of upper jaw had pronounced wrinkles with their highest relief near serrations postcranial skeleton thumb restoration neck of giganotosaurus was strong and axis bone neck vertebra that articulates with skull was robust rear neck cervical vertebrae had short flattened centra bodies of vertebrae with almost hemispherical articulations contacts at front and pleurocoels hollow depressions divided by laminae plates back dorsal vertebrae had high neural arches and deep pleurocoels tail caudal vertebrae had neural spines that were elongated from front to back and had robust centra transverse processes of caudal vertebrae were long from front to back and chevrons on front were blade like pectoral girdle was proportionally shorter than that of tyrannosaurus with ratio between scapula shoulder blade and femur being less than 0 5 blade of scapula had parallel borders and a strong tubercle for insertion of triceps muscle coracoid was small and hook shaped ilium of pelvis had a convex upper border a low blade behind acetabulum and a narrow brevis shelf a projection where tail muscles attached pubic foot was pronounced and shorter at front than behind ischium was straight and expanded hindwards ending in a lobe shape femur was sigmoid shaped and had a very robust upwards pointing head with a deep sulcus groove lesser trochanter of femoral head was wing like and placed below greater trochanter which was short fourth trochanter was large and projected backwards tibia of lower leg was expanded at upper end its articular facet where it articulated with femur was wide and its shaft was compressed from front to back history of discovery upright thumb holotype skeleton with reconstructed skull arm and feet on floor in ebpm in 1993 amateur fossil hunter ruben d carolini discovered tibia of a theropod dinosaur while driving a dune buggy in badlands near villa el chocon in neuquen province of patagonia argentina specialists from national university of were sent to excavate specimen after being notified of find discovery was announced by palaeontologists rodolfo coria and leonardo salgado at a society of vertebrate paleontology meeting in 1994 where science writer don lessem offered to fund excavation after having been impressed by a photo of leg bone partial skull was scattered over an area of about 10 square metres 110 sq ft and postcranial skeleton was disarticulated specimen preserved almost 70 of skeleton and included most of vertebral column pectoral and pelvic girdles femora and left tibia and fibula in 1995 this specimen mucpv was preliminarily described in nature by coria and salgado who made it holotype of new genus and species giganotosaurus carolinii parts of skeleton were still encased in plaster at this time generic name is derived from ancient greek words gigas gigas meaning giant notos notos meaning austral southern in reference to its provenance and sauros sauros meaning lizard specific name honours carolini discoverer holotype skeleton is now housed in ernesto bachmann paleontological museum in villa el chocon which was inaugurated in 1995 at request of carolini specimen is main exhibition at museum and is placed on sandy floor of a room devoted to animal along with tools used by palaeontologists during excavation a mounted reconstruction of skeleton is exhibited in an adjacent room thumb left reconstructed skeleton ebpm one of features of theropod dinosaurs that has attracted most scientific interest is fact that group includes largest terrestrial predators of mesozoic era this interest began with discovery of one of first known dinosaurs megalosaurus named in 1824 for its large size more than half a century later in 1905 tyrannosaurus was named and it remained largest known theropod dinosaur for 90 years though other large theropods were also known discussion of which theropod was largest was revived in 1990s by new discoveries in africa and south america in their original description coria and salgado considered giganotosaurus at least largest theropod dinosaur from southern hemisphere and perhaps largest in world they conceded that comparison with tyrannosaurus was difficult due to disarticulated state of cranial bones of giganotosaurus but noted that at femur of giganotosaurus was 5 cm 2 in longer than that of sue largest known tyrannosaurus specimen and that bones of giganotosaurus appeared to be more robust indicating a heavier animal they estimated skull to have been about 1 53 m 5 ft long and whole animal to have been 12 5 m 41 ft long with a weight of about in 1996 palaeontologist paul sereno and colleagues described a new skull of related genus carcharodontosaurus from morocco a theropod described in 1927 but previously known only from fragmentary remains original fossils were destroyed in world war ii they estimated skull to have been long similar to giganotosaurus but perhaps exceeding that of tyrannosaurus sue with a 1 53 m 5 ft long skull they also pointed out that carcharodontosaurs appear to have had proportionally largest skulls but that tyrannosaurus appears to have had longer hind limbs in a 1995 interview for a science news article entitled new beast usurps t rex as king carnivore sereno noted that these newly discovered theropods from south america and africa competed with tyrannosaurus as largest predators and would help in understanding of late cretaceous dinosaur faunas which had otherwise been very north america centric in same issue of science in which carcharodontosaurus was described palaeontologist philip j currie cautioned that it was yet to be determined which of two animals were larger and that size of an animal is less interesting to palaeontologists than for example adaptations relationships and distribution he also found it remarkable that two animals were found within a year of each other and were closely related in spite of being found on different continents thumb comparison between estimated sizes of holotype light green and assigned specimen dark green in a 1997 science news interview coria estimated giganotosaurus to have been 13 7 45 ft to 14 3 47 ft m long and weighing based on new material larger than carcharodontosaurus sereno countered that it would be difficult to determine a size range for a species based on few incomplete specimens and both palaeontologists agreed that other aspects of these dinosaurs were more important than settling size contest in 1998 palaeontologist jorge o calvo and coria referred a partial left dentary containing some teeth mucpv 95 to giganotosaurus it had been collected by calvo near los candeleros in 1988 found in 1987 who described it briefly in 1989 while noting it may have belonged to a new theropod taxon calvo and coria found dentary to be identical to that of holotype though 8 larger at 62 cm 24 in though rear part of it is incomplete they proposed that skull of holotype specimen would have been long and estimated skull of larger specimen to have been long longest skull of any theropod in 1999 calvo referred an incomplete tooth mucpv 52 to giganotosaurus this specimen was discovered near lake ezequiel ramos mexia in 1987 by a delgado and is therefore first known fossil of genus calvo further suggested that some theropod trackways and isolated tracks which he made basis of in 1991 belonged to giganotosaurus based on their large size largest tracks are long with a pace of and smallest is long with a pace of tracks are three toed and have large and coarse digits with prominent claw impressions impressions of digits occupy most of track length and one track has a thin heel though tracks were found in a higher stratigraphic level than main fossils of giganotosaurus they were from same strata as single tooth and some sauropod dinosaurs that are also known from same strata as giganotosaurus thumb left restoration with size comparison in 2001 physician scientist frank proposed a new polynomial method of calculating body mass estimates for dinosaurs using body length depth and width and found giganotosaurus to have weighed based on original length estimate in their 2002 description of braincase of giganotosaurus coria and currie gave a length estimate of for holotype skull and calculated a weight of by extrapolating from circumference of femur shaft this resulted in an encephalization quotient a measure of relative brain size of 1 9 in 2004 palaeontologist gerardo v mazzetta and colleagues pointed out that though femur of giganotosaurus holotype was larger than that of sue tibia was shorter at they found holotype specimen to have been equal to tyrannosaurus in size at marginally smaller than sue but that larger dentary might have represented an animal of if geometrically similar to holotype specimen by using multivariate regression equations these authors also suggested an alternative weight of for holotype and for larger specimen and that latter was therefore largest known terrestrial carnivore in 2005 palaeontologist cristiano dal sasso and colleagues described new skull material a snout of spinosaurus original fossils of which were also destroyed during world war ii and concluded this dinosaur would have been long with a weight exceeding maximum size of all other theropods in 2006 coria and currie described large theropod mapusaurus from patagonia it was closely related to giganotosaurus and of approximately same size in a 2007 palaeontologists francois therrien and donald m henderson found that giganotosaurus and carcharodontosaurus would both have approached in length and in weight surpassing tyrannosaurus and estimated giganotosaurus holotype skull to have been long they cautioned that these measurements depended on whether incomplete skulls of these animals had been reconstructed correctly and that more complete specimens were needed for more accurate estimates they also found that dal sasso and colleagues reconstruction of spinosaurus was too large and instead estimated it to have been long weighing and possibly as low as in length and in weight they concluded that these dinosaurs had reached upper biomechanical size limit attainable by a strictly bipedal animal in 2010 palaeontologist gregory s paul suggested that skulls of carcharodontosaurs had been reconstructed as too long in general thumb reconstructed skull in japan based on large size estimates in 2012 palaeontologist matthew t carrano and colleagues noted that though giganotosaurus had received much attention due to its enormous size and in spite of holotype being relatively complete it had not yet been described in detail apart from braincase they pointed out that many contacts between skull bones were not preserved which lead to total length of skull being ambiguous they found instead that skulls of giganotosaurus and carcharodontosaurus were exactly same size as that of tyrannosaurus they also measured femur of giganotosaurus holotype to be long in contrast to original measurement and proposed that body mass would have been smaller overall in 2013 palaeontologist scott hartman published a graphic double integration mass estimate based on drawn skeletal reconstructions on his blog wherein he found tyrannosaurus sue to have been larger than giganotosaurus overall he estimated giganotosaurus holotype to have weighed and larger specimen tyrannosaurus was estimated to have weighed and hartman noted that it had a wider torso though two seemed similar in side view he also pointed out that giganotosaurus dentary that was supposedly 8 larger than that of holotype specimen would rather have been 6 5 larger or could simply have belonged to a similarly sized animal with a more robust dentary he conceded that with only one good giganotosaurus specimen known it is possible that larger individuals will be found as it took most of a century to find sue after tyrannosaurus was discovered in 2014 nizar ibrahim and colleagues estimated length of spinosaurus to have been over by extrapolating from a new specimen scaled up to match snout described by dal sasso and colleagues this would make spinosaurus largest ever carnivorous dinosaur in 2019 palaeontologist w scott persons and colleagues described a tyrannosaurus specimen nicknamed scotty and estimated it to be more massive than other giant theropods but cautioned that femoral proportions of carcharodontosaurids giganotosaurus and tyrannotitan indicated a body mass larger than other adult tyrannosaurus they noted that these theropods were known by far fewer specimens than tyrannosaurus and that future finds may reveal specimens larger than scotty as indicated by large giganotosaurus dentary while scotty had greatest femoral circumference femoral length of giganotosaurus was about 10 longer but authors stated it was a difficult to compare proportions between large theropod clades classification thumb reconstructed skeleton fernbank museum of natural history coria and salgado originally found giganotosaurus to group more closely with theropod clade tetanurae than to more basal or primitive theropods such as ceratosaurs due to shared features synapomorphies in legs skull and pelvis other features showed that it was outside more derived or advanced clade coelurosauria in 1996 sereno and colleagues found giganotosaurus carcharodontosaurus and acrocanthosaurus to be closely related within superfamily allosauroidea and grouped them in family carcharodontosauridae features shared between these genera include lacrimal and postorbital bones forming a broad shelf over orbit and squared front end of lower jaw as more carcharodontosaurids were discovered their interrelationships became clearer group was defined as all allosauroids closer to carcharodontosaurus than allosaurus or sinraptor by palaeontologist thomas r holtz and colleagues in 2004 in 2006 coria and currie united giganotosaurus and mapusaurus in carcharodontosaurid subfamily based on shared features of femur such as a weak fourth and a shallow broad groove on lower end in 2008 sereno and palaeontologist stephen l brusatte united giganotosaurus mapusaurus and tyrannotitan in tribe giganotosaurini in 2010 paul listed giganotosaurus as giganotosaurus or carcharodontosaurus carolinii without elaboration giganotosaurus is one of most complete and informative members of carcharodontosauridae following cladogram shows placement of giganotosaurus within carcharodontosauridae according to sebastian et al 2016 thumb upright full size model frankfurt hauptbahnhof evolution coria and salgado suggested that convergent evolution of gigantism in theropods could have been linked to common conditions in their environments or ecosystems sereno and colleagues found that presence of carcharodontosaurids in africa carcharodontosaurus north america acrocanthosaurus and south america giganotosaurus showed group had a transcontinental distribution by early cretaceous period dispersal routes between northern and southern continents appear to have been severed by ocean barriers in late cretaceous which led to more distinct provincial faunas by preventing exchange previously it was thought that cretaceous world was biogeographically separated with northern continents being dominated by tyrannosaurids south america by abelisaurids and africa by carcharodontosaurids subfamily in which giganotosaurus belongs appears to have been restricted to southern continent of gondwana formed by south america and africa where they were probably apex top predators south american tribe giganotosaurini may have been separated from their african relatives through vicariance when gondwana broke up during aptian albian ages of early cretaceous palaeobiology left thumb restoration of a walking individual in 1999 palaeontologist reese e barrick and geologist william j showers found that bones of giganotosaurus and tyrannosaurus had very similar oxygen isotope patterns with similar heat distribution in body these thermoregulatory patterns indicate that these dinosaurs had a metabolism intermediate between that of mammals and reptiles and were therefore homeothermic with a stable core body temperature a type of warm bloodedness metabolism of an giganotosaurus would be comparable to that of a mammalian carnivore and would have supported rapid growth in 2001 physicist ernesto blanco and mazzetta evaluated cursorial running capability of giganotosaurus they rejected hypothesis by james orville farlow that risk of injuries involved in such large animals falling while on a run would limit speed of large theropods instead they posed that imbalance caused by increasing velocity would be limiting factor calculating time it would take for a leg to gain balance after retraction of opposite leg they found upper kinematic limit of running speed to be they also found comparison between running capability of giganotosaurus and birds like ostrich based on strength of their leg bones to be of limited value since theropods unlike birds had heavy tails to counterbalance their weight feeding thumb casts of giganotosaurus and contemporary sauropod limaysaurus hungarian natural history museum in 2002 coria and currie found that various features of rear part of skull such as slope of occiput and low and wide occipital condyle indicate that giganotosaurus would have had a good capability of moving skull sideways in relation to front neck vertebrae these features may also have been related to increased mass and length of jaw muscles jaw articulation of giganotosaurus and other carcharodontosaurids was moved hindwards to increase length of jaw musculature enabling faster closure of jaws whereas tyrannosaurs increased mass of lower jaw musculature to increase power of their bite in 2005 therrien and colleagues estimated relative bite force of theropods estimates in absolute values like newtons were impossible and found that giganotosaurus and related taxa had adaptations for capturing and bringing down prey by delivering powerful bites whereas tyrannosaurs had adaptations for resisting torsional stress and crushing bones bite force of giganotosaurus was weaker than that of tyrannosaurus and force decreased hindwards along tooth row lower jaws were adapted for slicing bites and it probably captured and manipulated prey with front part of jaws these authors suggested that giganotosaurus and other may have been generalised predators that fed on a wide spectrum of prey smaller than themselves such as juvenile sauropods ventral process or chin of lower jaw may have been an adaptation for resisting tensile stress when powerful bite was delivered with front of jaws against prey therrien f henderson d m ruff c b 2005 bite me biomechanical models of theropod mandibles and implications for feeding in carpenter k carnivorous dinosaurs life of past indiana university press pp 179 237 first known fossils of closely related mapusaurus were found in a bonebed consisting of several individuals at different growth stages in their 2006 description of genus coria and currie suggested that though this could be due to a long term or coincidental accumulation of carcasses presence of different growth stages of same taxon indicated aggregation was not coincidental in a 2006 national geographic article coria stated that bonebed was probably result of a catastrophic event and that presence of mainly medium sized individuals with very few young or old is normal for animals that form packs therefore coria said large theropods may have hunted in groups which would be advantageous when hunting gigantic sauropods palaeoecology giganotosaurus was discovered in candeleros formation which was deposited during early cenomanian age of late cretaceous period approximately 98 to 97 million years ago although holtz provided an earlier lower bound for its age of 99 6 million years this formation is lowest unit in neuquen group wherein it is part of rio limay subgroup formation is composed of coarse and medium grained sandstones deposited in a fluvial environment associated with rivers and streams and in aeolian conditions effected by wind paleosols buried soil siltstones and claystones are present some of which represent swamp conditions giganotosaurus was probably apex predator in its ecosystem it shared its environment with herbivorous dinosaurs such as titanosaurian sauropod and rebbachisaurid sauropods limaysaurus and other theropods include abelisaurid ekrixinatosaurus dromaeosaurid and other reptiles include crocodyliform araripesuchus sphenodontians snakes and turtle other vertebrates include mammals a frog and fishes footprints indicate presence of large ornithopods and pterosaurs as well references
