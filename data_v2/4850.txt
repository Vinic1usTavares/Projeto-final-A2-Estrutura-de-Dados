black canyon of gunnison national park is an american national park located in western colorado and managed by national park service there are two primary entrances to park south rim entrance is located east of montrose while north rim entrance is south of crawford and is closed in winter park contains of long black canyon of gunnison river national park itself contains deepest and most dramatic section of canyon but canyon continues upstream into curecanti national recreation area and downstream into gunnison gorge national conservation area canyon s name owes itself to fact that parts of gorge only receive 33 minutes of sunlight a day according to images of america black canyon of gunnison in book author duane states several canyons of american west are longer and some are deeper but none combines depth sheerness narrowness darkness and dread of black canyon geology thumb left upright black canyon of gunnison gunnison river drops an average of through entire canyon making it 5th steepest mountain descent in north america by comparison colorado river drops an average of through grand canyon greatest descent of gunnison river occurs within park at chasm view dropping black canyon is so named because its steepness makes it difficult for sunlight to penetrate into its depths as a result canyon is often shrouded in shadow causing rocky walls to appear black at its narrowest point canyon is only wide at river thumb overview black canyon with gunnison river extreme steepness and depth of black canyon formed as result of several geologic processes acting together gunnison river is primarily responsible for carving canyon though several other geologic events had to occur in order to form canyon as it is seen today thumb upright painted wall tallest sheer cliff in colorado at lighter colored pegmatite dikes are clearly visible precambrian precambrian gneiss and schist that make up majority of steep walls of black canyon formed 1 7 billion years ago during a metamorphic period brought on by collision of ancient volcanic island arcs with southern end of what is present day wyoming lighter colored pegmatite dikes that can be seen crosscutting basement rocks formed later during this same period cretaceous tertiary entire area underwent uplift during laramide orogeny between 70 and 40 million years ago which was also part of gunnison uplift this raised precambrian gneiss and schist that makes up canyon walls during tertiary from 26 to 35 million years ago large episodes of volcanism occurred in area immediately surrounding present day black canyon west elk mountains la sal mountains henry mountains and abajo mountains all contributed to burying area in several thousand feet of volcanic ash and debris modern gunnison river set its course 15 million years ago as run off from nearby la sal and west elk mountains and sawatch range began carving through relatively soft volcanic deposits quaternary with gunnison river s course set a broad uplift in area 2 to 3 million years ago caused river to cut through softer volcanic deposits eventually river reached precambrian rocks of gunnison uplift since river was unable to change its course it began scouring through extremely hard metamorphic rocks of gunnison uplift river s flow was much larger than currently with much higher levels of turbidity as a result river dug down through precambrian gneiss and schist at rate of every 100 years extreme hardness of metamorphic rock along with relative quickness with which river carved through them created steep walls that can be seen today a number of feeder canyons running into black canyon slope in wrong direction for water to flow into canyon it is believed that less entrenched streams in region shifted to a more north flowing drainage pattern in response to a change in tilt of surrounding terrain west flowing gunnison however was essentially trapped in hard precambrian rock of black canyon and could not change its course history ute indians had known canyon to exist for a long time before first europeans saw it they referred to river as much rocks big water and are known to have avoided canyon out of superstition by time united states declared independence in 1776 two spanish expeditions had passed by canyons in 1800s numerous fur trappers searching for beaver pelts would have known of canyon s existence but they left no written record first official account of black canyon was provided by captain john williams gunnison in 1853 who was leading an expedition to survey a route from saint louis and san francisco he described country to be roughest most hilly and most cut up he had ever seen and skirted canyon south towards present day montrose following his death at hands of ute indians later that year river that captain gunnison had called grand was renamed in his honor denver rio grande in 1881 william jackson palmer s denver and rio grande railroad had reached gunnison from denver line was built to provide a link to burgeoning gold and silver mines of san juan mountains rugged terrain precluded using 4 8 1 2 standard rail palmer decided to go with narrower 3 gauge it took over a year for irish and italian laborers to carve out a 15 mile roadbed from to cimarron costing a staggering 165 000 a mile last mile is said to have cost more than entire royal gorge project on august 13 1882 first passenger train passed through black canyon editor of gunnison review press rode in one of observation cars he remarked that canyon was undoubtedly largest and most rugged canyon in world traversed by iron horse we had often heard of scenery of this canyon but no one can have faintest conception of its grandeur and magnificence until they have made a trip through it it is a narrow gorge with walls of granite rising in some places to a height of thousands of feet throughout its entire length there is probably not a quarter of a mile of straight track on it it is a serpentine road in every respect and curves are frequent and sharp in hundreds of places walls of granite are perpendicular and in many places road bed is blasted out in side of walls of rock which overhang track he went on to proclaim another such a feat of railroad engineering probably can not be found in world and there is probably no section of colorado or of whole country where such a varied and interesting lot of scenery can be found thumb left preserved rail bridge over cimarron creek in hopes of running railroad through rest of black canyon palmer sent his top engineer bryan bryant on an inner canyon exploration bryant set off with a 12 man crew in december 1882 expecting to complete survey in 20 days he returned in 68 eight of twelve man crew left after a few days terrified of task in front of them what rest of men saw was spectacular and had never been seen by another human bryant reported that black canyon was impenetrable and that it was impossible to build anything in its depths heeding bryant s advice palmer decided to route railroad south of canyon and in march 1883 it completed its connection to salt lake city and for a brief period canyon was on main line of a transcontinental railroad system while railroad and early visitors used canyon as a path to utah and mines to southwest later visitors came to see canyon as an opportunity for recreation and personal enjoyment rudyard kipling described his 1889 ride through canyon in following words we entered a gorge remote from sun where rocks were two thousand feet sheer and where a rock splintered river roared and howled ten feet below a track which seemed to have been built on simple principle of dropping miscellaneous dirt into river and pinning a few rails a top there was a glory and a wonder and a mystery about mad ride by 1890 an alternate route through glenwood springs had been completed and route through black canyon being more difficult to operate lost importance for through trains however local rail traffic continued over black canyon line until route was finally abandoned in early 1950s today various elements of railroad have been preserved in cimarron area including a steel bridge in cimarron canyon gunnison tunnel in 1901 u s geological survey sent abraham lincoln fellows and william torrence into canyon to look for a site to build a diversion tunnel bringing water to uncompahgre valley which was suffering from water shortages due to an influx of settlers into area torrence a montrose native and an expert mountaineer had taken part in a failed expedition previous year and his experience proved valuable on his second excursion he opted to bring a single rubber air mattress instead of heavy wooden boats that had doomed his previous journey into canyon they entered canyon on august 12 equipped with only hunting knives two silk lifeline ropes and rubber bags to encase their instruments after a harrowing 10 days braving rock falls waterfalls and 76 river crossings they emerged from canyon with a suitable tunnel site construction on tunnel began 4 years later and was fraught with difficulties right from onset working conditions at tunnel were difficult due to high levels of carbon dioxide excessive temperatures humidity water mud shale sand and a fractured fault zone it took tunneling crew almost one year to bore through 2000 feet of water filled rock tunnel was driven through granite quartzite gneiss and shale as well as layers of sandstone coal and limestone work on gunnison tunnel was first done manually and by candlelight one miner would hold drill and rotate it while second miner would use a sledgehammer to drive drill into rock this work required strong hard working men in spite of good pay and fringe benefits most disliked dangerous underground conditions and stayed an average of only 2 weeks 26 men were killed during 4 year undertaking tunnel was finally completed in 1909 stretching a distance of 5 8 miles and costing nearly 3 million dollars at time gunnison tunnel held honor of being world s longest irrigation tunnel on september 23 president william howard taft dedicated tunnel in montrose east portal of gunnison tunnel is accessible via east portal road which is on south rim of canyon although tunnel itself is not visible diversion dam can be seen from campground creation of park thumb right park headquarters south rim black canyon of

mesa point is area most developed for camping it includes tent camping and rv camping with full hookups private site as well as canyon tours hiking fishing and boat tours nearby is curecanti national recreation area which includes a visitor center marina facilities and among 10 campgrounds within in nra lake fork campground west end of park has river access by automobile as well as guided tours of canyon a short hike at blue mesa point information center heads down to pine creek and morrow point boat tours boating fishing and hiking at south rim there is one campground for tent and rv camping one loop of which has electrical hookups and several hiking and nature trails north rim is also accessible by automobile and has a small primitive campground automobiles can access river via east portal road at south rim this road has a 16 grade and is prohibited to vehicles over in length thumb left gunnison point trail south rim river can also be accessed by steep unmaintained trails called routes or draws on north and south rim these routes require about two hours to hike down and two to four hours to hike back up depending on which route is taken all inner canyon descents are strenuous and require class 3 climbing and basic route finding skills steep talus impassable ledges and lack of cover are some of challenges hikers are faced with poison ivy also grows abundantly in draws and on canyon floor long sleeves and hiking boots are strongly recommended flow rate of gunnison river should also be considered for those planning on camping in canyon as high river levels can wash out camp sites national park service warns following routes are difficult to follow and only individuals in excellent physical condition should attempt these hikes hikers are expected to find their own way and to be prepared for self rescue a free back country permit is required for all inner canyon use except at west end gunnison river is designated as a gold medal water from 200 yards downstream of crystal reservoir dam to north fork this includes 12 miles within black canyon of gunnison national park only artificial flies and lures are permitted and all rainbow trout are catch and release additionally fishing is prohibited within 200 yards downstream of crystal dam thumb right gunnison river at east portal black canyon is a center for rock climbing in a style known as traditional climbing most of climbs are difficult and attempted only by advanced climbers rafting opportunities exist in region but run through park itself is a difficult technical run for only best kayakers there are several impassable stretches of water requiring long sometimes dangerous portages remaining rapids are class iii v and are only for expert river runners downstream in gunnison gorge national conservation area river is somewhat easier to navigate though still very remote and only for experienced runners with rapids that are class iii iv in music canyon inspired a symphonic composition by
