there might be some fishsticks in freezer jimmy do you like fishsticks cartman yeah jimmy do you like putting fishsticks in your mouth cartman yeah jimmy what are you a gay fish joke which plays on similarity of phrases fishsticks and fish dicks when spoken becomes a hit throughout south park when cartman begins taking half credit for joke kyle tells jimmy he should stand up to cartman when jimmy tells cartman he feels he wrote most of joke cartman fears jimmy will try to take full credit and asks kyle for advice on how to deal with jimmy kyle instead says he believes jimmy wrote entire joke and suggests that cartman s ego is so big that he subconsciously remembers things incorrectly to make himself feel more important this is supplemented by cartman s flashbacks to creation of joke which become more overblown and ridiculous as episode goes on showing him to truly believe that he deserves credit meanwhile joke becomes a national sensation comedian carlos mencia goes on conan o brien s show claiming credit for joke joke is played on rapper kanye west who does not understand it west grows angry when others say he does not get it and will not allow anyone to explain it to him because he claims to be a genius and voice of a generation kanye abducts carlos mencia who admits he stole joke to compensate for not being funny and claiming that his dick don t work in a parody of viggo mortensen s character lalin in carlito s way but kanye does not believe him and beats him to death with help of his hired thugs cartman and jimmy go on ellen degeneres show and claim they invented joke prompting kanye to go after them jimmy confronts cartman asking how he can live with himself for taking credit for a joke he did not write they are interrupted by kanye who threatens to kill them by now cartman has not only convinced himself he wrote whole joke without jimmy s help but believes he also saved his life from a black widow slew a dragon defeated an army of jew robots and has powers similar to human torch cartman thinks he realizes what kyle was trying to tell him but he gets it completely backwards cartman believes that jimmy s ego is one that is twisted and jimmy s ego trying to convince itself that he wrote joke while not accepting that cartman wrote whole thing and jimmy believes him kanye has an epiphany about his own massive ego and believes he finally understands joke however he incorrectly thinks it means he is in fact a gay fish episode ends with kanye donning a wetsuit and diving off santa monica pier into ocean to embrace his new identity as a gay fish in form of a music video in which he happily swims around sea kissing and humping random fish however in a deleted scene west drowns and his body is picked up and discovered by us coast guards production fishsticks was written and directed by series co creator trey parker concept for fishsticks began when parker fellow co creator matt stone and actor bill hader attended a writers retreat in seattle washington and they visited a body of water where they could watch salmon jump they started joking about a salmon wearing an outfit like motorcycle daredevil evel knievel which eventually reminded them of music video for rapper kanye west s song touch sky in which west himself dresses like knievel this led to them picturing a scene with west on a news program angrily denying reports that he is a fish shouting no i am not a salmon during a four hour ride in a car stone and parker discussed joke further and eventually thought of fishsticks joke that featured prominently in final episode duo said they found it hilarious and told variations of joke back and forth to each other for rest of ride stone said van driver we hired was just so bummed because we just kept talking about fishsticks you re a gay fish over and over we thought it was so funny and just fact that he didn t get it although joke originally stemmed from evel knievel and not kanye west parker and stone said they realized west would probably be extremely humorless about joke and not understand it so they decided episode should revolve mostly around him after coming up with idea parker and stone waited a long time before they finally wrote script because stone said it just seemed too dumb are we really going to do a whole episode about this stone said jokes about carlos mencia were just a complete afterthought that came about during writing process during one scene in fishsticks cartman steals credit from jimmy for a joke he did not write this was inspired by people parker and stone have worked with in television business who were present for discussions duo had then later claimed credit for idea even though they had nothing to do with it stone said they truly believe they did it that s really sinister part it s not where they re trying to steal part of glory they actually fully believe that they came up with it parker provided voice of kanye both in episode and in gay fish a full length song featured at end of episode about west s realization that he actually is a gay fish parker used a large amount of auto tune pitch audio processing which he had never used before parker

fish west song as spell binding tv guide listed episode at number five on top ten television moments of week travis fickett of ign said episode included some good laughs but never kicks into high gear and said themes might have worked better as subplots than a full episode fishsticks is one of those episodes that typically occur around now in south park season it s not great not bad hovering somewhere around amusing towards forgettable sean o neal of a v club said he was disappointed by episode and thought message about celebrity self delusion might have been better if it focused on only west or mencia rather than both although o neal liked west song in episode s final scene o neal said cramming west and mencia together even mixed in with cartman s very funny fantasy sequences felt too cobbled to me and time limits imposed by cutting back and forth between it all made respective digs start to feel a little too one note legacy 200px thumb right west s 2008 appearance at music
