as legates to cyprus gnaeus cornelius merula and titus torquatus with mission to support physcon s claim on island while preventing a war between brothers polybius thought that romans wanted to avoid threat of a unified ptolemaic kingdom and therefore supported claims of physcon polybius xxxi 10 in rhodes titus successfully convinced physcon to abandon his project of conquering cyprus so he could instead go to alexandria in order to negotiate a peaceful settlement with philometor however cyrenaica under physcon s control rebelled just after titus had left younger ptolemy it prompted physcon s return to africa to quell revolt and end of talks between titus and elder ptolemy embassy thus ended in a failure polybius xxxi 17 19 broughton vol i p 442 at their return to rome titus and merula
