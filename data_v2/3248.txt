thumb upright 1 35 prince siddhartha leaving palace on a horse during great renunciation deities support hooves of horse approximately 2nd century india great renunciation or great departure is traditional term for departure of gautama buddha bce from his palace at kapilavastu to live a life as an ascetic it is called great renunciation because it is regarded as a great sacrifice most accounts of this event can be found in post canonical buddhist texts from several buddhist traditions which are most complete these are however of a more mythological nature than early texts they exist in pali sanskrit and chinese language according to these accounts at birth of prince siddhartha gautama buddha to be brahmin priests predicted that he would either become a world teacher or a world ruler to prevent his son from turning to religious life prince siddhartha s father and raja of sakya clan suddhodana did not allow him to see death or suffering and distracted him with luxury during his childhood prince siddhartha had a meditative experience which made him realize suffering inherent in all existence he grew up and experienced a comfortable youth but he continued to ponder about religious questions and when he was 29 years old he saw for first time in his life what became known in buddhism as four sights an old man a sick person and a corpse as well as an ascetic that inspired him shortly after prince siddhartha woke up at night and saw his female servants lying in unattractive poses which shocked prince moved by all things he had experienced prince decided to leave palace behind in middle of night against will of his father to live life of an wandering ascetic leaving behind his just born son rahula and wife yasodhara he traveled to river anomiya with his charioteer chandaka and horse kanthaka and cut off his hair leaving his servant and horse behind he journeyed into woods and changed into monk s robes later he met king bimbisara who attempted to share his royal power with former prince but now ascetic gautama refused story of prince siddhartha s renunciation illustrates conflict between lay duties and religious life and shows how even most pleasurable lives are still filled with suffering prince siddhartha was moved with a strong religious agitation sanskrit and about transient nature of life but believed there was a divine alternative to be found found in this very life and accessible to honest seeker apart from this sense of religious agitation he was motivated by a deep empathy with human suffering sanskrit and traditional accounts say little about early life of buddha and historical details cannot be known for certain historians argue that siddhartha was indeed born in a wealthy and aristocratic family with a father as a raja but hometown was an oligarchy or republic not a kingdom and prince s wealth and blissful life have been embellished in traditional texts historical basis of siddhartha gautama s life has been affected by his association with ideal king cakravartin inspired by growth of maurya empire a century after he lived literal interpretation of confrontation with four old age sickness and death for first time in his generally not accepted by historians but seen as symbolical for a growing and shocking existential realization which may have started in gautama s early childhood later he may have intentionally given birth to his son rahula before his renunciation to obtain permission from his parents more easily double prediction which occurred shortly after prince s birth point at two natures within prince siddhartha s person struggling human who worked to attain enlightenment and divine descendant and cakravartin which are both important in buddhist doctrine great renunciation has been depicted much in buddhist art it has influenced ordination rituals in several buddhist communities and sometimes such rituals have affected accounts in turn a modified version of great renunciation can be found in legend of christian saints barlaam and josaphat one of most popular and widespread legends in 11th century christianity although story describes a victorious christian king and ascetic it is imbued with buddhist themes and doctrines derived from its original in modern times authors such as edwin arnold 1832 1904 and jorge luis borges 1899 1986 have been influenced by story of great renunciation sources several early buddhist texts such as sutta and sutta as well as sections in texts on monastic discipline sanskrit and contain fragments about early life of buddha but not a complete and continuous biography nevertheless even in these fragments great departure is often included especially in chinese translations of early texts from mahisasaka and dharmaguptaka schools later onward several buddhist traditions have produced more complete accounts but these are of a more mythological nature this includes a more complete biography in vinaya of from 4th century bc and several related texts sanskrit texts that deal with life of buddha are buddhacarita by asvaghosa ce mahavastu from 1st century ce lalitavistara from 1st century ce and there are also translated biographies in chinese about life of buddha of which earliest can be dated between 2nd and 4th century bc many of these include chinese word for great departure as part of title one of most well known of these is jing usually translated as sutra of departure sinhalese commentators have composed pali language a commentary to jataka from 2nd 3rd century ce which relates buddha s life up until donation of jetavana monastery other important pali biographies of later origin are 12th century by 13th century by 18th century and from 14th 18th century however most widely distributed biography in southeast asia is late medieval recorded in pali and at least eight vernacular languages besides textual sources information about basic elements of life of buddha can be obtained from early buddhist art which is often much older than biographical sources these artistic depictions were produced in a time when there was no continuous written account of life of buddha available yet accounts in buddhist discourses great renunciation and departure are usually mentioned in life of buddha among several other motifs that cover religious life of buddha to be prince siddhartha gautama his first meditation marriage palace life four encounters life of ease in palace and renunciation great departure encounter with hunters and farewell to his horse kanthaka and his charioteer chandaka in tibetan

it upright 75 traditional buddhist texts relate that prince siddhartha gautama was born with 32 auspicious bodily characteristics based on child s body as well as his parents dreams about his birth eight brahmin priests and a holy man called asita made a prediction that he would either become a world teacher or a world ruler though one of brahmins and according to some sources asita stated that child could only become a world teacher to prevent his son and heir apparent from turning to religious life prince siddhartha s father and raja of sakya clan suddhodana did not allow him to see death or suffering and distracted him with luxury to prevent him from worrying and becoming interested in religious life early texts and post canonical biographies describe in much detail how rajas son lived in great luxury suddhodana provided him with three palaces in kapilavastu for summer winter and monsoon as well as many female attendants to distract him during his childhood prince had his first experience of meditation sitting under a jambu tree during royal ploughing ceremony in some later texts this is extensively described explaining how young prince looked at animals on courtyard eating each other and him realizing suffering inherent in all existence this caused him to attain meditative absorption during this meditative experience shadow of tree remained miraculously still leading king to come and bow for his own son experience would later be used by gautama after his renunciation when he discarded austerities and sought another path it is also a brief summary of what

married yasodhara just like him of warrior noble caste who is described as perfect in many ways all while texts depict prince siddhartha as perfect prince being both a good student a good warrior and a good husband to emphasize glory he would have to leave behind when renouncing palace life he is described as intelligent eager to learn and compassionate but prince continued to ponder about religious questions and when he was 29 years old he traveled outside palace he then to some accounts on separate sights for first time in his life an old man a sick person a corpse and an ascetic most traditional texts relate that sights were brought about through power of deities because suddhodana had kept all such people away from his son s sight however some sources say it was because of chance regardless prince siddhartha learned that everyone including himself will have to face old age sickness and death in same way he was shocked by this and found no happiness in palace life fourth sign was an ascetic who looked at ease restrained and compassionate ascetic taught compassion and non violence and gave prince hope that there was a way out of suffering or a way toward wisdom therefore again prince discovered what he would later understand more deeply during his enlightenment duhkha and end of duhkha some time later prince siddhartha heard news that a son had been born to him pali account claims that when he received news of his son s birth he replied meaning a rahu is born a fetter has arisen that is an impediment to search for enlightenment accordingly raja named child rahula because he did not want his son to pursue a spiritual life as a mendicant in some versions prince siddhartha was one naming his son this way for being a hindrance on his spiritual path discontentment

can mean blissful at peace but also extinguished gone to nirvana song fascinated him for this reason and he took it as a sign that it was time for him to seek nirvana foucher describes this as follows in some versions of story he therefore rewarded woman for her song with a string of pearls before prince siddhartha decided to leave palace in morally oriented lalitavistara he is seen asking his father whether he could leave city and retire to forest but his father said his son that he would give anything for him to stay then prince asked his father whether he could prevent him from growing old becoming sick or die raja answered he could not knowing that his son would therefore leave palace he gave him his blessing that night prince siddhartha woke up in middle of night only to find his female servant musicians lying in unattractive poses on floor some of them drooling prince felt as though he was in a cemetery surrounded by corpses indologist bhikkhu rahula notes that there is an irony here in that women originally sent by raja suddhodana to entice and distract prince from thinking to renounce worldly life eventually accomplish just opposite prince siddhartha realized that human existence is conditioned by dukkha and that human body is of an impermanent and loathsome nature in another version of story recorded in lalitavistara musicians played love songs to prince but deities caused prince to understand songs as praising detachment and reminding him of vow to buddhahood which he took in previous lives that night prince siddhartha dreamt five different dreams which he would later understood to refer to his future role as a buddha leaving palace thumb just before prince leaves palace for spiritual life prince siddhartha takes one look at his wife yasodhara and

before he left palace for spiritual life he took one look at his wife yasodhara and his newborn child fearing his resolve might waver he resisted to pick up his son and left palace as planned some versions of story say that deities caused royal family to fall into a slumber to help prince escape palace because of this chandaka and kanthaka tried to wake up royal family but unsuccessfully nevertheless in some accounts prince is seen taking leave from his father in a respectful manner while latter slept finally chandaka and kanthaka both protest against prince s departure but to no avail having finally left palace prince looked back at it once more and took a vow that he would not return until he had attained enlightenment texts continue by relating that prince siddhartha was confronted by mara personification of evil in buddhism who attempted to tempt him to change is mind and become a cakravartin instead but to no avail however in most versions of story as well as visual depictions there is no such figure in some versions it is not mara but father of yasodhara or local city goddess representing distressed city regardless prince traveled on horse with his charioteer chandaka crossing three kingdoms reaching river anomiya there he gave all his ornaments and robes to chandaka shaved his hair and beard and became a religious ascetic tradition says prince threw his in air where it was picked up by deities and enshrined in heaven brahma deity offered him his robes and other requisites siddhartha then comforted chandaka and sent his charioteer back to palace to inform his father while former prince crossed river chandaka was to tell king that his son had not chosen this life because of spite or lack of love nor for yearning for paradise but to put an end to birth and death he had been witness to departure from start up until transformation into a mendicant which was exactly what he was required to see to make palace understand transformation was irreversible former prince dismissing chandaka and his horse kanthaka is severing of last tie that bound him to world chandaka left reluctantly kanthaka died because it could not bear loss although in some versions prince siddhartha returned with chandaka to palace first former prince then continued his journey into woods probably in area of malla according to some accounts he changed his princely clothes into more simple clothes only now when he met a woodsman or hunter former prince then swapped his clothes with man who is in some versions identified with deity indra in disguise scholar of iconography anna argues that this exchange indicates gautama s choice to engage in a more primitive kind of society removed from urban life ascetic gautama then traveled via northern route passing present day rajgir there gautama met king bimbisara who was much impressed by his demeanor king sent a retainer to offer a share to his kingdom or according to some sources a position as a minister king gautama refused however but promised to return later after his enlightenment meanwhile when royal family realized their son and prince was gone they suffered from loss but they were able to deal with it partly by raising grandson rahula as for prince s jewels queen discarded those in a pond to forget loss discrepancies pali sources state that renunciation happened on full moon day of whereas sources from sarvastivada and dharmaguptaka schools say it happened on vaisakha there are also textual discrepancies with regard to which day prince siddhartha left some texts stating 8th day of waxing moon others 15th as was already observed by chinese translator xuan zang 664 ce other early buddhist textual traditions contain different accounts with regard to rahula s birth mahavastu as well as mulasarvastivada texts relate that rahula was on evening of renunciation of prince and only born six years later on day that prince siddhartha achieved enlightenment and later chinese texts such as abhiniskramana sutra give two types of explanation for long gestation period result of karma in yasodhara and rahula s past lives and more naturalistic explanation that yasodhara s practice of religious austerities stunted foetus growth buddhist studies scholar john s strong notes that these alternative accounts draw a parallel between quest for enlightenment and yasodhara s path to being a mother and eventually they both are accomplished at same time in buddhist doctrine thumb left upright prince siddhartha and his charioteer leaving kapilavastu ivory 18th 19th century india alt two figures wearing headdresses riding horses great renunciation functions as a founding story of buddhism prince siddhartha s leaving palace is traditionally called great renunciation because of great sacrifice it entails archaeologist alfred foucher pointed out that great departure marks a point in biographies of buddha from which he was no longer a prince and no longer asked deities for assistance and as such he found himself in an indifferent world without guidance or support confronted with both noble task of seeking mankind s salvation and lowly but pressing one of securing his daily bread sacrifice meant that he discarded his royal and caste obligations to affirm value of spiritual enlightenment story of his renunciation illustrates conflict between lay duties and religious life and shows how even most pleasurable lives are still filled with suffering all traditional sources agree that prince led a very comfortable life before his renunciation emphasizing luxury and comfort he had to leave behind he renounced his life in palace in order to find good and to find that most blessed state which is beyond death story of great renunciation is therefore a symbolic example of renunciation for all buddhist monks and nuns buddha s rejection of hedonism of palace life would be reflected in his teaching on middle way path between two extremes of sensual pleasure and self mortification buddha s motivation is described as a form of strong religious agitation sanskrit and a sense of fear and disgust that arises when confronted with transient nature of world buddha was shocked by pervasiveness of old age sickness and death and spoke about a noble quest of stillness in which one faces duhkha as it is and learns from it early buddhist texts state that prince siddhartha s motivation in renouncing palace life was his existential self examination being aware that he would grow old become sick and die this awareness would also inspire his teachings later such as on suffering and four noble truths buddha has also described his motivation to leave palace life as a yearning for a life that is wide open and as complete and pure as a polished shell rather than palace which is constricting crowded and dusty author karen armstrong has suggested that buddha s motivation to renounce worldly life was motivated by a belief in opposites a feature of perennial philosophy common in pre modern world that is that all things in mundane life have their counterpart in divine life buddha looked for divine counterpart of suffering of birth ageing and difference was though that buddha believed he could realize this counterpart in a demonstrable reality in mundane world natural to human beings and accessible to honest seeker scholar of religion argues that buddha s motivation for renunciation was a cognitive dissonance between pleasurable palace life and hard reality of age sickness and death in real life and a resulting emotional tension thumb left prince siddhartha and princess yasodhara modern depiction alt prince siddhartha and princess yasodhara sitting on throne looking at a dancing and music performance upright 1 35 generally buddhists regard marriage between prince siddhartha and princess yasodhara as a good one and prince as an example of loving kindness for his wife and son all buddhist schools agree that his main motivation in this is a deep empathy with human suffering sanskrit and though prince left behind his wife and only son buddhists see this lifetime in context of a path of many lifetimes through which both wife and child had taken vows to become a disciple of buddha in of previous lives of buddha as sumedha yasodhara and sumedha are depicted taking a vow to spend following lifetimes together on condition that yasodhara would not hinder buddha to be on his quest after having become buddha former prince siddhartha is seen to come back to palace to teach yasodhara and rahula and liberate them as well eventually yasodhara became a nun and attained enlightenment in same story buddha is also described teaching his father and later on his step mother who had raised him great renunciation is not only a part of biography of gautama buddha but is a pattern that can be found in life of every single buddha part of a pre established blueprint that each buddha must follow scholarly analysis historical thumb prince siddhartha on eve of his renunciation sitting in palace alt drawing made of relief buddha like figure sitting among several other figures some sleeping some apparently conversing with main figure upright 75 only a little information is given in texts and discourses about early life of buddha which contrasts with abundance of traditional sources about rest his life from enlightenment to parinirvana bareau speculated that this may be because buddha was disinclined to talk about it either out of modesty or because also his leading disciples did not consider that relating his secular life was sufficiently edifying as opposed to his religious life furthermore since accounts about buddha s life are filled with mythological embellishments it may be not be possible to know exact history though accounts are clearly based around historical events site of siddhartha gautama s birth kapilavastu is considered likely to have been historically genuine though not as commercially important as depicted in later texts it was an oligarchy or republic led by a council with alternating rajas which at time of siddhartha gautama s birth was suddhodana suddhodana was a large landowner belonging to nobility and was likely to have had considerable speaking ability and persuasive powers which his son siddhartha may have inherited siddhartha gautama was probably born in a wealthy and aristocratic family indologist a k warder believed that siddhartha gautama s three palaces were historical but conventional luxury for a wealthy person of time whether a warrior or a merchant however palaces were probably houses with multiple levels not great palaces buddhologist andre bareau 1921 1993 argued that association that is made between life of buddha and that of cakravartin may have been inspired by rapid growth of maurya empire in 4th century bce india though it could also be a pre buddhist tradition kapilavastu has been identified with both india and nepal and scholars are divided as to which site is more likely to have been historical kapilavastu during time of king ashoka 3rd century bce area was already regarded as birthplace of buddha judging from pillar that was erected in lumbini nepal with regard to mentioning of castes in texts scholars are in debate as to what extent kapilavastu was already organized along lines of castes of mainland india apart from kapilavastu nineteen other places featured in first 29 years of prince s life were identified by xuan zang who was also a well known pilgrim foucher argued that these places were based on oral recitation traditions surrounding pilgrimages which now have been lost marriage between siddhartha gautama and yasodhara is very likely to be historical after all according to foucher monastic and celibate composers of biographies would have had no good reason to include it if it was not a notable event scholars have pointed out that four sights are not mentioned in earliest texts in relation to gautama buddha but they are mentioned in one of those texts with regard to another buddha that is buddha nevertheless biographies connect this motif with gautama buddha from still a relatively early date and sutra also says that these events were repeated in life of every buddha earliest texts do mention that buddha reflected on aging sickness and death thereby overcoming delusion of eternal youth health and a long life and deciding to help humanity conquer aging sickness and death this part is most likely historical though it is unlikely that it was possible to raise young siddhartha as blissfully unaware as described in traditional texts it is clear from multiple early texts that confrontation with old age sickness and death was an important motivation in his renunciation in words of buddhist studies scholar peter harvey thumb great departure and temptation of buddha first half of 3rd century india andhra pradesh upright 75 bareau pointed out that four sights express moral shock of confrontation with reality in a legendary form moreover studying vinaya texts he found an episode with prince siddhartha as a child expressing wish to leave palace and family life which bareau believed was actual cause for rajas concern about his son leaving rather than prediction or four sights bareau dated this explanation to first century after buddha or even buddha himself 5th century bce whereas he dated four sights and motif of blissful youth to maurya period late 4th century bce and a century afterwards respectively he related these motifs to association of buddha with cakravartin which would have made most sense during rise of maurya empire connection between deities and previous buddhas on one hand and four sights on other hand bareau dated to end of 3rd century bce it was then applied to gautama buddha in 1st century bce or 1st century ce drawing from a theory by philologist buddhist studies scholar bhikkhu analayo argues on other hand that four sights might originate in pictorial depictions used in early buddhism for didactic purposes these are already mentioned in early texts and later generations might have taken these depictions literally with regard to restrictions enforced by suddhodana schumann said it is probable that raja tried to prevent his son from meeting with free thinking samana and wandering mendicants assembling in nearby parks siddhartha s departure at 29 years old is also seen as historical with regard to prince siddhartha s motivations in renouncing palace life at time of renunciation were under military threat by kingdom of kosala tribal republic as a political unit was gradually being replaced by larger kingdoms prince s sensitivity with regard to future of his clan may have further added to his decision scholars have hypothesized that siddhartha gautama conceived rahula to please his parents to obtain their permission for leaving palace and becoming a mendicant it was an indian custom to renounce world only after birth of a child or grandchild historian further speculated that siddhartha gautama only conceived a son thirteen years after his marriage because yasodhara initially did not want to bear a child for fear that he would leave palace and throne as soon as child was conceived although many traditional accounts of buddha s life relate that siddhartha left palace in secret early buddhist texts clearly state that his parents were aware of his choice as they are said to have wept at time their son left them motif of leaving palace without parents permission might also originate in early use of didactic canvases analayo argues way former prince renounces worldly life by shaving his hair and beard and putting on saffron robes may have already been a custom in those days and later became a standard buddhist custom mythological thumb upright prince siddhartha and kanthaka by tagore 1914 alt horse and man standing and looking at each other both extensively decorated with jewelry man wearing upright chinese pilgrim xuan zang 664 ce claimed that pillar of asoka marking lumbini was once decorated at top with a horse figure symbolizing great departure alt ancient stone pillar surrounded by a small fence covered with devotional clothes great renunciation was partly motivated by first meditation under tree when prince was still a child this meditation goes hand in hand with a shock at killing of animals which occurred during ploughing ceremony foucher argues that this account may have been affected by contempt which indian intellectuals had for agriculture buddhist studies scholar kate crosby argues that siddhartha conceiving or giving birth to a son before his renunciation functions as a motif to prove that he is best at each possible path in life after having tried life of a father to fullest he decides to leave it behind for a better alternative in early buddhist india being a father and bearing a son was seen as a spiritual and religious path as well as that of renouncing one s family and siddhartha s bringing a son in world before renunciation proves he is capable of both buddhist studies scholar john s strong hypothesizes that mulasarvastivada and mahavastu version of story of prince conceiving a child on eve of his departure was developed to prove that buddha was not physically disabled in some way a disability might have raised doubts about validity of his ordination in monastic tradition motif of sleeping harem preceding renunciation is widely considered by scholars to be modeled on story of a guild master and disciple of buddha who is depicted having a similar experience however it can also be found in hindu epic ramayana and scholar of religion alf hiltebeitel as well as folklorist mary brockington believe buddhacarita may have borrowed from it orientalist edward johnston did not want to make any statements about this however preferring to wait for more evidence though he did acknowledge that asvaghosa took pleasure in comparing buddha s renunciation with rama s leaving for forest hiltebeitel believes that such borrowing is not only about using poetic motifs but a conscious choice in order to compare dharma of buddha with dharma of brahmanism prince siddhartha s motivations in renunciation are explained in conversations with his relatives and other figures alluding explicitly and implicitly to motifs from ramayana in his analysis of indian literature scholar of religion graeme macqueen observes a recurring contrast between figure of king and that of ascetic who represent external and internal mastery respectively this contrast often leads to conflicting roles and aggression in buddhist stories in life of buddha this contrast can be found in two predictions in which prince siddhartha will either be a buddha or an all conquering king brekke notes that buddha chooses to change self instead of changing world as a king would do he chooses to try to understand essence of world and awaken to its truth strong argues that scene of double prediction after prince s birth serves to indicate that two aspects of character would continually operate in prince siddhartha s life on one hand that of king cakravartin divine descendant from and on other hand human being person who struggled to find spiritual truth on his path to enlightenment buddhist studies scholar points out two aspects of prince siddhartha s life narrative that co exist one one hand that of nearly perfect being who was born with full awareness whose life was only one life in a long series and who was surrounded by miraculous events on other hand human being who was emotionally shocked by old age and death and grew to full awareness and enlightenment both aspects are part of buddhist message of liberation horse kanthaka has an important role in accounts about great renunciation through several motifs accounts establish a close relationship between buddha s aspiration to bring living beings to enlightenment on one hand and carrying of prince siddhartha by kanthaka on other hand in several biographies of buddha s life a shrine is mentioned which was placed at point where kanthaka passed during great departure classicist edward j thomas 1869 1958 thought this shrine to be historical on a similar note xuan zang claimed that pillar of asoka which marks lumbini was once decorated at top with a horse figure which likely was kanthaka symbolizing great departure many scholars have argued that this is implausible however saying this horse figure makes little sense from a perspective of textual criticism or art history in art and ritual thumb great departure 18th century thailand left alt drawing copied from painting prince riding horse which is lifted by four figures with crowns on their head and surrounded by another four figures with crowns some of them with half animal half human faces upright 75 buddhist art scenes that are often depicted are four sights harem and yasodhara scene in which prince slips out of palace kanthaka dying lock of hair being picked up by deity sakra and brahma deity offering robes and other requisites scene in which prince siddhartha leaves palace riding kanthaka is frequently depicted in buddhist art of south and southeast asia in some depictions hooves of horse are supported by deities to prevent noise and wake up royal family in scenes of great departure there often is a figure depicted standing next to prince siddhartha holding a bow some scholars identify him as one of four heavenly kings in buddhist cosmology others identify him as indra king of second heaven in buddhism or chinese god of cosmos in some depictions chandaka clings to tail of prince siddhartha s horse departing from palace in gandharan art great renunciation is most popular episode of buddha s biography together with buddha s birth scene of great departure is often depicted in such art with sun and moon positioned opposite one another and a taurus symbol which scholars of iconography katsumi tanabe and gerd argue is indicative of event happening at midnight during full moon sometimes greek moon goddess selene or a veiled woman is also used to indicate night time gandharan reliefs connect departure with month of vaisakha following agamas some gandharan frontal depictions of great renunciation are likely to have been influenced by greco bactrian images of god helios and indian counterpart surya steps that prince siddhartha goes through when becoming a monk have become a model for ordination rituals for monastics cutting of hair removal of princely clothes and putting on monk s robes providing of etc therefore founding story of buddhism essentially becomes founding story of every buddhist monk or nun many buddhists for example shan people in myanmar commemorate prince siddhartha s departure in a procession which takes place during an ordination of a novice in which departure is reenacted there are also reenactments of scene in which mara tries to block prince role of mara being played by relatives or friends or reenactments of scenes in which deities encourage prince to leave palace on a similar note in thai ordinations of monks candidate monk to be sometimes rides on a horse in procession to ordination grounds in memory of prince siddhartha s departure relatives play role of mara in cambodia similar customs can be found with participants even playing role of indra of chandaka roles of other deities and army of mara strong has hypothesized that some of these ritual reenactments may have influenced traditional accounts again such as can be seen in motif of deities dressing up prince siddhartha before his departure and tonsure on a similar note there is a to develop detachment this may have affected narratives as can be seen in motif of musicians lying naked on floor before prince s renunciation besides rituals biographies may have been influenced by local accounts these accounts developed at pilgrimage sites dedicated to certain events in buddha s life such as great renunciation more official biographies integrated these local accounts connected to cultic life to authenticate certain buddha images as well as patrons and polities connected to them many buddhists celebrate great renunciation on vaisakha but in china event is celebrated on 8th day of second month of chinese calendar

balawhar wa budasf main character is horrified by his harem attendants and decides to leave his father s palace to seek spiritual fulfillment balawhar wa budasf would later be widely circulated and modified into story of legendary christian saints barlaam and josaphat being passed down through manichaeans islamic world and christian east from 11th century onward this story would in turn become very popular and would significantly affect western spiritual life its romantic and colorful setting as well as powerful structure of story caused it to enjoy a popularity attained perhaps by no other legend story would be translated in many languages including 13th century barlaam s saga in total over sixty versions of story were written in main languages of europe christian east and christian africa reaching nearly every country in christian world christian story of barlaam and josaphat starts out very similar to story of prince siddhartha but birth of prince is preceded by a discussion between his father indian king and a nobleman turned christian ascetic in this conversation ascetic points at limitations of worldly life in which no real satisfaction can be found after birth of prince josaphat double prediction of his possible future his growing up in a protected environment and first three of four sights he enters upon a personal crisis then he meets with ceylonese sage barlaam who introduces him to christian faith king attempts at first to fool his young son in understanding that barlaam has lost a debate with people in court but to no avail next he sends women to tempt prince but again unsuccessfully josaphat wishes to renounce worldly life and become an ascetic king manages to persuade his son to stay however by giving him half of his kingdom accepting offer king josaphat becomes a good king and his christian kingdom prospers more than that of his father who eventually converts after death of his father however josaphat gives up throne to become an ascetic as he originally intended and spends final years of his life with barlaam in ceylon it would take up until 1859 before well known western translators and scholars realized that story was derived from life of buddha although similarities had been noticed before by a less well known venetian editor and portuguese traveler in 15th and 16th centuries respectively although story has been passed on through different languages and countries some basic tenets of buddhism can still be found in it nature of duhkha in life as expressed in opening dialogue between nobleman and king cause of suffering being desire path of self analysis and self control which follows this realization and there are even some hints that point at ideals similar to buddhist nirvana modern edwin arnold 1832

british poet edwin arnold 1832 1904 to extent that it became subtitle of work work was based on chinese translation of abhiniskramana sutra focus on renunciation in life of buddha contributed to popularity of work as well as fact that arnold left out many miraculous details of traditional accounts to increase its appeal to a post darwinian audience moreover arnold s depiction of prince siddhartha as an active and compassionate truth seeker defying his father s will and leaving palace life went against stereotype of weak willed and fatalistic oriental but did conform with middle class values of time arnold also gave a much more prominent role to yasodhara than traditional sources having prince siddhartha explain his departure to his wife extensively and even respectfully circumambulating her before leaving light of asia therefore inclined both toward imperial appropriation and toward self effacing acknowledgment of other arnold s depiction of buddha s renunciation inspired other authors in their writings including american author theodore dreiser 1871 1945 and argentinian author jorge luis borges 1899 1986 jorge luis borges 1899 1986 alt young man in a suit thumb upright 7 borges was greatly influenced by story of renunciation of buddha and wrote several essays and a book about it emphasis on plot above character an aspects of epiphany and destiny

model of narrative borges based his works on light of asia as well as numerous translations of traditional buddhist texts borges saw in great renunciation anti thesis for realist novel a story in which mythological motif is more important than psychology of character and authorial anonymity is a key factor furthermore he saw in story proof of universal and archetypical nature of literature deriving from goethe s idea of morphology this biological theory presumed an archetypical intuitive unity behind all living forms borges presumed a similar idea in literature in which from only a small number of archetypes all literary forms and narratives could be derived to prove his point he connected great renunciation of buddha with arabian chinese and irish stories and explained that same motifs were at play for example motif of ascetic who shows meaninglessness of king s land and thereby destroys king s confidence comparative literature scholar dominique jullien concludes that story of great renunciation widespread narrative of king and ascetic is a confrontation between a powerful and powerless figure however powerless figure has last word leading to change and reform in king not only original story of prince siddhartha influenced modern writers derived story of barlaam and josaphat has much influenced russian writer leo tolstoy 1828 1910 indeed he went through a
