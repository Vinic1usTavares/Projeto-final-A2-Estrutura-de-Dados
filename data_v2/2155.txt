previously read three parchments authored by haddock s ancestor sir francis haddock duo had discovered coordinates to what they believe is treasure aboard sunken 17th century vessel unicorn near an unknown island an eccentric hard of hearing inventor named professor cuthbert calculus offers to aid them with use of his shark shaped one man submarine but they decline his assistance setting sail they are joined by police detectives thomson and thompson and soon discover that calculus has stowed away on board bringing his submarine with him when they reach coordinates shown on parchments there is no island in sight frustrated haddock ponders turning back but tintin soon realizes problem if sir francis had used a french chart instead of an english chart to calculate position coordinates would have been measured on paris meridian rather than greenwich meridian as they have been using greenwich meridian they realise that they are too far west after traveling to correct position they discover an unknown island which is located about 200 km north of hispaniola and 300 km east south east of turks and caicos islands there they find a statue of sir francis haddock and other evidence including parrots who still use haddock insults handed down from sir francis tintin deduces that francis haddock had taken refuge on island and that wreck of unicorn must be nearby they locate wreck

country estate marlinspike hall back in belgium calculus purchases hall using funds from sale of his submarine design and gives it to haddock tintin and haddock search house s cellars where tintin spots a statue of saint john evangelist holding a cross with a globe and eagle at its feet tintin suddenly remembers that francis haddock s original three parchments said for tis from light that light will dawn and then shines forth eagle s cross and realises that this message referred not to location of unicorn but to saint john eagle his traditional symbol tintin locates island on globe presses a secret button he finds there and discovers red rackham s treasure hidden inside sometime later haddock hosts an exhibition of treasure and several unicorn artefacts in marlinspike hall history background thumb german soldiers in eastern belgium in 1940 red rackham s treasure and secret of unicorn were both written while belgium was under german occupation red rackham s treasure was serialized amidst german occupation of belgium during world war ii herge had accepted a position working for belgium s largest francophone daily newspaper confiscated from its original owners was permitted by german authorities to reopen under directorship of belgian editor raymond de becker although it remained firmly under nazi control supporting german war effort and espousing anti semitism after joining on 15 october 1940 herge became editor of its new children s supplement with help of an old friend paul jamin and cartoonist jacques van melkebeke before paper shortages forced tintin to be serialised daily in main pages of some belgians were upset that herge was willing to work for a newspaper controlled by occupying nazi administration although he was heavily enticed by size of s readership which numbered some 600 000 faced with reality of nazi oversight herge abandoned overt political themes that had pervaded much of his earlier work instead adopting a policy of neutrality entertainment producer and author harry thompson observed that without need to satirise political types herge was now concentrating more on plot and on developing a new style of character comedy public reacted positively red rackham s treasure was second half of a two part story arc which had begun with previous adventure secret of unicorn this arc was first that herge had produced since cigars of pharaoh and blue lotus 1934 36 however as tintin expert michael farr related whereas cigars of pharaoh and blue lotus had been largely self sufficient and self contained connection between secret of unicorn and red rackham s treasure is far closer influences thumb upright left calculus was visually based upon scientist auguste piccard red rackham s treasure introduced professor cuthbert calculus to adventures of tintin who became a recurring character herge had made use of various eccentric professors in earlier volumes of series such as sophocles sarcophagus in cigars of pharaoh hector alembick in king ottokar s sceptre and decimus in shooting star all of whom prefigure arrival of calculus character s deafness had been inspired by a colleague whom herge had worked with years earlier at le vingtieme siecle visually calculus was based on a real scientist swiss inventor auguste piccard who had been first man to explore stratosphere in a hot air balloon in 1931 herge had observed piccard walking about brussels on a number of occasions however character of calculus would be notably much shorter than piccard herge named this character tryphon tournesol while surname meant sunflower forename was adopted from a carpenter named tryphon whom herge had encountered in tryphon tournesol was later renamed cuthbert calculus in english translation and balduin meaning little bee for german translation calculus shark shaped submarine was visually based on a real american submarine herge had seen a picture of this in a german newspaper diving suit worn in story was also based on clippings that herge had accumulated similarly dockside bar depicted by cartoonist was based on an illustration that he had collected shop where haddock and tintin buy diving equipment including suit was inspired from a picture of a bar which was featured in german magazine berliner illustrirte zeitung tribal effigy found on a caribbean island by sir francis haddock was based on a tribal statue from cameroon that herge saw in a museum sirius which had appeared before in shooting star was named after ss sirius first ship to cross atlantic ocean solely under steam power but was visually based upon design of a trawler john o 88 herge had sketched this ship in ostend docks before obtaining both detailed plans of trawler from builders jos boel son and a small scale model of it from a collector undersea wreck of unicorn was loosely inspired by images of wreck of a 17th century swedish vessel vasa which herge had collected instance in story in which a shark swallows a large box that characters hope contains treasure is based on a real account of a shark that swallowed a camera from american underwater photographer otis barton which herge had encountered in a french illustrated magazine brief appearance of dr who warns haddock to cease drinking alcohol was an allusion to herge s own physician dr herge made a comical reference to french comedian sacha guitry in story by advertising a play by guitry titled me in which guitry himself plays every role adventure was first to depict tintin wearing a white shirt under a blue sweater this would go on to become character s iconic costume publication thumb right herge deemed this frame from story to be one of his two favourites from entire adventures of tintin due to detail of its foreground midground and background action le tresor de rackham le rouge began serialisation as a daily strip in le soir from 19 february 1943 title of new adventure had been announced in an advertisement in newspaper two days previously in belgium it was then published in a 62 page book format by editions casterman in 1944 red rackham s treasure contained one of herge s two favourite illustrations from adventures of tintin it combines three actions encapsulating a sequence of events into one drawing haddock striding up beach in foreground tintin thomson and thompson bringing rowboat ashore in midground and sirius weighing anchor in background rather than immediately embark on creation of a new tintin adventure herge agreed to a proposal that le soir crime writer paul would author a detective story featuring thomson and thompson story was titled dupont et dupond detectives thomson and thompson detectives and was illustrated by herge secret of unicorn and red rackham s treasure were first two adventures of tintin to be published in standalone english language translations for british market as king ottokar s sceptre had previously been serialised in eagle in 1951 published by casterman in 1952 these two editions sold poorly and have since become rare collector s items they would be republished for british market seven years later this time by methuen with translations provided by michael turner and leslie lonsdale cooper farr reported that red rackham s treasure is best selling story in adventures of tintin while harry thompson referred to secret of unicorn red rackham s treasure arc as most successful of all tintin s adventures critical analysis harry thompson stated that secrets of unicorn red rackham s treasure arc marked beginning of third and central stage of tintin s career he furthermore stated that in these two stories tintin has been converted from a reporter into an explorer to cope with new political climate he stated that in this story herge abandons complex plotting of secret of unicorn in favour of an episodic style of adventure not seen since early books thompson further draws attention to arrival of calculus in story describing him as third and final member of tintin s family thompson was critical of use of colour in story stating that much of it looks better in black and white as it was originally printed in le soir thumb left alt photograph of a man pierre assouline seated with a microphone in his hand herge biographer pierre assouline believes red rackham s treasure reveal s herge at a new level in his art herge biographer benoit peeters observed that both secret of unicorn and red rackham s treasure hold a crucial position in adventures of tintin as it establishes tintin universe with its core set of characters he felt that while religious elements had been present in previous stories they were even stronger in secret of unicorn and its sequel something which he attributed to van melkebeke s influence peeters believed that red rackham s treasure was an unforgettable book because it is volume in which family meaning tintin snowy haddock and calculus all come together fellow biographer pierre assouline echoed this idea noting that herge had settled three characters in their new home focusing on character of calculus he noted that idea of eccentric professor was so universal that it would be inaccurate to point to any one source suggesting possible influences from charlie chaplin and herge s own father for assouline professor embodies gentle madness and subtle humour in comic strips he added that both red rackham s treasure and its predecessor reveal herge at a new level in his art and suggested that reason for their popularity lay in fact that they were visual continuation of a literary universe that stretches from jules verne to pierre benoit jean marc lofficier and randy lofficier opined that secret of unicorn red rackham s treasure arc represents a turning point for series as it shifts reader s attention from tintin to haddock who has become by far most interesting character they claim that introduction of calculus completes indispensable triangle that imbues tintin with its mythic quality asserting that here herge s art has reached a degree of near perfection they awarded it five stars out of five michael farr said that scene introducing calculus was a comic tour de force marking start of rich vein of humour that character brought to series noting that unlike shooting star this two book story arc contains scarcely an allusion to occupation and war he praised arc s narrative as perfectly paced without that feeling of haste present in some of herge s earlier work in his psychoanalytical study of adventures of tintin academic jean marie apostolides characterised secret of unicorn red rackham s treasure arc as being about characters going on a treasure hunt that turns out to be at same time a search for their roots he stated that arc revolves around haddock s ancestry and in doing so deals with meanings of symbolic relations within personal life he compared sir francis haddock to robinson crusoe and noted how caribbean natives deified sir francis haddock by erecting a statue of him in same manner that congolese deify tintin at end of tintin in congo highlighting that calculus is one of many eccentric scientists to appear in series apostolides nonetheless emphasises uniqueness of calculus by noting that character approaches tintin rather than tintin approaching him as young reporter had done with previous scientists commenting on introduction of calculus shark submarine apostolides states that it allows them to cross a boundary previously restricting human beings and to penetrate into another universe one beneath seas that holds secrets hitherto unknown ultimately he believes that by end of story family structure is in place with calculus representing a father figure with financial control and haddock and tintin who have become brothers through their joint adventure adding that with aid of francis haddock ancestor they are given a home at marlinspike hall literary critic tom mccarthy highlighted what he perceived as scenes in red rackham s treasure which reflected common themes in adventures of tintin he pointed out that in being a stowaway aboard ship calculus was one of many stowaways in series and that treasure represented theme of jewels and precious stones which also cropped up in broken ear tintin in congo and castafiore emerald he noted tintin s misreading of parchments and stated this was one of a number of calculation mistakes that character makes in series he suggested that a scene in which shark submarine pushes between haddock s buttocks was a form of sexual innuendo referencing anal sex highlighting similar innuendo in broken ear and crab with golden claws adaptations in 1957 animation company belvision studios produced herge s adventures of tintin a series of daily five minute colour adaptations based
