mallard or anas platyrhynchos is a dabbling duck that breeds throughout temperate and subtropical americas eurasia and north africa and has been introduced to new zealand australia peru brazil uruguay argentina chile colombia falkland islands and south africa this duck belongs to subfamily of waterfowl family anatidae male birds drakes have a glossy green head and are grey on their wings and belly while females hens or ducks have mainly brown speckled plumage both sexes have an area of white bordered black or iridescent blue feathers called a speculum on their wings males especially tend to have blue speculum feathers mallard is long of which body makes up around two thirds length wingspan is and bill is long it is often slightly heavier than most other dabbling ducks weighing mallards live in wetlands eat water plants and small animals and are social animals preferring to congregate in groups or flocks of varying sizes this species is main ancestor of most breeds of domesticated ducks female lays eight to 13 creamy white to greenish buff spotless eggs on alternate days incubation takes 27 to 28 days and fledging takes 50 to 60 days ducklings are precocial and fully capable of swimming as soon as they hatch mallard is considered to be a species of least concern by international union for conservation of nature iucn unlike many waterfowl mallards are considered an invasive species in some regions it is a very adaptable species being able to live and even thrive in urban areas which may have supported more localised sensitive species of waterfowl before development non migratory mallard with indigenous wild ducks of closely related species through genetic pollution by producing fertile offspring complete hybridisation of various species of wild duck gene pools could result in extinction of many indigenous waterfowl wild mallard is ancestor of most domestic ducks and its naturally evolved wild gene pool gets genetically polluted by domesticated and feral mallard populations taxonomy and evolutionary history thumb an american black duck top left and a male mallard bottom right in eclipse plumage mallard was one of many bird species originally described in 1758 of systema naturae by carl linnaeus he gave it two binomial names anas platyrhynchos and anas latter was generally preferred until 1906 when einar lonnberg established that a platyrhynchos had priority as it appeared on an earlier page in text scientific name comes from latin anas duck and ancient greek platyrhynchus broad billed from broad and rugkhos bill genome of anas platyrhynchos was sequenced in 2013 name mallard originally referred to any wild drake and it is sometimes still used this way it was derived from old french or for wild drake although its true derivation is unclear it may be related to or at least influenced by an old high german masculine proper name clues lying in alternate english forms or masle male has also been proposed as an influence mallards frequently interbreed with their closest relatives in genus anas such as american black duck and also with species more distantly related such as northern pintail leading to various hybrids that may be fully fertile this is quite unusual among such different species and is apparently because mallard evolved very rapidly and recently during late pleistocene distinct lineages of this radiation are usually kept separate due to non overlapping ranges and behavioural cues but have not yet reached point where they are fully genetically incompatible mallards and their domesticated conspecifics are also fully genetic analysis has shown that certain mallards appear to be closer to their indo pacific relatives while others are related to their american relatives mitochondrial dna data for d loop sequence suggests that mallards may have evolved in general area of siberia mallard bones rather abruptly appear in food remains of ancient humans and other deposits of fossil bones in europe without a good candidate for a local predecessor species large ice age that made up at least european and west asian populations during pleistocene has been named anas platyrhynchos mallards are differentiated in their mitochondrial dna between north american and eurasian populations but nuclear genome displays a notable lack of genetic structure haplotypes typical of american mallard relatives and can be found in mallards around bering sea aleutian islands hold a population of mallards that appear to be evolving towards a subspecies as gene flow with other populations is very limited also paucity of morphological differences between old world mallards and new world mallard demonstrates extent to which genome is shared among them such that birds like chinese spot billed duck are highly similar to old world mallard and birds such as hawaiian duck are highly similar to new world mallard size of mallard varies clinally for example birds from greenland though larger have smaller bills paler plumage and stockier bodies than birds further south and are sometimes classified as a separate subspecies greenland mallard a p description thumb juvenile male and female thumb upright iridescent speculum feathers of male thumb a group of mallards quacking thumb duckling mallard is a medium sized waterfowl species that is often slightly heavier than most other dabbling ducks it is which body makes up around two a wingspan of and weighs among standard measurements wing chord is bill is and tarsus is breeding male mallard is unmistakable with a glossy bottle green head and a white collar that demarcates head from purple tinged brown breast grey brown wings and a pale grey belly rear of male is black with white bordered dark tail feathers bill of male is a yellowish orange tipped with black with that of female generally darker and ranging from black to mottled orange and brown female mallard is predominantly mottled with each individual feather showing sharp contrast from buff to very dark brown a coloration shared by most female dabbling ducks and has buff cheeks eyebrow throat and neck with a darker crown and eye stripe both male and female mallards have distinct iridescent purple blue speculum feathers edged with white which are prominent in flight or at rest but temporarily shed during annual summer moult upon hatching plumage of duckling is yellow on underside and face with streaks by eyes and black on back with some yellow spots all way to top and back of head its legs and bill are also black as it nears a month in age duckling s plumage starts becoming drab looking more like female though more streaked and its legs lose their dark grey colouring two months after hatching fledgling period has ended and duckling is now a juvenile between three and four months of age juvenile can finally begin flying as its wings are fully developed for flight which can be confirmed by sight of purple speculum feathers its bill soon loses its dark grey colouring and its sex can finally be distinguished visually by three factors 1 bill is yellow in males but black and orange in females 2 breast feathers are reddish brown in males but brown in females and 3 in males centre tail feather drake feather is curled but in females centre tail feather is straight during final period of maturity leading up to adulthood 6 10 months of age plumage of female juveniles remains same while plumage of male juveniles gradually changes to its characteristic colours this change in plumage also applies to adult mallard males when they transition in and out of their non breeding eclipse plumage at beginning and end of summer moulting period adulthood age for mallards is fourteen months and average life expectancy is three years but they can live to twenty several species of duck have brown plumaged females that can be confused with female mallard female gadwall a strepera has an orange lined bill white belly black and white speculum that is seen as a white square on wings in flight and is a smaller bird more similar to female mallard in north america are american black duck a rubripes which is notably darker hued in both sexes than mallard and mottled duck a which is somewhat darker than female mallard and with slightly different bare part colouration and no white edge on speculum in captivity domestic ducks come in wild type plumages white and other colours most of these colour variants are also known in domestic mallards not bred as livestock but kept as pets aviary birds etc where they are rare but increasing in availability thumb owing to their highly malleable genetic code mallards can display a large amount of variation as seen here with this female who displays faded or apricot plumage a noisy species female has deep quack stereotypically associated with ducks male mallards make a sound phonetically similar to that of female a typical quack but it is a deep and raspy and can also sound like when incubating a nest or when offspring are present females vocalise differently making a call that sounds like a truncated version of usual quack they hiss if nest or offspring are threatened or interfered with when taking off wings of a mallard produce a characteristic faint whistling noise mallard is a rare example of both allen s rule and bergmann s rule in birds bergmann s rule which states that polar forms tend to be larger than related ones from warmer climates has numerous examples in birds as in case of greenland mallard which is larger than mallards further south allen s rule says that appendages like ears tend to be smaller in polar forms to minimise heat loss and larger in tropical and desert equivalents to facilitate heat diffusion and that polar taxa are stockier overall examples of this rule in birds are rare as they lack external ears but bill of ducks is supplied with a few blood vessels to prevent heat loss and as in greenland mallard bill is smaller than that of birds farther south illustrating rule due to variability of mallard s genetic code which gives it its vast interbreeding capability mutations in genes that decide plumage colour are very common and have resulted in a wide variety of hybrids such as brewer s duck mallard x gadwall anas strepera distribution and habitat thumb male mallard is widely distributed across northern and southern hemispheres in north america its range extends from southern and central alaska to mexico hawaiian islands across eurasia from iceland and southern greenland and parts of morocco north africa in west scandinavia and britain to north and to siberia japan and south korea in east south eastern and south western australia and new zealand in southern hemisphere it is strongly migratory in northern parts of its breeding range and winters farther south for example in north america it winters south to southern united states and northern mexico but also regularly strays into central america and caribbean between september and may a drake later named trevor attracted media attention in 2018 when it turned up on island of niue an atypical location for mallards mallard inhabits a wide range of habitats and climates from arctic tundra to subtropical regions it is found in both fresh and salt water wetlands including parks small ponds rivers lakes and estuaries as well as shallow inlets and open sea within sight of coastline water depths of less than are preferred with birds avoiding areas more than a few metres deep they are attracted to bodies of water with aquatic vegetation behaviour feeding mallard is omnivorous and very flexible in its choice of food its diet may vary based on several factors including stage of breeding cycle short term variations in available food nutrient availability and interspecific and intraspecific competition majority of mallard s diet seems to be made up of gastropods invertebrates including beetles flies lepidopterans dragonflies and caddisflies crustaceans worms many varieties of seeds and plant matter and roots and tubers during breeding season male birds were recorded to have eaten 37 6 animal matter and 62 4 plant matter most notably echinochloa galli and females ate 37 0 animal matter and 63 0 plant matter while laying females ate 71 9 animal matter and only 28 1 plant matter plants generally make up larger part of a bird s diet especially during autumn migration and in winter mallard usually feeds by dabbling for plant food or grazing there are reports of it eating frogs however in 2017 a flock of mallards in romania were observed hunting small migratory birds including grey wagtail and black redstart first documented occasion they had been seen attacking and consuming large vertebrates it usually nests on a river bank but not always near water it is highly gregarious outside of breeding season and forms large flocks which are known as breeding thumb female mallard with five ducklings mallards usually form pairs in october and november in northern hemisphere until female lays eggs at start of nesting season which is around beginning of spring at this time she is left by male who joins up with other males to await moulting period which begins in june in northern hemisphere during brief time before this however males are still sexually potent and some of them either remain on standby to sire replacement clutches for female mallards that have lost or abandoned their previous clutch or forcibly mate with females that appear to be isolated or unattached regardless of their species and whether or not they have a brood of ducklings thumb egg collection museum wiesbaden egg clutches number 8 13 creamy white to greenish buff eggs free of speckles they measure about in length and in width eggs are laid on alternate days and incubation begins when clutch is almost complete incubation takes 27 and fledging takes 50 ducklings are precocial and fully capable of swimming as soon as they hatch however filial imprinting compels them to instinctively stay near mother not only for warmth and protection but also to learn about and remember their habitat as well as how and where to forage for food when ducklings mature into flight capable juveniles they learn about and remember their traditional migratory routes unless they are born and raised in captivity thumb drake mallard performing grunt whistle during breeding season both male and female mallards can become aggressive driving off competitors to themselves or their mate by charging at them males tend to fight more than females and attack each other by repeatedly pecking at their rival s chest ripping out feathers and even skin on rare occasions drakes that end up being left out after others have paired off with mating partners sometimes target an isolated female duck even one of a different species and proceed to chase and peck at her until she weakens at which point males take turns copulating with female 1961 calls this behaviour attempted rape flight and stanley cramp and k e l simmons 1977 speak of rape intent flights male mallards also occasionally chase other male ducks of a different species and even each other in same way in one documented case of homosexual necrophilia a male mallard copulated with another male he was chasing after chased male died upon flying into a glass window this paper was awarded an ig nobel prize in 2003 mallards are opportunistically targeted by brood parasites occasionally having eggs laid in their nests by redheads ruddy ducks lesser gadwalls northern northern pintails cinnamon teal common goldeneyes and other mallards these eggs are generally accepted when they resemble eggs of host mallard but hen may attempt to eject them or even abandon nest if parasitism occurs during egg laying predators and threats mallards of all ages but especially young ones and in all locations must contend with a wide diversity of predators including raptors mustelids corvids snakes raccoons opossums skunks turtles large fish felids and canids including domesticated ones most prolific natural predators of adult mallards are red foxes which most often pick off brooding females and faster or larger birds of prey e g peregrine falcons aquila eagles or haliaeetus eagles in north america adult mallards face no fewer than 15 species of birds of prey from northern harriers and short eared owls both smaller than a mallard to huge bald and golden eagles and about a dozen species of mammalian predator not counting several more avian and mammalian predators who threaten eggs and nestlings mallards are also preyed upon by other waterside apex predators such as grey heron european herring gull wels catfish and northern pike crows corvus are also known to kill ducklings and adults on occasion also mallards may be attacked by larger anseriformes such as swans cygnus and geese during breeding season and are frequently driven off by these birds over territorial disputes mute swans cygnus have been known to attack or even kill mallards if they feel that ducks pose a threat to their offspring predation avoidance behavior of sleeping with one eye open allowing one brain hemisphere to remain aware while other half sleeps was first demonstrated in mallards although it is believed to be widespread among birds in general status and conservation thumb illustration by carl friedrich 1875 thumb thumbtime 1 several drakes swim in a pond since 1998 mallard has been rated as a species of least concern on iucn red list of endangered species this is because it has a large range more than 20 000 000 km2 7 700 000 mi2 and because its population is increasing rather than declining by 30 over ten years or three generations and thus is not warranted a vulnerable rating also population size of mallard is very large unlike many waterfowl mallards have benefited from human alterations to much so that they are now considered an invasive species in some regions they are a common sight in urban parks lakes ponds and other human made water features in regions they inhabit and are often tolerated or encouraged in human habitat due to their placid nature towards humans and their beautiful and iridescent colours while most are not domesticated mallards are so successful at coexisting in human regions that main conservation risk they pose comes from loss of genetic diversity among a region s traditional ducks once humans and mallards colonise an area mallards are very adaptable being able to live and even thrive in urban areas which may have supported more localised sensitive species of waterfowl before development release of feral mallards in areas where they are not native sometimes creates problems through interbreeding with indigenous waterfowl these non migratory mallards interbreed with indigenous wild ducks from local populations of closely related species through genetic pollution by producing fertile offspring complete hybridisation of various species of wild duck gene pools could result in extinction of many indigenous waterfowl wild mallard itself is ancestor of most domestic ducks and its naturally evolved wild gene pool gets genetically polluted in turn by domesticated and feral populations over time a continuum of hybrids ranging between almost typical examples of either species develop speciation process is beginning to reverse itself this has created conservation concerns for relatives of mallard such as hawaiian duck new zealand grey duck a s superciliosa subspecies of pacific black duck american black duck mottled duck meller s duck yellow billed duck and mexican duck in latter case even leading to a dispute as to whether these birds should be considered a species and thus entitled to more conservation research and funding or included in mallard species ecological changes and hunting have also led to a decline of local species for example new zealand grey duck population declined drastically due to overhunting in mid 20th century hybrid offspring of hawaiian ducks seem to be less well adapted to native habitat and using them in re introduction projects apparently reduces success in summary problems of mallards hybridising away relatives is more a consequence of local ducks declining than of mallards spreading allopatric speciation and isolating behaviour have produced today s diversity of mallard like ducks despite fact that in most if not all of these populations hybridisation must have occurred to some extent invasiveness thumb last male mariana are causing severe genetic pollution to south africa s biodiversity by breeding with endemic ducks even though agreement on conservation of african eurasian migratory waterbirds an agreement to protect local waterfowl populations applies to mallard as well as other ducks hybrids of mallards and yellow billed duck are fertile capable of producing hybrid offspring if this continues only hybrids occur and in long term result in extinction of various indigenous waterfowl mallard duck can cross breed with 63 other species posing a severe threat to indigenous waterfowl s genetic integrity mallards and their hybrids compete with indigenous birds for resources including nest sites roosting sites and food availability of mallards mallard ducklings and fertilised mallard eggs for public sale and private ownership either as poultry or as pets is currently legal in united states except for state of florida which has currently banned domestic ownership of mallards this is to prevent hybridisation with native mottled duck mallard is considered an invasive species in new zealand where it competes with local new zealand grey duck which was in past there and elsewhere mallards are spreading with increasing urbanisation and hybridising with local relatives eastern or chinese spot billed duck is currently into mallard populations of primorsky krai possibly due to habitat changes from global warming mariana mallard was a resident allopatric population in most respects a good species apparently initially derived from mallard pacific black duck hybrids unfortunately it became extinct in late 20thcentury laysan duck is an insular relative of mallard with a very small and fluctuating population mallards sometimes arrive on its island home during migration and can be expected to occasionally have remained and with laysan ducks as long as these species have existed however these hybrids are less well adapted to peculiar ecological conditions of laysan island than local ducks and thus have lower fitness laysan ducks were found throughout hawaiian archipelago before after which they suffered a rapid decline during polynesian colonisation now their range includes only laysan island it is one of successfully translocated birds after having become nearly extinct in early 20thcentury relationship with humans domestication mallards have often been ubiquitous in their regions among ponds rivers and streams of human parks farms and other human made to point of visiting water features in human courtyards thumb george hetzel mallard still life painting 1883 1884 mallards have had a long relationship with humans almost all domestic duck breeds derive from mallard with exception of a few muscovy breeds mallards are generally monogamous while domestic ducks are mostly polygamous domestic ducks have no territorial behaviour and are less aggressive than mallards domestic ducks are mostly kept for meat their eggs are also eaten and have a strong flavor they were first domesticated in southeast asia at least 4 000 years ago during neolithic age and were also farmed by romans in europe and malays in asia as domestic duck and mallard are same species as each other it is common for mallards to mate with domestic ducks and produce hybrid offspring that are fully fertile because of this mallards have been found to be contaminated with genes of domestic duck while keeping of domestic breeds is more popular pure bred mallards are sometimes kept for eggs and meat although they may require wing clipping to restrict flying or training to navigate and fly home hunting mallards are one of most common varieties of ducks hunted as a sport ideal location for hunting mallards is considered to be where water level is somewhat shallow hunting mallards might cause population to decline in some places at some times and with some populations in certain countries mallard may be legally shot but is protected under national acts and policies for example in united kingdom mallard is protected under wildlife and countryside act 1981 which restricts certain hunting methods or taking or killing mallards as food since ancient times mallard has been eaten as food wild mallard was eaten in neolithic greece usually only breast and thigh meat is eaten it does not need to be hung before preparation and is often braised or roasted sometimes flavoured with bitter orange or with port references external links category anas category birds described in 1758 category ducks category migratory birds eastern
