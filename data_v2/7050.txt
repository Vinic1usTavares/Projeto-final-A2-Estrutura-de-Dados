nipples themes reviewers agree that skin bone is as much about los angeles and film industry as it is about prostitution or even homosexuality writing in bright lights film journal critic gary morris suggests that film is inevitably set in los angeles amid that city s arid strip malls newsstands and endless dusty streets and he points to significance of ghislaine s constant movement through city looking glamorous and inscrutable in her opaque sunglasses for anita gates in new york times film s strongest message is a questioning of actor s trade for gates film comes to sympathize with harry s notion that prostitutes are in fact actors or perhaps vice versa mr lewis s point seems to be that it s all same what s big difference he asks between acting out fantasies of one rich old man or those of a few million ticket buyers lewis himself seems to give some weight to these interpretations when he describes skin bone as being about giving your soul away and rationalizing loss as a bonus and as a metaphor for experiences i suffered attempting to make a film at an evil film company production and style lewis became interested in making a film about hustlers because despite there being films about hustlers dating back more than three decades he had never seen such a film in lewis s own words when i started there were no hustler movies and now there s a whole genre his original concept for skin bone was that it would be a series of 70 one minute shots lewis changed his mind about concept following some improvisation with actor b wyatt in creating harry character much of film was improvised after a year of filming improvisation sessions lewis wrote some scripted material to provide some story structure shooting took several years to complete because film was almost entirely self financed film alternates between color and black and white sequences black and white usually denotes that scene involves one or more of hustlers engaged with a client and indicates that one or more of characters not necessarily client is fantasizing but scheme is not always consistent for example when dean has sex with paralyzed client scene is in color and harry also has an s m scene that s all in color although his client never appears on screen equally harry s fantasies about lovely girl who is apparently dead are occasionally in color in their final scene harry and dean are in black and white but when client and ghislaine are shown watching they re in color raising question of exactly who is having fantasy according to lewis convention grew out of fact that initial improvised sequences were shot in black and white he acknowledges that by end distinction had become very confused film features a number of songs by queercore band pansy division david arquette has a cameo appearance as buzz head one of ghislaine s regular clients arquette himself played a hustler in film johns also released in 1996 critical reception reviews for skin bone were decidedly mixed new york times called it a bleak disjointed movie that often comes across as if it had been planned like a pornographic feature director lewis is praised however for effectively mix ing us up as to what s real and what isn t bright lights film journal had stronger words of praise for film calling it intense and sometimes unsettling with a conceptual richness and mocking wit while also noting element of genuine pathos that runs beneath sardonic wit and brutal sometimes lethal sex village voice was much more dismissive panning film as fitfully comic pitifully pretentious soap opera that runs out of promise so quickly that only most tenacious or desperate viewers will hang on till sorry end echoing voice tv guide while praising lewis s icy style nonetheless suggests that film is a half hour too long and doesn t really offer much to justify its existence beyond obvious titillation one near unanimous critical note concerns nicole dillenberg s performance as ghislaine while actors playing three hustlers are variously described as really quite competent and game gesturally hip and highly empathic dillenberg is judged too callow for ghislaine and stiffly plying monotonous attitude in lieu of creating a real character rather like a female impersonation of female impersonator jackie beat see also male prostitution in arts references external links category 1996 films category american crime
