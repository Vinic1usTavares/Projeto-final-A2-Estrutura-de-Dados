and was characterized by an environment of overly high government structural deficits and accelerating debt levels when as a negative repercussion of great recession relatively fragile banking sector had suffered large capital losses most states in europe had to bail out several of their most affected banks with some supporting recapitalization loans because of strong linkage between their survival and financial stability of economy as of january 2009 a group of 10 central and eastern european banks had already asked for a bailout at time european commission released a forecast of a 1 8 decline in eu economic output for 2009 making outlook for banks even worse many public funded bank were one reason behind sharply deteriorated debt to gdp ratios experienced by several european

of crisis from outbreak of crisis to fragmented european federation new york and heidelberg springer p 274 in first few weeks of 2010 there was renewed anxiety about excessive national debt with lenders demanding ever higher interest rates from several countries with higher debt levels deficits and current account deficits this in turn made it difficult for four out of eighteen eurozone governments to finance further budget deficits and repay or refinance existing government debt particularly when economic growth rates were low and when a high percentage of debt was in hands of foreign creditors as in case of greece and portugal states that were adversely affected by crisis faced a strong rise in interest rate spreads for government bonds as a result of investor concerns about their future debt sustainability four eurozone states had to be rescued by sovereign bailout programs which were provided jointly by international monetary fund and european commission with additional support at technical level from european central bank together these three international organisations representing bailout creditors became nicknamed troika to fight crisis some governments have focused on raising taxes and lowering expenditures which contributed to social unrest and significant debate among economists many of whom advocate greater deficits when economies are struggling especially in countries where budget deficits and sovereign debts have increased sharply a crisis of confidence has emerged with widening of bond yield spreads and risk insurance on cds

public debt by 2007 i e before global financial crisis of 2007 2008 it was still one of fastest growing in eurozone with a public debt to gdp that did not exceed 104 but it was associated with a large structural deficit as world economy was hit by financial crisis of 2007 08 greece was hit especially hard because its main industries shipping and tourism were especially sensitive to changes in business cycle government spent heavily to keep economy functioning and country s debt increased accordingly turmoil of great recession lead budget deficits of several western nations to reach or exceed 10 of gdp what was exceptional for greece was that high budget deficit which after several corrections was revealed that it had been allowed to reach 10 2 and 15 1 of gdp in 2008 and 2009 respectively was simultaneously coupled with a high public debt to gdp ratio which until then was relatively stable for several years at just above 100 of gdp as calculated after all corrections thus country appeared to lose control of its public debt to gdp ratio which already reached 127 of gdp in 2009 in addition being a member of eurozone country had essentially no autonomous monetary policy flexibility finally a role was played by controversies about greek statistics due to aforementioned revisions and possibly by an effect of media reports consequently greece was punished by markets which increased borrowing rates making impossible for country to finance its debt despite drastic upwards revision of forecast for 2009 budget deficit in october 2009 greek borrowing rates initially rose rather slowly by april 2010 it was apparent that country was becoming unable to borrow from markets on 23 april 2010 greek government requested an initial loan of from eu and international

unrest throughout greece troika a tripartite committee formed by european commission european central bank and international monetary fund ec ecb and imf offered greece a second bailout loan worth in october 2011 second economic adjustment programme but with activation being conditional on implementation of further austerity measures and a debt restructure agreement surprisingly greek prime minister george papandreou first answered that call by announcing a december 2011 referendum on new bailout plan but had to back down amidst strong pressure from eu partners who threatened to withhold an overdue loan payment that greece needed by mid december on 10 november 2011 papandreou resigned following an agreement with new democracy party and popular orthodox rally to appoint non mp technocrat lucas as new prime minister of an interim national union government with responsibility for implementing needed austerity measures to pave way for second bailout loan all implemented austerity measures have helped greece bring down its primary deficit i e fiscal deficit before interest payments from eur24 7bn 10 6 of gdp in 2009 to just eur5 2bn 2 4 of gdp in 2011 but as a side effect they also contributed to a worsening of greek recession which began in october 2008 and only became worse in 2010 and 2011 greek gdp had its worst decline in 2011 with 6 9 a year where seasonal adjusted industrial output ended 28 4 lower than in 2005 and with 111 000 greek companies going bankrupt 27 higher than in 2010 as a result greeks have lost about 40 of their purchasing power since

2012 an imf official negotiating greek austerity measures admitted that excessive spending cuts were harming greece imf predicted greek economy to contract by 5 5 by 2014 harsh austerity measures led to an actual contraction after six years of recession of 17 some economic experts argue that best option for greece and rest of eu would be to engineer an orderly default allowing athens to withdraw simultaneously from eurozone and reintroduce its national currency drachma at a debased rate if greece were to leave euro economic and political consequences would be devastating according to japanese financial company nomura an exit would lead to a 60 devaluation of new drachma analysts at french bank bnp paribas added that fallout from a greek exit would wipe 20 off greece s gdp increase greece s debt to gdp ratio to over 200 and send inflation soaring to 40 50 also ubs warned of hyperinflation a bank run and even military coups and possible civil war that could afflict a departing country eurozone national central banks may lose up to in debt claims against greek national bank through ecb s system deutsche bundesbank alone may have to write off to prevent this from happening troika ec

3bn in 2012 and another eur10bn in 2013 and 2014 then in march 2012 greek government did finally default on parts of its debt as there was a new law passed by government so that private holders of greek government bonds banks insurers and investment funds would voluntarily accept a bond swap with a 53 5 nominal write off partly in short term efsf notes partly in new greek bonds with lower interest rates and maturity prolonged to 11 30 years independently of previous maturity this counted as a credit event and holders of credit default swaps were paid accordingly it was world s biggest debt restructuring deal ever done affecting some of greek government bonds debt write off had a size of and caused greek debt level to temporarily fall from roughly to in march 2012 it would

scheduled eurozone bailout tranche in december 2014 and about a potential update of its remaining bailout programme for 2015 16 when calculating impact of 2015 fiscal budget presented by greek government there was a disagreement with calculations of greek government showing it fully complied with goals of its agreed midterm fiscal plan 2013 16 while troika calculations were less optimistic and returned a not covered financing gap at eur2 5bn being required to be covered by additional austerity measures as greek government insisted their calculations were more accurate than those presented by troika they submitted an unchanged fiscal budget bill on 21 november to be voted for by parliament on 7 december eurogroup was scheduled to meet and discuss updated review of greek

first three quarters of 2014 was replaced by a new fourth recession starting in q4 2014 this new fourth recession was widely assessed as being direct related to premature snap parliamentary election called by greek parliament in december 2014 and following formation of a led government refusing to accept respecting terms of its current bailout agreement rising political uncertainty of what would follow caused troika to suspend all scheduled remaining aid to greece under its second programme until such time as greek government either accepted previously negotiated conditional payment terms or alternatively could reach a mutually accepted agreement of some new updated terms with its public creditors this rift caused a renewed increasingly growing liquidity crisis both for greek government and greek financial system resulting in plummeting stock prices at athens stock exchange while interest rates for greek government at private lending market spiked to levels once again making it inaccessible as an alternative funding source faced by threat of a sovereign default and potential resulting exit of eurozone some final attempts were made by greek government in may 2015 to settle an

competitiveness through internal devaluation a painful economic adjustment process where a country aims to reduce its unit labour costs german economist hans werner sinn noted in 2012 that ireland was only country that had implemented relative wage moderation in last five years which helped decrease its relative price wage levels by 16 greece would need to bring this figure down by 31 effectively reaching level of turkey by 2012 wages in greece had been cut to a level last seen in late 1990s purchasing power dropped even more to level of 1986 similarly salaries in italy fell to 1986 levels and consumption fell to level of 1950 other economists argue that no matter how much greece and portugal drive down their wages they could never compete with low cost developing countries such as china or india instead weak european countries must shift their economies to higher quality products and services though this is a long term process and may not bring immediate relief fiscal devaluation another option would be to implement fiscal devaluation based on an idea originally developed by john maynard keynes in 1931 keynes j m 1931 addendum to great britain committee on finance and industry

contributions while offsetting loss of government revenues through higher taxes on consumption vat and pollution i e by pursuing an ecological tax reform germany has successfully pushed its economic competitiveness by increasing value added tax vat by three percentage points in 2007 and using part of additional revenues to lower employer s unemployment insurance contribution portugal has taken a similar stance and also france appears to follow this suit in november 2012 french president francois hollande announced plans to reduce tax burden of corporate sector by within three years while increasing standard vat from 19 6 to 20 and introducing additional eco taxes in 2016 to minimise negative effects of such policies on purchasing power and economic activity french government will partly offset tax hikes by decreasing employees social security contributions by and by reducing lower vat for convenience goods necessities from 5 5 to 5 progress thumb upright 1 35 alt eurozone

2011 according to report most critical eurozone member countries are in process of rapid reforms authors note that many of those countries most in need to adjust are now making greatest progress towards restoring their fiscal balance and external competitiveness greece ireland and spain are among top five reformers and portugal is ranked seventh among 17 countries included in report see graph in its euro plus monitor report 2012 published in november 2012 lisbon council finds that eurozone has slightly improved its overall health with exception of greece all eurozone crisis countries are either close to point where they have achieved major adjustment or are likely to get there over course of 2013 portugal and italy are expected to progress to turnaround stage in spring 2013 possibly followed by spain in autumn while fate of greece continues to hang in balance overall authors suggest that if eurozone gets through current acute crisis and stays on reform path it could eventually emerge from crisis as most dynamic of major western economies euro plus monitor update from spring 2013 notes that eurozone remains on right track according to authors almost all vulnerable countries in need of adjustment are slashing their underlying fiscal deficits and improving their external competitiveness at an impressive speed for which they expected eurozone crisis to be over by end of

account imbalances of eurozone countries from 1997 to 2018 animated graph of current account imbalances since 1999 regardless of corrective measures chosen to solve current predicament as long as cross border capital flows remain unregulated in euro area current account imbalances are likely to continue a country that runs a large current account or trade deficit i e importing more than it exports must ultimately be a net importer of capital this is a mathematical identity called balance of payments in other words a country that imports more than it exports must either decrease its savings reserves or borrow to pay for those imports conversely germany s large trade surplus net export position means that it must either increase its savings reserves or be a net exporter of capital lending money to other countries to allow them to buy german goods 2009 trade deficits for italy spain greece and portugal were estimated to be 42 75 31bn and 35 and 25 6bn respectively while germany s trade surplus was 188 6bn a similar imbalance exists in us which runs a large trade deficit net import position and therefore is a net borrower of capital from abroad ben warned of risks of such imbalances in 2005 arguing that a savings glut in one country with a trade surplus can drive capital into other countries with trade deficits artificially lowering interest rates and creating asset bubbles a country with a large trade surplus would generally see value of its currency appreciate relative to other currencies which would reduce imbalance as relative price of its exports increases this currency appreciation occurs as importing country sells its currency to buy exporting country s currency used to purchase goods alternatively trade imbalances can be reduced if a country encouraged domestic saving by restricting or penalising flow of capital across borders or by raising interest rates although this benefit is likely offset by slowing down economy and increasing government interest payments either way many of countries involved in crisis are on euro so devaluation individual interest rates and capital controls are not available only solution left to raise a country s level of saving is to reduce budget deficits and to change consumption and savings habits for example if a country s citizens saved more instead of consuming imports this would reduce its trade deficit it has therefore been suggested that countries with large trade deficits e g greece consume less and improve their exporting industries on other hand export driven countries with a large trade surplus such as germany austria and netherlands would need to shift their economies more towards domestic services and increase wages to support domestic consumption economic evidence indicates crisis may have more to do with trade deficits which require private borrowing to fund than public debt levels economist paul krugman wrote in march 2013 really strong relationship within eurozone countries is between interest spreads and current account deficits which is in line with conclusion many of us have reached that euro area crisis is really a balance of payments crisis not a debt crisis a february 2013 paper from four economists concluded that countries with debt above 80 of gdp and persistent current account trade deficits are vulnerable to a rapid fiscal deterioration progress in its spring 2012 economic forecast european commission finds some evidence that current account rebalancing is underpinned by changes in relative prices and competitiveness positions as well as gains in export market shares and expenditure switching in deficit countries in may 2012 german finance minister wolfgang has signalled support for a significant increase in german wages to help decrease current account imbalances within eurozone according to euro plus monitor report 2013 collective current account of greece ireland italy portugal and spain is improving rapidly and is expected to balance by mid 2013 thereafter these countries as a group would no longer need to import capital in 2014 current account surplus of eurozone as a whole almost doubled compared to previous year reaching a new record high of 227 9bn euros mobilisation of credit several proposals were made in mid 2012 to purchase debt of distressed european countries such as spain and italy markus brunnermeier economist graham bishop and daniel gros were among those advancing proposals finding a formula which was not simply backed by germany is central in crafting an acceptable and effective remedy commentary us president barack obama stated in june 2012 right now europe s focus has to be on strengthening their overall banking system making a series of decisive actions that give people confidence that banking system is solid in addition they re going to have to look at how do they achieve growth at same time as they re carrying out structural reforms that may take two or three or five years to fully accomplish so countries like spain and italy for example have embarked on some smart structural reforms that everybody thinks are necessary everything from tax collection to labour markets to a whole host of different issues but they ve got to have time and space for those steps to succeed and if they are just cutting and cutting and cutting and their unemployment rate is going up and up and up and people are pulling back further from spending money because they re feeling a lot of pressure ironically that can actually make it harder for them to carry out some of these reforms over long term i n addition to sensible ways to deal with debt and government finances there s a parallel discussion that s taking place among european leaders to figure out how do we also encourage growth and show some flexibility to allow some of these reforms to really take root economist wrote in june 2012 outside germany a consensus has developed on what mrs merkel must do to preserve single currency it includes shifting from austerity to a far greater focus on economic growth complementing single currency with a banking union with euro wide deposit insurance bank oversight and joint means for recapitalisation or resolution of failing banks and embracing a limited form of debt mutualisation to create a joint safe asset and allow peripheral economies room gradually to reduce their debt burdens this is refrain from washington beijing london and indeed most of capitals of euro zone why hasn t continent s politician sprung into action proposed long term solutions european fiscal union crisis is pressuring euro to move beyond a regulatory state and towards a more federal eu with fiscal powers increased european integration giving a central body increased control over budgets of member states was proposed on 14 june 2012 by jens weidmann president of deutsche bundesbank expanding on ideas first proposed by jean claude trichet former president of european central bank control including requirements that taxes be raised or budgets cut would be exercised only when fiscal imbalances developed this proposal is similar to contemporary calls by angela merkel for increased political and fiscal union which would allow europe oversight possibilities european bank recovery and resolution authority european banks are estimated to have incurred losses approaching eur1 trillion between outbreak of financial crisis in 2007 and 2010 european commission approved some eur4 5 trillion in state aid for banks between october 2008 and october 2011 a sum which includes value of taxpayer funded recapitalisations and public guarantees on banking debts this has prompted some economists such as joseph stiglitz and paul krugman to note that europe is not suffering from a sovereign debt crisis but rather from a banking crisis on 6 june 2012 european commission adopted a legislative proposal for a harmonised bank recovery and resolution mechanism proposed framework sets out necessary steps and powers to ensure that bank failures across eu are managed in a way that avoids financial instability new legislation would give member states power to impose losses resulting from a bank failure on bondholders to minimise costs for taxpayers proposal is part of a new scheme in which banks will be compelled to bail in their creditors whenever they fail basic aim being to prevent taxpayer funded bailouts in future public authorities would also be given powers to replace management teams in banks even before lender fails each institution would also be obliged to set aside at least one per cent of deposits covered by their national guarantees for a special fund to finance resolution of banking crisis starting in 2018 eurobonds a growing number of investors and economists say eurobonds would be best way of solving a debt crisis though their introduction matched by tight financial and budgetary co ordination may well require changes in eu treaties on 21 november 2011 european commission suggested that eurobonds issued jointly by 17 euro nations would be an effective way to tackle financial crisis using term stability bonds jose manuel barroso insisted that any such plan would have to be matched by tight fiscal surveillance and economic policy coordination as an essential counterpart so as to avoid moral hazard and ensure sustainable public finances germany remains largely opposed at least in short term to a collective takeover of debt of states that have run excessive budget deficits and borrowed excessively over past years european safe bonds a group of economists from princeton university suggest a new form of european safe bonds esbies i e bundled european government bonds 70 senior bonds 30 junior bonds in form of a union wide safe asset without joint liability according to authors esbies would be at least as safe as german bonds and approximately double supply of euro safe assets when protected by a 30 thick junior tranche esbies could be issued by public or private sector entities and would weaken diabolic loop and its diffusion across countries it requires no significant change in treaties or legislation in 2017 idea was picked up by european central bank european commission has also shown interest and plans to include esbies in a future white paper dealing with aftermath of financial crisis european commission has recently introduced a proposal to introduce what it calls sovereign bond backed securities which are essentially same as esbies and european parliament endorsed changes in regulations necessary to facilitate these securities in april 2019 european monetary fund on 20 october 2011 austrian institute of economic research published an article that suggests transforming efsf into a european monetary fund emf which could provide governments with fixed interest rate eurobonds at a rate slightly below medium term economic growth in nominal terms these bonds would not be tradable but could be held by investors with emf and liquidated at any time given backing of all eurozone countries and ecb emu would achieve a similarly strong position vis a vis financial investors as us where fed backs government bonds to an unlimited extent to ensure fiscal discipline despite lack of market pressure emf would operate according to strict rules providing funds only to countries that meet fiscal and macroeconomic criteria governments lacking sound financial policies would be forced to rely on traditional national governmental bonds with less favourable market rates econometric analysis suggests that if short term and long term interest rates in euro area were stabilised at 1 5 and 3 respectively aggregate output gdp in euro area would be 5 percentage points above baseline in 2015 at same time sovereign debt levels would be significantly lower with e g greece s debt level falling below 110 of gdp more than 40 percentage points below baseline scenario with market based interest levels furthermore banks would no longer be able to benefit unduly from intermediary profits by borrowing from ecb at low rates and investing in government bonds at high rates

likely continue to grow reaching between 250 for italy and about 600 for japan by 2040 a bis study released in june 2012 warns that budgets of most advanced economies excluding interest payments would need 20 consecutive years of surpluses exceeding 2 per cent of gross domestic product starting now just to bring debt to gdp ratio back to its pre crisis level same authors found in a previous study that increased financial burden imposed by ageing populations and lower growth makes it unlikely that indebted economies can grow out of their debt problem if only one of following three conditions is met government debt is more than 80 to 100 of gdp non financial corporate debt is more than 90 of gdp private household debt is more than 85 of gdp first condition suggested by an influential paper written by kenneth carmen reinhart has been disputed due to major calculation errors in fact average gdp growth at public debt gdp ratios over 90 is not dramatically different from when debt gdp ratios are lower boston consulting group bcg adds that if overall debt load continues to grow faster than economy then large scale debt restructuring becomes inevitable to prevent a vicious upward debt spiral from gaining momentum authors urge policymakers to act quickly and decisively and aim for an overall debt level well below 180 for private and government sector this number is based on assumption that governments non financial corporations and private households can each sustain a debt load of 60 of gdp at an interest rate of five per cent and a nominal economic growth rate of three per cent per year lower interest rates and or higher growth would help reduce debt burden further to reach sustainable levels eurozone must reduce its overall debt level by eur6 1 trillion according to bcg this could be financed by a one time wealth tax of between 11 and 30 for most countries apart from crisis countries particularly ireland where a write off would have to be substantially higher authors admit that such programmes would be drastic unpopular and require broad political coordination and leadership but they maintain that longer politicians and central bankers wait more necessary such a step will be thomas french economist and author of bestselling book capital in twenty first century regards taxes on capital as a more favorable option than austerity inefficient and unjust and inflation only affects cash but neither real estates nor business capital according to his analysis a flat tax of 15 percent on private wealth would provide state with nearly a year s worth national income which would allow for immediate reimbursement of entire public debt instead of a one time write off german economist harald has called for a 30 year debt reduction plan similar to one germany

relief similar to london agreement in 1953 private sector lenders as well as governments agreed to write off about half of west germany s outstanding debt this was followed by beginning of germany s economic miracle or according to this agreement west germany had to make repayments only when it was running a trade surplus that is when it had earned money to pay up rather than having to borrow more or dip into its foreign currency reserves its repayments were also limited to 3 of export earnings as lse researchers note this had effect that germany s creditors had an incentive to buy country s goods so that it would be able to afford to pay them controversies european bailouts are largely about shifting exposure from banks and others who otherwise are lined up for losses on sovereign debt they have piled up onto european taxpayers eu treaty violations no bail out clause eu s maastricht treaty contains juridical language that appears to rule out intra eu bailouts first no bail out clause article 125 tfeu ensures that responsibility for repaying public debt remains national and prevents risk premiums caused by unsound fiscal policies from spilling over to partner countries clause thus encourages prudent fiscal policies at national level european central bank s purchase of distressed country bonds can be viewed as violating prohibition of monetary financing of budget deficits article 123 tfeu creation of further leverage in efsf with access to ecb lending would also appear to violate terms of this article articles 125 and 123 were meant to create disincentives for eu member states to run excessive deficits and state debt and prevent moral hazard of over spending and lending in good times they were also meant to protect taxpayers of other more prudent member states by issuing bail out aid guaranteed by prudent eurozone taxpayers to rule breaking eurozone countries such as greece eu and eurozone countries also encourage moral hazard in future while no bail out clause remains in place no bail out doctrine seems to be a thing of past convergence criteria eu treaties contain so called convergence criteria specified in protocols of treaties of european union as regards government finance states agreed that annual government budget deficit should not exceed 3 of gross domestic product gdp and that gross government debt to gdp should not exceed 60 of gdp see protocol 12 and 13 for eurozone members there is stability and growth pact which contains same requirements for budget deficit and debt limitation but with a much stricter regime in past many

southern european public finances and probability of breakup of eurozone breakup these sentiments were an ordinary market panic rather than some deliberate plot greek prime minister papandreou is quoted as saying that there was no question of greece leaving euro and suggested that crisis was politically as well as financially motivated this is an attack on eurozone by certain other interests

de intelligence service national intelligence centre in spanish to investigate role of anglo saxon media in fomenting crisis so far no results have been reported from this investigation other commentators believe that euro is under attack so that countries such as uk and us can continue to fund their large external deficits and government deficits and to avoid collapse of us us and uk do

reported that goldman was reportedly most heavily involved of a dozen or so wall street banks that assisted greek government in early 2000s to structure complex derivatives deals early in decade and borrow billions of dollars in exchange rate swaps which did not officially count as debt under eurozone rules critics of bank s conduct said that these deals contributed to unsustainable public finances which in turn destabilized eurozone in response to accusations that speculators were worsening problem some markets banned naked short selling for a few months speculation about break up of eurozone some economists mostly from outside europe and associated with modern monetary theory and other post keynesian schools condemned design of euro currency system from beginning because it ceded national monetary and economic sovereignty but lacked a central fiscal authority when faced with economic problems they maintained without such an institution emu would prevent effective action by individual countries and put nothing in its place us economist martin feldstein went so far to call euro an experiment that failed some non keynesian economists such as luca a ricci of imf contend that eurozone does not fulfil necessary criteria for an optimum currency area though it is moving in that direction ricci luca a exchange rate regimes and location 1997 as debt crisis expanded beyond

marshall 25 may 2011 iceland not part of eu is regarded as one of europe s recovery success stories it defaulted on its debt and drastically devalued its currency which has effectively reduced wages by 50 making exports more competitive lee harris argues that floating exchange rates allows wage reductions by currency devaluations a politically easier option than economically equivalent but politically impossible method of lowering wages by political enactment sweden s floating rate currency gives it a short term advantage structural reforms and constraints account for longer term prosperity labour concessions a minimal reliance on public debt and tax reform helped to further a pro growth policy wall street journal conjectured as well that germany could return to deutsche mark or create another currency union with netherlands austria finland luxembourg and other european countries such as denmark norway sweden switzerland and baltics a monetary union of these countries with current account surpluses would create world s largest creditor bloc bigger than china or japan wall street journal added that without german led bloc a residual euro would have flexibility to keep

times a greek departure is likely to be seen as beginning of end for whole euro zone project a major accomplishment whatever its faults in post war construction of a europe whole and at peace likewise two big leaders of euro zone german chancellor angela merkel and former french president nicolas sarkozy have said on numerous occasions that they would not allow eurozone to disintegrate and have linked survival of euro with that of entire european union in september 2011 eu commissioner joaquin almunia shared this view saying that expelling weaker countries from euro was not an option those who think that this hypothesis is possible just do not understand our process of integration former ecb president jean claude trichet also denounced possibility of a return of deutsche mark challenges to speculation about break up or salvage of eurozone is rooted in its innate nature that break up or salvage of eurozone is not only an economic decision but also a critical political decision followed by complicated ramifications that if berlin pays bills and tells rest of europe how to behave it risks fostering destructive nationalist resentment against germany and it would strengthen camp in britain arguing for an exit a problem not just for britons but for all economically liberal europeans solutions which involve greater integration of european banking and fiscal management and supervision of national decisions by european umbrella institutions can be criticised as germanic domination of european political and economic life according to us author ross douthat this would effectively turn european union into a kind of postmodern version of old austro hungarian empire with a germanic elite presiding uneasily over a polyglot imperium and its restive local populations economist provides a somewhat modified approach to saving euro in that a limited version of federalisation could be less miserable solution than break up of euro recipe to this tricky combination of limited federalisation greatly lies on mutualisation for limiting fiscal integration in order for overindebted countries to stabilise dwindling euro and economy overindebted countries require access to money and for banks to have a safe euro wide class of assets that is not tied to fortunes of one country which could be obtained by narrower that a limited amount of debt for a limited amount of time proposition made by german council of economic experts provides detailed blue print to current debts of all euro zone economies above 60 of their gdp instead of break up and issuing new national governments bonds by individual euro zone governments everybody from germany debt 81 of gdp to italy 120 would issue only these joint bonds until their national debts fell to 60 threshold new bond market worth some eur2 3 trillion would be paid off over next 25 years each country would pledge a specified tax such as a vat surcharge to provide cash so far german chancellor angela merkel has opposed all forms of mutualisation hungarian american business magnate george soros warns in does euro have a future that there is no escape from gloomy scenario of a prolonged european recession and consequent threat to eurozone s political cohesion so long as authorities persist in their current course he argues that to save euro long term structural changes are essential in addition to immediate steps needed to arrest crisis changes he recommends include even greater economic integration of european union soros writes that a treaty is needed to transform european financial stability fund into a full fledged european treasury following formation of treasury european council could then authorise ecb to step into breach with risks to ecb s solvency being indemnified soros acknowledges that converting efsf into a european treasury will necessitate a radical change of heart in particular he cautions germans will be wary of any such move not least because many continue to believe that they have a choice between saving euro and abandoning it soros writes that a collapse of european union would precipitate an uncontrollable financial meltdown and thus only way to avert another great depression is formation of a european treasury british betting company ladbrokes stopped taking bets on greece exiting eurozone in may 2012 after odds fell to 1 3 and reported plenty of
