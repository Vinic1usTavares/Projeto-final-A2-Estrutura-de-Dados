creatures was created from use of stop motion puppets in 1991 subspecies became first american film to be filmed in bucharest romania director ted nicolaou was initially apprehensive about shooting on location in romania but during a four day location scout he came to love location thanks to free rein he had over ancient ruins and woodland area other transylvanian areas would be used for all subspecies films with specific location shootings at hunedoara brasov and sinaia although remnants of communism left in country along with cultural differences and general problems that accompany film productions lent to a difficult experience for crew while shooting first subspecies film subspecies creatures which were created from radu s blood originally began as local romanian men in rubber suits men were filmed on over scaled sets to simulate miniature size of creatures performances of romanian men along with design of rubber suits caused director ted nicolaou to rethink his approach nicolaou brought in animator david w allen to assist him in creating more magical looking subspecies creatures allen went through all of film footage that contained romanian extras in their rubber suits with film s editor in order to find usable footage before and after men enter scene allen would use isolated footage to develop a new background for animated creatures he would later create allen created two puppet types displayed in front of a bluescreen a stop motion puppet and a rod puppet each of puppet types were composed of foam rubber and held similar skeletal systems some differences between two types include tension filled joints for stop motion puppet while rod puppet was looser flexibility of rod puppet allowed for faster movements which were needed occasionally for real time filming for bloodstone and bloodlust wayne toth and norman cabrera came on board to create special make up effects for films they also pulled double duty composing and performing music alongside romanian musicians for a portion of bloodstone limited budget that toth and cabrera had to work forced them to use any location they could find in order to apply make up to actors as they did not have a separate workstation make up trailers would be created in local resident s homes cave openings inside of cars or just sitting on side of road to create radu s face toth and cabrera applied four separate prosthetic pieces to anders hove s forehead left and right cheek and his chin a cosmetic make up is applied over his entire face to help conceal those four prosthetics this was same process used in original subspecies film although toth and cabrera admit to tweaking coloring of radu s skin one major change to make up process was to radu s hands in original film hove had to wear individual appliances on each of his fingers but to cut back on time needed to apply make up toth and cabrera created a pair of prosthetic gloves that hove could slip on his hands for mummy radu s sorceress mother a headpiece was cast from pamela gordon which included her shoulders as well after make up was applied to give cast a dry and mummified appearance it was slipped over gordon s head leaving only her face showing from there toth and cabrera applied a separate face prosthetic facial appliance gave gordon near zero visibility having only a single eye slit for her left eye crew had to escort her around sets so that she would not injure herself gordon was given a pair of dentures to wear as well as some prosthetic gloves similar to what hove wore rest of gordon s body was draped in clothing to conceal it reception culture cartel critic mike bracken believed story was largely cliched coupled with bad acting on part of watson and female cast but commended realism nicolaou created by shooting on location in romania using romanian residents for smaller roles in film as well as fact that film does not take itself too seriously making it more fun than francis ford coppola s dracula cold fusion video s nathan shumate echoed bracken s opinion on authenticity created from romanian landscaping and actors that gave feel of verisimilitude but criticized stop motion subspecies as being irrelevant to main action and story as a general lack of urgency richard scheib a critic for science fiction horror and fantasy review website moria felt original film showed promise when it attempted to go back to folklore roots of vampirism he also liked authentic feeling from shooting in romania but felt limited budget restricted film from being convincing with david allen s stop motion subspecies creatures being a disappointment when he had a chance to review bloodstone scheib felt sequel delivered vampire cliches but again showed promise with its imaginative make up effects specifically staking of stefan reattachment of radu s head by subspecies creatures look of mummy as well as visual effects of radu s shadow stalking michelle through town which gave scheib a sense of nosferatu another criticism from scheib was with replacement of laura tate with denice duff scheib characterizes duff as internalized and afraid as opposed to addition of melanie shatner s character rebecca morgan who he classifies as alert and intelligent wrote that film series manage to give an edge of bad to its vampires and that each entertains in its own right and furthers subspecies tale one more step beyond last one until finally being beaten over head by a shovel with stinky vampire journals in a review by laserdisc it was felt that one consistency through series was radu whose villainy is effectively embodied by anders hove laserdisc also believed that sequels sustained entertainment value through their intelligent use of eroticism gore and on location setting other media in 1991 full moon teamed with eternity comics to produce comic books series for a handful of full moon s titles among these comics was a subspecies series that served as a prequel
