siegfried class was a group of six coastal defense ships built by german kaiserliche marine imperial navy in late 19th century ships were intended to protect german coastline from naval attacks class comprised lead ship along with her sisters and all six ships were named after norse mythological figures two further vessels were built to a similar design but were not identical siegfried class ships were obsolete by outbreak of world war i and saw only limited service in their intended role before they were withdrawn from active duty ships then served in a variety of secondary duties including barracks ships target ships and in case of beowulf an icebreaker in baltic sea all six ships were struck from naval register on 17 june 1919 days before treaty of versailles was signed five of ships were sold for scrapping immediately after they were struck from register with hildebrand being lost in transit but frithjof was purchased by a shipping company and converted into a freighter she served in this capacity until she too was scrapped in 1930 design in late 1880s german kaiserliche marine grappled with problem of what type of capital ship to build in face of limited naval budgets owing to parliamentary objections to naval spending and cost of dredging kaiser wilhelm canal general leo von caprivi new chef der admiralitat chief of admiralty requested a series of design proposals which ranged in size from small coastal defense ships armed with a battery of two guns to heavily armed ocean going battleships equipped with seven guns caprivi ordered ten coastal defense ships to guard entrances to canal since even opponents of navy in reichstag imperial diet agreed that such vessels were necessary first six of these siegfried class were based on smallest proposal though they were scaled up to add a third main battery gun caliber of which was increased from 21 cm to two of these guns were carried in open barbettes side by side forward as german naval theorists still favored ramming attacks that required a capability for end on fire ships were to carry a secondary battery of six hotchkiss revolver cannon for defense against torpedo boats but tests conducted at firing range at meppen revealed that guns were insufficient against modern vessels as a result battery was increased to eight guns general characteristics thumb left illustration of siegfried as originally configured ships of siegfried class were long at waterline and long overall ships had a beam of and a draft of between forward and aft all six ships were heavily rebuilt each undergoing refits at various times between 1898 and 1904 during rebuilding ships were lengthened to at waterline and overall ships beams remained same but their draft was slightly decreased to forward and aft ships had a designed displacement of and a maximum displacement of after reconstruction displacement was increased to between depending on ship ships used transverse and longitudinal steel frames in hull they had eight watertight compartments and a double bottom that ran for 60 of hull after refits one more watertight compartment was added ships were described as good sea boats they had gentle motion and were very responsive to commands from helm ships lost significant speed in heavy seas however ships had a crew of 20 officers and 256 enlisted men with an additional 6 officers and 22 men when serving as a flagship refit increased crew requirements to an additional 31 sailors normally and extra flagship crew increased to 9 officers and 34 men ships carried a number of smaller boats including one picket boat one pinnace two cutters one yawl and one dinghy propulsion thumb left illustration of hagen in 1910 after her reconstruction ships were powered by two sets of 3 cylinder triple expansion engines each in its own engine room this was first use of triple expansion machinery in a major german warship these engines drove a pair of three bladed screws that were in diameter ships had eight marine type boilers with exception of hagen which was equipped with eight thornycroft boilers ships had similar maximum speeds with beowulf fastest at and heimdall slowest at each ship had three electric generators that provided between 29 26 kilowatts at 67 volts ships stored up to of coal and of fuel oil which enabled a range of at a cruising speed of at ships could only steam with refit fuel bunkerage was more than doubled to of coal and of oil this dramatically increased sailing range to at 10 knots and at 14 knots siegfried received completely oil fired boilers during her refit in 1895 but these boilers proved to be very inefficient and she later received mixed firing boilers installed on other vessels armament thumb painting of heimdall and siegfried underway ships primary armament consisted of three 24 cm k l 35 guns in an arrangement very unusual for such large guns two of which were mounted in a pair of mpl c 88 turrets forward side by side while third was mounted in a single turret aft guns could train 150 degrees to either side of centerline and depress to 4 degrees and elevate to 25 degrees this enabled a maximum range of guns had an ammunition storage of 204 rounds or 68 shells per gun guns had a rate of fire of around 2 shells per minute 1895 design for armor piercing shell weighed ships also had a secondary battery of eight 8 8 sk l 30 guns with 1 500 rounds of ammunition though siegfried only had six of these guns after refit this was increased to ten 8 8 cm guns and munition storage correspondingly increased to 2 500 rounds 8 8 cm gun fired a projectile at a muzzle velocity of 590 m s 1 936 m s guns could sustain a rate of fire of approximately 15 rounds per minute six machine guns were temporarily fitted ships were also equipped with four torpedo tubes one tube was mounted in stern in an above water swivel mount two were placed laterally also above water and fourth was in bow torpedo tubes were supplied with a total of 10 torpedoes after refit stern and lateral tubes were replaced with weapons but lateral torpedo tubes were submerged they had 8 torpedoes between them bow tube was retained but also moved below waterline it had three torpedoes armor ships armor consisted of compound steel for first three ships and krupp armor for last three coupled with teak upper section of main armored belt was thick in central portion of ship and reduced to at either end this was mounted on of timber lower section of belt was thick in central area and on bow and stern this portion of armored belt was mounted on of timber main armored deck was thick though on hagen and heimdall this was increased to conning tower had a roof that was thick and sides that were thick armor protection on conning tower sides was also increased on hagen and heimdall to construction thumb hagen underway six ships of siegfried class were built by a combination of private and government shipyards siegfried was laid down at germaniawerft dockyard in kiel in 1888 ship was ordered as coast defense ship o under construction number 44 she was launched on 10 august 1889 and commissioned into fleet on 29 april 1890 beowulf was built at ag weser in bremen from 1890 to 1892 she had been ordered as p under construction number 100 beowulf was launched on 8 november 1890 and commissioned on 1 april 1892 frithjof was also built at ag weser under construction number 101 and provisional name q she was launched on 21 july 1891 and commissioned into active service on 23 february 1893 heimdall hildebrand and hagen were all built at imperial navy dockyards with heimdall at kaiserliche werft wilhelmshaven and latter two at kaiserliche werft kiel heimdall was laid down in 1891 under construction number 14 and provisional name u she was launched on 27 july 1892 and commissioned on 7 april 1894 hildebrand and hagen were ordered as r and s respectively hildebrand was laid down in 1890 launched on 6 august 1892 and commissioned on 28 october 1893 hagen last ship of class was laid down in 1891 launched on 21 october 1893 and completed on 2 october 1894 ships in class ship siegfried 29 april 1890 31 august 1915 sold for scrap 1920 beowulf 1 april 1892 31 august 1915 sold for scrap 1921 frithjof 23 february 1893 31 august 1915 sold for scrap 1930 heimdall 7 april 1894 31 august 1915 sold for scrap 1921 hildebrand 28 october 1893 31 august 1915 sunk while en route to scrapping 1919 raised and scrapped 1933 hagan 2 october 1894 31 august 1915 sold for scrap 1919 service history thumb left hagen during her reconstruction in 1899 ships of siegfried class saw only limited service in their intended roles revolutions in capital ship building in first decade of 20th century rapidly made these ships obsolete second naval law passed on 27 march 1908 reduced service life of all capital ships from 25 years to 20 years this meant that siegfried class ships along with a number of other vessels were to be replaced as soon as possible siegfried beowulf and frithjof were replaced by s and heimdall hildebrand and hagen were replaced by s and respectively as new battleships were intended for offensive operations siegfried class was still retained for coast defense duties ships served in this capacity through start of world war i until they were withdrawn from active service in 1915 afterward all six ships served in a variety of secondary roles primarily as barracks ships all six ships were struck from naval register on 17 june 1919 shortly before treaty of versailles which ended first world war was signed siegfried was a barracks ship in wilhelmshaven from 1916 she was intended to be rebuilt as a salvage ship but this plan was abandoned and vessel was sold to h peters wewelsfleth in 1919 for 425 000 marks she was broken up in 1920 in kiel beowulf served as a target ship for u boats from 1916 to 1918 when she transitioned to ice breaking duty in baltic sea frithjof was a barracks ship in danzig after 1916 following her removal from navy service she was sold to a bernstein in hamburg she was rebuilt as a freighter by deutsche werke and served in this capacity until she was broken up in 1930 she was longest serving siegfried class ship heimdall was a barracks ship for crews of u boats and ems coast defense flotilla based in emden like siegfried heimdall was intended to be reconstructed as a salvage ship and this was likewise abandoned she was broken up for scrap metal in 1921 hildebrand was a barracks ship in windau after she was removed from active duty she was sold to a dutch ship breaking firm in 1919 but while en route to scrapyard she became grounded on dutch coast wreck was blown up in 1933 and eventually scrapped in situ hagen was a barracks ship in libau danzig and warnemunde during remainder of world war i she was sold for scrapping to norddeutsche tiefbaugesellschaft after end of war footnotes references category coastal defense ship classes category victorian
