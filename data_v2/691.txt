macroolithus is an oogenus fossil egg genus of dinosaur egg belonging to oofamily elongatoolithidae type oospecies m rugustus was originally described under now defunct oogenus name oolithes three other oospecies are known m yaotunensis m mutabilis and m lashuyuanensis they are relatively large elongated eggs with a two layered eggshell their nests consist of large concentric rings of paired eggs there is evidence of blue green pigmentation in its shell which may have helped camouflage nests macroolithus eggs have been found containing oviraptorid dinosaur embryos resembling heyuannia multiple other associations between oviraptorid and elongatoolithids including other eggs containing embryos parents brooding on nests and a pair of shelled macroolithus like eggs preserved within an oviraptorid s pelvis confirm that parent of macroolithus was an oviraptorid it is found in upper cretaceous formations of central and eastern asia fossils have been found in mongolia kazakhstan and china in nanxiong formation in southern china macroolithus fossils range up to and possibly over cretaceous tertiary boundary which is traditionally assumed to mark extinction of non avian dinosaurs some paleontologists have interpreted record of dinosaur eggs at this formation as supporting a gradual extinction event rather than a sudden cataclysmic event however other paleontologists believe that these interpretations are merely based on artifacts of erosion and in early paleogene description thumb right a pair of macroolithus eggs macroolithus eggs are characterized by large size measuring long and by their particularly coarse ornamentation their microstructure is not well defined in literature but generally follows typical elongatoolithid pattern eggshell is arranged into two structural layers mammillary layer and continuous layer continuous layer forms outer part of eggshell its eggshell units are fused together so that layer appears to be a continuum inner layer known as mammillary or cone layer is made up of cone shaped structures that form base of eggshell units in macroolithus continuous layer is two to three times thicker than mammillary layer eggs have great diversity of pore structure since gas conductance is related to pore size and density this could imply that eggs were laid in variable environments oospecies four oospecies of macroolithus are currently recognized m rugustus type oospecies these eggs are found in nanxiong and jiangxi in south china it is also common in nemegt formation of mongolia and manrakskaya svita in kazakhstan it ranges in size from long by across its eggshell is thick about 1 4 of which is mammillary layer outer surface is covered with irregular chains of nodes ornamentation around outer center of egg transitioning to a more pitted netlike pattern at ends m yaotunensis is native to henan and to nanxiong it has similar microstructure and ornamentation to m rugustus but can be distinguished by being slightly larger long and having a thicker shell simon d j 2014 giant dinosaur theropod eggs of oogenus macroelongatoolithus elongatoolithidae from southeastern idaho taxonomic and reproductive implications doctoral dissertation montana state university bozeman also unlike m rugustus m yaotunensis shows a wavy boundary between its mammillary layer and its continuous layer thumb right size of two macroolithus oospecies m mutabilis this mongolian oospecies is known from several eggshell fragments fragments range from thick slightly thicker than m rugustus when complete egg probably measured over it is unique for what mikhailov called features several fragments have pore canals and lack ornamentation m lashuyuanensis this oospecies is based on an eggshell fragment found in nanxiong basin of guangdong with a thickness of its eggshell is thickest among macroolithus oospecies it is furthermore distinguished by having a dark dense band near top of its continuous layer and a gradual transition between continuous and layers coloration some specimens of m yaotunensis preserve traces of reddish brown pigment protoporphyrin and blue green pigment biliverdin same pigments used in eggs of many modern birds eggs were most likely an intense blue green color as shown by predominance of biliverdin in shell purpose of coloration is uncertain but in modern birds it can serve as coloration or as a post mating sexual signal colored eggs are also correlated with active paternal care in modern birds lending further support to hypothesis that oviraptorid males cared for their eggs names and etymology name macroolithus is derived from greek roots macro meaning large and meaning stone egg conventional suffix for oogenus names its chinese name similarly translates to giant egg yaotunensis and lashuyuanensis honor localities where those oospecies were originally discovered and districts of guangdong respectively affixing latin suffix ensis to denote place of origin name mutabilis is latin for changeable when he named oolithes rugustus yang 1965 did not give etymology of rugustus but chinese form translates to rough skin paleobiology and parenting thumb right artist s restoration of oviraptorid nemegtomaia brooding on its nest many associations between adult oviraptorosaur skeletons or embryos with elongatoolithid eggs including macroolithus demonstrate that macroolithus and other elongatoolithids were laid by oviraptorosaurs one oviraptorosaur skeleton from upper cretaceous of china was described in 2005 two shelled elongatoolithid eggs were preserved inside of its pelvis this suggests that oviraptorosaurs had two functional oviducts where both would produce eggs simultaneously while sato et al did not refer eggs specifically to macroolithus they noted that eggs closely resemble m yaotunensis though with a thinner eggshell thin eggshell however could simply be because shell had not finished forming when mother died or because of biochemical dissolution of shell before fossilization multiple different genera of oviraptorids have been found on or near elongatoolithid nests indicating that oviraptorid parents would brood on their eggs most likely for extended periods of time there is some evidence to suggest that oviraptorid and troodontid eggs were cared for by father perhaps in a polygamous system given large size of eggs relative to parent a mother would only lay two eggs at a time so eggs of a single nest may have been contributed by multiple females nests thumb left a fossilized nest of oviraptorid eggs multiple well preserved macroolithus nests are known representing m rugustus and m yaotunensis a very well preserved clutch of m yaotunensis contains 20 eggs arrayed in two possibly three circular layers when complete this nest may have contained 40 or more eggs tanaka et al 2015 found that among modern archosaurs group including birds crocodilians and dinosaurs porosity of eggshells can be used to accurately predict whether eggs are buried or laid in open nests they concluded that macroolithus nests were either open or only partially covered with vegetation eggs blue green coloration could have acted as a camouflage to hide nest from predators m rugustus eggs at in mongolia represent a coastal colonial nesting site embryos a few macroolithus eggs preserve embryonic remains of oviraptorids inside two eggs containing embryos found in upper cretaceous nanxiong formation near ganzhou jiangxi were referred to m yaotunensis in 2008 one of these embryos shows a much greater degree of bone development ossification than other it preserves ossified hind limbs and several vertebrae fact that cervical vertebrae not only have ossified centra and neural arches but also have ossified zygapophyses led cheng et al to conclude that this embryo may in fact represent a hatchling since in modern chickens and skuas these are cartilaginous until hatching also embryo s foot anatomy specifically proportions of its metatarsals resembles that of oviraptorid heyuannia huangi indicating that these eggs belong to h huangi or a similar species other egg has a much less developed embryo with only hind limbs preserved while this does not permit comparison on species level tibia shinbone confirms that it is an oviraptorosaur thumb artist s restoration of heyuannia with its nest three more eggs containing embryos from same formation were described in 2016 by wang et al though they noted that these eggs strongly resemble m yaotunensis they declined to refer them to any lower than elongatoolithidae because macroolithus is not clearly defined and is in need of revision embryos within these eggs are some of most well preserved of any oviraptorids providing new information on oviraptorid ontogeny specimens show a relatively shallow head which indicates that as oviraptorids matured their skulls grew dorsoventrally top to bottom faster than front to back this growth pattern is unusual among theropods but is also seen in derived advanced tyrannosaurids also unusual is that even at this early stage of development nasal bones are fused coincidentally tyrannosaurids also show fusion of nasals early in development pathology and extinction many macroolithus specimens in south china have double or multiple layering of cones on inner surface of eggshell a pathological condition known as ovum in ovo it is especially prevalent among eggs nearest to cretaceous tertiary k t boundary which represents end of mesozoic era this pathology is correlated with a higher concentration of trace elements like co cr cu mn ni pb sr v and zn experiments on modern birds have demonstrated that exposure to high levels of these elements will cause them to be incorporated into eggshell but precise mechanism behind pathological multi layering is unknown these abnormalities presumably affected of eggs and may have played a role in extinction of dinosaurs however embryonic remains inside three multilayered macroolithus like eggs from ganzhou appear unaffected k t boundary is associated with abnormally high amounts of iridium an element which is rare in earth s crust but relatively common in asteroids and in earth s core this has been used as evidence that a meteorite impact caused extinction of dinosaurs alvarez hypothesis however some paleontologists attribute extinction event and iridium anomaly to more gradual climatic change caused by volcanic activity of deccan traps nanxiong basin has special relevance to this discussion because it contains k t boundary however position of boundary as well as duration of extinction have been subject to debate zhao et al 2002 and 2009 have postulated that there were at least two iridium delivering events over a time period consistent with deccan traps volcanism correlated with a gradual decline in diversity and eventual disappearance of fossil eggs from nanxiong basin according to their interpretation macroolithus survived 250 000 years into early paleocene however buck et al 2004 disputed these claims arguing that debris flows mixed and reworked sediments near boundary causing a blurring of iridium anomaly and appearance of eggshell fragments on both sides classification fossilized eggs are classified in their own parataxonomic system parallel to linnaean taxonomy macroolithus elongatoolithus and were first oogenera ever named in this system they were classified in oofamily elongatoolithidae cladistic analysis also supports placement of macroolithus close to elongatoolithus together with other elongatoolithids in a clade four oospecies are known m rugustus m yaotunensis m mutabilis and m lashuyuanensis oogenus s microstructures are poorly defined and therefore may be in need of revision when mikhailov described m mutabilis he found no microstructural difference in zhao s original illustrations of m rugustus and m yaotunensis but did not synonymize oospecies because chinese paleontologists considered them distinct history discoveries macroolithus eggs were first discovered in southern china by pioneering chinese paleontologist yang zhongjian he described remains of several fossil eggs from that region in 1965 working prior to advent of modern fossil egg he gave them names as species of oolithes a now defunct name that was formerly used for various types of fossil eggs in 1975 chinese paleontologist zhao zikui prototyped modern parataxonomic system creating a hierarchical system of oogenera and oospecies zhao placed yang s o rugustus into new oogenus macroolithus splitting it into two oospecies m yaotunensis and m rugustus he also suggested that american oospecies oolithes carlylensis which is now classified in a different elongatoolithid oogenus macroelongatoolithus be recombined as macroolithus carlylensis in 1991 russian paleontologist konstantin mikhailov introduced modern classification of fossil eggs based on zhao s parataxonomic naming system he classified o carlylensis in oofamily spheroolithidae but otherwise followed zhao s 1975 classification of macroolithus in 1994 he named m mutabilis a new oospecies of macroolithus based on remains discovered in mongolia in 2000 a fourth oospecies m turolensis was described by spanish paleontologists olga amo jose ignacio and gloria cuenca based on material from spain however when new material of this oospecies was uncovered in 2014 it was moved into its own oogenus which was furthermore moved to spheroolithidae in 2005 eggs possibly attributable to m yaotunensis were discovered paired inside pelvis of a fossil oviraptorid skeleton in 2008 chinese paleontologists cheng yen nien ji qiang wu xiao chun and shan hsi yin discovered a pair of eggs representing first in china to contain embryonic remains of oviraptorosaurs both eggs were referred to m yaotunensis fourth oospecies m lashuyuanensis was described in 2009 by chinese paleontologists fang xiao si li pei xian zhang zhi jun zhang xian qiu lin you li guo sheng bin cheng ye ming li zhen yu zhang xiao jun and cheng zheng wu interpretations thumb restoration of heyuannia putative parent of macroolithus in 1994 mikhailov suggested that macroolithus represented eggs of a large theropod specifically tarbosaurus based on large size of eggs and largely overlapping distribution however discovery of an oviraptorid embryo inside an elongatoolithid egg cast doubt on this hypothesis with discovery of multiple oviraptorosaur elongatoolithid associations in late 1990s eggs of elongatoolithids came to be accepted as belonging to oviraptorosaurian dinosaurs oviraptorid parentage was confirmed for macroolithus when in 2008 oviraptorid embryos resembling heyuannia were discovered inside a pair of m yaotunensis eggs in jiangxi early on paleontologists considered macroolithus nests to have been buried mou 1992 noted high gas conductance values in macroolithus eggs and therefore concluded that they were laid in a very humid environment buried underground or inside a mound deeming 2006 found a similar result this seems to contradict evidence that brooded bird like on their eggs but deeming suggested that oviraptor buried its eggs in a mound and then oviraptor and its relatives sat atop a nest mound to incubate rather than directly contacting eggs however tanaka et al 2015 criticized these results for lack of statistical rigor they found based on comparisons to modern eggs that macroolithus was predicted to be laid in open or partially covered nests wiemann et al 2017 also criticized mou and deeming because they had only measured eggshell porosity at middle section of eggs and did not take into account fact that pore density is much lower near poles this would lead to an overestimate of total eggshell porosity and therefore an of gas conductance value extinctions of macroolithus and other eggs from southern china have also had a history of different interpretations in 1990s chinese paleontologists including prominent egg specialist zhao zikui observed a gradual reduction in dinosaur egg diversity during final 200 000 to 300 000 years of cretaceous with only macroolithus ranging up to boundary they postulated contrary to impact hypothesis that extinction was result of a prolonged drought that increased concentration of trace heavy metals which adversely affected eggshell and embryo development of dinosaurs causing population to gradually decline and collapse zhao et al revised this hypothesis in 2002 postulating a gradual extinction of macroolithus caused by volcanism of deccan traps in 2004 buck et al disputed this interpretation arguing that apparent gradual extinction was an illusion caused by reworking of sediments zhao et al 2009 maintained that extinction event was gradual distribution and paleoecology macroolithus is known from myriad late cretaceous locations in china mongolia and kazakhstan henan in henan macroolithus yaotunensis coexists with other elongatoolithids elongatoolithus and e elongatus as well as ovaloolithus and of and formations these formations were formed during late cretaceous in a lacustrine or environment dinosaur body fossils are rarely found in same units but troodontids tyrannosaurs and hadrosaurs are known from same area shandong some eggs tentatively assigned to macroolithus are known from wangshi group in shandong formations of wangshi group were deposited in alluvial fans braided channels and shallow lakes common fossils include hadrosaurids and dinosaur eggs southern china m rugustus m yaotunensis and m lashuyuanensis are all known from nanxiong basin in guangdong this formation was deposited primary from streams rivers and lakes in that region it spans across k t boundary at which point most of dinosaur eggs disappear but macroolithus apparently exists on both sides of boundary which would imply that some species of dinosaurs survived into early tertiary however evidence suggests that these fossils were actually reworked by debris flows into tertiary rocks nanxiong basin is known for its abundance of fossil eggs predominantly eggs elongatoolithus and macroolithus other types of eggs include other elongatoolithids as well as and footprints show that nanxiong basin was populated by ornithopods theropods and possibly sauropods southern china particularly nanxiong formation in jiangxi province possibly has greatest oviraptorosaur diversity in world and also includes several associations of oviraptorosaurs with macroolithus or similar eggs titanosaurs and tyrannosaurids are also known from this area non dinosaur fauna includes lizards and terrestrial turtles mongolia macroolithus rugustus is abundant in nemegt formation which dates to late campanian to early maastrichtian this formation represents depositions of a meandering river well preserved dinosaur remains are common in nemegt formation including oviraptorosaurs titanosaurs troodontids tyrannosaurs ankylosaurs pachycephalosaurs hadrosaurs ornithomimosaurs alvarezsaurs and therizinosaurs remains of small animals are relatively rare but several types of birds are known from nemegt as well as several types of multituberculate mammals other fossil eggs from nemegt formation include ovaloolithus spheroolithus elongatoolithus and m mutabilis is known solely at ikh locality from barun goyot formation dating from santonian to campanian m rugustus is also known from barun goyot formation which represents a sand dune filled eolian environment compared to nemegt formation large dinosaurs are rare at barun goyot where fauna is dominated by oviraptorids and ankylosaurids other types of fossil eggs from barun goyot formation include spheroolithus and kazakhstan m rugustus has also been found in formation also called manrakskaya svita of basin in east kazakhstan region this formation is near to river and dates to some time in late cretaceous probably see also list of dinosaur oogenera
