represent robotic nature of connor paesano s music was made with idea that it would be like a church hymn personifying markus transformation into a leader sheppard recorded at abbey road studios with

stories he enjoyed its execution and connor s calm demeanor and android origin carter praised setting calling it believable and captivating while also noting that smaller moments were among its strengths michael goroff of electronic gaming monthly favoured fact that playable characters were androids because their second class citizenship status created an effective viewpoint controls and quick time events were also subject to approval goroff lauded incredibly satisfying and sometimes unexpected impact of collective decisions and declared this game s biggest accomplishment writing for game informer kimberley wallace agreed with carter s assessment of little moments and said character development was fun to watch well handled and highlight of game she appreciated how branching narratives affected latter parts and complimented quantic dream for impressive achievement paul tamburro at game revolution wrote that detroit become human boasted a compelling world enriched by fantastic performances and state of art motion capturing he commended curry dechart and williams for their engrossing performances and said game was among most well acted around he also felt choices drastically changed story peter brown of gamespot welcomed variety of cycling between characters for ensuring player engagement game s most dreadful and horrific scenes made a considerable impression on brown some of which he found to be truly unforgettable additionally he remarked that visuals were beautiful and captivating to behold gamesradar s andy hartup praised quantic dream for making an interactive story capable of provoking genuine honest and varied emotions he thought consequences of decisions were utterly delightful albeit rarely and saw setting as beautiful hartup liked character models calling them most remarkable you ll see in gaming and favoured eyes in particular on decision making aspects he proclaimed detroit become human new gold standard for meaningful choice in gaming lucy o brien at ign wrote that game manages to be a frequently moving melodrama that bends to your choices with meaningful results she also praised acting of curry dechart and williams observing different benefits to each character o brien appraised general plot as big ambitious fun and environments as beautifully detailed like goroff wallace tamburro and hartup o brien found branching paths to be multiple and deep while also complimenting flowcharts a feature colm ahern of videogamer com singled out as one of game s few redeeming qualities conversely carter criticised game s surface level exploration of ship of theseus questioning director s subtlety he blamed weakness of kara s story on cage s writing called portrayal of domestic and substance abusers cartoonish and complained about occasional wooden acting goroff s only annoyance with controls concerned its motion sensitive feature especially disparaging its use in quick time events wallace thought markus story was worst of three citing predictable speeches and black and white decisions as primary problems she suggested that narrative suffered heavy handed attempts at historical parallels and noted as carter did that its representation of abuse seemed exploitive due to over top antics she felt use of motion controls and touchpad was unintuitive and wanted more variety from gameplay tamburro faulted opening act for its slow and dull interactions quick time events for their abundance and occasional story paths for being highly questionable brown viewed markus as remarkably lacking in nuance and allegories to actual history as on nose and distracting he commented that flowchart exposition was ultimately detrimental to player immersion and wished there was a way of disabling it hartup disliked moments in which themes were either fumble d or pushed too far o brien observed multiple plotholes and found exposition and dialogue to be clumsy ahern wrote in his verdict detroit become human wants to move you thing is it really doesn t when narrative is as cringey and ham fisted as it is you won t want to play through it multiple times sales detroit become human reached fifth place on uk chart after two
