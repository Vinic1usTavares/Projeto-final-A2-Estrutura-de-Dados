akodon caenosus is a rodent in genus akodon found in northwestern argentina and south central bolivia since its description in 1918 it has been alternatively classified as a separate species or a subspecies of akodon lutescens formerly akodon puer species akodon aliquantulus described from some very small argentine specimens in 1999 is now recognized as a synonym of a caenosus akodon caenosus is very small averaging in weight and variable in coloration but generally brown underparts are sharply different in color from upperparts skull has a short rostrum front part broad interorbital region between eyes and narrow braincase karyotype includes 34 chromosomes a caenosus mostly occurs in yungas vegetation and breeds mainly during winter it shares its range with many other sigmodontine rodents including three other species of akodon taxonomy e budin collected first specimen of species on august 21 1917 in jujuy province northwestern argentina and next year oldfield thomas used animal as holotype of a new subspecies of akodon puer a bolivian species he described new subspecies akodon puer caenosus as darker and duller in color than bolivian form but otherwise identical thomas 1918 pp 189 190 in 1920 thomas recognized additional differences between two after examining more specimens and classified argentine form as a separate species akodon caenosus thomas 1920 p 193 most subsequent authors followed this arrangement but since 1980s some have placed form now spelled caenosus in a puer again jayat et al 2010 p 25 in 1990 philip myers and others reviewed akodon boliviensis group which includes a puer and a caenosus and again considered caenosus as a subspecies of puer myers et al 1990 p 66 they retained caenosus as a separate subspecific name for argentine populations of puer because of its small size dark fur myers et al 1990 p 73 and distinctive karyotype myers et al 1990 p 74 myers and colleagues had included name lutescens j a allen 1901 as a subspecies of akodon puer thomas 1902 and in 1997 sydney anderson noted that older name lutescens should instead be used for species because of principle of priority therefore he utilized combination akodon lutescens caenosus for argentine subspecies through 1990s and 2000s authors continued to differ on classification of caenosus as either a full species or a subspecies or puer lutescens two small akodon collected in 1993 in tucuman province northwestern argentina were given name akodon in 1994 but that name is a nomen nudum and therefore not available for use under international code of zoological nomenclature diaz et al 1999 p 795 jayat et al 2010 p 23 in 1999 monica diaz and others described these animals more fully as a new species akodon aliquantulus which they considered closely related to a puer caenosus diaz et al 1999 p 786 specific name means how little or how few in latin and refers to small size of species and small sample diaz and colleagues could use diaz et al 1999 p 794 in 2005 third edition of mammal species of world guy musser and michael carleton termed differentiation between a aliquantulus and a lutescens puer unimpressive and recommended further taxonomic research musser and carleton 2005 p 1093 common names proposed for a aliquantulus include diminutive musser and carleton 2005 p 1092 and tucuman grass mouse duff and lawson 2004 p 59 in 2010 pablo jayat and colleagues reviewed members of akodon boliviensis group in argentina on basis of sequences from mitochondrial cytochrome b gene jayat et al 2010 p 5 they found a caenosus to be closest to a lutescens and a subfuscus forming a clade that was sister group to a clade of remaining species in a boliviensis group a boliviensis a spegazzinii a sylvanus and a polopi jayat et al 2010 fig 1 p 9 they classified a caenosus as a species separate from a lutescens because two forms did not form a single clade a caenosus was instead closer to a subfuscus and because difference between cytochrome b sequences of a lutescens and a caenosus was relatively high at 3 5 jayat et al 2010 p 43 fig 1 a aliquantulus was reduced to a synonym of a caenosus because they found no substantial differentiation between two and could not replicate characters diaz and colleagues had noted as diagnostic for a aliquantulus description akodon caenosus is smallest of argentine members of a boliviensis group indeed among smallest of all species of akodon diaz et al 1999 p 795 upperparts are uniformly colored but their tone is variable generally ochraceous brown but approaching yellow red or in some individuals reddish tones occur mostly in lactating females high altitude animals are generally lighter but there is also conspicuous variation within populations jayat et al 2010 p 24 ears are similar to upperparts but some individuals have sides more rich and clear in color underparts are clearly different in color varying from light gray to yellowish or reddish there are yellowish rings around eyes jayat et al 2010 p 18 which are more highly developed in high altitude populations there are white to yellowish hairs on fore and hindfeet jayat et al 2010 pp 23 24 tail is variably covered with hair and is dark brown above and white to buffy below in skull rostrum front part is short interorbital region between eyes is broad and hourglass shaped and braincase is small zygomatic plate flattened front part of zygomatic arch is narrow with poorly developed zygomatic notches at their front but there is considerable variation in features of plate incisive foramina openings in front part of palate extend back to between first molars mesopterygoid fossa openings behind bony palate is very narrow in mandible lower jaw masseteric ridges which anchor some of chewing muscles extend to near front margin of first molar capsular process a raising in back part of mandibular bone that accommodates root of incisor is poorly developed upper incisors are with chewing edge in horizontal plane to slightly opisthodont with chewing edge inclined backwards molars show some accessory crests and other features such as anteroloph on first upper molar and mesoloph on first and second upper molar in twelve adult argentine a caenosus total length is averaging tail length is averaging hindfoot length is averaging ear length is averaging and weight is averaging jayat et al 2010 table 1 karyotype includes 34 chromosomes with a fundamental number of 40 major arms 2n 34 fn 40 autosomes includes three large and one very small pairs of with two long arms and twelve small to medium sized acrocentric pairs which have a long and a very short arm x chromosome is medium sized and subtelocentric with a long and a short arm and y chromosome is very small and is acrocentric in jujuy specimens but metacentric in those from tucuman karyotype is separated from that of a lutescens by three translocations members of akodon boliviensis group including a caenosus are generally similar and difficult to separate but they differ in relative cranial measurements and some other characters jayat et al 2010 pp 24 25 41 a spegazzinii is larger than a caenosus a sylvanus is darker and has less contrast between upper and underparts and less well developed eye rings a polopi has a squared interorbital region and more well developed ridges on its skull jayat et al 2010 p 41 and a boliviensis is paler and has more densely furred ears jayat et al 2010 p 21 distribution and ecology akodon caenosus is found from northwestern argentina into south central bolivia jayat et al 2010 p 25 anderson 1997 p 422 in bolivia it occurs in tarija and chuquisaca departments anderson 1997 p 422 its argentine distribution extends from far northern salta to southern catamarca at altitudes ranging from it is mostly found in yungas but also in highest levels of chaco and lowest of andean mountain grasslands it occurs together with a boliviensis a sylvanus a simulator and species of oligoryzomys and breeding occurs throughout year but mostly from november to january during summer molting occurs mostly during winter and autumn fly cuterebra and claps 2005 p 572 and flea gracilis have been recorded from a caenosus lareschi et al 2010 p 212 mites androlaelaps fahrenholzi androlaelaps rotundus and have been found on a aliquantulus lareschi et al 2003 p 60 conservation status iucn currently assesses a aliquantulus as data deficient because so little is known about it but notes that ranching and fire may threaten it pardinas and jayat 2008 akodon lutescens including a caenosus is assessed as least concern because of its wide distribution large population and ability to persist in disturbed habitats however habitat loss may threaten
