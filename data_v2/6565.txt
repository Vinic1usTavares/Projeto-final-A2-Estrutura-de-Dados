development when players encounter enemies in either scripted events or random encounters they enter a battle mode during battles players control a small heart which represents their soul and must

game will tell players what monster s feelings and actions are enemy attacks change based on how players interact with them should players choose non violent options enemy attacks are easy whereas they become difficult if players choose violent options game relies on a number of metafictional elements in both its gameplay and story when players participate in a boss battle on a second playthrough dialogue will be altered depending on actions in previous playthroughs plot undertale takes place in underground a realm where monsters once equal to humans were banished to after war broke out between them underground is sealed from surface world by an imperfect magic barrier only point of entry being at mount a human child falls into underground and encounters flowey a sentient

they attacked and killed him resulting in asgore declaring war asgore now seeks to break barrier which requires him to collect seven human souls of which he has six game s ending depends on how player resolved encounters with monsters if player killed some but not all monsters human arrives at asgore s castle and learns that they also need a monster s soul to cross barrier forcing them to fight asgore sans stops human before their confrontation revealing that human s love is an acronym for level of violence and exp for execution points sans judges human based on combined resolution of

barrier they receive a phone call from sans explaining state of underground after human s departure if player instead kills no monsters and has completed a previous playthrough of game flowey is

human child assumes control and with or without player s consent destroys universe to enable further replays of game frisk must first give their soul to fallen human child in exchange for restoring universe which will permanently alter every subsequent pacifist run development undertale was developed by toby fox across 32 months development was financed through a crowdfunding campaign on website kickstarter campaign was launched on june 25 2013 with a goal of us 5 000 it ended on july 25 2013 with us 51 124 raised by 2 398 people 1022 48 of original goal undertale creation ensued after fox created a battle system using game creation system gamemaker studio he wanted to develop a role playing game that was different from traditional design which he often found boring to play he set out to develop a game with interesting characters and that utilizes medium as a storytelling device instead of having story and gameplay abstractions be completely separate fox worked on entire game independently besides some of art he decided to work independently to avoid relying on others fox had little experience with game development he and his three brothers often used rpg maker 2000 to make role playing games though few were ever completed fox also worked on several earthbound rom hacks while in high school chang worked as main artistic assistant for game providing most of sprites and concept art fox has said that game s art style would likely remain same if he had access to a larger team of artists he found that there s a psychological thread that says audiences become more attached to characters drawn simply rather than in detail particularly benefiting from use of visual gags within art game design defensive segment within battle system was inspired by mario luigi series as well as bullet hell shooters such as touhou project series when working on battle system fox set out to create a mechanic that he would personally enjoy he wanted undertale to have a battle system equally engaging as super mario rpg 1996 and mario luigi superstar saga 2003 fox did not want grinding to be necessary at any point in game instead leaving it optional to players he also did not wish to introduce fetch quests as they involve backtracking which he dislikes in terms of game s difficulty fox ensured that it was easy and enjoyable he asked some friends who are inexperienced with bullet hell shooters to test game and found that they were able to complete it he felt that game s difficulty is optimal particularly considering complications involved in adding another difficulty setting game s dialogue system was inspired by shin megami tensei 1992 particularly gameplay mechanic whereby players can talk to monsters to avoid conflict fox intended to expand upon this mechanic as failing to negotiate resulted in a requirement to fight i want to create a system that satisfied my urge for talking to monsters he said when he began developing this mechanic concept of completing game without killing any enemies just evolved naturally however he never considered removing option to fight throughout development when questioned on difficulty of playing game without killing fox responded that it is crux of one of major themes of this game asking players to think about it themselves certain parts of game such as core area as well as plot pace and progression of game and minor references draw strong parallels with chrono trigger writing for game s writing fox was partly influenced by silliness of internet culture as well as comedy shows like mr bean he was also inspired by unsettling atmosphere of earthbound fox s desire to subvert concepts that go unquestioned in many games further influenced undertale development fox found that writing became easier after establishing a character s voice and mood he also felt that creating world was a natural process as it expressed stories of those within it fox felt importance to make game s monsters feel like an individual he cited final fantasy series as opposite all monsters in rpgs like final fantasy are same there s no meaning to that character of toriel who is one of first to appear in game was created as a parody of tutorial characters fox strongly disliked use of companion character fi in legend of zelda skyward sword in which answers to puzzles were often revealed early fox also felt that role playing video games generally lack mother characters in pokemon series as well as mother and earthbound fox felt that mothers are used as symbols rather than characters in response fox intended for toriel s character to be a mom that hopefully acts like a mom and genuinely cares about players actions music game s soundtrack was entirely composed by fox a self taught musician he composed most of tracks with little iteration game s main theme undertale was only song to undergo multiple iterations in development soundtrack was inspired by music from super nes role playing games such as earthbound as well as webcomic homestuck for which fox provided some of music fox also stated that he tries to be inspired by all music he listens to particularly those in video games according to fox over 90 of songs were composed specifically for game megalovania song used during boss battle with sans had previously been used within homestuck and in one of fox s earthbound rom hacks for each section of game fox composed music prior to programming as it helped decide how scene should go he initially tried using a music tracker to compose soundtrack but found it difficult to use he ultimately decided to play segments of music separately and connect them on a track to celebrate one year anniversary of game fox released five unused musical works on his blog in 2016 four of game s songs were released as official downloadable content for steam version of taito s groove coaster undertale soundtrack has been well received by critics as part of success of game in particular for its use of various leitmotifs for various characters used throughout various tracks in particular hopes and dreams boss theme when fighting asriel in run through where player avoids killing any monster brings back most of main character themes and is a perfect way to cap off your journey according to usgamer s nadia oxford oxford notes this track in particular demonstrates fox s ability at turning old songs into completely new experiences used throughout game s soundtrack tyler hicks of gamespot compared music to bit based melodies release game was released on september 15 2015 for microsoft windows and os x and on july 17 2016 for linux fox expressed interest in releasing undertale on other platforms but was initially unable to port it to nintendo platforms without reprogramming game due to engine s lack of support for these platforms a patch was released in january 2016 fixing bugs and altering appearance of blue attacks to help colorblind players see them better sony interactive

determine how to take project further fox clarified that deltarune will be a larger project than undertale fox stated it took him a few years to create first chapter of deltarune much longer than it
