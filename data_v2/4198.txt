1995 pacific hurricane season was least active pacific hurricane season since 1979 of eleven tropical cyclones that formed during season four affected land with most notable storm of season being hurricane ismael which killed at least 116 people in mexico strongest hurricane in season was hurricane juliette which reached peak winds of 150 mph 240 km h but did not significantly affect land hurricane adolph was an early season category 4 hurricane hurricane henriette brushed baja california peninsula in early september season officially started on may 15 1995 in eastern pacific and on june 1 1995 in central pacific and lasted until november 30 1995 these dates conventionally delimit period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in northeastern pacific ocean season saw eleven tropical cyclones form of which ten became tropical storms seven of these storms attained hurricane status three of them becoming major hurricanes there were fewer tropical storms than average of 16 while number of hurricanes and major hurricanes were slightly below average season marked beginning of a multi decade period of low activity in eastern pacific season summary right thumb 220px tropical depression erick left and tropical storm flossie bottom center on august 7 accumulated cyclone energy ace index for 1995 pacific hurricane season in total is 100 2 units broadly speaking ace is a measure of power of a tropical or subtropical storm multiplied by length of time it existed it is only calculated for full advisories on specific tropical and subtropical systems reaching or exceeding wind speeds of 39 mph 63 km h seasonal activity during 1995 was below normal and marked first of several seasons with lower than normal activity four tropical cyclones affected mexico first hurricane flossie passed within 75 miles 120 km of baja california peninsula producing moderate winds and killing seven people afterwards tropical storm gil dropped heavy rainfall in southern mexico early in its life though caused no damage hurricane henriette later made landfall near cabo san lucas with winds of 100 mph 160 km h resulting in moderate damage but no deaths finally ismael struck state of sinaloa as a minimal hurricane offshore fishermen were caught off guard by hurricane causing 57 of them to drown on land ismael destroyed thousands of houses leaving 30 000 homeless and killing another 59 both hurricanes flossie and ismael also produced moisture and localized damage in southwestern united states activity in central pacific ocean was below normal as well no tropical storms formed in basin for first time in four years barbara was only tropical cyclone to exist within basin but it formed in eastern pacific it entered as a weakening tropical storm and quickly dissipated without affecting land it was least activity in basin since 1979 when basin was completely quiet as no storms entered basin that year systems tropical depression one e a westward moving tropical wave entered pacific ocean in mid may convection within disturbance became more concentrated and organized on may 19 while wave was located a short distance south of gulf of tehuantepec deep convection concentrated around a low level circulation with expanding outflow and system developed into tropical depression one e on may 21 while located about 400 mi 645 km south of manzanillo mexico initially depression was forecast to strengthen to reach winds of 55 mph 90 km h as it moved westward under influence of a high pressure system to its north outflow increased as storm moved through an area of warm waters and a favorable upper level environment and two satellite classifications indicated system was at tropical storm status around nine hours after forming despite favorable environment and satellite classifications of tropical storm status depression failed to organize further convection and organization continued to decrease and on may 23 depression dissipated while it was developing locally moderate to heavy rainfall fell across southern mexico along disturbance s northern periphery with rainfall totals peaking at at petatlan hurricane adolph an area of disturbed weather associated with a tropical wave organized off southwest coast of mexico during middle of june banding features developed as a circulation persisted on northeast side of its deep convection and system developed into tropical depression two e on june 15 under weak steering currents depression moved slowly northward and with deep convection organizing near its center depression intensified to tropical storm adolph on june 16 located in an area of warm waters adolph exhibited a well defined outflow pattern and rapidly strengthened to attain hurricane status on june 17 as a banding type eye developed hurricane adolph turned to northwest and attained major hurricane status late that same day small eye of hurricane continued to organize as very deep convection surrounded eyewall and adolph reached its peak intensity of 135 mph 215 km h on june 18 making it a category 4 hurricane on saffir simpson scale shortly thereafter storm weakened as upper level environment became more hostile and system moved over progressively cooler waters on june 19 adolph turned to west and degenerated back into a tropical storm later that day on june 20 storm weakened to a tropical depression and on june 21 adolph began to dissipate as its center became devoid of deep convection as adolph moved north towards mexico while about 290 mi 465 km off coast mexican government issued a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch from punta tejupan to cabo corrientes jalisco when storm turned to northwest and later to west government discontinued warnings as it was determined storm would not be a threat to land no damage or casualties were reported hurricane barbara a few days later on june 24 another weak tropical wave moved off coast of africa it moved steadily westward through atlantic ocean without any development and entered eastern pacific ocean on july 5 at this point convection developed along wave axis and system gradually organized a circulation developed as it passed through an area of warm waters and system developed into tropical depression three e on july 7 while located about 600 miles 965 km south of manzanillo colima although outer rainbands warmed slightly in hours after formation convection near center deepened further with favorable upper level outflow and depression strengthened into tropical storm barbara early on july 8 barbara steadily intensified and following development of a ragged eye that night barbara strengthened into a hurricane on july 9 while located about 700 miles 1130 km south of southern tip of baja california peninsula after moving into an area of light vertical shear and warm water temperatures barbara quickly intensified to reach major hurricane status on july 10 eye continued to become better organized and barbara attained winds of 135 mph 215 km h later on july 10 after maintaining its intensity for 24 hours increased wind shear from an upper tropospheric trough degraded appearance of deepest convection and eye became obscured from satellite images after weakening to a 115 mph 185 km h hurricane barbara maintained its intensity for 30 hours before moving into an area with very warm waters and a favorable upper level environment on july 13 hurricane re organized a distinct eye again developed and barbara strengthened to reach its peak intensity of 140 mph 225 km h later that day barbara continued westward under influence of a subtropical ridge to its north and began to steadily weaken on july 14 as it moved into an area of cooler water temperatures hurricane degraded to a tropical storm on july 16 and a day later it deteriorated to a tropical depression as a depression with little to no convection near its center barbara continued west northwestward until dissipating on july 18 while located 720 mi 1160 km east southeast of hilo hawaii barbara remained away from land for its entire lifetime and it did not cause any damage or deaths hurricane cosme as barbara moved away from land another area of disturbed weather moved off coast of central america on july 11 moving westward this area slowly organized and developed a low level circulation on july 22 convection developed into curved rainbands and based on dvorak classifications of 35 mph 55 km h national hurricane center estimated that system developed into tropical depression four e on july 17 while located about 400 mi 645 km south southeast of southern tip of baja california peninsula as depression was situated in an area with warm waters and moderate upper level outflow system was forecast to slowly intensify to a 50 mph 80 km h tropical storm initially depression followed forecasts and it intensified into a tropical storm about 30 hours after developing receiving name cosme cosme was expected to strengthen only slightly due to predicted cooler waters and increased shear on july 18 contrary to predictions cosme became much better organized and well defined banding features were visible on satellite imagery storm continued to steadily intensify and subsequent to development of an eye cosme strengthened into a hurricane late on july 19 while located 380 miles 615 km west southwest of southern tip of baja california peninsula after maintaining hurricane status for 18 hours cosme weakened back to a tropical storm on july 20 cooler water temperatures deteriorated convection near center resulting in cosme quickly weakening to a tropical depression on july 21 after turning to west southwest cosme dissipated on july 22 cosme never affected land and as a result caused no damage or fatalities however intensity of storm is still uncertain late on july 18 a ship to east of cosme reported winds of 17 mph 27 km h despite that a normal 50 mph 80 km h tropical storm would produce tropical storm force winds for locations within at least 70 mi 110 km of center tropical storm dalila a tropical wave moved off coast of africa on july 11 it moved westward and quickly developed two areas of convection along wave axis one of areas nearly developed into a tropical depression after moving northwestward though it failed to organize further and dissipated southern area continued westward and ultimately entered eastern pacific ocean on july 21 thunderstorms along wave axis became more concentrated a few hundred miles south of gulf of tehuantepec and system developed into tropical depression five e on july 24 while located 500 mi 800 km southwest of manzanillo mexico located in an area of weak steering currents and easterly wind shear tropical depression drifted to north northeast while convection was displaced up to 70 mi 110 km west of circulation slightly strengthening occurred and on july 25 depression intensified into tropical storm dalila storm turned to northwest and later to west northwest and remained a minimal tropical storm until july 28 when a decrease in wind shear allowed dalila to strengthen a strong anticyclone developed to north of system causing dalila to accelerate to northwest late on july 28 dalila reached a peak intensity of 65 mph 105 km h at a position 570 mi 915 km southwest of cabo san lucas tropical storm dalila slowly weakened after moving over progressively cooler water temperatures and on august 1 it degenerated into a tropical depression dalila turned to southwest after much of convection waned and system dissipated on august 2 tropical storm erick on july 17 a tropical wave exited coast of africa and moved westward an area of convection along wave organized slightly on july 18 though next day convection diminished after moving through windward islands on july 23 deep convection again increased system failed to organize further though convection continued to develop upon entering eastern pacific ocean on july 27 cloudiness and thunderstorms became more consolidated off coast of southern mexico and on july 31 dvorak classifications began on system a circulation developed and system organized into tropical depression six e on august 1 while located about 520 mi 835 km south of southern tip of baja california peninsula initially depression was a small system with moderate amounts of easterly wind shear it organized slowly and after moving to southwest for 24 hours it turned to northwest subsequent to an increase in convection over center depression intensified into tropical storm erick on august 4 erick gradually strengthened as it moved to west northwest and reached peak winds of 65 mph 105 km h on august 5 while located about 720 miles 1160 km southwest of cabo san lucas operationally storm was forecast to continue to strengthen to reach hurricane status though this did not occur mid level ridge which had been tracking erick westward weakened resulting in erick to turn to north over cooler waters it quickly weakened to a tropical depression on august 6 and after turning to an eastward drift erick dissipated on august 8 while located 700 mi 1130 km west southwest of southern tip of baja california peninsula erick never affected land hurricane flossie a large circulation with an area of low pressure persisted in tropical eastern pacific ocean in early august large circulation was well developed by august 7 and convection concentrated a few hundred miles southwest of acapulco based on its organization national hurricane center designated system tropical depression seven e on august 8 depression intensified into tropical storm flossie based on ship reports storm paralleled coast of mexico as it moved northwestward and after a decrease of wind shear flossie developed very deep convection over its center it intensified into a hurricane on august 10 reaching peak winds of as an embedded warm spot appeared in center of storm after maintaining its peak intensity for 18 hours and passing within of baja california peninsula flossie weakened over cooler waters and degenerated to a tropical storm on august 12 storm continued to weaken and early on august 14 flossie dissipated government of mexico issued a tropical storm warning from punta tejupan to cabo corrientes early in its life though it was discontinued shortly thereafter officials issued a tropical storm watch and later a warning for baja california sur south of la paz which was later extended from loreto on east coast to san juanico on west coast large circulation of hurricane flossie produced gusty winds along west coast of mexico and southern baja california peninsula cabo san lucas reported a gust of 55 mph 90 km h and san jose del cabo recorded a gust of 65 mph 105 km h storm produced heavy rainfall peaking at at san felipe los cabos seven people died in mexico from storm including two that drowned in cabo san lucas a monsoon surge moving around its eastern periphery produced heavy rainfall in american southwest flooding from rainfall killed one person and left eleven motorists stranded thunderstorms in tucson arizona produced hurricane force wind gusts which caused widespread power outages and damage damage from storm in arizona totaled to 5 million 1995 usd usd although damage in mexico if any is unknown tropical storm gil an area of disturbed weather possibly related to a tropical wave persisted and gradually organized in gulf of tehuantepec a circulation developed within its deep convection and system organized into tropical depression seven e on august 19 while located about 115 mi 185 km southeast of acapulco operationally it was not until 15 hours later that national hurricane center initiated advisories on system depression moved westward and quickly intensified into a tropical storm a nearby ship confirmed existence of tropical storm force winds and gil reached winds of 50 mph 80 km h early on august 21 with well defined outflow and continually developing convection forecasters predicted gil to strengthen more and attain hurricane status within two days of becoming a tropical storm however increased northeasterly wind shear initially prevented further strengthening on august 22 cloud pattern of gil became better organized though low level circulation was located to northeast of deep convection due to wind shear shear also limited outflow to east preventing further strengthening gradually convection developed nearer to center after gil turned to northwest deep convection organized into a central dense overcast and it strengthened to reach winds of 60 mph 95 km h on august 24 later that day storm attained a peak strength of 65 mph 105 km h while located 380 mi 610 km southwest of southern tip of baja california peninsula after maintaining its peak strength for 30 hours gil moved over progressively cooler waters and weakened to a tropical depression on august 26 depression drifted westward and later turned to north and dissipated on august 27 while located 670 mi 1075 km to west of cabo san lucas while located a short distance off of mexico gil produced heavy rainfall near coast however there were no reports of casualties or damages in association with storm hurricane henriette a tropical wave moved off coast of africa on august 15 it traversed westward and entered eastern pacific ocean on august 29 system quickly developed deep convection and a low level circulation and on september 1 it organized into tropical depression nine e while located about 170 mi 270 km off southwest coast of mexico under favorable conditions depression slowly strengthened to become tropical storm henriette on september 2 while located 220 mi 350 km west of manzanillo henriette quickly organized and intensified into a hurricane on september 3 while located 135 mi 235 km west southwest of puerto vallarta in jalisco late on september 3 an eye began to form in center of deep convection as henriette turned to northwest eye became better defined next day and henriette attained a peak intensity of 100 mph 160 km h as northern portion of eyewall moved over southern baja california peninsula hurricane quickly crossed southern tip of baja california peninsula and re emerged into pacific ocean convection gradually waned as hurricane moved over progressively colder waters and on september 6 henriette weakened to a tropical depression on september 2 a few hours after henriette became a tropical storm government of mexico issued tropical cyclone warnings and watches for baja california peninsula threat of hurricane henriette prompted a carnival cruise line ship to alter their route winds of up to in southern baja california sur left much of cabo san lucas without water or power 2 000 people were directly affected by hurricane a strong storm surge produced flooding and heavy road damage in state 800 people were forced from their homes and crop damage was reported no damage estimates are available and no deaths were reported hurricane ismael hurricane ismael developed from a persistent area of deep convection on september 12 and steadily strengthened as it moved to north northwest ismael attained hurricane status on september 14 while located 210 mi 340 km off coast of mexico it continued to north and after passing a short distance east of baja california peninsula it made landfall on topolobampo in state of sinaloa with winds of 80 mph 130 km h ismael rapidly weakened over land and dissipated on september 16 over northwestern mexico remnants entered united states and extended eastward into mid atlantic states offshore ismael produced waves of up to 30 ft 9 m in height hundreds of fishermen were unprepared by hurricane which was expected to move more slowly and as a result 52 ships were wrecked killing 57 fishermen hurricane destroyed thousands of houses leaving 30 000 people homeless on land ismael caused 59 casualties in mainland mexico and resulted in 26 million in damage 1995 usd usd moisture from storm extended into united states causing heavy rainfall and localized moderate damage in southeastern new mexico hurricane juliette hurricane juliette was strongest and final hurricane of season it formed on september 16 from a tropical wave off southwest coast of mexico and moved west northwest for early part of its duration juliette was smaller than usual tropical cyclones and as a result it intensified quickly reaching hurricane status on september 18 and major hurricane status a day later on september 20 juliette reached peak winds of 150 mph 240 km h a category 4 on saffir simpson hurricane scale it subsequently began a slow weakening trend and turned toward northeast briefly threatening baja california peninsula instead strong wind shear overcame storm and juliette dissipated on september 26 without significantly affecting land other systems according to joint typhoon warning center jtwc on january 4 a tropical depression formed east of international dateline on january 4 and three days later it exited cphc s area of responsibility according to jtwc and japan meteorological agency on november 10 a tropical depression formed east
