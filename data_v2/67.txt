screenplay thin red line 1962 by james jones was adapted by malick over course of five months new york based producer bobby geisler first approached malick in 1978 and asked him to direct a film adaptation of david rabe s play in boom boom room malick declined offer but instead discussed idea of a film about life of joseph merrick once word got out about david lynch s film of elephant man he shelved idea in 1988 geisler and john roberdeau met with malick in paris about writing and directing a movie based on d m thomas 1981 novel white hotel malick declined but told them that he would be willing instead to write either an adaptation of moliere s or of james jones thin red line producers chose latter and paid malick 250 000 to write a screenplay malick began adapting thin red line on january 1 1989 five months later producers received his first draft which was 300 pages long according to an article in entertainment weekly they gained director s confidence by catering to his every whim providing him with obscure research material including a book titled reptiles and amphibians of australia an audiotape of kodo heartbeat drummers of japan information on navajo code talkers recruited by united states marine corps to communicate in their native navajo language to evade understanding by japanese troops intercepting radio transmissions making his travel plans and helping director and his wife michele get a mortgage for their paris apartment producers spent a lot of time talking with malick about his vision of film geisler said malick s guadalcanal would be a paradise lost an eden raped by green poison as terry used to call it of war much of violence was to be portrayed indirectly a soldier is shot but rather than showing a bloody face we see a tree explode shredded vegetation and a gorgeous bird with a broken wing flying out of a tree malick spent years working on other projects including a stage production of sansho bailiff and a script known as english speaker spending 2 million of producers money half of which for writing in 1990 he met with james jones widow gloria and his daughter about adapting thin red line into a film by january 1995 geisler and roberdeau were broke and pressured malick to decide which one he would complete they approached malick s former agent mike medavoy who was setting up his own production company phoenix pictures and he agreed to give them 100 000 to start work on thin red line medavoy had a deal with sony pictures and malick began scouting locations in panama and costa rica before settling on rain forests of northern australia in april 1997 three months before filming sony pulled plug while crews were building sets in queensland because new studio chairman john did not think malick could make his movie with proposed 52 million budget malick traveled to los angeles with medavoy to pitch project to various studios 20th century fox agreed to put up 39 million of budget with stipulation that malick cast five movie stars from a list of 10 who were interested pioneer films a japanese company contributed 8 million to budget and phoenix added 3 million casting casting for film became a hot topic when sean penn met malick he told him give me a dollar and tell me where to show up scripts were also sent to robert de niro robert duvall and tom cruise in 1995 once word went out that malick was making another movie after many years numerous actors approached him flooding casting directors until they had to announce they wouldn t be accepting more requests some a list actors including brad pitt al pacino gary oldman and george clooney offered to work for a fraction and some even offered to work for free bruce willis even went as far as offering to pay for first class tickets for casting crew to get a few lines for movie at medavoy s home in 1995 malick staged a reading with martin sheen delivering screen directions and kevin costner will patton peter berg lukas haas and dermot mulroney playing main roles in june of that year a five day workshop was scheduled at medavoy s with pitt dropping by and culminating with malick putting on soundtrack of where eagles dare and playing japanese taiko drums malick met with an interested johnny depp about project at book soup bistro on sunset strip edward norton flew out to austin and met malick who had been impressed by actor s screen test for primal fear matthew mcconaughey reportedly took a day off filming a time to kill to see malick others followed including william baldwin edward burns josh hartnett philip seymour hoffman stephen dorff and leonardo dicaprio latter flew up from mexico set of romeo juliet to meet malick at american airlines lounge in austin airport before casting was finalized nicolas cage had lunch with malick in hollywood in february 1996 malick went off to scout locations and tried calling cage that summer only to find out that his phone number had been disconnected tom sizemore however was offered a more substantial role in saving private ryan and when he could not contact malick for several days decided to do steven spielberg s film instead actors bill pullman mickey rourke and lukas haas filmed scenes for movie but were cut from final film due to time constraints publicity stills of pullman as sgt in a scene opposite brody and chaplin can be seen online haas is pictured in booklet of cd soundtrack and one of rourke s scenes was restored for criterion blu ray dvd release of film james caviezel who was cast as private witt credits malick s casting of him as turning point in his career principal photography cinematographer john toll began talking to malick in august 1996 several times over phone about film toll met malick in september of same year and was asked to do film in beginning of 1997 malick and toll began location scouting in february 1997 and started principal photography in june of that year pre production went slowly weeks before filming began malick told geisler and roberdeau not to show up in australia where film was being made ostensibly because george stevens jr would be on location producer supporting line producer grant hill malick told them that they had upset studio for refusing to give up above title production credit to stevens he did not tell them however that in 1996 he had a clause inserted in his contract barring producers from set geisler and roberdeau were mystified about this behavior geisler told entertainment weekly i didn t think he was capable of betrayal of this magnitude malick and toll shot for 100 days in australia using panavision cameras and lenses 24 days in solomon islands and three days in united states they scouted historic battlefields on guadalcanal and shot footage but health concerns over malaria limited filming to daylight hours only logistics were also difficult to shoot entire film there as director of photography john toll put it it s still a bit difficult to get on and off island and we had some scenes that involved 200 or 300 extras we would have had to bring everybody to guadalcanal and financially it just didn t make sense thin red line was filmed predominantly in rainforest and on bramston beach both in north queensland australia filming also took place on dancer mountain which had such rough terrain that trailers and production trucks could not make it up hill a base camp was set up and roads carved out of mountain transporting 250 actors and 200 crew members up hill took two hours filming took place in pacific ocean off coast of southern california near santa catalina island malick s unconventional filming techniques included shooting part of a scene during a bright sunny morning only to finish it weeks later at sunset he made a habit of pointing camera away during an action sequence and focus on a parrot a tree branch or other fauna malick s reputation and working methods commanded great respect among actors with both woody harrelson and john savage staying on for an extra month after they finished all of their scenes just to watch him at work post production bill pullman lukas haas and mickey rourke performed but their scenes were eventually cut billy bob thornton recorded narration that was scrapped martin sheen and viggo mortensen participated in of script and are thanked in end credits editor leslie jones was on location for five months and rarely saw malick who left her to her own devices after principal photography wrapped she came back with a five hour first cut and spent seven months editing with thornton contributing three hours of narrative voice over material it was at this point that editor billy weber joined and they spent 13 months in post production and last four months mixing film using four avid machines with a fifth added at one point malick edited footage one reel at a time with sound off while listening to a green day cd there were no preview screenings but several in house ones largest of which was attended by 15 people for marketing executives editors faced challenge of blending footage of veteran actors with less experienced ones integrating many cameos and voice overs according to jones malick removed scenes with dialogue whenever possible with final film varying greatly from original concept four months after principal photography malick invited toll to a rough cut screening of film in december 1998 toll did first color correction at lab prior to film s release in north america editing resulted in many of well known cast members being on screen for only a brief period john travolta and george clooney s appearances are little more than cameos yet clooney s name appears prominently in marketing of movie unfinished film was screened for new york press in december 1998 and adrien brody attended a screening to find that his originally significant role to carry movie as he put it had been reduced to two lines and approximately five minutes of screen time on april 15 2001 an interview with brody revealed that he was still upset over removal of his work he expressed his opinions in an interview with london newspaper independent malick was upset that studio screened his unfinished version for critics and penn ended up helping him in editing room shaping final version malick spent three more months and cut 45 additional minutes from film director refused to subject his film to test screenings before delivering his final cut after geisler and roberdeau told their story to vanity fair magazine medavoy s attorneys declared them in breach of contract and threatened to remove their names from film unless they agreed to do no future interviews until after academy awards music thin red line original motion picture soundtrack 1999 thumb

line is a daringly philosophical world war ii film with an enormous cast of eager stars on metacritic film has a weighted average score of 78 out of 100 based on 32 critics indicating generally favorable reviews gene siskel described it as finest contemporary war film i ve seen supplanting steven spielberg s saving private ryan from earlier this year or even oliver stone s platoon from 1986 a more subdued roger ebert gave it three stars saying that it felt confused and unfinished he wrote movie s schizophrenia keeps it from greatness this film has no firm idea of what it is about but doesn t make it bad it is in fact sort of fascinating battle scenes themselves are masterful in creating a sense of geography of a particular hill way it is defended by japanese bunkers ways in which american soldiers attempt to take it actors like sean penn john cusack jim caviezel and ben chaplin find perfect tone for scenes of a few seconds or a minute and then are dropped before a rhythm can be established in his review for time richard corliss wrote some films deal in plot truth this one expresses emotional truth heart s search for saving wisdom in some of most luscious imagery since malick s last film 1978 days of heaven mike clark of usa today gave film four out of four stars writing in washington post michael o sullivan wrote thin red line is a movie about creation growing out of destruction about love where you d least expect to find it and about angels especially fallen kind who just happen to be men andrew johnston of time out new york wrote like malick s previous efforts badlands 1973 and days of heaven 1978 line is a film of incredible beauty however atmosphere created by john toll s breathtaking cinematography and hans zimmer s powerful score is occasionally compromised parade of cameos john travolta george clooney woody harrelson and john cusack briefly appear is somewhat distracting and fact that bell and witt both have appalachian accents sometimes makes characters hard to differentiate yet even though it s confusing at times and perhaps a little long line is still a film of rare substance and power time out new york december 17 31 1998 p 141 owen gleiberman gave film a b in his review for entertainment weekly and wrote thin red line could i think turn out to be this season s beloved a movie too paralyzingly high minded to connect with audiences in her review for new york times janet maslin wrote heart piercing moments that punctuate its rambling are glimpses of what a tighter film might have been in a special episode of siskel and
