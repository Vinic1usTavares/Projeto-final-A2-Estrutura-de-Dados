plunketts creek is an approximately tributary of loyalsock creek in lycoming and sullivan counties in u s state of pennsylvania two unincorporated villages and a hamlet are on creek and its watershed drains in parts of five townships creek is a part of chesapeake bay drainage basin via loyalsock creek and west branch susquehanna and susquehanna rivers plunketts creek s name comes from first owner of land including creek s mouth and creek has given its name to two townships although one has since changed its name creek flows southwest and then south through dissected allegheny plateau through rock from mississippian sub period and devonian period much of plunketts creek valley is composed of various glacial deposits chiefly alluvium although plunketts creek watershed was clear cut and home to a tannery sawmills and a coal mine in nineteenth century today it is heavily wooded and known for its high water quality fishing and other recreational opportunities watershed now includes parts of loyalsock state forest pennsylvania state game lands and a state game farm for raising pheasant tourism hunting and fishing have long been important in region and year round population of plunketts creek township is increasing much faster than that of either lycoming or sullivan county name plunketts creek is named for colonel william plunkett a physician who was first president judge of northumberland county after it was formed in 1772 during conflicts with native americans he treated wounded settlers and fought natives plunkett led a pennsylvania expedition in yankee war to forcibly remove settlers from connecticut who had claimed and settled on lands also claimed by pennsylvania for his services plunkett was granted six tracts of land totaling on november 14 1776 although land was not actually surveyed until september 1783 plunkett s land included creek s mouth so plunketts creek was given his name note isbn refers to heritage books july 1996 reprint url is to a scan of 1892 version with some ocr typos during american revolution plunkett did not actively support revolution and thus was suspected of being sympathetic to british empire he died in 1791 aged about 100 and was buried in northumberland without a grave marker or monument except for creek that bears his name lycoming county was formed from northumberland county in 1795 when plunketts creek township was formed in lycoming county in 1838 original name proposed was plunkett township but lingering suspicions of his british sympathies led to that name being rejected naming township for creek was an acceptable compromise plunketts creek township was originally much larger than it is now and two other townships were formed from parts of it when sullivan county was formed from lycoming county on march 15 1847 plunketts creek township was divided between counties with each having a township of same name this led to some confusion and in 1856 citizens of sullivan county petitioned state legislature to change name of their plunketts creek township to hillsgrove township for hillsgrove main village and post office in township in 1866 cascade township was formed from parts of hepburn and plunketts creek townships in lycoming county according to meginness 1892 colonel plunkett actually spelled his last name but current spelling was established by custom and courts as of 2018 it is only stream officially named plunketts creek on usgs maps of united states and in usgs geographic names information system there is a plunkett creek in tennessee which has plunketts creek as an official variant name possessive apostrophe is not part of official name of creek although records from 19th century often spell it as plunkett s creek no native american name for plunketts creek is known two streams in watershed have given their names to roads in plunketts creek township engle run drive and mock run road course source of plunketts creek is 1440 ft 439 m above sea level northwest of unincorporated village of hillsgrove and just south of loyalsock state forest in hillsgrove township sullivan county source is a pond just north of pennsylvania route road between villages of proctor and hillsgrove and plunketts creek crosses road twice then receives two unnamed tributaries on right bank as it flows generally southwest about 1 5 miles 2 4 km to lycoming county line thumb left confluence of plunketts creek foreground with much larger loyalsock creek in village of barbours creek continues southwest as it enters plunketts creek township and receives run on left bank 4 70

bank erosion and landslide north of plunketts creek bridge no 2 from september 2011 flood plunketts creek can vary greatly in depth depending on season and recent precipitation its water level is typically highest perhaps 3 feet 1 m deep in spring or for a few days after a heavy rain and lowest in late summer when it can shrink to a trickle while there is no stream gauge on plunketts creek a rough estimate of creek s water level may be found from stream gauge on loyalsock creek bridge in barbours just downstream of mouth lycoming county operates this gauge as part of county wide flood warning system it only measures water height not discharge and measured a record gauge height of on september 7 2011 september 2011 flood was caused by remnants of tropical storm lee which dumped of rainfall in nearby village of shunk in fox township in sullivan county just north of creek s source 2011 flooding caused widespread damage in proctor and barbours and destroyed a small stone bridge on wallis run road in proctor over king run a tributary of plunketts creek barbours fire hall became an emergency relief center offering food shelter and supplies to victims of flood further downstream on loyalsock flooding badly damaged historic hillsgrove covered bridge washed out sections of pennsylvania route 87 along creek and destroyed pennsylvania route 973 and lycoming valley railroad bridges over creek near and in montoursville previous record flood reached on loyalsock flood gauge at barbours on january 19 20 1996 this major flood resulted from heavy rain snow melt and ice dams which caused millions of dollars of damage throughout lycoming county and six deaths on lycoming creek in and near williamsport on plunketts creek flood heavily damaged and later caused demolition of plunketts creek bridge no 3 a mid 19th century stone arch bridge listed on national register of historic places for images of six black and white photographs of bridge and report see here flood waters were 4 feet 1 2 m deep in barbours and it was called village s worst flood in history at time geology thumb left relief map of plunketts creek watershed in dissected allegheny plateau plunketts creek is in southern edge of dissected allegheny plateau near allegheny front underlying bedrock is sandstone and shale mostly from mississippian sub period with rock from devonian period in north of watershed northern edge of plunketts creek drainage basin is formed by ridge and popple ridge plunketts creek flows along north side of camp mountain and on turning south at proctor forms a water gap between it and cove mountain to west watershed has no oil or conventional natural gas fields however a potentially large source of natural gas is marcellus shale which lies 1 5 to 2 0 miles 2 4 to 3 2 km below surface here and stretches from new york through pennsylvania to ohio and west virginia estimates of total natural gas in black shale from devonian period range from 168 to 516 trillion cubic feet 4 76 to 14 6 trillion m3 with at least 10 percent considered recoverable pennsylvania bureau of topographic and geologic survey s distribution of pennsylvania coals map shows no major deposits of coal in plunketts creek watershed and only one deposit nearby in loyalsock creek watershed in southern plunketts creek township however meginness 1892 refers to coal mines in plunketts creek township and there is an unnamed tributary of plunketts creek in coal mine hollow on right bank between dry run and king run so it seems a small coal mine operated there in past much of plunketts creek valley and those of its tributaries is composed of various glacial deposits closer to mouth there are large deposits of alluvium as well as alluvial fan and alluvial terraces many of glacial deposits are associated with wisconsin glaciation with stratified drift and till as well as outwash present alluvium is 10 feet 3 m or more thick in lower reaches of plunketts creek valley but only 6 feet 2 m thick in headward tributary valleys outwash is described as stratified sand and gravel that form terrace remnants along flanks of loyalsock creek and plunketts creek valleys watershed thumb all of plunketts creek here near source in hoppestown is a high quality cold water fishery plunketts creek watershed drains parts of cascade mcnett and plunketts creek townships in lycoming county and fox and hillsgrove townships in sullivan county with most of watershed in plunketts creek township drainage basin area is accounting for 4 78 of loyalsock creek watershed bear creek whose mouth is also within village of barbours but on opposite left bank is nearest major creek at 0 52 miles 0 84 km downstream as measured along loyalsock creek it is also known as big bear creek as it is watershed upstream of little bear creek neighboring major watersheds on same bank are wallis run 9 56 miles 15 39 km downstream and mill creek at village of hillsgrove 9 16 miles 14 74 km upstream pleasant stream a tributary of lycoming creek is watershed to north named tributaries together account for 70 6 of plunketts creek watershed largest tributary is wolf run with an area of accounting for 31 3 of total wolf run drainage basin includes both noon branch 4 26 square miles 11 03 km2 and brian branch 1 60 square miles 4 14 km2 next largest tributary of plunketts creek is king run with or 23 6 of watershed king run watershed includes engle run with third largest tributary is dry run with or 7 6 followed by unnamed tributary in coal mine hollow with or 4 6 all other named tributaries are less than and account for less than 5 of drainage basin individually plunketts creek does not have its own watershed association but is part of larger loyalsock creek watershed association and water quality clear cutting of forests in 19th century adversely affected ecology of plunketts creek watershed and its water quality polluting industries on creek and its tributaries then included a coal mine and tannery which are long since departed for a historical perspective on pollution from both mining and tanneries see in autumn of 1897 three men working with hides at proctor tannery were stricken with anthrax two fatally another four deaths originally blamed on pneumonia were suspected of being due to pulmonary anthrax and some cattle drinking from plunketts creek downstream from tannery were also infected as late as 1959 sludge pile from tannery was still visible in proctor but was not disturbed for fear of anthrax spores article has a note that it was written in 1959 but author s name was lost prior to publication in 1966 no acid mine drainage is reported in watershed as of 1984 mean annual precipitation for loyalsock creek watershed which plunketts creek is part of was 42 to 48 inches 1067 to 1219 mm pennsylvania receives greatest amount of acid rain of any state in united states because plunketts creek is in a sandstone and shale mountain region it has a relatively low capacity to neutralize added acid this makes it especially vulnerable to increased acidification from acid rain which poses a threat to long term health of plants and animals in creek total alkalinity ta is a measure of capacity of water to neutralize acid with a larger ta corresponding to a greater capacity in 2007 ta of two subtributaries was known engle run a 4 9 mile 7 9 km tributary of king run had a ta of 5 and noon branch a 1 9 mile 3 1 km tributary of wolf run had a ta of 9 2002 pennsylvania department of conservation and natural resources dcnr report on state forest waters with special protection rated plunketts creek from its source to mouth and two of it tributaries wolf run and mock creek from county line to mouth as high quality cold water fisheries two subtributaries were rated as exceptional value streams for fishing engle run and noon branch of wolf run note what is now loyalsock state forest in plunketts creek watershed was then divided into tiadaghton state forest in lycoming county and wyoming state forest in sullivan county recreation thumb left proctor looking west surrounding mountains are popular with hunters and hikers meginness 1892 wrote that plunkett s creek township on account of its dashing mountain streams of pure water has always been a favorite place for trout fishing in 2007 pennsylvania fish and boat commission classified both engle run and noon branch of wolf run as class a wild trout waters defined as streams which support a population of naturally produced trout of sufficient size and abundance to support a long term and rewarding sport fishery barbours has been popular from early on with anglers seeking trout in sock and its tributaries as well as with hunters after black bear white tailed deer and wild turkey in surrounding forests besides fishing plunketts creek watershed contains much of of pennsylvania state game lands no 134 in both lycoming and sullivan counties habitat is found there for deer ruffed grouse and wild turkey hunting trapping and fishing are possible with proper licenses on both state forest and state game lands camping hiking mountain bike and horseback riding snowmobiling cross country skiing and bird watching are all possible on state forest lands southern end of 27 1 mile 43 6 km long old loggers path a loop hiking trail runs through watershed just north of engle and wolf runs history early inhabitants first recorded inhabitants of susquehanna river valley were iroquoian speaking susquehannocks their name meant people of muddy river in algonquian decimated by diseases and warfare they had died out moved away or been assimilated into other tribes by early 18th century lands of west branch susquehanna river valley were then chiefly occupied by munsee phratry of lenape or delaware and were under nominal control of five later six nations of iroquois on november 5 1768 british acquired new purchase from iroquois in treaty of fort stanwix opening what are now lycoming and sullivan counties to settlement initial settlements were on or near west branch susquehanna river and as noted plunkett did not receive land including creek until 1776 nor was it surveyed until 1783 it is not clear if plunkett ever lived on his land he resided in northumberland at time of his death a squatter named was first recorded inhabitant of what became plunketts creek township living there some time between 1770 and 1776 he was reputed to be a deserter from british army and left only when he was captured by british soldiers lumber and tannery thumb plunketts creek bridge no 3 built between 1840 and 1875 carried traffic for tannery in proctor like all streams in lycoming and sullivan counties plunketts creek served as an area for settlers to establish homesteads mills and to a lesser extent farms barbours first village on creek was founded in 1832 when john s barbour a scottish immigrant built a sawmill opposite mouth of plunketts creek on loyalsock creek originally known as barbour s mills village is in a rare area of flat land in narrow loyalsock valley and contains mouths of both plunketts and bear creeks barbours became a lumber center which owed its existence to those forested mountains and creeks that flow out of them john scaife arrived in 1856 and became a prosperous lumberman and farmer his family became prominent in barbours and in 1997 his 86 year old granddaughter scaife houser landon recalled that in her childhood every family that had 15 cents to their name had a sawmill for cutting lumber by 1878 village had several blacksmiths a temperance hotel its own post office many sawmills a school and a wagon maker barbours flourished throughout rest of nineteenth century in 1868 proctor was built as a company town in midst of timber required for tannery barbours had initially been considered for site second village on plunketts creek was originally named for thomas e proctor of boston who produced leather for soles of shoes there proctor was brought to area by william stone of standing stone township in bradford county who knew area was one vast tract of hemlock timber proctor tannery employed several hundred at wages between 50 cents and 1 75 a day employees living in one hundred twenty company houses each renting for 2 a month hemlock bark used in tanning process was hauled to tannery from up to 8 miles 13 km away in both summer and winter using wagons and sleds hides which were tanned to make leather came from united states and as far away as mexico argentina and china in 1892 proctor had a barber shop two blacksmiths cigar stand i o o f hall leather shop news stand a post office established in 1885 a two room school two stores and a wagon shop finished sole leather was hauled by horse drawn wagon south about 8 miles 13 km to little bear creek where it was exchanged for green hides and other supplies brought north from montoursville plunketts creek was a source of power in nineteenth century and water powered sawmills woolen mills and grist grain mills lined sock and plunketts and big bear creeks although hemlock logs were originally left to rot after their bark was peeled for tanning with time their lumber was used among other places in a sawmill on engle run north of proctor by 1892 there were two steam powered sawmills on plunketts creek one 0 5 miles 0 8 km above mouth and other 4 0 miles 6 4 km up creek near hoppestown an extension of susquehanna and eagles mere railroad crossed an unnamed tributary of plunketts creek near its source in sullivan county in 1906 running from village of hillsgrove northwest to lumber boomtown of masten in cascade and mcnett townships in lycoming county note shows susquehanna and eagles mere railroad as cited in a logging railroad was built by central pennsylvania lumber company cpl in far northern part of watershed in 1920s it crossed engle run twice and ran parallel to wolf run near both their sources note shows line as lumber rr no other railroads crossed or ran along plunketts creek decline and renewal thumb left plunketts creek valley looking southwest with northcentral state game farm pheasant enclosures coal mine hollow in cove mountain is at left lumber boom on plunketts creek ended when virgin timber ran out by 1898 old growth hemlock was exhausted and proctor tannery then owned by elk tanning company was closed and dismantled lumbering continued in watershed but last logs were floated down plunketts creek to loyalsock in 1905 susquehanna and eagles mere railroad was abandoned in sections between 1922 and 1930 as lumber it was built to transport was depleted cpl logging railroad and their masten sawmills were abandoned in 1930 without timber populations of proctor and barbours declined barbours post office closed in 1930s and proctor post office closed on july 1 1953 both villages also lost their schools and almost all of their businesses proctor celebrated its centennial in 1968 and a 1970 newspaper article on its thirty ninth annual proctor homecoming reunion called it a near deserted old tannery town in 1980s last store in barbours closed and former hotel which had become a hunting club was torn down to make way for a new bridge across loyalsock creek second growth forests have since covered most of clear cut land beginnings of today s protected areas were established in late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries pennsylvania s state legislature authorized acquisition of abandoned clear cut land in 1897 creating state forest system game commission began acquiring property for state game lands in 1920 and established northcentral state game farm on plunketts creek in 1945 to raise wild turkey it was converted to ringneck pheasant production in 1981 and as of 2007 it is one of four pennsylvania state game farms producing about 200 000 pheasants each year for release on land open to public hunting northcentral state game farm is in plunketts creek valley just south of proctor and a part of it is on right bank of loyalsock creek downstream of confluence loyalsock state game farm is 13 miles 21 km downstream on loyalsock creek at village of when a may 2007 fire destroyed a brooder house there just days before 18 000 pheasant chicks were due to hatch eggs were transferred to nearby northcentral state game farm without reduction in production goal thumb plunketts creek cutting through camp mountain in village of proctor creek s ecosystem has recovered since it was a tannery s waste disposal system from 1868 to 1898 as of 2007 proctor has two separate businesses a general store which also sells gasoline and a bed and breakfast church which used to host annual proctor homecoming reunions still stands but is closed barbours has no store or gas station but does have one church barbours is home to plunketts creek township volunteer fire company and township municipal building which houses a small branch library since 1967 barbours has been home to pneu dart which makes tranquilizer darts and guns for livestock and wildlife capture and control in 1997 pneu dart had eight employees today much of plunketts creek s watershed is wooded and protected as part of loyalsock state forest or pennsylvania state game lands no 134 pennsylvania s state forests and game lands are managed and small scale lumbering operations continue in watershed today barbours has one sawmill in 1997 it had thirty contract loggers and fifteen employees with 1 2 million in annual gross sales plunketts creek has been a place for lumber and tourism since its villages were founded before advent of automobiles area was quite isolated and 16 mile 26 km trip to montoursville took at least three hours today it takes less than half an hour
