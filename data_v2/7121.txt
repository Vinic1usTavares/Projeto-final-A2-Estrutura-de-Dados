with breathy background vocals featuring sounds effect including repeated kissing noises roberts sings about falling in love with someone as she sings aah say that you love me say that you need me too best you ever had it could be so easy for you to please me baby so how come you tease me roberts discussed track on her blog commenting that its lyrical content alludes to a boy that initially does not share same feelings as his partner but in end you win him over and it s your lucky day you can take it however you want though maybe you won on scratch cards and so you had a lucky day that kind of thing roberts described it as a romantic reference with a down beat track underneath and in contrast called top line of track quite cute and girly a remix of song was producer by band white lies

a y during promotion for cinderella s eyes album lucky day was well received by contemporary critics popjustice responded positively it must be hard being nicola roberts imagine living your life knowing that at any point you might be crushed by weight of your own noting that band dragonette was a large part behind success of track dan from online magazine so so gay found song to be a perfect medium between classic pop lyrics and a pulsating dance beat and positively commented on riffs within track stating they would satisfy most hoxton of hipsters emily mackay from nme declared i d be a bit freaked out by a phonecall like that in response to lyrics i d like a phone call i d like to hear something like this mackay called track classy and concluded her review saying sugar spun electropop goes down smooth despite listing lucky day as one of singles of week alex macpherson of metro gave a predominantly negative review noting she s lionised by a cult fan base but wider appeal remains elusive and further explaining that her voice is simultaneously too weak and shrill to carry music video background music video for lucky day was directed by stephen agnes it was filmed in new york city on east village during production of music video they were not allowed to play music on streets and so roberts had to wear an ear piece with track playing of which she stated people were staring at as she was jumping around on set with no music playing so people did not understand what she was doing roberts expressed her discomfort with shoot due to weather saying video was really relaxed it was so hot i was literally dripping not nice in between takes i had about 5 fans on me one up front of my dress one up back of my dress i was wearing trainers again i learnt from day before that i needed to bandage my feet up so they couldn t expand anymore we couldn t play music on street so i was wearing an ear piece with my track playing loads of people were stopping and looking at me like i d lost it jumping up and down to what they thought was no music playing gotta do what you gotta do everyone worked so hard in getting video together considering conditions i was really grateful synopsis right thumb music video features roberts performing in east village in new york city while special effects changed tone throughout music video video starts with a coin dropped onto ground after which a title card that reads roberts name and track title is shown as title changes color roberts walks and skips down a new york city street wearing a floral t shirt dress effects are placed on roberts with sperm cells graffitied on it shadow her movement with neon colors and throughout becomes increasingly prominent and during second verse roberts performs a short dance movement with two back up dancers before she walks past a wall with sperm graffitied on it which also changes to multiple neon colours as video progresses roberts interacts with buildings and objects such as new york style newspaper dispensers and following this her entire body has effects placed upon it as she changes color and shades and last frames of video show more of same effects and finally shows a frame of a new york street with roberts walking out of frame before camera moves upwards to show a purple sky release and reception a promotional teaser was released before full release of video it saw roberts walking on new york city pavements with a pair of backing dancers gaining looks from men it also showed a neon style aspect of video where roberts wore nike air max trainers with neon moving sperm shaped graffiti moving to beat of track ok magazine responded well whilst noting her unusually short dress in video they said we can t help but feel upbeat and summery when watching star bounce about for single lucky day aaron spencer charles of metro gave a mixed review whilst describing video he ended with and that s it really nicola strolls along with a few colourful effects to keep things interesting maybe adding a male model would have made things a bit livelier popjustice commented on nicola s seemingly lack of confidence in video stating nicola you light up our world like nobody else but when you smile at ground it ain t hard to tell you don t know you re beautiful her short dress in video sparked criticism from some critics to which roberts responded saying i m not safe with fashion and i haven t been for a long time i liked it and everybody on team liked it on day it was 120 degrees so anything longer i d have died formats and track listings cd single lucky day 3 20 7
