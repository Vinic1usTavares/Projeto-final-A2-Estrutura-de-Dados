together they started out with an idea for hold tight and madonna loved it after finishing writing lyrics she invited mnek to recording studio to finish its production rapper was satisfied with outcome and described sessions as cool and recalled madonna giving him chocolate peanut butter sweets in studio hold tight is a reflective and sombre midtempo pop ballad having atmospheric keyboards military drums and flourishes of pastel electronics as its main instrumentation its tribal chorus gallops euphorically over twinkling arpeggio picked out by a juno whistle which according to quietus amy pettifer is reminiscent of kate bush s running up that hill john marrs of gay times noted song s synths remind of confessions on a dance floor s forbidden love and euphoric instrumentals of british electronica band faithless lyrically song talks about holding on and being strong with madonna singing about being scarred and bruised for adam r holz of plugged in song permeates in same lyrical content of living for love while pettifer noted that it s a galvanising anthem of shoulder to shoulder survival that s collective and communal rather than intimate and romantic critical response joe lynch of billboard described song as an immediately familiar track with an epic arresting chorus lewis corner of digital spy gave emphasis to space madonna s voice is given to shine something we d like to hear more often lauren murphy of irish times described it as an old school pop song and picked it as a standout track whilst john marrs of gay times claimed that mid tempo track underpinned by a dirty bass bears little resemblance to sparse pedestrian demo also noting that when melody is lush as this she could be singing a recipe from mary berry s cookbook as far as we care amy pettifer of quietus saw it as shakira s whenever wherever as seen through murky lens of a lost generation sam c mac of slant magazine called it a perfectly acceptable album filler innocuous lyrically platitudinous pop that briefly works itself up into something exciting when it threatens to become a stomp however mac noted that i t wouldn t be particularly lamentable were it not for fact that there are so many better choices for standard edition of album that have been relegated to bonus tracks ludovic hunter tilney of financial times called it a dull ballad while for saeed saeed of national song is first of a few tracks that should have been cut criticizing its atmospheric keyboards for being sleep inducing evan sawdey of popmatters named it one of album s forgettable jams and a generic thump meanwhile lydia jenkins of new zealand herald opined that hold tight has so little substance that it seems wrong to call it a song chart performance following its digital release on february 9 2015 as instant grat for pre ordering album hold tight entered record charts of several countries in united kingdom song was unable to enter uk singles chart but it reached number 97 on its
