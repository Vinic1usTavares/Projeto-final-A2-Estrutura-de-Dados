cattle herders or ranchers they also found a branding iron which cowboys had used to change u s brand into d 8 stealing mules was a federal offense because animals were government property cowboy frank patterson made an agreement with captain hurst and hurst persuaded posse to withdraw with understanding that mules would be returned cowboys showed up two days later without mules and laughed at hurst and earps in response hurst printed a handbill describing theft and he charged mclaury with hiding mules he also reproduced handbill in tombstone epitaph on july 30 1880 mclaury angrily printed

threatened their lives virgil reported that mclaury accosted him and said if you ever again follow us as close as you did then you will have to fight anyway a month later earp ran into frank and tom mclaury in charleston and they told him that they would kill him if he ever followed them as he had done before becomes deputy sheriff county sheriff charles a shibell appointed earp as deputy sheriff for eastern part of pima county arizona on july 28 1880 which included tombstone and earp passed his wells fargo job as shotgun messenger to his brother morgan wyatt did his job well and his name was mentioned nearly every week from august through november in tombstone epitaph or nugget newspapers deputy sheriff s position was worth more than 40 000 a year about today because he was also county assessor and tax collector and board of supervisors allowed him to keep 10 percent of amounts paid town marshal shot on october 28 1880 tombstone town marshal fred white attempted to break up a group of five late night drunken revelers shooting at moon on allen street deputy sheriff earp was in owens saloon a block away though unarmed he heard shooting and ran to scene borrowed a pistol from fred dodge and went to assist white he saw white attempt to disarm curly bill brocius and gun discharged striking white in groin earp pistol whipped brocius knocking him to ground then he grabbed brocius by collar and told him to get up brocius asked what have i done fred dodge arrived on scene and he recalled what he saw in a letter to stuart lake years later earp altered his story later on telling john h flood jr that he did not see brocius s pistol on ground in dark until afterward pistol contained one expended cartridge and five live rounds brocius waived a preliminary hearing so that his case could be transferred to tucson district court and virgil and wyatt escorted him to tucson to stand trial possibly saving him from a lynching white age 31 died of his wound two days after his shooting on december 27 1880 earp testified that white s shooting was accidental brocius expressed regret saying that he had not intended to shoot white gunsmith jacob gruber testified that brocius s single action revolver was defective allowing it to be discharged at half cock a statement was introduced which white had made stating that shooting was accidental judge ruled that shooting was accidental and released brocius brocius however remained intensely angry about how earp had pistol whipped him and he became an enemy to earps shibell election on november 2 1880 shibell unexpectedly won election by a margin of 58 votes under suspicious circumstances james c hancock reported that cowboys curly bill brocius and johnny ringo had served as election officials in san simon precinct although biographer david johnson places ringo in new mexico with ike clanton on november 1 day before election curly bill had been arrested and jailed in tucson on october 28 for shooting marshal white and he was still there on election day home of john magill was used as polling place precinct only contained about 10 eligible voters another source says 50 but cowboys gathered non voters such as children and chinese and had them cast ballots they then gave names to all dogs donkeys and poultry and cast ballots in their names for shibell precinct 27 in san simon valley in northern cochise county turned out 104 votes 103 of them for shibell election board met on november 14 and declared shibell winner paul filed a lawsuit on november 19 contesting election results alleging that shibell s cowboy supporters ike clanton curly bill brocius and frank mclaury had conspired in ballot stuffing in late january 1881 chief justice of arizona c g w french ruled in paul s favor but shibell appealed a recount found that paul had 402 votes and shibell had 354 in april 1881 when election commission found that a mysterious henry johnson was responsible for certifying ballots this turned out to be same james k johnson who had been shooting up allen street night when marshal white was killed moreover he had testified at curly bill s preliminary hearing after he shot fred white johnson later testified in election hearing and said that ballots had been left in care of ike clanton s brother phineas none of witnesses during election hearing reported on ballots being cast by dogs paul was declared winner of pima county sheriff election however election was a moot point by then as paul could not replace behan with earp because cochise county was created out of eastern portion of pima county on january 1 1881 earp loses reappointment earp served as deputy sheriff for eastern pima county for only three months because democrat shibell ran for re election against republican challenger robert h paul in november region was strongly republican and paul was expected to win earp was a republican and expected that he would continue in job given how fast eastern pima county was growing many expected that it would be split off into its own county soon with tombstone as its seat and earp hoped to win job as new county s sheriff and continue receiving 10 of all tax money collected southern pacific was major landholder so tax collection was a relatively easy process in 1882 cochise county sheriff earned 24 010 52 or about today in fees earp resigned from sheriff s office on november 9 1880 and shibell immediately appointed johnny behan as new deputy sheriff for eastern pima county behan had considerably more political experience than earp as he had served as yavapai county sheriff from 1871 to 1873 he had been elected to arizona territorial legislature twice representing yavapai country in 7th territorial legislature in 1873 and mohave county in 10th in 1879 behan moved to northwest arizona territory where he served as mohave county recorder in 1877 and then deputy sheriff of mohave county at gillet in 1879 behan wins election earp and behan both applied for new position of cochise county sheriff which paid office holder 10 of fees and taxes collected as did pima county sheriff job earp thought that he had a good chance to win because he was former undersheriff in region and a republican like arizona territorial governor john c fremont however behan had greater political experience and influence in prescott earp later testified at o k corral hearing that he and behan had made a deal he said that behan and he agreed that if earp withdrew his application behan would appoint him as undersheriff behan received appointment in february 1881 but he did not keep his end of bargain and instead chose harry woods as undersheriff who was a prominent democrat behan testified at first that he had not made any deal with earp although he later admitted that he had lied he said that he broke his promise to earp because of an incident which occurred shortly before his appointment when earp learned that ike and billy clanton had one of his prize horses which had been stolen more than a year before earp and holliday rode to clanton ranch near charleston to recover horse and overtook behan along way who was riding in a wagon behan also was heading to ranch to serve an election hearing subpoena on ike clanton from turner alford ed o k corral inquest 1992 accounts differ as to what happened next but earp testified that billy clanton gave up horse when earp arrived at ranch even before being presented with ownership papers according to behan s testimony however earp had told clantons that behan was on his way to arrest them for horse theft incident embarrassed both clantons and behan and behan later testified that he did not want to work with earp and chose woods instead relationship with sadie marcus thumb a possible image of josephine sarah marcus who left a relationship with johnny behan and took up with wyatt earp later in life josephine sarah marcus aggressively protected her and wyatt s history while in tombstone marcus was deliberately vague about this period causing modern researchers to question what she was hiding she said that she first visited tombstone as part of pauline markham theater troupe on december 1 1879 for a one week engagement but modern researchers have not found any record that she was ever part of theater company many contradictions in her story have led to considerable speculation about her past researchers have identified two women with similar names in same region of arizona territory whose lives bear many striking parallels sadie mansfield and sadie marcus were both known by their friends as sadie both made a stagecoach journey from san francisco to prescott arizona territory both traveled with a black woman named julia both were sexual partners with behan both were 19 years old born in new york city and had parents from prussia only difference noted in 1880 census is in their occupations sadie who lived in san francisco is listed as at home while sadie in tip top is recorded as a courtesan josephine said that her parents hid her activities and they may have been covering for her when census taker was a neighbor who knew family behan owned a saloon in tip top arizona where he maintained a prostitute named sadie mansfield and he moved to tombstone in september 1880 sadie was a popular nickname for sarah and prostitutes commonly changed their first names sadie mansfield prostitute may have returned to san francisco and then rejoined behan in tombstone in september 1880 as sadie marcus where they continued their relationship in spring 1881 sadie found behan in bed with wife of a friend and kicked him out although she still used behan surname through end of that summer earp had a common law relationship with mattie blaylock modern researchers have found her listed as earp s wife in june 1880 census she suffered from severe headaches and became addicted to laudanum a commonly used opiate and painkiller and later committed suicide when marcus learned that stuart lake had discovered existence of blaylock she successfully demanded that he omit her from his book i married wyatt earp after marcus arrived in tombstone with behan earp apparently developed an interest in her although there are no records in tombstone of a relationship between josephine and earp tombstone diarist george w parsons never mentioned seeing wyatt and josephine together and neither did john clum in his memoirs but earp and marcus certainly knew each other as behan and earp both had offices above crystal palace saloon in april 1882 shortly after leaving tombstone following earp vendetta ride there is evidence that earp had feelings for marcus earp posse went to albuquerque new mexico for two weeks wyatt and holliday had been fast friends since holliday saved earp s life in dodge city during 1878 wyatt was staying with prominent businessman henry n jaffa who was also president of new albuquerque s board of trade like josephine jaffa was jewish during their stay in albuquerque two men ate at retreat restaurant owned by fat charlie former new mexico territory governor miguel otero described in a letter he wrote in 1940 an incident that indicates earp s feelings for marcus he wrote holliday said something about earp becoming a damn jew boy earp became angry and left henry jaffa told me later that earp s woman was a jewess earp did when entering house earp s anger at holliday s ethnic slur may indicate that his feelings for josephine were more serious at time than is commonly known information in letter is compelling because at that time in 1940s possibility of a prior relationship between wyatt earp and josephine marcus while in tombstone was unknown otero could know these things only if he had a relationship with someone who had personal knowledge of individuals involved marcus went to great lengths to sanitize her own and wyatt s history for example she worked hard to keep both her name and name of wyatt s second wife mattie out of stuart lake s 1931 book wyatt earp frontier marshal and marcus threatened litigation to keep it that way marcus also told earp s biographers and others that earp never drank did not own gambling saloons and that he never provided prostitutes to customers although strong evidence to contrary exists interest in mining and gambling thumb business card for tombstone s oriental saloon with names of w erp r b clark and l losing undersheriff position left earp without a job in tombstone however he and his brothers were beginning to make some money on their mining claims in tombstone area in january 1881 oriental saloon owner mike joyce gave earp a 25 percent interest in faro concession at oriental saloon in exchange for his services as a manager and enforcer gambling was regarded as a legitimate profession at time earp invited his friend bat masterson to tombstone to help him run faro tables in saloon and he telegraphed luke short in june 1881 to offer him a job as a faro dealer masterson remained until april 1881 when he returned to dodge city to assist his brother jim facing down a lynch mob michael o rourke killed henry schneider chief engineer of tombstone mining and milling company and said that it was in self defense schneider was well liked and a mob of miners quickly gathered and threatened to lynch o rourke on spot lake s biography describes earp single handedly dispersing mob but epitaph gave primary credit to ben sippy for calming crowd assisted by virgil earp wyatt earp and johnny behan nevertheless lake s account added to earp s modern legend as a lawman stagecoach robbers kill two tensions increased between earps and both clantons and mclaurys through 1881 three cowboys attempted to rob a kinnear company stagecoach on march 15 1881 at 10 pm which was reportedly carrying 26 000 in silver bullion about in today s dollars amount of bullion which stagecoach actually carried is questioned by modern researchers who note that bullion would have weighed about since value of silver at time was 1 an ounce a significant weight for a team of horses according to wells fargo agent john q jackson a stagecoach typically carried an express box containing bullion weighing only history of stage coach in west holdup took place near benson during which robbers killed driver eli budd philpot and

known cowboy movie star william s hart to help set record straight about his life and get a movie made if story were exploited on screen by you he wrote hart it would do much toward setting me right before a public which has always been fed lies about me hart encouraged earp to first find an author to pen his story in 1925 earp began to collaborate on a biography with his friend and former mining engineer john flood to get his story told in a way that he approved flood volunteered his time and attempted to write an authorized biography of earp s life based on earp s recollections two men sat together every sunday in kitchen of earp s modest rented bungalow while wyatt a drink and smoked a cigar they tried to tell earp s story but josephine was always present she often interrupted and insisted you can t write that it needs to be clean she also demanded that they add more pep to manuscript which in her mind meant including word crack in all capitals in chapter about shootout manuscript includes 109 uses of crack she thought earp needed to be shown as a hero and manuscript includes a chapter titled conflagration in which earp saves two women one a cripple from a tombstone fire flood s writing was stilted corny and one dimensional and manuscript completed some time in early 1926 never found a publisher in february 1927 editor anne johnston of bobbs merrill wrote back and was highly critical of stilted florid and diffuse writing she wrote now one forgets what it s all about in clutter of unimportant details that impedes its pace and pompous manner of its telling spolidora as a teenager had visited earps many times near her family home in needles california and she sometimes went to san diego with them in an interview with san bernardino historical society in 1990 she attributed highly exaggerated stories about wyatt earp to josephine josephine would always interfere whenever wyatt would talk with stuart lake she always interfered she wanted him to look like a church going saint and blow things up wyatt didn t want that at all hart tried to help in february 1926 he wrote saturday evening post and encouraged them to publish flood s biography so that rising generation may know real from unreal but flood was a horrendous writer and publisher after publisher rejected manuscript several copies were made and sold in 1981 and original carbon copy of

shouldered with a large blonde mustache he is dignified self contained game and fearless and no man commands greater respect he weighed about was long armed and muscular and was very capable of using his fists instead of his weapon to control those resisting his authority at about same time mirror a newspaper in monroe iowa printed a wire story originating in denver anonymous reporter described wyatt in detail in 1926 writer adela rogers st johns met elderly earp for first time contemporary reputation among his peers near his death wyatt was respected his deputy jimmy cairns described wyatt s work as a police officer in wichita kansas wyatt earp was a wonderful officer he was game to last ditch and apparently afraid of nothing cowmen all respected him and seemed to recognize his superiority and authority at such times as he had to use it he described wyatt as most dependable man i ever knew a quiet unassuming chap who never drank and in all respects a clean young fellow when citizens of dodge city learned earps had been charged with murder after gunfight they sent letters endorsing and supporting earps to judge wells spicer john clum owner of tombstone epitaph and mayor of tombstone while wyatt was a gambler and lawman there described him in his book it all happened in tombstone bill dixon knew wyatt early in his adult life he wrote public perception of his life has varied over years as media accounts of his life have changed story of earps actions in tombstone were published at time by newspapers nationwide shortly after shooting of curly bill tucson star wrote on march 21 1882 in an editorial about o k corral gunfight that cowboys had been ordered to put their hands up and after they complied were shot by earps stating whole series of killings cannot be classed other than cold blooded murder famous lawman bat masterson described wyatt in 1907 experience in gun fights wyatt was reputed to be an expert with a revolver he showed no fear of any man tombstone epitaph said of wyatt bravery and determination were requisites and in every instance proved himself right man in right place wyatt was lucky during few gun fights he took part in from his earliest job as an assistant police officer in wichita to tombstone where he was briefly deputy u s marshal unlike his lawmen brothers virgil and james wyatt was never wounded although once his clothing and his saddle were shot through with bullet holes according to john h flood s biography as dictated to him by wyatt earp wyatt vividly recalled a presence that in several instances warned him away or urged him to take action this happened when he was on street alone in his room at cosmopolitan hotel at bob hatch s pool hall where he went moments before morgan was assassinated and again when he approached iron springs and surprised curly bill brocius killing him later reputation after shootout in tombstone his pursuit and murder of those who attacked his brothers and after leaving arizona wyatt was often target of negative newspaper stories that disparaged his and his brothers reputation his role in history has stimulated considerable ongoing scholarly and editorial debate a large body of literature has been written about wyatt earp and his legacy some of it highly fictionalized considerable portions of it are either full of admiration and flattery or hostile debunking wyatt was repeatedly criticized in media over remainder of his life his wife josephine wrote falsehoods that were printed in some of newspapers about him and unjust accusations against him hurt wyatt more deeply than anything that ever happened to him during my life with him with exception of his mother s death and that of his father and brother warren negative publicity on april 16 1894 fort worth gazette wrote that virgil earp and john behan had a deadly feud it described behan as an honest man a good official and possessed many of attributes of a gentleman earp on other hand was head of band of a partner in stage robbers and a friend of gamblers and professional killers wyatt was boss killer of region former nemesis johnny behan continued to spread rumors about earps for next 20 years on december 7 1897 he was quoted in a story in washington post reprinted by san francisco call describing earp s lawbreaking behavior in tombstone after referring to fitzimmons sharkey fight article quoted behan clanton brothers and were a tough lot of rustlers who were main perpetrators of rife in that region between them and earps rose a bitter feud over division of proceeds of looting earp boys believed they had failed to get a fair divide of booty and swore vengeance they caught their former allies in tombstone unarmed and shot three of them dead while their hands were uplifted behan went on to say they were hauled up before a justice of peace warrants were issued for their arrest and summoning a posse i went out to bring earps in they were chased entirely out of country and tombstone knew them no more up until he died in 1912 johnny behan lambasted earps as bad men who had attacked cowboys after earp left alaska in 1901 new york sun printed a story in 1903 that described a confrontation earp had reportedly had with a short cockney canadian mountie who embarrassed earp by demanding that he leave his weapon in his room story was reprinted as far away as new zealand by otago witness dawson record commented on story mocking newspaper as a venerable dispenser of truth on april 13 1921 arizona republican ran a lengthy interview with thomas raines a former resident of tombstone raines described gunfight as an ambush he said that he remembered earps shot cowboys and killed ike clanton when they actually killed his brother billy before cowboys had a chance to surrender he recalled that cowboys were leading their horses out of gate when they were confronted almost from ambush by four of earps virgil wyatt morgan and jim and by doc holliday virgil earp armed with a sawed off express shotgun and accompanying his demand with profanity yelled hands up but he didn t wait for action demanded and shot almost as soon as he spoke tom showed his empty bands and cried gentlemen i am unarmed holliday answered with discharge of his shotgun ike clanton fell at first fire mortally wounded but he rolled over and fired two shots from his pistol between his bent knees during 1922 frederick r bechdolt published book when west was young which included a story about wyatt s time in tombstone but he mangled many basic facts he described earp clanton differences as falling out of partners in crime bechdolt frederick r 1922 when west was young century company on march 12 1922 sunday los angeles times ran a short scandalous article titled lurid trails are left by olden day bandits by j m scanland it described wyatt and his brothers as a gang comparable to dalton gang who waylaid cowboys in shoot out at o k corral it said that earps were allies of frank stilwell who had informed on them so they killed him and that earp had died in colton california author concocted a fictional description of earp s relationship with sheriff behan and cowboys josephine and earps friend and actor william hart both wrote letters to publisher josephine demanded that error must be corrected and printed in same sensational manner given to correction as to original article which paper published reputation at death at time of his death earp may have been more well known for controversy that engulfed him after fitzsimmons vs sharkey match in san francisco than for gunfight in tombstone his associated press obituary gave prominent attention to his officiating of fitzsimmons sharkey fight while describing him as a gun fighter whose blazing six shooters were for most of his life allied with side of law and order in its january 14 1929 obituary los angeles times wrote a fictional account of earp taming colton california modern reputation long after his death he has many devoted detractors and admirers earp s modern day reputation is that of old west s toughest and deadliest gunman of his day walter noble burns author walter noble burns visited earp in september 1926 and asked him questions with intent to write a book about earp earp declined because he was already collaborating with john flood burns visited tombstone and based on what he learned decided instead to focus his book on doc holliday he pestered earp for facts and on march 27 next year earp finally responded to burns repeated requests in an 11 page letter outlining basic facts from earp s point of view when their efforts to get flood manuscript published failed earps decided to appeal to burns whose own book was near publication but he was not interested his book was about to be published free of constraints imposed by a collaboration with earp burns wrote them i should not now care to undertake another book which in part at least would be upon much same lines i should have been delighted six months ago to accept your offer but it is too late now my book has championed mr earp s cause throughout and i believe will vindicate his reputation in tombstone in a way that he will like when burns turned them down josephine actively worked to stop publication of his book fearful that their efforts to publish wyatt s biography would be thwarted as a result in late 1927 burns published tombstone an iliad of southwest a mesmerizing tale of blood and thunder that christened earp as lion of tombstone strong bold forceful picturesque was fighter of old frontier something epic in him fashioned in homeric mold in his way a hero it included a good deal about wyatt as well much to wyatt and josie s displeasure readers and reviewers found they had a difficult time discerning between fact and fiction book was first to popularize its subject for a mass reading audience burns treated earp as a mythical figure a larger than life hero whose many portrayals in film television and books often render fidelity to truth first casualty billy breakenridge while living in vidal wyatt and josie were visited by billy breakenridge former tombstone deputy under john behan he pressed wyatt for details about his time in tombstone to add to his book bringing law to mesquite breakenridge was assisted by western novelist william macleod raine who since 1904 had published more than 25 novels about western history book was published in 1928 before wyatt died it depicted wyatt as a thief pimp crooked gambler and murderer breakenridge wrote that earps and doc holliday aggressively mistreated guiltless cowboys until they were forced into a fatal confrontation his description of 1881 o k corral gun fight stated that clanton and mclaury brothers were merely cowboys who had been unarmed and surrendered but earp brothers had shot them in cold blood wyatt and josie protested that book s contents was biased and more fiction than fact earp complained about book until his death in 1929 and his wife continued in same vein afterward edwin burkholder edwin v burkholder who specialized in stories about old west published an article about wyatt in 1955 in argosy magazine he called wyatt earp a coward and murderer and manufactured evidence to support his allegations he also wrote using pseudonyms george carleton mays and j s for western magazine real west his stores were filled with sensational claims about wyatt earp s villainy and he made up fake letters to editor from supposed old timers to corroborate this story frank waters frank waters interviewed virgil earp s widow allie sullivan earp to write earp brothers of tombstone allie earp was so upset by way waters distorted and manipulated her words that she threatened to shoot him his writing was so contentious and disputed that he waited until 13 years after her death to publish book in it waters vociferously berated wyatt purportedly quoting allie he invented bitter public fights between mattie and wyatt and told how wyatt s affair with sadie marcus slut of tombstone had humiliated mattie he condemned earp brothers character and called them names waters used allie earp s anecdotes as a frame for adding a narrative and building a case essentially piling quote upon quote to prove that wyatt earp was a con man thief robber and eventually murderer book further embroidered upon frank waters s imaginings about wyatt s adulterous affair with josephine it was described by one reviewer as a smear campaign levied against earp brothers years later he wrote a letter to arizona historical society in which he admitted that he had combined allie s words to create a cold objective analysis and expose of whole subject s j reidhead author of travesty frank waters earp agenda exposed spent nearly a decade searching for water s original manuscript researching him his background and his bias against earps in doing so author discovered that story waters presented against earps was primarily fictitious nothing is documented she wrote there are no notes nor sourcing there is only original tombstone travesty manuscript and final earp brothers of tombstone because of his later reputation few writers even today dare question waters motives they also do not bother fact checking earp brothers of tombstone which is so inaccurate it should be considered fiction rather than fact anti earp writers and researchers use frank waters earp brothers of tombstone as their primary source for material that presents wyatt earp as something of a villainous monster aided and abetted by his brothers who were almost brutes waters detested earps so badly that he presented a book that was terribly flawed poorly edited and brimming with prevarications in his other work waters is poetic in earp brothers of tombstone he is little more than a tabloid hack trying to slander someone he dislikes to date no reason has been uncovered for bias frank waters exhibited against wyatt earp and his brothers ed bartholomew in 1963 ed bartholomew published wyatt earp untold story followed by wyatt earp man and myth in 1964 his books were strongly anti earp and attacked wyatt earp s image as a hero bartholomew went about this by reciting snippets of accumulated anti earp facts rumors gossip and innuendo bartholomew s books started a trend of debunking earp and academic community followed his lead pursuing image of earp as a fighting pimp allen barra in reviewing allen barra s inventing wyatt earp his life and many legends william urban a professor of history at monmouth college in warren county illinois pointed out a number of factual inaccuracies in book one inconsistency by barra pointed out by another reviewer includes a description of poker game night before shootout ike clanton s account of game only one that exists gives participants as john behan virgil earp ike clanton tom mclaury and a fifth man ike did not recognize while barra wrote that holliday had attended game fame earp was dismayed about controversy that continually followed him he wrote a letter to john hays hammond on may 21 1925 telling him notoriety had been bane of my life i detest it and i never have put forth any effort to check tales that have been published in which my brothers and i are supposed to have been principal participants not one of them is correct 1922 scandalous story in sunday los angeles times by scanland annoyed earp he was tired of all lies perpetuated about him and became determined to get his story accurately told still in 1924 a story in a san francisco paper said interviewing him was like pulling teeth earp did not trust press and preferred to keep his mouth shut many negative untruthful stories bothered earp a great deal and he finally decided to tell his own story earp also tried to find j m scanland author of la times article and extract a written retraction from him which he finally did in 1927 in 1925 earp began to collaborate on a biography with his friend and former mining engineer with john flood to get his story told in a way that he approved lake s biography unlike most legendary lawmen of american west earp was relatively unknown until stuart n lake published first biography of wyatt earp wyatt earp frontier marshal in 1931 two years after earp died lake portrayed earp as a western superhero who single handedly cleaned up a town full of cowboy criminals in fact earp had been a stagecoach guard for wells fargo a full time gambler a regular associate of prostitutes and occasionally a lawman lake wrote book with earp s input but was only able to interview him eight times before earp died during which earp sketched out barest facts of his life despite having received very little information from earp lake wrote biography in first person lake initially sought earp out hoping to write a magazine article about him earp was also seeking a biographer at about same time earp who was 80 was concerned that his vantage point on tombstone story may be lost and may have been financially motivated as he had little income in his last years of life during interviews and in later correspondence josephine and wyatt went to great lengths to keep her name out of lake s book lake wrote earp that he planned to send portions of book to his new york agent but earp objected because he wanted to read it first after earp s death on january 13 1929 josephine continued to try to persuade lake to leave her and earp s former wife mattie blaylock out of book even threatening legal action lake finally published wyatt earp frontier marshal in 1931 two years after earp s death lake s creative biography portrays earp as a western superhero gallant white knight and entirely avoided mentioning josephine earp or blaylock a number of hollywood movies have been directly and indirectly influenced by lake s book and its depiction of earp s role as a western lawman book drew considerable positive attention and established lake as a western screenwriter for years to come it also established gunfight at o k corral in public consciousness and earp as a fearless lawman in american old west book is now regarded more as fiction than fact an imaginative hoax a fabrication mixed with just enough fact to give it credibility reputation as a teetotaler josephine earp worked hard to create an image of wyatt as a teetotaler but as a saloon owner and gambler he drank occasionally as well when flood and lake wrote their biographies prohibition was in force among other facts josephine wanted scrubbed from earp s history was that he liked a drink she persuaded biographers flood lake and burns to write that earp was a non drinker a good friend of earp s charlie welsh was known to disappear for days at a time to see property family euphemism for a drinking binge and earp was his regular partner director john ford said that whenever josephine left town for religious conventions earp would come into town play poker and get drunk with cowboy actors colt buntline special in his book lake wrote about colt buntline special a variant of long barreled colt single action army revolver according to lake s biography dime novelist ned buntline had five buntline specials commissioned lake described them as extra long colt single action army revolvers with barrels buntline was supposed to have presented them to lawmen in thanks for their help with contributing local color to his western yarns according to lake revolver was equipped with a detachable metal shoulder stock lake wrote that earp and four other well known western lawmen bat masterson bill tilghman charlie bassett and neal brown each received a buntline special however neither tilghman nor brown were lawmen then researchers have never found any record of an order received by colt company and ned buntline s alleged connections to earp s have been largely discredited after publication of lake s book various colt revolvers with long 10 or 16 barrels were referred to as colt colt re introduced revolvers in its second generation revolvers produced after 1956 buntline special was further popularized by life and legend of wyatt earp television series dubious claims by earp earp s reputation has been confused by inaccurate conflicting and false stories told about him by others and by his own claims that cannot be corroborated for example in an interview with a reporter in denver in 1896 he denied that he had killed johnny ringo he then flipped his story claiming he had killed ringo in 1888 he was interviewed by an agent of california historian hubert h bancroft and earp claimed that he had killed over a dozen stage robbers murderers and cattle thieves in about 1918 he told hooker who wrote an unpublished manuscript and then frank lockwood who wrote pioneer days in arizona in 1932 that he was one who killed johnny ringo as he left arizona in 1882 however earp included details that do not match what is known about ringo s death earp repeated that claim to at least three other people at hearing following tombstone shootout earp said he had been marshal in dodge city a claim he repeated in an august 16 1896 interview that appeared in san francisco examiner but earp had only been an assistant city marshal there during an interview with his future biographer stuart lake during late 1920s earp said that he arrested notorious gunslinger ben thompson in ellsworth kansas on august 15 1873 when news accounts and thompson s own contemporary account about episode do not mention his presence he also told lake that he had hunted buffalo during 1871 and 1872 but earp was arrested three times in peoria area during that period for keeping and being found in a house of ill fame he was arrested and jailed on a horse theft charge on april 6 1871 however he was not convicted of last charge and was released in same interview earp claimed that george hoyt had intended to kill him although newspaper accounts from that time report differently he also said he and bat masterson had confronted clay allison when he was sent to dodge city to finish george hoyt s job and that they had forced him to back down two other accounts contradicted earp crediting cattleman dick mcnulty and long branch saloon owner chalk beeson with convincing allison and his cowboys to surrender their guns cowboy charlie witnessed incident and left a written account modern image role in o k corral gunfight wyatt outlived his brothers and due to fame wyatt gained from lake s biography and later adaptations of it he is often mistakenly viewed as central character and hero of gunfight at o k corral in fact virgil earp as deputy u s marshal and tombstone city marshal actually held legal authority in tombstone day of shootout virgil had considerably more experience with weapons and combat as a union soldier in civil war and in law enforcement as a sheriff constable and marshal than did wyatt as city marshal virgil made decision to enforce a city ordinance prohibiting carrying weapons in town and to disarm cowboys wyatt was only a temporary assistant marshal to his brother cultural image as western lawman earp s modern day reputation is that of old west s toughest and deadliest gunman of his day he is a cultural icon a man of law and order a mythic figure of a west where social control and order were notably absent due to lake s fanciful biography and because wyatt outlived all of his brothers his name became famous and he is source of many movies tv shows biographies and works of fiction western historian and author john boessenecker describes earp as an enigmatic figure he always lived on outer fringe of respectable society and his closest companions were gamblers and sporting men wyatt never set down roots in any one place when money stopped coming in or his problems became too great he would pull up stakes and move on to next boomtown for his entire life was a gamble an effort to make money without working hard for it to succeed quickly without ever settling in for long haul josephine earp memoir one of most well known and for many years respected books about wyatt earp was book i married wyatt earp originally credited as a factual memoir by josephine marcus earp published in 1976 it was edited by amateur historian glenn boyer and published by respected university of arizona press it was immensely popular for many years capturing imagination of people with an interest in western history studied in classrooms cited by scholars and relied upon as factual by filmmakers in 1998 writer tony ortega wrote a lengthy investigative article for phoenix new times for which he interviewed boyer boyer said that he was uninterested in what others thought of accuracy of what he had written this is an artistic effort i don t have to adhere to kind of jacket that these people are putting on me i am not a historian i m a storyteller boyer admitted that book is 100 percent boyer he said book was not really a first person account that he had interpreted wyatt earp in josephine s voice and admitted that he could not produce any documents to vindicate his methods boyer and university press credibility was severely damaged in 2000 university referred all questions to university lawyers who investigated some of allegations about boyer s work later that year press removed book from their catalog book has been discredited as a fraud and a hoax that cannot be relied on as a result other works by boyer were subsequently questioned his book wyatt earp s tombstone vendetta published in 1993 was according to boyer based on an account written by a previously unknown tombstone journalist that he named theodore ten eyck but whose identity could not be independently verified boyer claimed that manuscript was clearly authentic and that it contained fascinating revelations if they are true and would make an ace movie boyer later said character was in fact a blend of scores of accounts but could not provide any sources history professor william urban also described questionable scholarship of glenn boyer dominant figure in for past several decades who has apparently invented a manuscript and then cited it as a major source in his publications this does not surprise this reviewer who has personal experience with boyer s pretentious exaggeration
