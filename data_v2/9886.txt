apalachee massacre was a series of raids by english colonists from province of carolina and their indian allies against a largely peaceful population of apalachee indians in northern spanish florida that took place in 1704 during queen anne s war against limited spanish and indian resistance a network of missions was destroyed most of population either was killed or captured fled to larger spanish and french outposts or voluntarily joined english only major event of former carolina governor james moore s expedition was battle of ayubale which marked only large scale resistance to english raids significant numbers of apalachee unhappy with conditions they lived in under spanish simply abandoned their towns and joined moore s expedition they were resettled near savannah and ocmulgee rivers where conditions were only slightly better moore s raiding expedition was preceded and followed by other raiding activity that was principally conducted by english allied creeks cumulative effect of these raids conducted between 1702 and 1709 was to depopulate spanish florida beyond immediate confines of saint augustine and pensacola background english and spanish colonization efforts in southeastern north america began coming into conflict as early as middle of 17th century founding in 1670 by english of charles town present day charleston south carolina in recently established 1663 province of carolina heightened tensions with spanish in florida arnade 1962 p 31 traders raiders and slavers from new province penetrated into florida leading to raiding and reprisal expeditions on both sides crane 1919 p 381 in 1700 carolina s governor joseph blake threatened spanish with assertions that english claims to pensacola established by spanish in 1698 would be enforced crane 1919 p 384 blake s death later that year interrupted these plans and he was replaced in 1702 by james moore la florida spanish population of florida at time was fairly small compared to that of nearby english colonies since its founding in 16th century spanish had set up a network of missions whose primary purpose was to pacify local indian population and convert them to roman catholicism in apalachee province roughly present day western florida and southwestern georgia there were 14 mission communities with a total population in 1680 of about 8 000 many but not all of these communities were populated by apalachee others were inhabited by other tribes that had migrated southward to area boyd et al p 10 by early 18th century apalachee province had become a major source of food for principal towns of st augustine and pensacola which were situated near lands not well suited for agriculture covington 1972 p 367 native populations of florida were not entirely happy with spanish rule there had been several uprisings against spanish in 17th century boyd et al pp 6 8 indians were often forced to do work for spanish military garrisons and plantation owners including labor of hauling goods to st augustine about away these policies and mistreatment by overbearing spanish masters led some apalachees to flee to english in carolina covington 1972 pp 369 371 spanish policy also forbade indians possession of muskets which made them dependent on spanish for protection against english armed creeks wright p 65 raids before 1704 news that war of spanish succession known in north america as queen anne s war had widened to include england arrived in carolina by september 1702 and governor moore convinced provincial assembly in september 1702 to fund an expedition against st augustine crane 1956 p 76 expedition was a failure and there was rioting in charles town over expenses incurred mccrady pp 382 386 one significant accomplishment of st augustine expedition was destruction of coastal spanish mission towns in guale province present day coastal georgia covington 1972 p 371 after expedition florida governor jose de zuniga y la cerda ordered remaining spanish missions in apalachee and timucua province to be moved closer together for defensive purposes boyd et al p 119 missions in province were consolidated south of st johns river and those in timucua were consolidated at san francisco de potano in early 1703 creeks attacked san jose de and san francisco de potano also raiding either or it is possible that as many as 500 indians were enslaved as a result of these raids hoffman p 177 ayubale in 1703 ex governor moore presented to carolina assembly and his replacement nathaniel johnson a plan for an expedition against spanish towns in apalachee province crane 1956 p 78 he promised that unlike st augustine expedition colony would not have to pay for anything he expected its costs to be recovered by taking of loot and slaves covington 1972 p 372 on september 7 1703 carolina assembly approved plan asking moore to go to assistance of and other our friendly indians and to crane 1956 p 79 after recruiting 50 colonists he traveled to upper waters of ocmulgee river where he recruited 1 000 creek indians to join expedition against their traditional enemies thumb left reconstructed church at san luis de apalachee ayubale s church may have resembled it on january 25 1704 moore s force arrived at ayubale one of larger mission towns in apalachee while most of creeks raided surrounding villages moore took most of whites and 15 creek into ayubale itself around 7 00 am only resistance was organized by father angel miranda who retreated into town s church compound which was surrounded by a mud wall with 26 men he successfully held english at bay for nine hours and only surrendered himself his men and 58 women and children after they ran out of arrows according to one spanish account miranda threw himself and his followers on moore s mercy he was according to this account but apparently not others see below then summarily slain in cold blood by moore s indian allies and some of his followers were then tortured and killed tepaske p 114 word of attack reached san luis de apalachee eight leagues about south of ayubale where captain juan ruiz de mexia raised a force of 400 apalachee and 30 spanish cavalry this force engaged moore s at ayubale and was decisively defeated more than 200 apalachees were killed or captured three spaniards were killed and eight were captured with mexia among captured there is evidence that as many as 50 apalachee joined with english against spanish led forces in this encounter covington 1972 p 373 moore considered making an attack on fort at san luis but his force had suffered a significant number of wounds so he opted instead for an attempt at extortion some of spanish prisoners managed to escape so he released miranda mexia and others to go to san luis with hope that san luis garrison commander would then pay a ransom for them boyd et al p 16 however garrison commander refused to pay further raiding in apalachee following battle at ayubale moore continued his march through apalachee one village san lorenzo de ivitachuco survived when its leader surrendered his church s gold ornaments and a train of supplies moore moved slowly since many of apalachee apparently wanted to leave with english according to his report most of population of seven villages joined his march voluntarily covington 1972 p 374 in moore s report of expedition he claimed to have killed more than 1 100 men women and children he also stated that he removed into exile 300 and captured as slaves more than 4 300 people mostly women and children boyd et al p 13 only major missions to survive in apalachee were san luis and san lorenzo de ivitachuco spanish at first attempted to fortify these places but they were eventually judged to be indefensible and abandoned survivors were consolidated at abosaya east of san francisco de potano boyd et al pp 12 17 p p 187 james moore did not identify by name places his force destroyed historian mark boyd has analyzed english and spanish sources documenting missions and effects of moore s raid according to his analysis boyd et al pp 13 14 following missions were ones most likely to have been destroyed la concepcion de ayubale san francisco de san antonio de san martin de santa cruz y san pedro de alcantara de spanish authorities in st augustine and pensacola mobilized their meager forces but did not return to ayubale until after moore s force had clearly left area they buried christian dead many of whom they reported as exhibiting evidence of torture despite losses they did not immediately abandon or consolidate missions until further raiding took place after which demoralized surviving apalachee insisted they would either retreat to pensacola or go over to english boyd et al pp 17 18 later raids in wake of moore s raids further raids were made into northern florida principally executed by creeks in august 1704 creeks destroyed missions of san pedro and san mateo a year later they attacked apalachee at abosaya further attacks against abosaya next month prompted survivors to flee to st augustine in spring of 1706 creek raiders besieged san francisco de potano and attacked la chua ranch near abosaya both of these were abandoned and timucua was virtually depopulated by may 1706 according to apalachee scholar john hann between moore s raids and these later ones 2 000 indians went into exile and an unknown number were enslaved gallay p 147 french governor of mobile jean baptiste le moyne de bienville wrote that raiding florida area resulted in killing of 2 000 apalachees and capture 32 spaniards 17 of whom were burned alive by end of 1706 spanish presence in florida had been reduced to st augustine and pensacola gallay p 148 consequences many survivors fled westward and settled near french colonial outpost of mobile while others ended up near either st augustine or pensacola bienville reported that about 600 refugees were settled near mobile apalachees taken by moore were resettled either along savannah river or among creek on ocmulgee river covington 1972 p 376 free apalachee refugees that settled these areas were frequently harassed by slavers in some cases indians taken as slaves were freed after protests were made to carolina authorities covington 1972 pp 377 378 spanish responded to raids by encouraging privateering raids against carolina coastal plantations in following years english colonists continued to make inroads against spanish and french interests in florida and on gulf coast but they were never able to capture st augustine pensacola or mobile main spanish and french settlements pensacola was twice besieged by creek forces in 1707 apparently with english colonial support hoffman p 181 english supplied indians also made incursions into french dominated territories to west but english intentions to assault mobile never got beyond planning stages there was a raid on an indian village near mobile in 1709 griffen pp 251 253 historiography due in part to somewhat fragmentary unclear and contradictory primary materials about these raids historians have at times written widely varying accounts of number of indians that were enslaved although moore claimed in his report that a large number of apalachee were enslaved modern historians believe that a significant number of those resettled by moore went voluntarily and were not actually slaves vernon crane in southern frontier 1670 1732 originally published in 1929 uncritically accepts moore s numbers and 19th century south carolina historian edward mccrady only mentions 1 400 apalachees being taken of whom only 100 were slaves mccrady p 393 historian allan gallay in a modern analysis opines that raids in 1704 alone resulted in enslavement of between 2 000 and 4 000 indians opinions also differ as to long term fate of indians that voluntarily went with moore since a 1715 census of savannah river settlements counted fewer than 650 apalachees allan gallay believes that balance were probably sold into slavery james covington believes that a combination of factors was to blame in addition to active slaving against those settlements disease starvation intermarriage with other tribes and migration to other communities account for difference covington 1972 p 378 see also list of massacres in florida references citations sources further reading
