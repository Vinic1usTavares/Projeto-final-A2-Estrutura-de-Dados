punishment lasted longer than usual for era development commenced in 1997 with only four staff and concluded in 2000 with more people involved than in any of treasure s previous projects guiding inspiration to develop sin and punishment was design of nintendo 64 controller treasure wanted to make a game that had player holding left side of controller instead of right which was typical across system s library treasure team encountered difficulties programming game citing system s complex 3d rendering capabilities and difficulties adapting 2d gameplay ideas into 3d environments originally titled glass soldier by treasure game was retitled to sin and punishment by nintendo wanting a name that stood out sin and punishment was released to positive reviews critics highlighted game s intensity and flashy graphics and particularly pointed out treasure s ability to reduce game s polygon count to maintain smooth gameplay action while still keeping graphics stylish since game was

attacking current earth saki now in a part human part ruffian state combines with airan to revert to his full ruffian form saki and airan successfully destroy new earth and send achi drifting into space development thumb right standard way to hold nintendo 64 controller was with right two grips popularized by super mario 64 treasure wanted to develop a game where player held left two grips sin and punishment was co developed by nintendo research development 1 and treasure development began around 1997 when treasure wrote original proposal and submitted it to nintendo original inspiration to develop game was design of nintendo 64 controller in early days of system s lifespan nintendo had suggested two ways of holding controller a left and right position due to success of super mario 64 which released alongside console in 1996 many games followed in its trails and featured same right positioning it used masato maegawa president of treasure began discussing with his team how left positioning was underutilized and thought it could make for an interesting game and so started developing a new game to use this position nintendo warned treasure that left positioning would feel unnatural to players at first however treasure was already expecting this nintendo was also planning a controller accessory at time with a movement sensor team considered adapting sensor for game but ultimately decided against it as it would have lengthened an already dragging development process sensor technology was not finalized by nintendo until release of wii in 2006 original interview in japanese and translation in early stages of development team was at what maegawa called absolute minimum staffing two programmers and two designers by end of development more people were involved than in any of treasure s previous projects among staff was head programmer nakagawa and character and enemy designer yasushi suzuki both previously held minor roles in developing treasure s radiant silvergun 1998 sin and punishment would be treasure s first attempt at a true 3d action game presenting a challenge to a company known for fast paced 2d action games adhering with typical treasure culture team attempted to push limits of hardware but they still experienced many difficulties programming for nintendo 64 hardware they believed that its silicon graphics architecture was more difficult to use because it was a more professional and robust 3d graphics system than on competing hardware nakagawa had troubles programming aiming and shooting mechanics since reticle moved in two dimensions but game world was in three he also struggled with collision between enemy bullets and player which needed to work correctly otherwise it would look and feel unnatural lastly he found scaling and sizing of boss characters to be an obstacle because bosses need to fit in screen while also appearing large and intimidating suzuki also had troubles keeping texture size and polygon counts low because nintendo 64 had restrictive texture mapping limitations to compensate team removed joints in models to prevent game speed from dipping too much director from nintendo side of development was hitoshi yamagami he found treasure to be difficult to work with and called them a weird company he encountered troubles establishing deadlines with treasure team who continued to deflect such requests when yamagami first played an early prototype of sin and punishment he was impressed but found it too difficult treasure responded by saying he should not be supervising project if he was not skilled enough to play it yamagami understood that level of difficulty was a characteristic of treasure s games but still thought it needed to be reduced maegawa believed that difficulty was in players being unable to understand game s unique control scheme discussions about game difficulty continued for almost a year towards end of development difficulty level was decreased game was originally titled during most of its development because main character was fragile like glass title was written in katakana a japanese writing system typically used when writing foreign words however many game titles were written in katakana during this era to help game stand out yamagami wanted to create a new title written in kanji another japanese writing system perfect dark 2000 was in development at time and was known in japan with a kanji title yamagami took inspiration from this name to think up a new title thinking title may be too obscure yamagami approached young staff members for a subtitle they suggested but with reading of which means earth changed to hoshi which means star one of other titles considered was dark wasteland treasure team initially did not like change in name brought by nintendo but gradually took a liking to it soundtrack to sin and punishment was composed by toshiya yamanaka who was employed as a subcontractor before joining treasure later in his career translation all music was composed using a roland sc 88 pro one of programmers was able to program in pulse code modulation pcm support a technology which can play digital audio signals converted from uncompressed analog audio allowing for higher quality music development for sin and punishment took a relatively long time compared with other games of era although development began in 1997 a year after release of nintendo 64 game was not released until near end of nintendo 64 s lifecycle in 2000 in retrospect satoru iwata commented that treasure was able to accomplish a large amount despite small size of their team maegawa agreed saying that with a smaller team they were able to stay focused on making game how they each personally envisioned and were not bothered with conflicts normally present in larger teams release sin and punishment was first revealed in august 2000 game was first released exclusively in japan on nintendo 64 on 21 november 2000 as console s life cycle was approaching its end game was targeted towards older gaming audiences and sold about 100 000 copies maegawa said he could not call game a financial success but nintendo had wanted genre to be represented on nintendo 64 game was ported to ique player and released in china in 2004 sin and punishment grew a cult following in western territories among import gamers and was regarded as one of best nintendo 64 games to never see localization nintendo s 2001 e3 press kit mentioned that it would be on display at nintendo s booth but was not shown with release of nintendo s virtual console for wii sin and punishment became one of most demanded titles game featured english voice acting which also made it a good candidate for re release it was finally released on wii virtual console in japan on 20 september 2007 in pal regions on 28 september 2007 and in north america on 1 october 2007 localized releases featured english menus game was later re released on wii u virtual console in north america on 27 august 2015 in pal regions on 3 september 2015 and in japan on 25 april 2016 reception although it was not localized for its original release some western critics still imported sin and punishment for review fran mirabella iii of ign found it to be a tour de force of arcade style shooting action and praised treasure for their excellence at developing games in genre he concluded that it was one of most unique and daring games on nintendo 64 as well as one of best but did make some complaints with regards to its short length jeff gerstmann of gamespot described sin and punishment as a technical and artistic achievement but was even more harsh on game s short length and also felt game was too easy both reviewers believed that game had excellent graphics full of flashy explosions and lots of onscreen items they both pointed out game s low polygon models but believed this was a fair sacrifice to keep game running at a smooth frame rate in retrospective reviews for game s virtual console release critics praised nintendo for making moves to re release sin and punishment and finally localize it for western audiences frank provo of gamespot found release to be a bargain seeing as original nintendo 64 cartridges were uncommon and approaching 100 usd in price on used game market even though original game was built around nintendo 64 controller critics still found gamecube controller worked well as a substitute critics shared shared sentiments of reviews at time in regard to game s intense and furious action stylish graphics and smooth frame rate while again also criticizing its short length concluding their thoughts adam riley of cubed3 called sin and punishment a cult legend damien mcferran of nintendo life believed it to be pinnacle of nintendo 64 library and lucas m thomas of ign called it a nintendo 64 masterpiece and perfect hardware swan song west never got to hear legacy retro gamer included sin and punishment among their list of top ten nintendo 64 games highlighting game s intensity and hardware pushing prowess and ign included it among their list of best virtual console games todd ciolek of gamesetwatch described it as one of best games in sparsely populated shooting gallery genre along with wild guns 1994 a novelization of game was published in japan in early 2001 a comic adaption was also printed in dengeki daioh magazine character saki amamiya re appeared as an assist trophy in super smash bros brawl 2008 and super smash bros for nintendo 3ds and wii u 2014 a minor role where he can suddenly appear and damage players in addition to this saki also received a mii costume for super smash bros ultimate where his outfit and hairstyle can be used as costume pieces for certain fighters nintendo and treasure
