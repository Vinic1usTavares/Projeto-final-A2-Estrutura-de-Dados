mikoyan gurevich i 211 was a prototype high altitude soviet fighter aircraft built during world war ii it was a version of mikoyan gurevich i 210 itself a variant of mikoyan gurevich mig 3 fitted with a shvetsov ash 82f radial engine its development was quite prolonged although successful but by time it finished its manufacturer s trials in early 1944 there was no need for a high altitude fighter and it was not worth reducing production of existing fighters to convert a factory over to i 211 development i 211 was a direct descendant of mikoyan gurevich i 210 high altitude fighter prototype also known as mig 3 82 or mig 9 late in 1941 a decision was made to phase out production of mikulin am 35a engine used by mig 1 and mig 3 in favor of mikulin am 38 engine used in ilyushin il 2 mig design team had already created a version of mig 3 called i 210 using a shvetsov ash 82 radial engine instead of inline liquid cooled engine a number of changes were made in order to accommodate larger circumference of radial engine but redesign of engine cowling was a failure and i 210 proved to be slower than yak 1 or lagg 3 when it first flew on 23 july 1941 artem mikoyan and mikhail gurevich continued development and another prototype was built mig i 211 or mig using improved ash 82f engine improvements from i 210 included aerodynamic refinements of engine cowling cockpit was moved aft oil cooler inlets were moved to wing roots oil cooler was moved entirely inside fuselage and a larger tail was fitted it was armed with two shvak cannon it weighed some less than i 210 possibly due to an all metal structure but this cannot be confirmed these refinements took most of 1942 to design and assembly of i 211 did not begin until december 1942 its first flight was on 24 february 1943 reduction in drag and in weight greatly improved performance over i 211 with a top speed of at a height of and it took only 4 0 minutes to reach an altitude of okb had originally planned to build ten in first quarter of 1943 but manufacturer s trials took an unexpectedly long time to complete and were not finished until first quarter of 1944 by this time there was little demand for a high altitude fighter and project was canceled with only a single aircraft built nomenclature in a number of older books mig i 211 is called mig 5 it is now established that mig 5 designation was reserved for production version of mig dis a twin engine fighter that did not enter production acronym dis comes from istrebitel or long range escort fighter similarly mig 9 designation was intended for production version of mig 3 with ash 82 radial engine this name was reused shortly afterwards for first mikoyan gurevich jet fighter operators soviet air force specifications i 211 references further reading mikoyan gurevich mig 01 i 211 category abandoned military aircraft projects of soviet union category single engined tractor aircraft category aircraft first flown in 1943
