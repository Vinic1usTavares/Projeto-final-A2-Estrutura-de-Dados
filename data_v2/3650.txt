khmer oxford english dictionary khmer natively phiasaa khmae dialectal khmae or or more formally ra phiasaa is language of khmer people and official language of cambodia with approximately 16 million speakers it is second most widely spoken austroasiatic language after vietnamese khmer has been influenced considerably by sanskrit and pali especially in royal and religious registers through hinduism and buddhism more colloquial registers have influenced and have been influenced by thai lao vietnamese and cham all of which due to geographical proximity and long term cultural contact form a sprachbund in peninsular southeast asia it is also earliest recorded and earliest written language of mon khmer family predating mon and by a significant margin vietnamese due to old khmer being language of historical empires of angkor and presumably their earlier predecessor state funan vast majority of khmer speakers speak central khmer dialect of central plain where khmer are most heavily concentrated within cambodia regional accents exist in remote areas but these are regarded as varieties of central khmer two exceptions are speech of capital phnom penh and that of khmer khe in stung treng province both of which differ sufficiently enough from central khmer to be considered separate dialects of khmer outside of cambodia three distinct dialects are spoken by ethnic khmers native to areas that were historically part of khmer empire northern khmer dialect is spoken by over a million khmers in southern regions of northeast thailand and is treated by some linguists as a separate language khmer krom or southern khmer is first language of khmer of vietnam while khmer living in remote cardamom mountains speak a very conservative dialect that still displays features of middle khmer language khmer is primarily an analytic isolating language there are no inflections conjugations or case endings instead particles and auxiliary words are used to indicate grammatical relationships general word order is subject verb object and modifiers follow word they modify classifiers appear after numbers when used to count nouns though not always so consistently as in languages like chinese in spoken khmer topic comment structure is common and perceived social relation between participants determines which sets of vocabulary such as pronouns and honorifics are proper khmer differs from neighboring languages such as thai burmese lao and vietnamese in that it is not a tonal language words are stressed on final syllable hence many words conform to typical mon

northern khmer standard khmer and related dialects including khmer krom standard khmer or central khmer language as taught in cambodian schools and used by media is based on dialect spoken throughout central plain a region encompassed by northwest and central provinces northern khmer called khmer surin in khmer refers to dialects spoken by many in several border provinces of present day northeast thailand after fall of khmer empire in early 15th century mountains served as a natural border leaving khmer north of mountains under sphere of influence of kingdom of lan xang conquests of cambodia by naresuan great for ayutthaya furthered their political and economic isolation from cambodia proper leading to a dialect that developed relatively independently from midpoint of middle khmer period this has resulted in a distinct accent influenced by surrounding tonal languages lao and thai lexical differences and phonemic differences in both vowels and distribution of consonants syllable final which has become silent in other dialects of khmer is still pronounced in northern khmer some linguists classify northern khmer as a separate but closely related language rather than a dialect phonetic variation of final trill and final palatals in khmer dialects of thailand mahidol university mon khmer studies 24 1 26 pg 1 western khmer also called cardamom khmer or khmer is spoken by a very small isolated population in cardamom mountain range extending from western cambodia into eastern central thailand although little studied this variety is unique in that it maintains a definite system of vocal register that has all but disappeared in other dialects of modern khmer phnom penh khmer is spoken in capital and surrounding areas this dialect is characterized by merging or complete elision of syllables which speakers from other regions consider a relaxed pronunciation for instance phnom penh is sometimes shortened to m penh another characteristic of phnom penh speech is observed in words with an r either as an initial consonant or as second member of a consonant cluster as in english word bread r trilled or flapped in other dialects is either pronounced as a uvular trill or not pronounced at all this alters quality of any preceding consonant causing a harder more emphasized pronunciation another unique result is that syllable is spoken with a low rising or dipping tone much like hoi tone in vietnamese for example some people pronounce fish as is dropped and vowel begins by dipping much lower in tone than standard speech and then rises effectively doubling its length another example is word study which is pronounced with uvular r and same intonation described above khmer krom or southern khmer is spoken by indigenous khmer population of mekong delta formerly controlled by khmer empire but part of vietnam since 1698 khmers are persecuted by vietnamese government for using their native language and since 1950s have been forced to take vietnamese names

weakening of empire sometime in 13th century old khmer is attested by many primary sources and has been studied in depth by a few scholars most notably pou phillip jenner and heinz jurgen following end of khmer empire language lost standardizing influence of being language of government and accordingly underwent a turbulent period of change in morphology phonology and lexicon language of this transition period from about 14th to 18th centuries is referred to as middle khmer and saw borrowing from thai lao and to a lesser extent vietnamese changes during this period are so profound that

colonialism thailand which had for centuries claimed suzerainty over cambodia and controlled succession to cambodian throne began losing its influence on language in 1887 cambodia was fully integrated into french indochina which brought in a french speaking aristocracy this led to french becoming language of higher education and intellectual class by 1907 french had wrested over half of modern day cambodia including north and northwest where thai had been prestige language back from thai control and reintegrated it into country many native scholars in early 20th century led by a monk named chuon nath resisted french and thai influences on their language forming government sponsored cultural committee to define and standardize modern language they championed khmerization purging of foreign elements reviving and use of old khmer roots and historical pali and sanskrit to coin new words for modern ideas opponents led by keng who embraced total khmerization by denouncing reversion to classical languages and favoring use of contemporary colloquial khmer for neologisms and koeus who favored borrowing from thai were also influential koeus later joined cultural committee and supported nath nath s views and prolific work won out and he is credited with cultivating modern khmer language identity and culture overseeing translation of entire pali buddhist canon into khmer he also created modern khmer language dictionary that is still in use today thereby ensuring that khmer would survive and indeed flourish during french colonial period phonology phonological system

from international phonetic alphabet ipa consonants labial alveolar palatal velar glottal plosive voiced plosive nasal liquid fricative approximant voiceless plosives may occur with or without aspiration as vs etc this difference is contrastive before a vowel however aspirated sounds in that position may be analyzed as sequences of two phonemes this analysis is supported by fact that infixes can be inserted between stop and aspiration for example big becomes size with a infix when one of these plosives occurs initially before another consonant aspiration is no longer contrastive and can be regarded as mere phonetic detail slight aspiration is expected when following consonant is not one of or if initial plosive is voiced plosives are pronounced as by most speakers but this

authors have proposed slightly different analyses of khmer vowel system this may be in part because of wide degree of variation in pronunciation between individual speakers even within a dialectal

rarely three consonants only possible clusters of three consonants at start of a syllable are phonetic and phonological analysis of khmer and with aspirated consonants analyzed as two consonant

contrastive aspiration see above t h k h t r k r str skr slight vowel epenthesis occurs in clusters consisting of a plosive followed by in those beginning and in cluster after initial consonant or consonant cluster comes syllabic nucleus which is one of vowels listed above this vowel may end syllable or may be followed by a coda which is a single consonant if syllable is stressed and vowel is short there must be a final consonant all consonant sounds except and can appear as coda although final r is heard in some dialects most notably in northern khmer a minor syllable unstressed syllable preceding main syllable of a word has a structure of cv crv cvn or where c is a consonant v a vowel and n a nasal consonant vowels in such syllables are usually short in conversation they may be reduced to although in careful or formal speech including on television and radio they are clearly articulated an example of such a word is me nuh person pronounced or more casually stress stress in khmer falls on final syllable of a word because of this predictable pattern stress is non phonemic in khmer it does not distinguish different meanings most khmer words consist of either one or two syllables in most native disyllabic words first syllable is a minor fully unstressed syllable such words have been described as i e as having one and a half syllables there are also some disyllabic words in which first syllable does not behave as a minor syllable but takes secondary stress most such words are compounds but some are single morphemes generally loanwords an example is language pronounced words with three or more syllables if they are not compounds are mostly loanwords usually derived from pali sanskrit or more recently french they are nonetheless adapted to khmer stress patterns headley robert k lim lam kheng lim hak chun chen 1977 cambodian english dictionary bureau of special research in modern languages catholic university of america press washington d c primary stress falls on final syllable with secondary stress on every second syllable from end thus in a three syllable word first syllable has secondary stress in a four syllable word second syllable has secondary stress in a five syllable word first and third syllables have secondary stress and so on long are not often used in conversation compounds however preserve stress patterns of constituent words thus name of a kind of cookie literally bird s nest is pronounced with secondary stress on second rather than first syllable because it is composed of words nest and bird phonation and tone khmer once had a phonation distinction in its vowels but this now survives only in most archaic dialect western khmer distinction arose historically when vowels after old khmer voiced consonants became breathy voiced and for example became when consonant voicing was lost distinction was maintained by vowel later phonation disappeared as well these processes explain origin of what are now called a series and o series consonants in khmer script although most cambodian dialects are not tonal colloquial phnom penh dialect has developed a tonal contrast level versus peaking tone as a by product of elision of intonation intonation often conveys semantic context in khmer as in distinguishing declarative statements questions and exclamations available grammatical means of making such distinctions are not always used or may be ambiguous for example final interrogative particle can also serve as an emphasizing or in some cases negating particle intonation pattern of a typical khmer declarative phrase is a steady rise throughout followed by an abrupt drop on last syllable i don t want it other intonation contours signify a different type of phrase such as full doubt interrogative similar to yes no questions in english full doubt interrogatives remain fairly even in tone throughout but rise sharply towards end do you want to go to siem reap exclamatory phrases follow typical steadily rising pattern but rise sharply on last syllable instead of falling this book is expensive grammar khmer is primarily an analytic language with no inflection syntactic relations are mainly determined by word order old and middle khmer used particles to mark grammatical categories and many of these have survived in modern khmer but are used sparingly mostly in literary or formal language khmer makes extensive use of auxiliary verbs and serial verb construction colloquial khmer is a zero copula language instead preferring predicative adjectives and even predicative nouns unless using a copula for emphasis or to avoid ambiguity in more complex sentences basic word order is subject verb object svo although subjects are often dropped prepositions are used rather than postpositions huffman franklin 1967 an outline of cambodian grammar phd thesis cornell university topic comment constructions are common and language is generally head initial modifiers follow words they modify some grammatical processes are still not fully understood by western scholars for example it is not clear if certain features of khmer grammar such as actor nominalization should be treated as a morphological process or a purely syntactic device and some derivational morphology seems purely decorative and performs no known syntactic work lexical categories have been hard to define in khmer henri maspero an early scholar of khmer claimed language had no parts of speech while a later scholar judith jacob posited four parts of speech and innumerable particles john on other hand identifies a couple dozen parts of speech in khmer with caveat that khmer words have freedom to perform a variety of syntactic functions depending on such factors as word order relevant particles location within a clause intonation and context some of more important lexical categories and their function are demonstrated in following example sentence taken from a hospital brochure morphology modern khmer is an isolating language which means that it uses little productive morphology there is some derivation by means of prefixes and infixes but this is a remnant of old khmer and not always productive in modern language khmer morphology is evidence of a historical process through which language was at some point in past changed from being an agglutinative language to adopting an isolating typology affixed forms are lexicalized and cannot be used productively to form new words below are some of most common affixes with examples as given by huffman affix function word meaning affixed word meaning prefixed causation broke torn origin to tear apart to originate trans prefixed derives adjectives nominalization to extinguish to hide extinguished a screen shade prefixed reciprocity to bite similar to bite each other to compare prefixed causation to break intrans to walk to study learn to cause to break to take for a walk to teach infixed causation to be clean to die to clean to kill infixed nominalization to walk to know something to believe a trip information belief compounding in khmer is a common derivational process that takes two forms coordinate compounds and repetitive compounds coordinate compounds join two unbound morphemes independent words of similar meaning to form a compound signifying a concept more general than either word alone coordinate compounds join either two nouns or two verbs repetitive compounds one of most productive derivational features of khmer use reduplication of an entire word to derive words whose meaning depends on class of reduplicated word a repetitive compound of a noun indicates plurality or generality while that of an adjectival verb could mean either an intensification or plurality coordinate compounds style width 25 height 50px

particular language how words relate to each other within clauses or phrases and how those phrases relate to each other within a sentence to convey meaning khmer syntax is very analytic relationships between words and phrases are signified primarily by word order supplemented with auxiliary verbs and particularly in formal and literary registers grammatical marking particles grammatical phenomena such as negation and aspect are marked by particles while interrogative sentences are marked either by particles or interrogative words equivalent to english wh words a complete khmer sentence consists of four basic elements an optional topic an optional subject an obligatory predicate and various and particles topic and subject are noun phrases predicates are verb phrases and another noun phrase acting as an object or verbal attribute often follows predicate basic constituent order when combining these noun and verb phrases into a sentence order is typically svo style width 25 height

common demonstratives are this these and that those word those over there has a more distal or vague connotation if noun phrase contains a possessive adjective it follows noun and precedes numeral if

attribute modern usage may carry connotation of mild intensity style width 25 height 50px field paddy vast colspan 4 very expansive fields and paddies verb phrase khmer verbs are completely uninflected and once a subject or topic has been introduced or is clear from context noun phrase may be dropped thus simplest possible sentence in khmer consists of a single verb for example to go on its own can mean i m going he went they ve gone let s go etc this also results in long strings of verbs such as style width 25 height 50px i to want to go to walk to play colspan 5 i want to go for a

subordinate clause word order in clauses is same for that of basic sentences described above coordinate clauses do not necessarily have to be marked they can simply follow one another when explicitly marked they are joined by words similar to english conjunctions such as and and and then or by clause final conjunction like adverbs and both of which can mean also or and also disjunction is indicated by or relative clauses can be introduced by that but similar to coordinate clauses often simply follow main clause for example both phrases below can mean hospital bed that has wheels style

if they do not immediately follow head noun khmer subordinate conjunctions always precede a subordinate clause subordinate conjunctions include words such as because seems as if and in order to numerals counting in khmer is based on a system numbers from 6 to 9 have form five one five two etc however words for multiples of ten from 30 to 90 are not related to basic khmer numbers but are probably borrowed from thai khmer numerals which were inherited from indian numerals are used more widely than western arabic numerals principal number words are listed in following table which gives

khmer employs a system of registers in which speaker must always be conscious of social status of person spoken to different registers which include those used for common speech polite speech speaking to or about royals and speaking to or about monks employ alternate verbs names of body parts and pronouns this results in what appears to foreigners as separate languages and in fact isolated villagers often are unsure how to speak with royals and royals raised completely within court do not feel comfortable speaking common register as an example word for to eat used between intimates or in reference to animals is used in polite reference to commoners it is when used of those of higher social status it is or for monks word is and for royals another result is that pronominal system is complex and full of honorific variations just a few of which are shown in table below situational usage i me you he she it intimate or addressing an inferior neutral formal or or kinship term title or
