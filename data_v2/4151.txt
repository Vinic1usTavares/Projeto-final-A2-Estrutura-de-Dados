good day for his team although he acknowledged that he was not on same pace levels as e dams renaults he revealed that his first car had a large amount of oversteer and stated smallest of change would make a large difference in terms of championship di grassi was handed a formal reprimand by stewards for pit stop release that caused piquet to brake to avoid hitting him and was fined eur1 500 piquet

believed stewards would not be taken seriously in future races piquet advocated for more people to observe track install more cameras and a gps system in all cars d ambrosio felt aggrieved over battle between his teammate duval in race s closing period saying events were a little bit of a pity and was unsure whether it was a misunderstanding duval insisted battle was firm but fair saying he gave d ambrosio room but would make it difficult for anyone to overtake him as you have seen in past though we have had fights and most of time i was really gentle and this weekend i was in this position where i was competitive and i had less energy available so i fought dragon s team principal jay penske revealed his drivers were allowed to battle each other cleanly but if one of them eliminated other from contention that driver would be required to miss following race attention also focused on jaguar s improved pace during event prior to race team had been criticised by media for their inability to perform well in series with some publications criticising decision to sign evans and carroll as their drivers evans said his improved performance encouraged everyone working for team and it gave jaguar more confidence if you look at bigger picture i ve got to be satisfied with today qualifying was great to be honest i topped group if you ask me or whole team if this would have happened after marrakesh we would have taken it with both hands carroll stated that he hoped he would have a strong performance in event and be faster than he could be but it was an issue that could be improved on jaguar team principal james barclay stated improvement was a little bit of a positive surprise but was unsure if carroll s problem at start was caused by driver error or an electrical issue but admitted his team had to improve their understanding of full course yellow in future races result extended buemi s lead at top of drivers championship to 29 points in front of second placed di grassi who in turn was a further ten ahead of prost in third vergne s second place finish moved him to fourth on 22 points and rosenqvist was a close fifth on 20 points e dams renault s strong
