industrial melanism is an evolutionary effect prominent in several arthropods where dark pigmentation melanism has evolved in an environment affected by industrial pollution including sulphur dioxide gas and dark soot deposits sulphur dioxide kills lichens leaving tree bark bare where in clean areas it is boldly patterned while soot darkens bark and other surfaces darker pigmented individuals have a higher fitness in those areas as their camouflage matches polluted background better they are thus favoured by natural selection this change extensively studied by bernard kettlewell is a popular teaching example in darwinian evolution providing evidence for natural selection kettlewell s results have been challenged by zoologists creationists and journalist judith hooper but later researchers have upheld kettlewell s findings industrial melanism is widespread in lepidoptera butterflies and moths involving over 70 species such as odontopera bidentata scalloped hazel and lymantria monacha dark arches but most studied is evolution of peppered moth biston betularia it is also seen in a beetle adalia bipunctata two spot ladybird where camouflage is not involved as insect has conspicuous warning coloration and in seasnake emydocephalus annulatus where melanism may help in excretion of trace elements through sloughing of skin rapid decline of melanism that has accompanied reduction of pollution in effect a natural experiment makes natural selection for camouflage only credible explanation other explanations for observed correlation with industrial pollution have been proposed including strengthening immune system in a polluted environment absorbing heat more rapidly when sunlight is reduced by air pollution and ability to excrete trace elements into melanic scales and feathers history thumb upright intermediate form between pale typica and dark carbonaria in tone of peppered moth on a lichen covered birch tree bernard kettlewell counted frequencies of all three forms industrial melanism was first noticed in 1900 by geneticist william bateson he observed that colour morphs were inherited but did not suggest an explanation for polymorphism in 1906 geneticist leonard doncaster described increase in frequency of melanic forms of several moth species from about 1800 to 1850 in heavily industrialised north west region of england in 1924 evolutionary biologist j b s haldane constructed a mathematical argument showing that rapid growth in frequency of carbonaria form of peppered moth biston betularia implied selective pressure originally published in trans phil soc 23 19 41 from 1955 onwards geneticist bernard kettlewell conducted a series of experiments exploring evolution of melanism in peppered moth he used a capture mark recapture technique to show that dark forms survived better than light ones by 1973 pollution in england had begun to decrease and dark carbonaria form had declined in frequency this provided convincing evidence gathered and analysed by kettlewell and others such as entomologist and geneticist michael majerus and population geneticist laurence m cook that its rise and fall had been caused by natural selection in response to changing pollution of landscape taxonomic range industrial melanism is known from over 70 species of moth that kettlewell found in england and many others from europe and north america which cites kettlewell 1973 among these apamea crenata clouded border brindle moth and knot grass moth are always polymorphic though melanic forms are more common in cities and like those of peppered moth are declining in frequency as those cities become less polluted among other insects industrial melanism has been observed in a beetle adalia bipunctata two spot ladybird in vertebrates industrial melanism is known from turtle headed seasnake emydocephalus annulatus and may be present in urban feral pigeons camouflage originally peppered moths lived where light colored lichens covered trees for camouflage from predators against that clean background they had generally light coloration during industrial revolution in england sulphur dioxide pollution in atmosphere reduced lichen cover while soot blackened bark of urban trees making light colored moths more vulnerable to predation this provided a selective advantage to gene responsible for melanism and darker colored moths increased in frequency melanic phenotype of biston betularia has been calculated to give a fitness advantage as great as 30 per cent by end of 19th century it almost completely replaced original light coloured type var typica forming a peak of 98 of population in 1895 thumb upright tree bark covered in shrubby and leafy lichens forms a patterned background against which non melanic disruptively patterned moth camouflage is effective melanic b betularia have been widely observed in north america in 1959 90 of b betularia in michigan and pennsylvania were melanic by 2001 melanism dropped to 6 of population following clean air legislation drop in melanism was correlated with an increase in species diversity of lichens a decrease in atmospheric pollutant sulphur dioxide and an increase in pale phenotype return of lichens is in turn directly correlated with reduction in atmospheric sulphur dioxide an additional study in 2018 further quantified survivability by looking at color and luminance camouflauge and avian artificial predation models for color camouflage typica moths blended better under lichen bark than carbonaria but when placed under plain bark there was no significant difference however in luminance camouflauge carbonaria moths blended better compared to typica on a plain bark tree when both variants were placed on an unpolluted lichen covered tree typica moths had a 21 better survival rate controversy kettlewell s experiments were criticised by zoologist theodore david sargent who failed to reproduce kettlewell s results between 1965 and 1969 and argued that kettlewell had specially trained his birds to give desired results michael majerus however found that kettlewell was basically correct in concluding that differential bird predation in a polluted environment was primary cause of industrial melanism in peppered moth story was in turn taken up in a 2002 book of moths and men by journalist judith hooper asserting that kettlewell s findings were fraudulent story was picked up by creationists who repeated assertions of zoologists including l m cook b s grant majerus and david rudge however all upheld kettlewell s account finding that each of hooper s and creationists claims collapsed when facts were examined it has been suggested that demonstrated relationship between melanism and pollution can not be fully proven because exact reason for increase in survivability can not be tracked and pin pointed however as air quality has improved in industrial areas of america and britain through improved regulation offering conditions for a natural experiment melanism has sharply declined in moths including b betularia and odontopera bidentata cook and j r g turner have concluded that natural selection is only credible explanation for overall decline and other biologists working in area concur with this judgement alternative explanations immunity in 1921 evolutionary biologist richard goldschmidt argued that observed increase in melanic form of black arches moth lymantria monacha could not have been caused by mutation pressure alone but required a selective advantage from an unknown cause he did not consider camouflage as an explanation nearly a century later it was suggested that moth s industrial melanism might in addition pleiotropy to providing camouflage with well known protective dark coloration also confer better immunity to toxic chemicals from industrial pollution darker forms have a stronger immune response to foreign objects these are encapsulated by insect blood cells and capsule so formed is then hardened with deposits of dark pigment melanin trace metal excretion a non camouflage mechanism has been suggested for some vertebrates in tropical ocean regions subject to industrial pollution turtle headed seasnake emydocephalus annulatus is more likely to be melanic these snakes shed their skin every two to six weeks sloughed skin contains toxic minerals higher for dark skin so industrial melanism could be selected for through improved excretion of trace elements same may apply in case of urban feral pigeons which have ability to remove trace metals such as zinc to their feathers however toxic lead was not found to accumulate in feathers so putative mechanism is limited in its range thermal advantage melanic forms of two spot ladybird adalia bipunctata are very frequent in and near cities and rare in unpolluted countryside so they appear to be industrial ladybirds are aposematic with conspicuous warning coloration so camouflage cannot explain distribution a proposed explanation is that melanic forms have a thermal advantage directly linked to pollution aspect of industrialization since smoke and particulates in air reduce amount of sunlight that reaches habitats of these species melanic phenotypes should then be favoured by natural selection as dark coloration absorbs limited sunlight better a possible explanation might be that in colder environments thermal advantages of industrial melanism might increase activity and likelihood to mate in netherlands melanic a bipunctata had a distinct mating advantage over non melanic form however thermal melanism failed to explain distribution of species near helsinki where city forms a relatively warm heat island while near finnish coast there is more sunlight as well as more melanism so selective pressure driving melanism requires a different explanation a study in birmingham similarly found no evidence of thermal melanism but a strong correlation with smoke pollution melanism declined from 1960 to 1978 as city became cleaner further same study found that a related species adalia experienced no change in frequency of melanism in same places in that period notes references category evolution
