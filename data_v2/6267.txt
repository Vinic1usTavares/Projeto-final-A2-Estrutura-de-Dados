apeomyoides savagei is a fossil rodent from miocene of united states only species in genus apeomyoides it is known from fragmentary jaws and isolated teeth from a site in early barstovian around 15 16 million years ago of nevada together with other species from scattered localities in united states japan and europe apeomyoides is classified in subfamily apeomyinae of extinct rodent family eomyidae apeomyines are a rare but widespread group that may have been adapted to a relatively dry habitat as is characteristic of apeomyines apeomyoides was a large eomyid with high crowned cheekteeth and a large gap between incisors and cheekteeth furthermore cheekteeth premolars and molars approach a bilophodont pattern with two distinct lobes other features distinguish apeomyoides from other apeomyines including rectangular shape of cheekteeth fourth lower premolar p4 is larger than molars behind it and has two roots while lower molars have three taxonomy apeomyoides is a member of eomyidae a diverse rodent family that is now extinct eomyids first appeared in middle eocene 47 million years ago mya in north america where they existed until end of miocene 5 mya in europe they survived a little longer until end of pliocene 2 3 mya apeomyoides is further part of a distinctive subgroup of eomyids known as apeomyinae first apeomyine to be discovered was apeomys named in 1968 based on fossils from early miocene of germany and later discoveries have expanded range of apeomys and similar taxa in 1998 fejfar and colleagues reviewed apeomys and identified a second related genus megapeomys from early miocene of germany czech republic and japan these scientists also named a new eomyid subfamily apeomyinae to house apeomys and megapeomys japanese megapeomys was named as a separate species megapeomys repenningi in 2011 further apeomyines have been identified in north america megapeomys bobwilsoni from of nevada apeomyoides savagei from barstovian of nevada zophoapeomys indicum from late oligocene of south dakota and a possible second species of zophoapeomys from late oligocene of nebraska another north american eomyid arikareeomys from of nebraska has also been reidentified as an apeomyine in general apeomyines are a widespread but generally rare group of distinctive eomyids with a tendency towards large size fejfar and colleagues suggested that apeomyines were ecologically distinct from other eomyids and probably preferred a drier habitat although other scientists recognized apeomyinae as a subfamily in a 2008 summary of north american eomyids lawrence flynn placed group as a tribe within subfamily flynn described apeomyoides as most derived apeomyine apeomyoides savagei was described as a new genus and species by kent smith richard cifelli and nicholas in 2006 generic name apeomyoides adds greek suffix ides indicating similarity to name of related genus apeomys while specific name savagei honors donald e savage for his work on fossil mammals and for assistance to smith in same paper these scientists argued in favor of apeomyine affinities for arikareeomys description apeomyoides savagei is a large eomyid though not as large as megapeomys and m bobwilsoni megapeomys repenningi from japan is similar in size but its cheekteeth are not as high crowned a savagei shows a series of traits that are characteristic for apeomyines high crowned cheekteeth with thick enamel that are bilophodont divided into two lobes in form and a very long diastema gap between lower incisor and cheekteeth however cheekteeth are higher crowned than those of other apeomyines including apeomys megapeomys and arikareeomys and they are rectangular in shape while other apeomyines have barrel shaped teeth similarly oldest apeomyine zophoapeomys is smaller and has lower crowned cheekteeth known material of apeomyoides consists of a number of fragmentary mandibles lower jaws and isolated cheekteeth length of first and second lower molars m1 and m2 ranges from 1 74 to 2 58 mm width from 2 08 to 2 33 mm fourth upper premolar p4 has not been recorded but there is a specimen of its deciduous precursor dp4 this tooth is characterized by four major cusps protocone paracone hypocone and metacone and lophs or crests mesoloph and posteroloph separated by synclines or valleys first and second upper molar m1 and m2 are almost square and similar in size and structure to dp4 an additional loph on m1 and m2 is incomplete in apeomyoides but more prominent in both megapeomys bobwilsoni and arikareeomys four lower cheekteeth fourth lower premolar p4 and first through third lower molars m1 m3 are high crowned teeth like upper teeth they bear four cusps metaconid protoconid entoconid and hypoconid four lophs metalophid mesolophid hypolophid and posterolophid and three valleys each of lower cheekteeth lacks an additional loph ectolophid which is present in arikareeomys p4 is larger than any of molars and longer than it is wide among molars m1 and m2 do not differ appreciably from each other and are a little wider than they are long while m3 is a little smaller and its back side is more rounded and narrower syncline iv which is located at back of tooth between hypolophid and posterolophid is closed at margins this valley is open in megapeomys bobwilsoni syncline iv also opens into centrally located syncline iii this opening is absent in arikareeomys there are two roots under p4 and three under each of molars fewer than in megapeomys bobwilsoni which shows three under p4 and four under molars on mandible diastema is very large and incisor is procumbent projecting forward which distinguishes apeomyoides from most eomyids apart from megapeomys there is a masseteric scar associated with jaw muscles from below m1 forward to a point in front of p4 below mental foramen an opening in jawbone in apeomys and megapeomys this scar only reaches to level of front root of p4 mental foramen is very small and opens in diastema near ventral shelf of scar in apeomys and megapeomys it is located near dorsal shelf further foramina are present on lingual inner surface of bone below cheekteeth thumb center 500px cheekteeth of apeomyoides

apeomyoides savagei is from eastgate local fauna in monarch mill formation of churchill county nevada this fauna dates to early barstovian land mammal age around 15 16 mya this makes apeomyoides youngest known apeomyine and its occurrence helps close a gap in known geographic range of north american apeomyines between megapeomys bobwilsoni elsewhere in nevada and arikareeomys in nebraska
