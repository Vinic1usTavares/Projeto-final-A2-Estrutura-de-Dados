interned at selarang barracks in changi to sign a no escape pledge after recapture of four escaped prisoners from changi prison earlier four escapees were australian corporal rodney breavington and private victor gale and english soldiers private harold waters and private eric fletcher pledge reads i hereby solemnly swear on my honour that i will not under any circumstances attempt to escape with three exceptions everyone refused to sign because prisoners saw it as their duty to escape if they could under geneva convention pows had right to attempt to escape and they were not supposed to be punished if they were recaptured however at that time japan was not a signatory to geneva convention general fukuye was furious at mass display of insubordination and following day he ordered all prisoners except three who had agreed to sign to congregate at parade square in selarang barracks what ensued was to become known as selarang barracks incident selarang barracks originally built to accommodate 800 men consisted of a parade ground surrounded on three sides by three storey buildings a number of smaller houses for officers and married couples were spread out in spacious grounds

breavington pleaded to no avail that he was solely responsible for escape attempt and should be only one executed their executions were carried out by indian national army guards with rifles on 2 september initial volley was non fatal and wounded men had to plead to be finished off an account mentioned by thompson stated men pleaded to be finished off while another account by australian 2 26th battalion stated last man died cursing his executors despite executions prisoners remained firm as days ensued without food and little water available and coupled with latrine pits kitchens and hospital beds crowded into an area of about a square kilometre dysentery broke out quickly and sick began to die realising that more would die needlessly prisoners commanders decided that they and their men would sign pledge under duress on 4 september lt col holmes issued a written order to his men as japanese weren t familiar with british names pows signed using false or meaningless names one of most common signatures among australians was ned kelly a famous australian folk hero after signing was completed japanese allowed prisoners back to their former areas on 5 september thus ending
