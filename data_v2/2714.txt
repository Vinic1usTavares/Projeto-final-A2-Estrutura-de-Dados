and development marilyn manson was formed in 1989 by vocalist and guitarist daisy berkowitz for next seven years name of every band member was created by combining stage name of a female pop culture

members of marilyn manson twiggy ramirez madonna wayne gacy and ginger fish nine inch nails guitarists robin finck and danny lohner and drummer chris vrenna participated record was initially produced by vocalist alongside trent reznor and former skinny puppy producer dave ogilvie process of creating album was long and difficult highlighted by experiments involving near constant drug use and sleep deprivation in an effort to create a violent and hostile environment suited to album s content manson has admitted to heavily experimenting with prescription painkillers including forms of morphine sulphate and during recording he also claimed he regularly inserted sewing needles underneath his fingernails to test his pain threshold initial sessions were unproductive and routinely culminated in destruction of studio as well as group s own equipment and instruments there was also a high level of antagonism between band members with most of this directed toward founding guitarist daisy berkowitz he later claimed to have been shut out of recording sessions and alleged that much of his equipment was destroyed such as four track recorder which had been used to produce many of band s early demos along with his drum machine latter was subsequently revealed to have been thrown from a second story window this animosity resulted in ramirez performing majority of guitar work on record thumb left 150px berkowitz s replacement zim zum during album s promotional campaign berkowitz was highly critical of reznor who he said purposely destroyed a fender jaguar given as a gift to berkowitz from his then recently deceased father explaining i was in studio and they were all in control room and i m playing guitar at end trent says do it again but do it more like this we went through this three times and he says hold on i ll come in there let me show you what i m talking about so i take my guitar off hand it to him and he smashes it just to fuck with me then he laughed and left room berkowitz acrimoniously exited group sometime after this incident reznor s relationship with rest of band manson in particularly also began to deteriorate during production primarily as a result of creative differences manson and reznor have not recorded material together since release of antichrist superstar ogilvie was eventually blamed for band s dysfunction and was fired as co producer he was replaced by frequent nine inch nails mixer sean beavan manson and beavan then spent several weeks reworking and remixing majority of album in nothing records auxiliary recording facility reznor had started production on soundtrack to david lynch s lost highway in primary studio and was often absent from these later sessions manson went on to praise beavan s influence on both album and band as a whole describing him as being like a magnet drawing band back in studio and back together pair are sole credited producers of three songs on record dried up tied and dead to world and minute of decay berkowitz s replacement on lead guitar joined band shortly after album was completed timothy linton adopted zim zum as his stage name ending seven year tradition of naming members after female icons and male serial killers his name was derived from kabbalah concept of concept and themes antichrist superstar is a rock opera concept album and its title is based on 1971 andrew lloyd webber musical jesus christ superstar central storyline of album revolves around a supernatural being a demagogic rockstar who seizes all political power from humanity in order to initiate an apocalyptic end event this underlying concept was both inspired by and a tribute to work of german philosopher friedrich nietzsche specifically his philosophical concept of an ubermensch it was also influenced by idea of putting yourself through a transformation to become something superhuman which manson said he garnered from nietzsche s antichrist album is a social critique which utilizes this premise as a metaphor for perceived fascist elements of conservative political movement and christian right in north america manson also cited david bowie s we are dead 1974 as a major influence on album lyrically saying i remember hearing that song in nineties when i first moved to l a it wouldn t have had same impact on me if i d heard it when i was a kid in ohio it felt like it was about culture of hollywood disgusting cannibalism composition and style antichrist superstar is primarily an industrial metal record and contains material which has been described as industrial rock and death metal as well as progressive metal new wave and gothic rock record is separated into three sections inauguration of worm and disintegrator rising in final section central character transforms into antichrist superstar an populist demagogue whose motivations transcend any conceivable sense of morality nihilistic and disgusted by humankind it initiates a genocidal extermination of human race eventually destroying entire planet album is also cyclical with both its opening and closing seconds consisting of distorted phrase when you are suffering know that i have betrayed you ramirez composed much of music on record and regularly asked for input from reznor whom he said was only other string musician in studio on a regular basis elaborating writing songs was nothing but going in and recording them we made some changes it was nice to have trent there like another member of band to help me have another outlook at some of stuff because daisy had ran out of ideas and just did not contribute whatsoever reznor is credited with co composing music of three songs on album after release of holy wood in shadow of valley of death in 2000 manson revealed that antichrist superstar formed a conceptual trilogy alongside both aforementioned album and 1998 s mechanical animals he explained that trilogy was an autobiographical story told in a reverse timeline chronologically reverse from their release dates with storyline beginning on holy wood followed by mechanical animals and antichrist superstar acting as its conclusion furthermore although antichrist superstar and mechanical animals made sense as individual concept albums there was an overarching story running through each release cycle ii inauguration of worm cryptorchid is shortest track on album and shortest song in band s overall discography as a result song has often been misconstrued as either an interlude or filler title is both a compound of words crypt and orchid and a direct reference to medical condition of cryptorchidism stereogum called song a uniquely beautiful track and identified its roots in avant garde and ambient genus of industrial music comparing it favorably to music of coil albeit an unusually rock centric one song is divided into two sections in first half manson s vocals are rendered deadpan using several layers of microphone filters while it is altered in second with a vocoder to augment a mellotron played over a pulsing sinus rhythm on close listening phrase i wish i had balls is whispered repeatedly in middle to bridge both sections crowning it band s 6th best song in their top 10 list stereogum mused of an alternative history where band explored song s experimental direction further throughout record cycle iii disintegrator rising title song ends with apple inc s 1990 s synthetic speech program also known as macintalk voices repeating when you are suffering know that i have betrayed you macintalk voices are used again in music video during live performances of song macintalk voices repeat you might as well kill yourself you re already dead at end of song song 1996 was subject of legal action brought against band by former bassist gein over alleged similarities to a demo titled she s not my girlfriend latter had first been recorded in 1990 four years before ramirez had joined group release and artwork antichrist superstar features elaborate artwork images in booklet consist of various medical diagrams from henry gray s anatomy of human body kabbalah symbols and a visual worm to angel metamorphosis references to verses one through five of revelation 12 as well as liner notes a note found under lyrics of irresponsible hate anthem claim song was recorded live on february 14 1997 despite album being released in october 1996 artwork for album was designed by p r brown it was first of several albums packaging designer designed for band in an interview with revolver brown recounted that his working relationship with band started on recommendation a friend in 1996 while he was working as creative director of a design studio in new york city band was recording album at nothing studios at time and were actively looking for a cover art designer by brown s own admission extent of his experience designing album covers up to that point had been limited to jazz records after researching into who manson was he realized it was pointless to send band any of his prior work brown decided to spend a weekend creating fictitious album covers for made up bands and sent those to new orleans after several months of hearing nothing back brown was invited to nothing studios to meet with manson during their meeting manson asked brown to watch e elias merhige s 1990 experimental art film begotten according to brown manson already had a strong idea of what he wanted album cover to look like drawing inspiration from bleak cinematography of this grainy scratched nightmare of a film after a listening session of unfinished record and an explanation of album s concept and three cycle structure both agreed that record needed two covers to portray evolution from a worm into antichrist brown utilized dean karr s photographs of band and mixed media for packaging he recalled drawing some things and scanning in several layers of dirt during design process o card slipcase depict manson as worm in front with yellowed scabrous wings and black superficial veins a medical diagram of a rib cage can also be seen on top left corner on back manson is shown as antichrist superstar in suit and tie along with stylized high voltage symbol used by band as album s logo roman numerals ix vi iii and vii round out rear of slipcase words heart mind complacent and malice are also featured on front of o card and throughout booklet they were originally from one of fictitious album covers brown made brown explained that he conceived of them after he picked opposing ideals and turned them into a symbolic compass of sorts heart is opposite of mind and complacency is opposite of malice strangely enough all of those things fit into concept of album exact graphic i used for fake albums was used for final package brown suspected it was reason he was hired back of tray insert depicts manson standing between ramirez and gacy while latter two wear oxygen masks connected to his senator joseph lieberman found image particularly offensive mistaking standing figure for a naked woman lieberman denounced these records and their corporate sponsors are telling our children it s season of senseless violence hopelessness and most

120 minutes of nothing tour commenced a month later on october 3 1996 at state theatre in kalamazoo michigan and consisted of 175 concerts staged in several continents band s now trademark theatricality was a cornerstone of shows by frontman s own estimation however it was less extravagant than prior or succeeding outings manson still enraged conservatives and christian right with near nightly concerts wherein he wiped his buttocks with flag of united states tore bibles apart and performed self mutilation tour mounted several set pieces depending on venue size backdrop consisted of a stained glass tableau that depicted jesus flanked by figures impaled on spears or alternatively saint michael archangel slaying dragon during war in heaven from 9th verse of twelfth chapter of book of revelations for smaller venues band used a crumbling mullioned and traceried gothic cathedral window stage design also included a pipe organ and a set of stairs from which manson descended to start opening piece manson s costume changes were limited between his signature elastic back brace matched to a jockstrap over a g string a pair of thigh high fishnet hosiery attached to a garter belt and calf high leather boots used for most of show alternating to a black suit and tie over a red dress shirt for performances of title song during title song stage design was converted into a mock nuremberg rally backdrop was switched from stained glass tableau to three oversized vertical banners unfurled from rafters and emblazoned with album s logo manson performed atop a similarly emblazoned lectern mimicking exaggerated gyrations of dictators and televangelists suggesting a similarity between two rest of band performed wearing chromed in his autobiography long hard road out of hell manson described that portion of show as simultaneous critiques on both inherent fascism in christianity and right wing morality as well as thin line between celebrity and demagoguery because rock and roll can be just as blind as christianity a snow ash like confetti was used during performances of cake and sodomy cryptorchid and apple of sodom while a microphone stand covered in orchids was used during song man that you fear tour was plagued by constant bomb and death threats and nearly every north american venue band visited was picketed by religious and civic organizations opponents of band

and human sacrifice and claims band engaged in homosexual intercourse with each other in concert and that underage concertgoers were violently raped by other audience members in this context utah

comer in reviewing for cmj new music monthly described record as a magnificent aural skull fuck writing that marilyn manson took in all angst hellfire and damnation one band could ingest then released

kot of chicago tribune complimented album s production as did jim farber of entertainment weekly who also praised its ambitious concept writing for entertainment weekly ann powers applauded album s concept and quality of songwriting saying until now manson s ideas carried more weight than his music but antichrist superstars sound matches garish grandiosity of his arguments its 16 songs rock like 70s sabbath style metal but harder arrangements echo queen in operatic scope but are more intense mood owes its vampiric chill to bauhaus but marilyn manson actually bites vein stephen thomas erlewine of allmusic wrote that album is considered band s definitive statement and rated it four out of five stars however he was critical of reznor s production saying though sonic details make album an intriguing listen it s not as extreme as it could have been in particular guitars are surprisingly anemic sounding like buzzing vacuums instead of unwieldy chainsaws even less impressed robert christgau dismissed record as a dud and later compared it to music used by united states military to psychologically harass manuel noriega during operation nifty package in rolling stone lorraine ali credited both album and band s associated rise within mainstream culture as marking end of reign of punk realism in rock roll calling record a volatile reaction to five years of earnest post nirvana rock she went on to hypothesize that marilyn manson offer total escapism as a true alternative complete with carefully crafted gloom wear no baggy shorts allowed a frontman who blatantly begs to be in spotlight and lyric imagery rivaling that of best slasher movies similarly a 2016 article from a v club called record influential suggesting that its success prompted a shift in rock music which resulted in other rock bands trading grunge s bruised heart for seething self nihilism political reaction thumb left alt it s season of senseless violence senator orrin hatch holding a copy of
