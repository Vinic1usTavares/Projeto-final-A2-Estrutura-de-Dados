a galaxy is a gravitationally bound system of stars stellar remnants interstellar gas dust and dark matter word galaxy is derived from greek literally milky a reference to milky way galaxies range in size from dwarfs with just a few hundred million stars to giants with one hundred trillion stars each orbiting its galaxy s center of mass galaxies are categorized according to their visual morphology as elliptical spiral or irregular many galaxies are thought to have supermassive black holes at their centers milky way s central black hole known as sagittarius a has a mass four million times greater than sun as of march 2016 gn z11 is oldest and most distant observed galaxy with a comoving distance of 32 billion light years from earth and observed as it existed just 400 million years after big bang research released in 2016 revised number of galaxies in observable universe from a previous estimate of 200 billion to a suggested 2 trillion or more and overall as many as an estimated stars more stars than all grains of sand on planet earth most of galaxies are 1 000 to 100 000 parsecs in diameter approximately 3000 to 300 000 light years and separated by distances on order of millions of parsecs or megaparsecs for comparison milky way has a diameter of at least 30 000 parsecs 100 000 ly and is separated from andromeda galaxy its nearest large neighbor by 780 000 parsecs 2 5 million ly space between galaxies is filled with a tenuous gas intergalactic medium having an average density of less than one atom per cubic meter majority of galaxies are gravitationally organized into groups clusters and superclusters milky way is part of local group which is dominated by it and andromeda galaxy and is part of virgo supercluster at largest scale these associations are generally arranged into sheets and filaments surrounded by immense voids largest structure of galaxies yet recognised is a cluster of superclusters that has been named laniakea which contains virgo supercluster etymology word galaxy was borrowed via french and medieval latin from greek term for milky way c t onions et al oxford dictionary of english etymology oxford 1966 p 385 milky circle named after its appearance as a milky band of light in sky in greek mythology zeus places his son born by a mortal woman infant heracles on hera s breast while she is asleep so that baby will drink her divine milk and will thus become immortal hera wakes up while breastfeeding and then realizes she is nursing an unknown baby she pushes baby away some of her milk spills and it produces faint band of light known as milky way in astronomical literature capitalized word galaxy is often used to refer to our galaxy milky way to distinguish it from other galaxies in our universe english term milky way can be traced back to a story by chaucer quote see yonder lo which men th milky wey for hit is geoffrey chaucer house of fame galaxies were initially discovered telescopically and were known as spiral nebulae most 18th to 19th century astronomers considered them as either unresolved star clusters or nebulae and were just thought as a part of milky way but their true composition and natures remained a mystery observations using larger telescopes of a few nearby bright galaxies like andromeda galaxy began resolving them into huge conglomerations of stars but based simply on apparent faintness and sheer population of stars true distances of these objects placed them well beyond milky way for this reason they were popularly called island universes but this term quickly fell into disuse as word universe implied entirety of existence instead they became known simply as galaxies nomenclature thumb galaxy cluster sdss 3313 sdss stands for sloan digital sky survey j for julian epoch and 1152 3313 for declination and right ascension respectively tens of thousands of galaxies have been catalogued but only a few have well established names such as andromeda galaxy magellanic clouds whirlpool

galaxies mcg morphological catalogue of galaxies and ugc uppsala general catalogue of galaxies all of well known galaxies appear in one or more of these catalogues but each time under a different

we live in a galaxy which is one among many galaxies parallels major discoveries that were made about milky way and other nebulae milky way greek philosopher democritus 450 370 bce proposed that bright band on night sky known as milky way might consist of distant stars aristotle 384 322 bce however believed milky way to be caused by ignition of fiery exhalation of some stars that were large numerous and close together and that ignition takes place in upper part of atmosphere in region of world that is continuous with heavenly motions neoplatonist philosopher olympiodorus younger 570 ce was critical of this view arguing that if milky way is sublunary situated between earth and moon it should appear different at different times and places on earth and that it should have parallax which it does not in his view milky way is celestial according to mohamed arabian astronomer alhazen 965 1037 made first attempt at observing and measuring milky way s parallax and he thus determined that because milky way had no parallax it must be remote from earth not belonging to atmosphere persian astronomer al biruni 973 1048 proposed milky way galaxy to be a collection of countless fragments of nature of nebulous stars andalusian astronomer ibn bajjah avempace 1138 proposed that milky way is made up of many stars that almost touch one another and appear to be a continuous image due to effect of refraction from sublunary material citing his observation of conjunction of jupiter and mars as evidence of this occurring when two objects are near in 14th century syrian born ibn qayyim proposed milky way galaxy to be a myriad of tiny stars packed together in sphere of fixed stars thumb shape of milky way as estimated from star counts by william herschel in 1785 solar system was assumed to be near center actual proof of milky way consisting of many stars came in 1610 when italian astronomer galileo galilei used a telescope to study milky way and discovered that it is composed of a huge number of faint stars galileo galilei sidereus nuncius venice italy thomas baglioni 1610 pages 15 and 16 english translation galileo galilei with edward stafford carlos trans sidereal messenger london england rivingtons 1880 pages 42 and 43 in 1750 english astronomer thomas wright in his an original theory or new hypothesis of universe speculated correctly that galaxy

perspective inside disk thomas wright an original theory or new hypothesis of universe london england h chapelle 1750 from p 48 stars are not infinitely dispersed and distributed in a promiscuous

germany johann friederich petersen 1755 available in english translation by ian johnston at vancouver island university british columbia canada first project to describe shape of milky way and position of sun was undertaken by william herschel in 1785 by counting number of stars in different regions of sky he produced a diagram of shape of galaxy with solar system close to center herschel s diagram of galaxy appears immediately after article s last page using a refined approach kapteyn in 1920 arrived at picture of a small diameter about 15 kiloparsecs ellipsoid galaxy with sun close to center a different method by harlow shapley based on cataloguing of globular clusters led to a radically different picture a flat disk with diameter approximately 70 kiloparsecs and sun far from center both analyses failed to take into account absorption of light by interstellar dust present in galactic plane but after robert julius trumpler quantified this effect in 1930 by studying open clusters present picture of our host galaxy milky way emerged thumb center 600px a fish eye mosaic of milky way arching at a high inclination across night sky shot from a dark sky location in chile magellanic clouds satellite galaxies of milky way appear near left edge distinction from other nebulae a few galaxies outside milky way are visible on a dark night to unaided eye including andromeda galaxy large magellanic cloud small magellanic cloud and triangulum galaxy in 10th century persian astronomer al sufi made earliest recorded identification of andromeda galaxy describing it as a small cloud in 964 al sufi probably mentioned large magellanic cloud in his book of fixed stars referring to al bakr of southern arabs since at a declination of about 70deg south it was not visible where he lived it was not well known to europeans until magellan s voyage in 16th century andromeda galaxy was later independently noted by simon marius in 1612 in 1734 philosopher emanuel swedenborg in his principia speculated that there may be galaxies outside our own that are formed into galactic clusters that are minuscule parts of universe which extends far beyond what we can see these views are remarkably close to present day views of cosmos in 1745 pierre louis maupertuis conjectured that some nebula like objects are collections of stars with unique properties including a glow exceeding light its stars produce on their own and repeated johannes hevelius s view that bright spots are massive and flattened due to their rotation kant immanuel universal natural history and theory of

wright s an original theory or new hypothesis of universe in thumb right photograph of great andromeda nebula from 1899 later identified as andromeda galaxy toward end of 18th century charles messier compiled a catalog containing 109 brightest celestial objects having nebulous appearance subsequently william herschel assembled a catalog of 5 000 nebulae in 1845 lord rosse constructed a new telescope and was able to distinguish between elliptical and spiral nebulae he also managed to make out individual point sources in some of these nebulae lending credence to kant s earlier conjecture parsonstown genius of parsons family william rosse parsonstown info in 1912 vesto slipher made spectrographic studies of brightest spiral nebulae to determine their composition slipher discovered that spiral nebulae have high doppler shifts indicating that they are moving at a rate exceeding velocity of stars he had measured he found that majority of these nebulae are moving away from us in 1917 heber curtis observed nova s andromedae within great andromeda nebula as andromeda galaxy messier object m31 was then known searching photographic record he found 11 more novae curtis noticed that these novae were on average 10 magnitudes fainter than those that occurred within our galaxy as a result he was able to come up with a distance estimate of 150 000 parsecs he became a proponent of so called island universes hypothesis which holds that spiral nebulae are actually independent galaxies in 1920 a debate took place between harlow shapley and heber curtis great debate concerning nature of milky way spiral nebulae and dimensions of universe to support his claim that great andromeda nebula is an external galaxy curtis noted appearance of dark lanes resembling dust clouds in milky way as well as significant doppler shift in 1922 estonian astronomer ernst gave a distance determination that supported theory that andromeda nebula is indeed a distant extra galactic object using new 100 inch mt wilson telescope edwin hubble was able to resolve outer parts of some spiral nebulae as collections of individual stars and identified some cepheid variables thus allowing him to estimate distance to nebulae they were far too distant to be part of milky way in 1936 hubble produced a classification of galactic morphology that is used to this day modern research thumb right 200px rotation curve of a typical spiral galaxy predicted based on visible matter a and observed b distance is from galactic core in 1944 hendrik van de predicted that microwave radiation with wavelength of 21 cm would be detectable from interstellar atomic hydrogen gas and in 1951 it was observed this radiation is not affected by dust absorption and so its doppler shift can be used to map motion of gas in our galaxy these observations led to hypothesis of a rotating bar structure in center of our galaxy with improved radio telescopes hydrogen gas could also be traced in other galaxies in 1970s vera rubin uncovered a discrepancy between observed galactic rotation speed and that predicted by visible mass of stars and gas today galaxy rotation problem is thought to be explained by presence of large quantities of unseen dark matter left thumb scientists used galaxies visible in goods survey to recalculate total number of galaxies beginning in 1990s hubble space telescope yielded improved observations among other things hubble data helped establish that missing dark matter in our galaxy cannot solely consist of inherently faint and small stars hubble deep field an extremely long exposure of a relatively empty part of sky provided evidence that there are about 125 billion galaxies in observable universe improved technology in detecting spectra invisible to humans radio telescopes infrared cameras and x ray telescopes allow detection of other galaxies that are not detected by hubble particularly galaxy surveys in zone of avoidance region of sky blocked at visible light wavelengths by milky way have revealed a number of new galaxies in 2016 a study published in astrophysical journal and led by christopher of university of nottingham using 3d modeling of images collected over 20 years by hubble space telescope concluded that there are over 2 trillion galaxies in observable universe types and morphology thumb 360px types of galaxies according to hubble classification scheme an e indicates a type of elliptical galaxy an s is a spiral and sb is a barred spiral galaxy galaxies to left side of hubble classification scheme are sometimes referred to as early type while those to right are late type galaxies come in three main types ellipticals spirals and irregulars a slightly more extensive description of galaxy types based on their appearance is given by hubble sequence since hubble sequence is entirely based upon visual morphological type shape it may miss certain important characteristics of galaxies such as star formation rate in starburst galaxies and activity in cores of active galaxies ellipticals hubble classification system rates elliptical galaxies on basis of their ellipticity ranging from e0 being nearly spherical up to e7 which is highly elongated these galaxies have an ellipsoidal profile giving them an elliptical appearance regardless of viewing angle their appearance shows little structure and they typically have relatively little interstellar matter consequently these galaxies also have a low portion of open clusters and a reduced rate of new star formation instead they are dominated by generally older more evolved stars that are orbiting common center of gravity in random directions stars contain low abundances of heavy elements because star formation ceases after initial burst in this sense they have some similarity to much smaller globular clusters largest galaxies are giant ellipticals many elliptical galaxies are believed to form due to interaction of galaxies resulting in a collision and merger they can grow to enormous sizes compared to spiral galaxies for example and giant elliptical galaxies are often found near core of large galaxy clusters shell galaxy thumb ngc 3923 elliptical shell galaxy hubble space telescope photograph a shell galaxy is a type of elliptical galaxy where stars in galaxy s halo are arranged in concentric shells about one tenth of elliptical galaxies have a shell like structure which has never been observed in spiral galaxies shell like structures are thought to develop when a larger galaxy absorbs a smaller companion galaxy as two galaxy centers approach centers start to oscillate around a center point oscillation creates gravitational ripples forming shells of stars similar to ripples spreading on water for example galaxy ngc 3923 has over twenty shells spirals thumb right pinwheel galaxy ngc spiral galaxies resemble spiraling pinwheels though stars and other visible material contained in such a galaxy lie mostly on a plane majority of mass in spiral galaxies exists in a roughly spherical halo of dark matter that extends beyond visible component as demonstrated by universal rotation curve concept spiral galaxies consist of a rotating disk of stars and interstellar medium along with a central bulge of generally older stars extending outward from bulge are relatively bright arms in hubble classification scheme spiral galaxies are listed as type s followed by a letter a b or c that indicates degree of tightness of spiral arms and size of central bulge an sa galaxy has tightly wound poorly defined arms and possesses a relatively large core region at other extreme an sc galaxy has open well defined arms and a small core region a galaxy with poorly defined arms is sometimes referred to as a spiral galaxy in contrast to grand design spiral galaxy that has prominent and well defined spiral arms speed in which a galaxy rotates is thought to correlate with flatness of disc as some spiral galaxies have thick bulges while others are thin and dense fat or flat getting galaxies into shape phys org february 2014 right thumb 300px ngc 1300 an example of a barred spiral galaxy in spiral galaxies spiral arms do have shape of approximate logarithmic spirals a pattern that can be theoretically shown to result from a disturbance in a uniformly rotating mass of stars like stars spiral arms rotate around center but they do so with constant angular velocity spiral arms are thought to be areas of high density matter or density waves as stars move through an arm space velocity of each stellar system is modified by gravitational force of higher density velocity returns to normal after stars depart on other side of arm this effect is akin to a wave of slowdowns moving along a highway full of moving cars arms are visible because high density facilitates star formation and therefore they harbor many bright and young stars thumb right hoag s object an example of a ring galaxy barred spiral galaxy a majority of spiral galaxies including our own milky way galaxy have a linear bar shaped band of stars that extends outward to either side of core then merges into spiral arm structure in hubble classification scheme these are designated by an sb followed by a lower case letter a b or c that indicates form of spiral arms in same manner as categorization of normal spiral galaxies bars are thought to be temporary structures that can occur as a result of a density wave radiating outward from core or else due to a tidal interaction with another galaxy many barred spiral galaxies are active possibly as a result of gas being channeled into core along arms our own galaxy milky way is a large disk shaped barred spiral galaxy about 30 kiloparsecs in diameter and a thick it contains about two hundred billion stars and has a total mass of about six hundred billion times mass of sun super luminous spiral recently researchers described galaxies called super luminous spirals they are very large with an upward diameter of 437 000 light years compared to milky way s 100 000 light year diameter with a mass of 340 billion solar masses they generate a significant amount of ultraviolet and mid infrared light they are thought to have an increased star formation rate around 30 times faster than milky way other morphologies peculiar galaxies are galactic formations that develop unusual properties due to tidal interactions with other galaxies a ring galaxy has a ring like structure of stars and interstellar medium surrounding a bare core a ring galaxy is thought to occur when a smaller galaxy passes through core of a spiral galaxy such an event may have affected andromeda galaxy as it displays a multi ring like structure when viewed in infrared radiation a lenticular galaxy is an intermediate form that has properties of both elliptical and spiral galaxies these are categorized as hubble type and they possess ill defined spiral arms with an elliptical halo of stars barred lenticular galaxies receive hubble classification irregular galaxies are galaxies that can not be readily classified into an elliptical or spiral morphology an irr i galaxy has some structure but does not align cleanly with hubble classification scheme irr ii galaxies do not possess any structure that resembles a hubble classification and may have been disrupted nearby examples of dwarf irregular galaxies include magellanic clouds an ultra diffuse galaxy udg is an extremely low density galaxy galaxy may be same size as milky way but has a visible star count of only 1 of milky way lack of luminosity is because there is a lack of star forming gas in galaxy which results in old stellar populations dwarfs despite prominence of large elliptical and spiral galaxies most galaxies in universe are dwarf galaxies these galaxies are relatively small when compared with other galactic formations being about one hundredth size of milky way containing only a few billion stars ultra compact dwarf galaxies have recently been discovered that are only 100 parsecs across many dwarf galaxies may orbit a single larger galaxy milky way has at least a dozen such satellites with an estimated 300 500 yet to be discovered dwarf galaxies may also be classified as elliptical spiral or irregular since small dwarf ellipticals bear little resemblance to large ellipticals they are often called dwarf spheroidal galaxies instead a study of 27 milky way neighbors found that in all dwarf galaxies central mass is approximately 10 million solar masses regardless of whether galaxy has thousands or millions of stars this has led to suggestion that galaxies are largely formed by dark matter and that minimum size may indicate a form of warm dark matter incapable of gravitational coalescence on a smaller scale other types of galaxies interacting thumb right 200px antennae galaxies are undergoing a collision that will result in their eventual merger interactions between galaxies are relatively frequent and they can play an important role in galactic evolution near misses between galaxies result in warping distortions due to tidal interactions and may cause some exchange of gas and dust collisions occur when two galaxies pass directly through each other and have sufficient relative momentum not to merge stars of interacting galaxies will usually not collide but gas and dust within two forms will interact sometimes triggering star formation a collision can severely distort shape of galaxies forming bars rings or tail like structures at extreme of interactions are galactic mergers in this case relative momentum of two galaxies is insufficient to allow galaxies to pass through each other instead they gradually merge to form a single larger galaxy mergers can result in significant changes to morphology as compared to original galaxies if one of merging galaxies is much more massive than other merging galaxy then result is known as cannibalism more massive larger galaxy will remain relatively undisturbed by merger while smaller galaxy is torn apart milky way galaxy is currently in process of cannibalizing sagittarius dwarf elliptical galaxy and canis major dwarf galaxy starburst thumb right 200px m82 a starburst galaxy that has ten times star formation of a normal galaxy stars are created within galaxies from a reserve of cold gas that forms into giant molecular clouds some galaxies have been observed to form stars at an exceptional rate which is known as a starburst if they continue to do so then they would consume their reserve of gas in a time span less than lifespan of galaxy hence starburst activity usually lasts for only about ten million years a relatively brief period in history of a galaxy starburst galaxies were more common during early history of universe and at present still contribute an estimated 15 to total star production rate starburst galaxies are characterized by dusty concentrations of gas and appearance of newly formed stars including massive stars that ionize surrounding clouds to create h ii regions these massive stars produce supernova explosions resulting in expanding remnants that interact powerfully with surrounding gas these outbursts trigger a chain reaction of star building that spreads throughout gaseous region only when available gas is nearly consumed or dispersed does starburst activity end are often associated with merging or interacting galaxies prototype example of such a starburst forming interaction is m82 which experienced a close encounter with larger irregular galaxies often exhibit spaced knots of starburst activity active galaxy thumb right 200px a jet of particles is being emitted from core of elliptical radio galaxy a portion of observable galaxies are classified as active galaxies if galaxy contains an active galactic nucleus agn a significant portion of total energy output from galaxy is emitted by active galactic nucleus instead of stars dust and interstellar medium of galaxy standard model for an active galactic nucleus is based upon an accretion disc that forms around a supermassive black hole smbh at core region of galaxy radiation from an active galactic nucleus results from gravitational energy of matter as it falls toward black hole from disc in about 10 of these galaxies a diametrically opposed pair of energetic jets ejects particles from galaxy core at velocities close to speed of light mechanism for producing these jets is not well understood seyfert galaxies or quasars are classified depending on luminosity are active galaxies that emit high energy radiation in form of x rays blazars blazars are believed to be an active galaxy with a relativistic jet that is pointed in direction of earth a radio galaxy emits radio frequencies from relativistic jets a unified model of these types of active galaxies explains their differences based on viewing angle of observer liners possibly related to active galactic nuclei as well as starburst regions are low ionization nuclear emission line regions liners emission from liner type galaxies is dominated by weakly ionized elements excitation sources for weakly ionized lines include post agb stars agn and shocks approximately one third of nearby galaxies are classified as containing liner nuclei seyfert galaxy seyfert galaxies are one of two largest groups of active galaxies along with quasars they have quasar like nuclei very luminous distant and bright sources of electromagnetic radiation with very high surface brightnesses but unlike quasars their host galaxies are clearly detectable seyfert galaxies account for about 10 of all galaxies seen in visible light most seyfert galaxies look like normal spiral galaxies but when studied under other wavelengths luminosity of their cores is equivalent to luminosity of whole galaxies size of milky way quasar quasars or quasi stellar radio sources are most energetic and distant members of active galactic nuclei quasars are extremely luminous and were first identified as being high redshift sources of electromagnetic energy including radio waves and visible light that appeared to be similar to stars rather than extended sources similar to galaxies their luminosity can be 100 times greater than that of milky way luminous infrared galaxy luminous infrared galaxies or lirgs are galaxies with luminosities measurement of brightness above 1011 l lirgs are more abundant than starburst galaxies seyfert galaxies and quasi stellar objects at comparable total luminosity infrared galaxies emit more energy in infrared than at all other wavelengths combined a s luminosity is 100 billion times that of our sun properties magnetic fields galaxies have magnetic fields of their own they are strong enough to be dynamically important they drive mass inflow into centers of galaxies they modify formation of spiral arms and they can affect rotation of gas in outer regions of galaxies magnetic fields provide transport of angular momentum required for collapse of gas clouds and hence formation of new stars typical average equipartition strength for spiral galaxies is about 10 mg or 1 nt for comparison earth s magnetic field has an average strength of about 0 3 g gauss or 30 mt radio faint galaxies like m 31 and m 33 our milky way s neighbors have weaker fields about 5 mg while gas rich galaxies with high star formation rates like m 51 m 83 and ngc 6946 have 15 mg on average in prominent spiral arms field strength can be up to 25 mg in regions where cold gas and dust are also concentrated strongest total equipartition fields 50 100 mg were found in starburst galaxies for example in m 82 and antennae and in nuclear starburst regions for example in centers of ngc 1097 and of other barred galaxies formation and evolution galactic formation and evolution is an active area of research in astrophysics formation align right thumb artist s impression of a forming in early universe current cosmological models of early universe are based on big bang theory about 300 000 years after this event atoms of hydrogen and helium began to form in an event called recombination nearly all hydrogen was neutral non ionized and readily absorbed light and no stars had yet formed as a result this period has been called dark ages it was from density fluctuations or anisotropic irregularities in this primordial matter that larger structures began to appear as a result masses of baryonic matter started to condense within cold dark matter halos these primordial structures would eventually become galaxies we see today thumb right 200px artist s impression of a young galaxy accreting material early galaxies evidence for early appearance of galaxies was found in 2006 when it was discovered that galaxy iok 1 has an unusually high redshift of 6 96 corresponding to just 750 million years after big bang and making it most distant and primordial galaxy yet seen while some scientists have claimed other objects such as abell 1835 have higher redshifts and therefore are seen in an earlier stage of universe s evolution iok 1 s age and composition have been more reliably established in december 2012 astronomers reported that is most distant object known and has a redshift value of 11 9 object estimated to have existed around 380 million years after big bang which was about 13 8 billion years ago is about 13 42 billion light travel distance years away existence of such early protogalaxies suggests that they must have grown in so called dark ages as of may 5 2015 galaxy egs zs8 1 is most distant and earliest galaxy measured forming 670 million years after big bang light from egs zs8 1 has taken 13 billion years to reach earth and is now 30 billion light years away because of expansion of universe during 13 billion years early galaxy formation thumb different components of near infrared background light detected by hubble space telescope in deep sky surveys detailed process by which early galaxies formed is an open question in astrophysics theories can be divided into two categories top down and bottom up in top down correlations such as eggen lynden bell els model protogalaxies form in a large scale simultaneous collapse lasting about one hundred million years in bottom up theories such as searle zinn sz model small structures such as globular clusters form first and then a number of such bodies accrete to form a larger galaxy once protogalaxies began to form and contract first halo stars called population iii stars appeared within them these were composed almost entirely of hydrogen and helium and may have been massive if so these huge stars would have quickly consumed their supply of fuel and became supernovae releasing heavy elements into interstellar medium this first generation of stars re ionized surrounding neutral hydrogen creating expanding bubbles of space through which light could readily travel in june 2015 astronomers reported evidence for population iii stars in cosmos redshift 7 galaxy at such stars are likely to have existed in very early universe i e at high redshift and may have started production of chemical elements heavier than hydrogen that are needed for later formation of planets and life as we know it evolution within a billion years of a galaxy s formation key structures begin to appear globular clusters central supermassive black hole and a galactic bulge of metal poor population ii stars form creation of a supermassive black hole appears to play a key role in actively regulating growth of galaxies by limiting total amount of additional matter added during this early epoch galaxies undergo a major burst of star formation during following two billion years accumulated matter settles into a galactic disc a galaxy will continue to absorb infalling material from high velocity clouds and dwarf galaxies throughout its life this matter is mostly hydrogen and helium cycle of stellar birth and death slowly increases abundance of heavy elements eventually allowing formation of planets evolution of galaxies can be significantly affected by interactions and collisions mergers of galaxies were common during early epoch and majority of galaxies were peculiar in morphology given distances between stars great majority of stellar systems in colliding galaxies will be unaffected however gravitational stripping of interstellar gas and dust that makes up spiral arms produces a long train of stars known as tidal tails examples of these formations can be seen in ngc or antennae galaxies milky way galaxy and nearby andromeda galaxy are moving toward each other at about 130 km s and depending upon lateral movements two might collide in about five to six billion years although milky way has never collided with a galaxy as large as andromeda before evidence of past collisions of milky way with smaller dwarf galaxies is increasing such large scale interactions are rare as time passes mergers of two systems of equal size become less common most bright galaxies have remained fundamentally unchanged for last few billion years and net rate of star formation probably also peaked approximately ten billion years ago future trends spiral galaxies like milky way produce new generations of stars as long as they have dense molecular clouds of interstellar hydrogen in their spiral arms elliptical galaxies are largely devoid of this gas and so form few new stars supply of star forming material is finite once stars have converted available supply of hydrogen into heavier elements new star formation will come to an end current era of star formation is expected to continue for up to one hundred billion years and then stellar age will wind down after about ten trillion to one hundred trillion years 1013 1014 years as smallest longest lived stars in our universe tiny red dwarfs begin to fade at end of stellar age galaxies will be composed of compact objects brown dwarfs white dwarfs that are cooling or cold black dwarfs neutron stars and black holes eventually as a result of gravitational relaxation all stars will either fall into central supermassive black holes or be flung into intergalactic space as a result of collisions larger scale structures deep sky surveys show that galaxies are often found in groups and clusters solitary galaxies that have not significantly interacted with another galaxy of comparable mass during past billion years are relatively scarce only about 5 of galaxies surveyed have been found to be truly isolated however these isolated formations may have interacted and even merged with other galaxies in past and may still be orbited by smaller satellite galaxies isolated term field galaxy is sometimes used to mean an isolated galaxy although same term is also used to describe galaxies that do not belong to a cluster but may be a member of a group of galaxies can produce stars at a higher rate than normal as their gas is not being stripped by other nearby galaxies on largest scale universe is continually expanding resulting in an average increase in separation between individual galaxies see hubble s law associations of galaxies can overcome this expansion on a local scale through their mutual gravitational attraction these associations formed early in universe as clumps of dark matter pulled their respective galaxies together nearby groups later merged to form larger scale clusters this on going merger process as well as an influx of infalling gas heats inter galactic gas within a cluster to very high temperatures reaching 30 100 about 70 80 of mass in a cluster is in form of dark matter with 10 30 consisting of this heated gas and remaining few percent of matter in form of galaxies most galaxies in universe are gravitationally bound to a number of other galaxies these form a fractal like hierarchical distribution of clustered structures with smallest such associations being termed groups a group of galaxies is most common type of galactic cluster and these formations contain a majority of galaxies as well as most of baryonic mass in universe to remain gravitationally bound to such a group each member galaxy must have a sufficiently low velocity to prevent it from escaping see virial theorem if there is insufficient kinetic energy however group may evolve into a smaller number of galaxies through mergers clusters of galaxies consist of hundreds to thousands of galaxies bound together by gravity clusters of galaxies are often dominated by a single giant elliptical galaxy known as brightest cluster galaxy which over time tidally destroys its satellite galaxies and adds their mass to its own superclusters contain tens of thousands of galaxies which are found in clusters groups and sometimes individually at supercluster scale galaxies are arranged into sheets and filaments surrounding vast empty voids above this scale universe appears to be same in all directions isotropic and homogeneous milky way galaxy is a member of an association named local group a relatively small group of galaxies that has a diameter of approximately one milky way and andromeda galaxy are two brightest galaxies within group many of other member galaxies are dwarf companions of these two galaxies local group itself is a part of a cloud like structure within virgo

wavelength observation peak radiation of most stars lies in visible spectrum so observation of stars that form galaxies has been a major component of optical astronomy it is also a favorable portion of spectrum for observing ionized h ii regions and for examining distribution of dusty arms dust present in interstellar medium is opaque to visual light it is more transparent to far infrared which can be used to observe interior regions of giant molecular clouds and galactic cores in great detail infrared is also used to observe distant red shifted galaxies that were formed much earlier in

ionized matter in early universe that later collapsed to form galaxies ultraviolet and x ray telescopes can observe highly energetic galactic phenomena ultraviolet flares are sometimes observed when a star in a distant galaxy is torn apart from tidal forces of a nearby black hole distribution of hot gas in galactic clusters can be mapped by x rays existence of supermassive black holes at cores of galaxies was confirmed through x ray astronomy see also dark galaxy galactic orientation galaxy formation and evolution illustris project list of galaxies list of nearest galaxies luminous infrared
