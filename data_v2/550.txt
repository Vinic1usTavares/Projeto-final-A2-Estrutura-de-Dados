structures such as golden gate bridge that have foundations on rock that is largely serpentine rising out of foundation are concrete core and large tall columns of steel reinforced concrete called outriggers core is attached to outrigger columns by diagonal steel buckling restrained braces which are designed to dissipate energy during an earthquake through controlled hysteretic behavior this type of advanced seismic system performs in a manner similar to that of shock absorbers braces are also encased in concrete and steel to further mitigate risk of buckling and strength loss also of note is controlled rocking system which features vertical post tensioning which runs height of building through ducts within reinforced concrete shear wall core many of these technologies used in one rincon hill south tower have never before been applied in united states water tanks at top of building is a large tuned sloshing damper which holds up to 50 000 gallons 189 250 litres of water and

harrison streets b building height and number of floors varies depending on measuring location and whether five underground levels lobby and topmost two mechanical levels are included in measurement sources like corresponding skyscraperpage thread list tower at tall with 60 floors leaving out topmost two levels source however san francisco project rundown thread on same site lists tower at with only 55 floors omitting five underground and topmost two non residential levels source emporis lists building at 605 feet 184 m and omits lobby level in addition to seven nonresidential levels from floor count leading to a count of 54 floors source another site gives no height figure but mentions tower has 62 levels source at least one san francisco chronicle article states building is tall with 62 levels which includes seven nonresidential levels source however another chronicle article uses a different measuring location stating that south tower has and 60 floors source see also list of
