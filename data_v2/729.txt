transport in union of soviet socialist republics ussr was an important part of nation s economy economic centralisation of late 1920s and 1930s led to development of infrastructure at a massive scale and rapid pace before soviet union s collapse in 1991 there were a wide variety of modes of transport by land water and air however because of government policies before during and after era of stagnation investments in transport were low by late 1970s and early 1980s soviet economists were calling for construction of more roads to alleviate some of strain from railways and to improve state budget civil aviation industry represented by aeroflot was largest in world but inefficiencies plagued it until ussr s collapse road network remained underdeveloped and dirt roads were common outside major cities at same time attendance of few roads they had were ill equipped to handle this growing problem by late 1980s after death of leonid brezhnev his successors tried without success to solve these problems at same time automobile industry was growing at a faster rate than construction of new roads by mid 1970s only 0 8 percent of soviet population owned a car despite improvements several aspects of transport sector were still riddled with problems due to outdated infrastructure lack of investment corruption and bad decision making by central authorities demand for transport infrastructure and services was rising but soviet authorities proved to be unable to meet growing demand of people underdeveloped soviet road network in a chain reaction led to a growing demand for public transport nation s merchant fleet was one of largest in world civil aviation thumb right area in front of airport building dnepropetrovsk ukraine 1974 ministry of civil aviation was according to air code of ussr responsible for all air transport enterprises and airlines established by it soviet civil air transport was largest by total destinations and vehicles during most of its post war existence in ussr aeroflot had a monopoly on all air transport this ranged from civil and cargo transport to transporting political prisoners to gulags and more soviet union covered over one sixth of entire earth s landmass and in early 1920s its government decided to invest in aviation industry they concluded that expanding it in soviet union would not only make travel more efficient and faster it would also help build and develop mostly farmland enormously spread out nation that it was at this time most travel required taking trains or as was often case by off road travel in cars buses or trucks matthew sagers and thomas maraffa soviet air passenger transportation network geographical review 80 1990 266 267 many of northern and eastern territories in soviet union were completely inaccessible during much of year most of these vast expanses of land lacked roads and railroads because of huge distances between them and nearest population centers practically uninhabitable weather

equipment was available to use for road construction making process even more daunting consequently soviet government concluded that building a series of airports scattered throughout more isolated parts of country would be far more economically efficient than to build thousands of miles of road and railways soviet government decided therefore that air travel would be best means of

increasing services from moscow to capitals of other soviet republics ever growing soviet air transportation network began to shrink railroad s importance in soviet nations as years passed soviet regime recognized aviation industry s increasing value and officials in transportation planning attempted to establish regular air service to nearly every city in union by 1968 after soviet engineers

of of which were electrified as quality of rail transport continued to deteriorate in part because of russian civil war some within soviet leadership claimed that railways were not sustainable if continued to increase those who advocated for an enlargement of rail transport felt that increased investment and lengthening of already established rail tracks could solve ongoing congestion crisis davies harrison and wheatcroft 1994 p 159 60 majority agreed on increasing investments but there was no clear consensus on how these investments were to be used there were even some who believed in recapitalisation of railways economists in meantime advocated for rationalisation of railways coupled with tariffs based on actual cost which would reduce traffic demand and provide funds for investment leadership was unable to reach a conclusion and rail system continued to deteriorate in 1931 in a central committee cc resolution it was decided that increased investments coupled with introduction of newer trains could solve crisis this resolution was never carried out and yet again system continued to deteriorate davies harrison and wheatcroft 1994 p 160 central committee ordered lazar kaganovich to solve railway crisis in 1935 kaganovich first prioritised bottleneck areas over other less traveled areas his second priority was investing in heavy traffic lines and thirdly least efficient areas of rail network were left to themselves davies harrison and wheatcroft 1994 p 160 61 another problem facing rail transport was massive industrialisation efforts pushed on by authorities industrialisation proved to be a heavy burden on railways and vyacheslav molotov and kaganovich even admitted this to 18th party congress even so soviet government continued their industrialisation efforts to better prepare themselves for a future war with germany which became reality in 1941 davies harrison and wheatcroft 1994 p 162 63 thumb right russian locomotive class u u

surpassing most of its first world counterparts soviet railway system was growing in size at a rate of 639 km a year from 1965 to 1980 while growth of rail transport in first world countries was either decreasing or stagnating this steady growth in rail transport can be explained by country s need to extract its natural resources most of which were located close to or in siberia while some problems with railways had been reported by soviet press soviet union could boast of controlling one of most electrified railway systems at time during much of country s later lifespan trains usually carried coal oil construction material mostly stone cement and sand and timber oil and oil products were one of key reasons for building railway infrastructure in siberia in first place wilson 1983 p 201 efficiency of railways improved over time and by 1980s it had many performance indicators superior to that of united states pp 17 nye o transporta sssr i ssha comparative data about development of transportation in ussr and usa by 1980s soviet railways had become most intensively used in world most soviet citizens did not own private transport and if they did it was difficult to drive long distances due to poor conditions of many roads another explanation has to do with soviet policy first being autarkic model created by joseph stalin s regime stalin s regime had little interest in rail transport or any other form for transport and instead focused most of country s investments in rapid industrialisation stalin s regime was not interested in establishing new railway lines but decided to conserve and later expand much of existing railways left behind by tsars however as lev a first deputy premier of soviet union noted in a speech to supreme soviet of soviet union in 1989 railway sector was main negative sector of economy in 1989 as industrial output declined in late 1980s so did demand for transportation which led to a decline in freight transport in return rail transit soviet rapid transit system was seen as quickest cleanest and cheapest way of urban transport and eventually another point acquired greater significance authorities could allocate their resources from automobile industry to rapid transit sector and save a substantial volume of country s diesel and petrol because rapid transit system usually were cheaper to operate and less energy consuming soviet authorities managed to construct 20 rapid transits nationwide wilson 1983 p 205 with a further nine in construction when soviet union collapsed wilson 1983 p 205 6 twenty other stations were under construction in 1985 wilson 1983 p 206 country s rapid transit system was most intensively used in world road network soviet union had a road network of of which were paved and were dirt roads road transport played a minor role in soviet economy compared to domestic rail transport or first world road transport according to historian martin crouch road traffic of goods and passengers combined was only 14 percent of volume of rail transport it was only late in its existence that soviet authorities put emphasis on road construction and maintenance because of vital role road transport usually played in regional economies of ussr road transport was of vital importance to agriculture mining and construction industry but it also played a significant role in urban economy road network had problems meeting people s demand a problem which soviet leadership publicly acknowledged a resolution by central committee laid down a plan for improvement in planning organisation and efficiency of local road transport enterprises ambler shaw and symons 1985 p 165 freight transport by motor vehicles commonly called motor transport by soviet authorities due to underdeveloped nature of nation s road network was of considerable significance to certain areas of economy in 1980s there were 13 million laborers employed in transport sector of those about 8 5 million were employed in motor transport inter city freight transport remained underdeveloped during whole soviet epoch with it constituting less than 1 percent of motor borne freight average these developments can again be blamed on cost and administrative inefficiencies road transport as a whole lagged far behind that of rail transport average distance moved by motor transport in 1982 was while average for railway transport was 930 km per ton and 435 km per ton for water freight in 1982 there was a threefold increase in investment since 1960 in motor freight transport and more than a increase since 1940 inter city transport and volume of road freight transport had also increased significantly ambler shaw and symons 1985 p 166 motor transport was much cheaper and flexible over short distances defined as less than 200 km than rail transport there were many soviet economists who argued that transferring some 100 million tons from railways to road transport would save up to 120 million rubles but in 1975 road transport was 27 times more expensive than railway transport due to long distances between starting points and destinations ambler shaw and symons 1985 p 166 67 deteriorating quality of roads was due to bad attendance and then ongoing growth in road transport made it even harder for soviet authorities to focus their resources on attendance and maintenance projects transport of freight by road had increased by 4 400 percent in past thirty years while growth of hardcore surfaced roads had grown only by 300 percent growth of motor vehicles had increased by 224 percent in 1980s while hardcore surfaced roads only increased by 64 percent as soviet economists in early to mid 1980s said soviet union had 21 percent of world s industrial output but only a meager 7 percent of world s top quality roads eleventh five year plan 1981 85 spanned through rules of leonid brezhnev yuri andropov and konstantin chernenko called for construction of an additional 80 000 km hardcore surfaced roads but this was far from adequate in solving serious shortage and planners needed to build at least twice as many roads to meet consumer demand another obstacle was that five year plans in ussr s later life were rarely fulfilled due to economic malfunctions many roads were not paved and because of this shortage several dirt roads were created ambler shaw and symons 1985 p 167 by 1975 only 0 8 percent of households owned a car ambler shaw and symons 1985 p 168 productions of cars however had increased dramatically in late 1970s from 1924 to 1971 ussr produced 1 million vehicles and government passed another milestones five years later when it had produced 2 million vehicles ambler shaw and symons 1985 p 169 bus transport only a very small proportion of population in ussr owned cars because of widespread lack of any mode of private transport most soviet citizens travelled via public transport due to a relative shortage of cars and good quality roads soviet people travelled twice as much by bus train and rapid transit as people in first world international monetary fund and oecd 1991 p 56 soviet bus transport throughout most of history of soviet union was controlled either by regional or republican branches of ministry of transport since rail transit systems were more environmental and consumed little fuel soviet planners concentrated their efforts in constructing electricity driven
