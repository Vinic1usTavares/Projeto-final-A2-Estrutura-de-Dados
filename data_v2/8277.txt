purana krishna stories have played a key role in history of indian theatre music and dance particularly through tradition of these are dramatic enactments of krishna s childhood adolescence and adulthood one common scene involves krishna playing flute in rasa leela only to be heard by certain gopis maidens which is theologically supposed to represent divine call only heard by certain enlightened beings some of text s legends have inspired secondary theatre literature such as eroticism in gita govinda graham 2007 encyclopedia of love in world religions editor greenberg pages 247 249 krishna related literature such as bhagavata purana accords a metaphysical significance to performances and treats them as religious ritual infusing daily life with spiritual meaning thus

history of sanskrit literature with possible exception of ramayana krishna outside of hinduism left thumb radha krishna jainism jainism tradition lists 63 salakapurusa or notable figures which amongst others includes twenty four tirthankaras spiritual teachers and nine sets of triads one of these triads is krishna as vasudeva balarama as baladeva and jarasandha as prati vasudeva in each age of jain cyclic time is born a vasudeva with an elder brother termed baladeva between triads baladeva upholds principle of non violence a central idea of jainism villain is prati vasudeva who attempts to destroy world to save world vasudeva krishna has to forsake non violence principle and kill prati vasudeva stories of these triads can be found in harivamsa purana 8thcentury ce of jinasena not be confused with its namesake addendum to mahabharata and charita of hemachandra see jerome h bauer hero of wonders hero in deeds vasudeva krishna in jaina in story of krishna s life in puranas of jainism follows same general outline as those in hindu texts but in details they are very different they include jain tirthankaras as characters in story and generally are polemically critical of krishna unlike versions found in mahabharata bhagavata purana and vishnu purana for example krishna loses battles in jain versions and his gopis and his clan of yadavas die in a fire created by an ascetic named similarly after dying from hunter jara s arrow jaina texts state krishna goes to third hell in jain cosmology while his brother is said to go to sixth heaven vimalasuri is attributed to be author of jain version of harivamsa purana but no manuscripts have been found that confirm this it is likely that later jain scholars probably jinasena of 8thcentury wrote a complete version of krishna legends in jain tradition and credited it to ancient vimalasuri partial and older versions of krishna story are available in jain literature such as in dasao of svetambara agama tradition in other jain texts krishna is stated to be a cousin of twenty second tirthankara neminatha jain texts state that taught krishna all wisdom that he later gave to arjuna in bhagavad gita according to jeffery d long a professor of religion known for his publications on jainism this connection between krishna and neminatha has been a historic reason for jains to accept read and cite bhagavad gita as a spiritually important text celebrate krishna related festivals and intermingle with hindus as spiritual cousins buddhism thumb upright depiction of krishna playing flute in a temple constructed in

devaki or vasudeva sk govardhana baladeva balarama and kanha or kesava sk krishna keshava like jaina versions of krishna legends buddhist versions such as one in ghata jataka follow general outline of story but are different from hindu versions as well for example buddhist legend describes devagabbha devaki to have been isolated in a palace built upon a pole after she is born so no future husband could reach her krishna s father similarly is described as a powerful king but who meets up with devagabbha anyway and to whom kamsa gives away his sister devagabbha in marriage siblings of krishna are not killed by kamsa though he tries in buddhist version of legend all of krishna s siblings grow to maturity krishna and his siblings capital becomes arjuna and krishna interaction is missing in jataka version a new legend is included wherein krishna laments in uncontrollable sorrow when his son dies and a feigns madness to teach krishna a lesson jataka tale also includes an internecine destruction among his siblings after they all get drunk krishna also dies in buddhist legend by hand of a hunter named jara but while he is traveling to a frontier city mistaking krishna for a pig jara throws a spear that fatally pierces his feet causing krishna great pain and then his death at end of this ghata jataka discourse buddhist text declares that sariputta one of revered disciples of buddha in buddhist tradition was incarnated as krishna in his previous life to learn lessons on grief from buddha in his prior rebirth while buddhist jataka texts co opt krishna vasudeva and make him
