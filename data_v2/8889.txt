would likely have become second player after babe ruth with 2 000 rbi and would have exceeded 500 career home runs had he not served in military his lowest full season rbi output before war was 72 in 1942 and as he needed only 49 rbi to reach 2 000 for his full career he certainly would have exceeded 2 000 rbi by playing without injury in 1945 his home run production is a different story and it is
