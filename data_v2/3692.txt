geastrum quadrifidum commonly known as rayed earthstar or four footed earthstar is an inedible species of mushroom belonging to genus geastrum or earthstar fungi first described scientifically by christian hendrik persoon in 1794 g quadrifidum is a cosmopolitan but not common species of europe americas africa asia and australasia fungus is a feeding off decomposing organic matter present in soil and litter of coniferous forests small tough fruit bodies are grayish brown balls that are initially enclosed by a skin or peridium made up of four distinct layers of tissue outer tissue layer splits to form star like rays and expose a circular spore case inside spore case is gleba fertile spore producing tissue that is white and firm when young but becomes brown and powdery in age grayish brown spore case is set on a short slender stalk and has a well defined narrow pore at top where mature spores may escape fully expanded fruit body reaches dimensions up to wide and up to about tall outer skin is purplish brown with four or five cream or yellowish brown colored rays that have their tips stuck in substrate there is a flat mat of interwoven mycelia between ray tips spores are spherical warty and have a diameter of up to 6 um geastrum quadrifidum is one of a number of earthstars whose rays arch downward as they mature lifting spore sac upward high enough to catch air currents that disseminate spores into new habitats species is easily confused with geastrum fornicatum a larger earthstar without a well defined pore mouth taxonomy and naming dutch mycologist christian hendrik persoon published first official description of geastrum quadrifidum in 1794 and later sanctioned this name in his 1801 synopsis methodica fungorum as geastrum quadrifidum var minus a variety now considered synonymous with g quadrifidum although species had been previously described as lycoperdon by jacob christian schaeffer 1763 and giovanni antonio scopoli 1772 then afterward as geaster coronatus by joseph schroter 1889 epithet coronatus is not to be used because of existence of sanctioned name in japan g quadrifidum has occasionally been called geastrum minus pers g cunn for example as in imai 1936 within taxonomical terminology this usage is an auctorum non a misapplication or misinterpretation of species name according to stanek s classification of genus geastrum a classification later endorsed in sunhede s 1989 monograph of european geastrum species g quadrifidum belongs in subsection of section perimyceliata a grouping of similar geastrum species that incorporate and encrust debris in mycelial layer and have an even peristome opening that is fibrillose made of more or less parallel thin thread like filaments several common names for g quadrifidum have been suggested including rayed earthstar four pointed earthstar and four footed earthstar samuel frederick gray called it four cut shell puff in his 1821 natural arrangement of british plants but name was not adopted by subsequent authors specific epithet quadrifidum is derived from latin and means four forks description thumb left closeup of spore sac showing detail of peristome above and supporting stalk below as in all geastrum fungi internal spore producing gleba is enclosed in peridium a protective structure composed of four layers of tissue an inner endoperidium and outer exoperidium that may further be divided into an external mycelial a tough and membranous middle fibrillose layer and an internal fleshy layer known as immature unopened fruit body is roughly spherical to somewhat flattened or irregular in shape it lies partly or wholly submerged encrusted with debris expanded fruit body is usually taller than it is wide about high with mycelial cup included about exoperidium outer tissue layer of four layered peridium splits in middle into three to six but usually four or five rays exoperidium is typically fornicate a structural feature that arises when separates from exoperidium adhering only at edge in this way endoperidium internal tissue layer that encloses spore sac is lifted upwards with downward movement of rays in this species tips of rays remain attached to mycelial layer which remain attached to substrate as a cup in ground unlike those of some other geastrum species rays of g quadrifidum are not hygroscopic they do not open and close in response to changes in humidity generally rays are broad but they may seem narrow as their edges are often rolled inwards width of exoperidium when still attached to mycelial cup is when fully expanded about pseudoparenchymatous layer when fresh is about thick initially whitish later turning beige to brownish sometimes over reddish tints and dark brown when old in newly expanded specimens this layer is covered with a thin layer of crystals and hyphae sometimes forming a pseudoparenchymatous cup or collar that often peels off in patches when dry shrunken and hard fibrous layer is papery to leathery inner side when free from pseudoparenchymatous remnants is almost white in age becoming dirty grayish white and sometimes greenish due to algae outer side is initially whitish somewhat glossy but in age becomes grayish white and dull mycelial layer has a whitish inner side and is strongly attached to litter on its outer side it persists for a long time 1 2 year old fruit bodies with intact mycelial cups have been found spore sac is variable in shape ranging from roughly spherical to egg shaped or irregular but it is usually taller than it is wide its diameter ranges between although it is most commonly between an apophysis a swelling on underside of spore sac is often present stalk is visible when pseudoparenchymatous layer has dried up and is short but distinct measuring tall color is variable in dry specimens it is whitish light beige beige gray smoky gray or brownish gray endoperidium in newly expanded fruit bodies is pruinose covered with a light beige to whitish powder of hyphae and crystalline matter this powder gradually disappears as fruit body ages its color is highly variable and both light and dark are present peristome a clearly demarcated region encircling opening of spore sac is distinctly delimited with a disc like to more or less conical shape it is lighter in color than spore sac and up to high in old specimens hyphae around peristome sometimes stick together to develop radial grooves color is variable but often of grayish or grayish brown tints often lighter than endoperidium columella sterile tissue usually originating in base of gleba extending into or through gleba is rather weak more or less columnar to club shaped emerging from a more or less bulge like continuation of stalk and intruding to about half or more into mature gleba mature gleba is dark brown g quadrifidum is inedible microscopic characteristics basidia of g quadrifidum have a basal clamp connection or they narrow into a hyphal part that ends at a clamp when they are young they are more or less ellipsoid to club shaped but in age they often become more or less bottle shaped ampullaceous or sometimes almost among other shapes when mature they measure 14 21 x 4 5 7 um excluding hyphal part hyphal part is less than 1 6 x 1 2 um sterigmata thin projections of basidia that attach to spore are 4 6 um long and mostly 1 1 5 um thick hyphae located immediately underneath basidia are thin walled 1 2 um wide provided with clamps and densely branched hyphae of plates are roughly parallel thin walled 1 2 um wide and provided with clamps which may be dilated thumb left spores are roughly spherical and have ornamentations on surface spores in mass are dark brown when mature they are spherical covered with warts or verrucae and measure 5 6 um in diameter including ornamentation spores often contain a drop of oil scanning electron microscopy reveals verrucae to be up to 0 8 um long conical to columnar processes with rounded to almost flattened tips apiculus part of a spore which attaches to sterigmata at end of a basidium is distinct with radiating ridge like processes young spore is first broadly egg shaped before becoming roughly spherical in maturity capillitium refers to coarse late maturing thick walled cells in gleba that develop pores or slits in their thick secondary walls capillitial hyphae are 1 5 9 5 um wide thick walled often with a narrow lumen and with or without surface ornamentation columella hyphae are 1 5 14 um wide occasionally wider up to 34 um thick walled often with narrow lumen single thin walled about 1 5 um wide hyphae with clamps can be observed endoperidial hyphae are densely interwoven thick walled and about 2 6 um wide whitish powder on newly expanded specimens consists of crystalline matter and thin walled 1 5 4 um wide branched hyphae with clamps peristome hyphae are thick walled 2 11 um wide pseudoparenchymatous layer is built up by bladder like thin walled hyphae of varying size on surface of newly expanded specimens crystals and thin walled hyphae of same kind as on endoperidium are present crystals are calcium oxalate dihydrate that have crystalline structure of a pyramid and are arranged singly or in loose aggregates 11 to 30 um in size fibrous layer has thick walled hyphae 1 5 4 um wide mycelial layer in inner very thin part seen as a glossy lining on fibrous layer of newly expanded fruit bodies consists of a dense web of thin walled 1 5 4 um wide clamped hyphae thick walled hyphae are also present measuring 2 11 sometimes up to 19 um wide outer part mycelial cup consists of thick walled branched and densely interwoven hyphae often with a narrow lumen that measure 1 5 4 um wide similar species geastrum quadrifidum is readily confused with g fornicatum which is larger up to and has smaller spores 4 5 mm in diameter sunhede 1989 p 209 geastrum minimum although small like g quadrifidum is distinguished by having more rays usually more than seven and it is not fornicate also its mycelial layer is attached to fibrous layer for a long time without forming a mycelial cup like g quadrifidum chilean species g does not have a clearly demarcated peristome geastrum quadrifidum is also similar to g dissimile g leptospermum and g welwitschii in its fruit body morphology especially rays endoperidial body and peristome geastrum dissimile differs from g quadrifidum by its often sulcate or silky fimbriate smooth peristome and slightly smaller spores 4 5 mm in diameter geastrum leptospermum can be distinguished from g quadrifidum by its smaller spores 2 3 mm in diameter and by its preference for growing in mosses on tree trunks g welwitschii differs from g quadrifidum by its epigeal mycelial cup with a felted or tufted outer surface and indistinctly delimited peristome distribution ecology and habitat although geastrum quadrifidum has a wide distribution it is not a common species european countries from which fungus has been reported include belgium denmark france germany montenegro norway poland and sweden in asia it has been collected in china and japan north american distribution extends from canada south to mexico and includes hawaii it is also found in australia and new zealand south africa and south america because of its rarity it has been placed on regional red lists of several european countries including montenegro denmark norway and poland like most earthstars g quadrifidum is a saprobic fungus and spends most of its life cycle as thin strands of mycelium deriving nutrients by decomposing leaf litter and similar detritus converting it to humus and mineralizing organic matter in soil fungal fruit bodies are generally found in coniferous woodland where they appear in summer and autumn in mexico it was found in tropical thorn forest and pine oak forest in summer in britain all collections have been made in beech forest on calcareous soil notes references
