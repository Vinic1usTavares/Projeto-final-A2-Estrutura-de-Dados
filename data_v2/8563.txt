history thumb left white pole road in casey before u s highway system came into being in 1926 roads in iowa were maintained and promoted by local organizations which sought to drive traffic into their communities two such organizations created virtually parallel routes connecting council bluffs and davenport via des moines routes southern great white way and northern river to river road eventually merged into whiteway 7 highway new route followed great white way from council bluffs to des moines and river to river road from des moines to davenport in 1926 whiteway 7 highway became us 32 which itself became us 6 in 1931 for a time us 6 was busiest highway in state after i 80 was built near us 6 portions of u s highway were moved onto interstate highway interest in original us 6 corridor has grown in 21st century by people who seek to drive traffic back into their communities great white way great white way was formed in 1910 by white pole auto club route was built along chicago rock island pacific railroad between council bluffs and des moines members of auto club painted poles along route white which lead route to be known as white pole road great white way passed through oakland atlantic adair de soto and valley junction in late 1912 great white way was extended east to davenport passing through pella oskaloosa washington and muscatine in 1913 when iowa state highway commission began registering named trails longer than great white way association paid 5 00 fee in dollars to become first official registered highway route on july 30 1914 when primary highway system was created great white way was assigned primary road no 2 in 2002 a group of residents from adair casey menlo stuart and dexter formed a new group to promote white pole road their intention was to bring visitors to their towns by diverting some traffic from nearby i 80 us 6 corridor to south and onto historic road poles were painted white up to high line along drive white pole road logo signs in each town give a short history of town and their founders river to river road river to river road rrr was also created in 1910 and also connected council bluffs and davenport via des moines this route however traveled a more northern route than great white way route passed through elk horn guthrie center adel des moines newton marengo iowa city and wilton route s origins trace back to 1909 10 winter season which brought on average of snow more than previous year which was followed by an unusually dry spring coupled with advent of ford model t many iowans complained about lack of good roads in state governor b f carroll convened a good roads convention on march 8 9 1910 to discuss condition of roads in his state it was then that route of rrr was decided among convention delegates further influencing river to river corridor was an announcement from american automobile association that annual glidden tour would pass through iowa gov carroll arranged for farmers who lived along route to drag all of road on saturday prior to tour s arrival at precisely 9 am work was finished in one hour when highway commission started accepting registered routes rrr association planned to register their route as soon as possible but miscommunication between association members and with highway commission delayed actual registration for years route became official on april 16 1918 when primary highway system was created river to river road was assigned primary road no 7 whiteway 7 highway in 1922 whiteway 7 highway association filed an application to register whiteway 7 highway with iowa state highway commission commission was concerned with whiteway 7 s similarity to great white way s name and route markings great white way was marked with a stripe while whiteway 7 would be marked with a stripe with a black circle containing a white seven another concern with new route was since its name contained number seven route would be assigned along primary road nos 2 and 7 on september 25 1922 highway commission gave great white way from des moines to council bluffs which would become part of whiteway 7 highway number 7 and gave river to river road s western half number 2 eight months later iowa state highway commission reversed course and restored primary road nos 2 and 7 to their original roadways although disappointed whiteway 7 highway association responded by removing number from their name on november 27 1925 route officially became whiteway highway u s numbered highways on november 11 1926 members of american association of state highway officials approved plan to create a system of interstate highways across country iowa s whiteway highway would take on designation of us 32 for four and a half years us 32 spanned from chicago to council bluffs meanwhile roosevelt highway association was pushing to have us 6 extended westward on june 8 1931 all of iowa portion of us 32 was absorbed into a newly extended us 6 which had previously connected erie pennsylvania and cape cod new us 6 also replaced us 38 in nebraska and colorado by end of 1937 us 6 extended from coast to coast at time it and us 30 were only cross country highways to bear a single route number across country when last segment of highway between adel and des moines was paved in 1931 us 6 became fourth paved road to cross state in early 1940s us 6 was most heavily traveled route in state state highway commission recorded that on average over 1900 vehicles used road per day at any rural point that compares to nearly 3000 vehicles using us 6 daily in 2012 on april 29 1947 iowa general assembly approved an act designating us 6 as grand army of republic highway a distinction route shares in other states governor robert d blue dedicated g a r highway at old capitol on september 28 1947 in attendance were last two surviving iowa veterans of civil war in 1950s iowa state highway commission began to straighten route a section of highway between grinnell and ladora was straightened which resulted in brooklyn and victor being bypassed between dexter and west des moines us 6 swapped alignments with iowa 90 in 1958 in 1961 us 6 was routed onto new interstate 80 from iowa 90 interchange to baxter exit currently exit 159 iowa 90 was extended onto old us 6 alignment however in 1967 those changes were reversed and us 6 was taken off i 80 and put back on road which had been iowa 90 iowa 90 was assigned section of us 6 between what s now exit 106 along i 80 and exit 69 along i 35 abandoned sections since 1970s portions of us 6 have been moved permanently onto i 80 first section between us 71 and adair was rerouted in 1972 abandoned section became an extended iowa 83 and cr g30 in adair county in 1980 three lengthy sections were moved onto interstate in western iowa between adair and dexter in central iowa between altoona and newton and in eastern iowa between wilton and davenport all three sections were originally kept as state highways but in 1991 when iowa department of transportation first showed new state highways designations on state highway map central section already had been turned over to polk and jasper counties western segment was numbered iowa 925 and eastern segment iowa 927 on july 1 2003 between dexter and adel were turned over to dallas county us 6 which had previously split away from i 80 at dexter exit was continued along i 80 to us 169 interchange at de soto and then along us 169 to adel former segments iowa 925 and iowa 927 were turned over to their respective counties as well major intersections references
