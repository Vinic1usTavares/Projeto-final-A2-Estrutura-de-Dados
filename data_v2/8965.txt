glover s pika ochotona gloveri is a species of mammal in family it was first described in 1922 by michael rogers oldfield thomas summer dorsal pelage is grayish rufous grayish brown or tea brown in colour winter pelage is similar to summer pelage but is lighter in tone endemic to china it is found in high altitudes of northeastern tibet southwestern qinghai western sichuan and northwestern yunnan it is a generalist herbivore and is known to construct haypiles it is rated as a species of least concern by international union for conservation of nature it is also regionally red listed as least concern in china taxonomy glover s pika was first described in 1922 by british zoologist michael rogers oldfield thomas in annals and magazine of natural history it belongs to subgenus there are three recognized subspecies o g brookei o g calloceps o g gloveri its taxonomic placement has been controversial and subject to change in 1951 ellerman and terence morrison scott assigned o g brookei as a subspecies of turkestan red pika ochotona but it is now treated as a subspecies of glover s pika pen et al in 1962 pika ochotona as a new form of glover s pika but it is now considered an independent species based on skull morphology glover s pika was earlier treated as a subspecies of turkestan red pika but it is now considered as an independent species based on skull morphology pelage color and zoogeography it had also been treated as a subspecies of chinese red pika ochotona partly because of its assignment under turkestan red pika according to morphological and molecular studies glover s pika is closely related to chinese red pika and two are sister groups in 1948 described species ochotona kamensis and explained it to be larger and more differentiated than chinese red pika and glover s pika in 1985 after observing striking similarities between their skull structures and coat colors feng and zheng synonymized ochotona kamensis with ochotona gloveri in 1988 however synonymized ochotona kamensis with ochotona gloveri brookei and retained name kamensis as she did not use principle of priority which recognizes first valid application of a name to a plant or animal description glover s pika measures in length and weighs it has a long skull with its dorsal side being arch shaped due to oblique backward sloping of parietal bone frontal bone protrudes forward slightly and has two oval alveoli above it summer dorsal pelage is grayish rufous grayish brown or tea brown in colour head is orange or pale brown from rostrum to frontal bone ears are large measuring in length are thin haired and light chestnut orange or orange brown colored winter pelage is similar to summer pelage but is lighter in tone ventral and upper portion of feet are dull gray or grayish white hindfeet are long anterior palatal foramen and palatal foramen are detached or adjoined nominate subspecies o g gloveri has a dark gray cheek and smoky yellow rostrum o g brookei has an orange russet tipped nose and light gray spotted above eyes glover s pika is similar to chinese red pika but it is distinguished by its smaller auditory bullae more slender rostrum and longer nasals than chinese red pika it also does not have reddish mantle as possessed by chinese red pika distribution and habitat glover s pika species is endemic to china it is found in high altitudes of northeastern tibet southwestern qinghai western sichuan and northwestern yunnan nominate subspecies o g gloveri is found in western sichuan o g brookei is found in southwestern qinghai and northeastern tibet and o g calloceps is found in northwestern yunnan and eastern tibet it is a rock dwelling pika which usually inhabits scree deposits and rocky clefts which is bordered by woodlands in most of its range it is also known to live in adobe walls of and villages and does not live in grazing or agricultural habitats it is typically found in high elevations ranging from from sea level but in sichuan it may occur at lower altitudes of behavior and ecology very little is known about glover s pika s behavior ecology and reproduction it is a generalist herbivore and is known to construct haypiles status and conservation since 1996 glover s pika is rated as a species of least concern on iucn red list of endangered species this is because it is a widespread species and it occurs in remote areas of china which are unlikely to be affected by human activities current state of its population trend is unclear as no natural historic or ecological investigation has been done on this species however being locally poisoned and trapped is a major threat to glover s pika populations it is also regionally red listed as a species of least concern in china references notes bibliography further reading external links category mammals of china category pikas category mammals described in 1922 category taxonomy articles created by polbot
