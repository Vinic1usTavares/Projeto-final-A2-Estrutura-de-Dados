rogue river in southwestern oregon in united states flows about in a generally westward direction from cascade range to pacific ocean known for its salmon runs whitewater rafting and rugged scenery it was one of original eight rivers named in wild and scenic rivers act of 1968 beginning near crater lake which occupies caldera left by explosive volcanic eruption of mount mazama river flows through geologically young high cascades and older western cascades another volcanic province further west river passes through multiple exotic terranes of more ancient klamath mountains in kalmiopsis wilderness section of rogue basin are some of world s best examples of rocks that form earth s mantle near mouth of river only dinosaur fragments ever discovered in oregon were found in otter point formation along coast of curry county people have lived along rogue river and its tributaries for at least 8 500 years european explorers made first contact with native americans indians toward end of 18th century and began beaver trapping and other activities in region clashes sometimes deadly occurred between natives and trappers and later between natives and european american miners and settlers these struggles culminated with rogue river wars of 1855 56 and removal of most of natives to reservations outside basin after war settlers expanded into remote areas of watershed and established small farms along river between grave creek and mouth of illinois river they were relatively isolated from outside world until 1895 when post office department added mail boat service along lower rogue as of 2010 rogue has one of two remaining rural mail boat routes in united states dam building and removal along rogue has generated controversy for more than a century an early fish blocking dam ament was dynamited by vigilantes mostly disgruntled salmon fishermen by 2009 all but one of main stem dams downstream of a huge flood control structure from river mouth had been removed aside

it averages about a year whereas at ashland which is inland it averages about average annual precipitation for entire basin is about most of this falls in winter and spring and summers are dry at high elevations in cascades much of precipitation arrives as snow and infiltrates permeable volcanic soils snowmelt contributes to stream flows in upper basin during dry months along illinois river in lower basin most of precipitation falls as rain on shallow soils rapid runoff leads to high flows during winter storms and low flows during dry summer average monthly temperatures for whole basin

nomadic hunters and gatherers radiocarbon dating suggests that they arrived in southwestern oregon at least 8 500 years ago and that at least 1 500 years before first contact with whites natives established permanent villages along streams home villages of various groups shared many cultural elements such as food clothing and shelter types intermarriage was common and many people understood dialects of more than one of three language groups spoken in region native americans indians included people near coast and further upstream groups of shasta costa takelma shasta and latgawa houses in villages varied somewhat but were often about wide and long framed with posts sunk into ground and covered with split sugar pine or red cedar planks people left villages during about half of year to gather camas bulbs sugar pine bark acorns and berries and hunted deer and elk to supplement their main food salmon total early 1850s native population of southern oregon including umpqua coos coquille and chetco watersheds as well as rogue is estimated to have been about 3 800 population before arrival of explorers and european diseases is thought to have been at least one third larger but there is insufficient evidence to estimate aboriginal populations prior to time of first white contact culture clash first recorded encounter between whites and coastal southwestern oregon indians occurred in 1792 when british explorer george vancouver anchored off cape blanco about north of mouth of rogue river and indians visited ship in canoes in 1826 alexander roderick mcleod of hudson s bay company

by michel laframboise was reported to have killed 11 rogue river natives and shortly thereafter a party led by an american trapper ewing young shot and killed at least two more name rogue river apparently began with french fur trappers who called river la riviere aux coquins because they regarded natives as rogues coquins in 1835 rogue river people killed four whites in a party of eight who were traveling from oregon to california two years later two of survivors and others on a cattle drive organized by young killed first two indians they met north of klamath river number of whites entering rogue river watershed greatly increased after 1846 when a party of 15 men led by jesse applegate developed a southern alternative to oregon trail new trail was used by emigrants headed for willamette valley later called applegate trail it passed through rogue and bear creek valleys and crossed cascade range between ashland and south of upper klamath lake from 90 to 100 wagons and 450 to 500 emigrants used new trail later in 1846 passing through rogue indian homelands between headwaters of bear creek and future site of grants pass and crossing rogue about downstream of it despite fears on both sides violence in watershed in 1830s and 1840s was limited indians seemed interested in speeding whites on their way and whites were happy to get through region without being attacked in 1847 whitman massacre and cayuse war in what became southeastern washington raised fears among white settlers throughout region and led to formation of large volunteer militias organized to fight indians though no whites were yet living in rogue river drainage along rogue tensions intensified in 1848 at start of california gold rush when hundreds of men from oregon territory passed through rogue valley on their way to sacramento river basin after indians attacked a group of returning miners along rogue in 1850 former territorial governor joseph lane negotiated a peace treaty with a leader of takelma indians it promised protection of indian rights and safe passage through rogue valley for white miners and settlers thumb right upright alt formal portrait showing head and shoulders

called jackson creek where they established a mining camp in 1852 at site of what later became jacksonville indian attacks on miners that year led to u s army intervention and fighting near table rock between indians and combined forces of professional soldiers and volunteer miner militias john p gaines new territorial governor negotiated a new treaty with some but not all of indian bands removing them from bear creek and other tributaries on south side of main stem at about same time more white emigrants including women and children were settling in region by 1852 about 28 donation land claims had been filed in rogue valley further clashes in 1853 led to treaty with rogue river 1853 that established table rock indian reservation across river from federal fort lane as white population increased and indian losses of land food sources and personal safety mounted bouts of violence upstream and down continued through 1854 55 culminating in rogue river war of 1855 56 suffering from cold hunger and disease on table rock reservation a group of takelma returned to their old village at mouth of little butte creek in october 1855 after a volunteer militia attacked them killing 23 men women and children they fled downriver attacking whites from gold hill to galice creek confronted by volunteers and regular army troops indians at first repulsed them however after nearly 200 volunteers launched an all day assault on remaining natives war ended at big bend at rm 35 or rk 56 on lower river by then fighting had also ended near coast where before retreating upstream a separate group of natives had killed about 30 whites and burned their cabins near what later became gold beach most of rogue river indians were removed in 1856 to reservations further north about 1 400 were sent to coast reservation later renamed siletz reservation to protect 400 natives still in danger of attack at table rock joel palmer oregon superintendent of indian affairs ordered their

were white gold miners married to native women from klamath river basin established gardens and orchards kept horses cows and other livestock and received occasional shipments of goods sent by pack mule over mountains until 1890s these settlers remained relatively isolated from outside world in 1883 one of settlers elijah h price proposed a permanent mail route by boat up rogue river from ellensburg later renamed gold beach to big bend about upstream route price told government would serve perhaps 11 families and no towns although post office department resisted idea for many years in early 1895 it agreed to a one year trial of water route established a post office at price s log cabin at big bend and named price postmaster price s job for which he received no pay during trial year included running post office and making sure that mail boat made one round trip a week he named new post office illahe name derives from chinook jargon word meaning land or earth propelled by rowing poling pushing pulling and sometimes by sail mail boat delivered letters and small packages including groceries from wedderburn where a post office was established later in 1895 in 1897 department established a post office near confluence of rogue and illinois rivers downriver from illahe postmaster named office agnes after his daughter but a transcription error added an extra s and name became

native americans living along rogue salmon migrations were so huge that early settlers claimed they could hear fish moving upstream these large runs continued into 20th century despite damage to spawning beds caused by gold mining in 1850s and large scale commercial fishing that began shortly thereafter fishing industry fed demands for salmon in growing cities of portland and san francisco

1897 he co operated with united states fish commission in building and operating an egg collecting station at mouth of elk creek on upper rogue in 1899 he built a hatchery near wedderburn across river from gold beach and until time of his death in 1908 he had salmon eggs shipped to it from elk creek station based on variations in size of yearly catch hume and others believed his methods of fish propagation to be successful however as salmon runs declined over time despite hatcheries recreational fishing interests began to oppose large scale operations in 1910 a state referendum banned commercial fishing on rogue but this decision was reversed in 1913 as fish runs continued to dwindle state legislature finally closed river to commercial fishing in 1935 as of 2010 oregon department
