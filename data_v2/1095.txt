elephant herpesviruses eehv or elephantid 1 1 is a type of herpesvirus which can cause a highly fatal hemorrhagic disease when transmitted to young asian elephants in african elephants related forms of these viruses which have been identified in wild populations are generally benign occasionally surfacing to cause small growths or lesions however some types of eehv can cause a highly fatal disease in asian elephants which kills up to 80 of severely affected individuals disease can be treated with rapid application of antiviral drugs but this has only been effective in around a third of cases first case of a fatal form of disease was documented in 1995 though tissue samples from as early as 1980s have since tested positive for virus and localized skin lesions in wild african elephants were recorded in 1970s since 1995 there have been over fifty documented disease cases in north america and europe of which only nine have been successfully cured those affected are mostly young animals born in captivity though a small number of older wild born adults held in zoos have died and a number of cases caused by same pathogenic type of eehv have been identified in both orphan and wild calves in asian elephant populations virus and transmission thumb 300px right donaldson a male asian elephant calf at whipsnade zoo died of eehv in may 2009 database entry at elephant se eehvs are members of genus a novel clade most closely related to mammalian that have been responsible for as many as 70 deaths of both zoo and wild asian elephants worldwide especially in young calves there are currently six known species types of and most commonly encountered and most pathogenic form eehv1 also has two chimeric subtypes 1a and 1b as well as numerous distinct strains eehv1a originally just known as eehv1 was first species type identified which causes an acute hemorrhagic disease with a very high mortality rate in asian elephants this form of virus was originally believed to occur naturally in african elephants occasionally producing skin nodules and to be transmitted to asian elephants within captivity but more extensive studies have since largely disproved this concept because several other species types of eehv e g eehv2 eehv3 and eehv6 instead have been identified in african elephants a second lethal subtype eehv1b was identified in asian elephants in 2001 eehv3 eehv4 and eehv5 have also each been responsible for deaths of at least one asian elephant calf eehv2 has caused hemorrhagic disease in several african elephants as reported by along with eehv3 and eehv6 it has also been found in pulmonary lymph nodes of several autopsied wild and zoo african elephants zong et al 2010 there are a further five or six species types and varieties of elephant found in eye and genital secretions of many healthy asian and african zoo elephants e g and also called elephantid and which are classified in subfamily rather than betaherpesvirinae these viruses are neither closely related to eehvs nor known cause of any disease symptoms studies have also detected both eehv1a and eehv1b as being shed in trunk wash secretions by healthy asymptomatic asian zoo elephant of calves that previously had disease and similarly for eehv5 thus similar to saliva for most human and animal herpesviruses trunk secretions may be a source of transmission for eehvs because of concerns about origins of eehv1 and evidence of cross species transmission for eehv3 long term contact between asian and african elephants has been discouraged along with avoiding new contacts between young captive born asian elephants and wild born asian elephants as latter may be carriers of disease an analysis of a number of north american cases which ruled out direct transmission of virus between any of affected facilities studied strongly supported idea of a significant asian carrier population this is supported by fact that some of deceased calves had no possible contact with any african elephants artificial insemination is not believed to be a transmission factor notes that when multiple calves of a single bull or cow elephant died at different times even at same facility they nearly all had distinct strains of virus yet when two calves died or became infected at same time at same facility pairs have always had identical virus strains a program of enzyme linked assay testing began in 2005 aiming to test blood samples from around a thousand elephants for antibodies to virus in order to help identify carriers and possible transmission patterns effects and treatment in benign infections found in some wild and captive african elephants these viruses can affect either skin or pulmonary system in former case it produces small pinkish nodules on head and trunk in juveniles which appear for a few weeks and then regress suggesting an intermittently reactivated localized infection that mostly remains dormant in second case it has been found in small white pulmonary nodules on necropsy of many asymptomatic adults these are both characteristic of eehv2 eehv3 and eehv6 in a fatal attack however it manifests very quickly in a number of cases death has occurred within 24 hours of onset of infection while other cases do not last longer than around five days virus attacks endothelial cells rupturing capillaries and causing blood loss and haemorrhaging once this reaches heart haemorrhage kills quickly through shock symptoms include lethargy and an unwillingness to eat a rapid heartbeat and decreased blood cell count as well as cyanosis of tongue mouth ulcers and oedema of head and trunk rapid treatment with famciclovir sustained for around a month has appeared to cure eight calves infected with eehv1 however this treatment is very expensive only partially effective and relies on early identification of infection a polymerase chain reaction test on a blood sample from affected animals will confirm a suspected case by identifying viral dna though it is now common to start famciclovir treatment at earliest possible moment rather than waiting for confirmation of case prior to development of test or in circumstances where it is not available disease may be misdiagnosed as any of a number of other conditions which have a quick onset leading to rapid death including and history virus has been identified in pulmonary nodules of african elephants as far back as 1970s first recognised fatal case of eehv in an asian elephant was identified at national zoo in washington d c in 1995 testing on stored tissue samples was able to identify a number of earlier deaths as being due to same virus these cases have so far been identified as early as 1983 since this date there have been a total of 54 more cases in north america and europe nine of which were successfully treated may 2009 deaths of two calves at whipsnade zoo were not included in this calculation this gives a fatality rate of over 80 among known symptomatic disease cases in cases where antiviral medication was applied treatment was effective in about one in three cases as of 2005 there were twelve cases where famciclovir had been used eight of which were fatal as a fraction of overall population it has been calculated that of 78 asian elephants born in captivity in north america between 1978 and 2007 19 are known to have died of eehv and five more were successfully treated with antiviral medication affected animals are mostly young asian elephants that had been born in captivity with half cases in north america being between ages of one and four years and three quarters between one and eight years old some cases have affected newborns or adult elephants born in wild oldest aged 40 years and three recorded cases have affected african elephants first documented fatal case for african elephants was an eleven month old male in 1996 since 2008 a number of cases have been attributed to eehv1 among wild asian elephants first suspected case in asia was in 1997 though it was not until fifth suspected case that presence of virus could be confirmed this case was reported in 2006 with death of a young wild born female calf at an elephant sanctuary in cambodia virus was identified as part of eehv1 group same as previously identified in north american and european captive populations in 2013 nine lethal cases from india were extensively characterized and found to consist of a wide variety of genetically diverged strains of eehv1a and eehv1b matching subtypes and genetic range of nearly all those found previously in europe and north america cases attributed to eehv1a and eehv4 have also been reported in thailand and there is both confirmed and anecdotal evidence for similar hemorrhagic disease deaths of between 16 and 30 more calves in asian countries including thailand india nepal myanmar and indonesia within past five years thus this is not just a disease of captive elephants but is endogenous to and possibly rampant in asian elephants in wild also further research has been noted as urgently required to study situation in regions with wild asian elephant populations on 12 june 2019 it was reported that in chester zoo 2 year old indian elephant calf hi way had fully recovered from eehv after numerous treatments over 2 weeks and that there is now hope of a vaccine for eehv references external links
