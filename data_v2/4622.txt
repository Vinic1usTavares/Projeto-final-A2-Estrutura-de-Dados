decided that a science fiction programme should fill gap head of script department donald wilson and writer c e webber contributed heavily to formatting of programme and co wrote programme s first format document with newman latter conceived idea of a time machine larger on inside than outside as well as central character of mysterious doctor and name doctor who production was initiated several months later and handed to producer verity lambert bbc s first female producer and story editor david whitaker to oversee after a brief period when show had been handled by a caretaker producer rex tucker casting and characters in webber s original production documents character of doctor referred to as dr who was a suspicious and malign character who hated scientists and inventors and had a secret intention to destroy or nullify future newman rejected this idea wanting character to be a father figure tucker offered role of doctor to hugh david having spent a year working on knight errant limited and not wanting to be tied to another series david turned down role tucker envisioned a young actor to play doctor with aged make up however lambert favoured an older actor to avoid preparation time and add authenticity to role part was turned down by actors leslie french cyril cusack alan webb and geoffrey bayldon cusack and webb were reluctant to work for a year on a series while bayldon wished to avoid another old man role lambert and director waris hussein invited william hartnell to play role after several discussions hartnell accepted viewing it as an opportunity to take his career in a new direction doctor s companion was originally named bridget or biddy a 15 year old girl eager for life her teachers were miss lola mcgovern a 24 year old timid woman capable of sudden courage and cliff a physically perfect strong and courageous man bridget was renamed suzan suzanne foreman later changed to susan and writer anthony coburn made her doctor s granddaughter to avoid any possibility of sexual impropriety implicit in having a young girl travelling with an older man newman was reluctant about idea as he wanted character to have human naivety miss mcgovern later became history teacher miss canning and susan s birth name briefly became when show s bible was written two teachers were renamed ian chesterton and barbara wright chesterton was much more violent in earlier drafts of script william russell was chosen to portray chesterton being only actor considered by lambert to do so tucker held auditions for roles of susan and barbara on 25 june 1963 actresses christa bergmann anne castaldini maureen crombie heather fleming camilla hasse waveney lee anna palk and anneke wills were all considered for role of susan while sally home phyllida law and penelope lee were considered for barbara following tucker s departure from production lambert was in talks with actress jacqueline lenya to play susan but role was ultimately given to carole ann ford a 23 year old who typically played younger roles lambert s friend jacqueline hill was chosen to play barbara writing programme was originally intended to open with a serial entitled giants written by webber but was scrapped by june 1963 as technical requirements of storyline which involved leading characters being drastically reduced in size were beyond their capabilities and story itself lacked necessary impact for an opener due to lack of scripts ready for production untitled second serial from coburn was moved to first in running order order change necessitated rewriting opening episode of coburn s script to include some introductory elements of webber s script for first episode of giants as a result webber received a co writer s credit for an unearthly child on internal bbc documentation coburn also made several significant original contributions to opening episode mostly notably that doctor s time machine should resemble a police box an idea he conceived after seeing a real police box while walking near his office filming right thumb 300px william hartnell and carole ann ford in original recording of first episode which was later scrapped due to technical issues several changes were made before final recording including character s costumes and mannerisms doctor s suit and tie was replaced with an edwardian outfit and he became more affectionate towards susan show remained unnamed in april 1963 simply referred to as saturday serial it was provisionally scheduled to begin recording on 5 july to be aired on 27 july but was delayed a pilot recording was scheduled to begin filming on 19 july if successful it could be broadcast on 24 august production was later deferred for a further two weeks while scripts were prepared and recording on 19 july was rescheduled as a test session for effect of tardis show s initial broadcast date was pushed back to 9 november with pilot recording scheduled for 27 september and regular episodes made from 18 october broadcast date was soon pushed back a week to 16 november due to bbc s athletics coverage on 9 november and later to 23 november show was granted a budget of ps2 300 per episode with an additional ps500 for construction of tardis tucker was originally selected as serial s director but task was assigned to hussein following tucker s departure from production some of pre filmed inserts for serial shot at ealing studios in september and october 1963 were directed by hussein s production assistant douglas camfield first version of opening episode was recorded at lime grove studios on evening of 27 september 1963 following a week of rehearsals however recording was bedevilled with technical errors including doors leading into tardis control room failing to close properly after viewing episode newman ordered that it be mounted again during weeks between two tapings changes were made to costuming effects performances and scripts second attempt at opening episode was recorded on 18 october with following three episodes being recorded weekly from 25 october to 8 november themes and analysis scholar mark bould discusses how serial establishes doctor who socio political stances in his 2008 essay science fiction television in united kingdom he writes story represents separation reunion capture escape pursuit evasion that will dominate next twenty six years as well as program s consistent advocacy of bbc s political and social liberalism he cites ian and barbara s attempt to teach a kindness friendship and democracy writing a tyrant is not as strong as whole tribe acting collectively scholar john r cook reflected in 1999 that presence of teachers as companions echoes doctor who original educational remit new scientist noted in 1982 that serial was set in stone age because show s original intention was to bring to life earth s history lawrence miles and tat wood argue that cavemen s focus on fire is meant to stand in for all technology thus linking latter three episodes with questions of generational change raised by first episode and its focus on suspicion of children and tying that to a discussion of technological progress including nuclear bomb they also argue that contrary to tendency to treat story as a one episode introduction to series followed by three episodes of running around and escaping that piece should be considered as a single dramatic whole that is about making four people who barely know one another learn to trust each other reception broadcast and ratings first episode was transmitted at 5 16p m on saturday 23 november 1963 assassination of american president john f kennedy previous day overshadowed launch of a new television series as a result first episode was repeated a week later on 30 november preceding second episode first episode was watched by 4 4 million viewers 9 1 of viewing audience and it received a score of 63 on appreciation index repeat of first episode reached a larger audience of six million viewers across its four episodes an unearthly child was watched by an average of 6 million 12 3 of potential viewers episodes 2 4 achieved ratings of 5 9 6 9 and 5 4 million viewers respectively mark bould suggests that a disappointing audience reaction and high production costs prompted bbc s chief of programmes to cancel series until daleks introduced in second serial in december 1963 were immediately popular with viewers serial has been repeated twice on bbc on bbc2 in november 1981 as part of repeat season five faces of doctor who achieving average audience figures of 4 3 million viewers and on bbc four as part of show s 50th anniversary on 21 november 2013 achieving an average of 630 000 viewers critical response serial received mixed reviews from television critics michael gower of daily mail wrote a short favourable review of first episode claiming that ending must have delighted hearts of who followed a reviewer in daily worker stated that they intend following closely to show describing ending as satisfying variety felt that script suffered from a glibness of characterisations which didn t carry burden of belief but praised effective camerawork noting that show will impress if it decides to establish a firm base in realism after second episode mary crozier of guardian was unimpressed by serial stating that it has fallen off badly soon after getting underway she felt that first episode got off ground predictably but there was little to thrill while second was a depressing sequel wigs and furry pelts and clubs were all ludicrous conversely marjorie norris of television today commented that if show keeps up high standard of first two episodes it will capture a much wider audience retrospective reviews are mostly positive towards an unearthly child referring to serial while discussing early years of doctor who in 1982 new scientists malcolm praised script acting and direction but criticised dated scenery in 2008 radio times reviewer patrick mulkern praised casting of hartnell moody direction and thrilling race back to tardis christopher bahn of a v club in 2010 labelled an unearthly child an essential serial to watch for background on programme in his review he noted that first episode is brilliantly done next three together could be about a half hour shorter but get job done he praised characters of ian barbara and mysterious doctor but noted that he was far from character he would become and susan was something of a cipher with hope she would develop later in a 2006 review dvd talk s john sinnott called first episode excellent but felt story goes down hill a bit with introduction of prehistoric time period he cited slower pace discussions in tarzan speak and lack of tension or high stakes commercial releases in print writer david whitaker omitted an unearthly child from first spin off novelisation doctor who in an exciting adventure with daleks later retitled doctor who and daleks and doctor who daleks with ian and barbara s entrance into tardis leading directly into an adaptation of second televised serial daleks historian james chapman highlights this as a reason that
