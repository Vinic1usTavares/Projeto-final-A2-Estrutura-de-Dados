his fellow resistance members had not even heard of their existence he sent a wire to london requesting that they should take over what remained of milorg rather than remaining passive during occupation only to step forward as leaders of milorg when war was over he became more critical when he became aware that they had started entering administration in london and stockholm according to him without necessary experience from practical fieldwork he was shocked at recklessness of one of them who arrived at one of their bases in trondheim concluding that they obviously had no idea about how strong infiltration really was in trondheim nor how we worked regional leadership that stepped forward after war was according to gjems onstad not identical with actual leadership of lark and milorg during war gjems onstad 1990 pp 117 119 historians have noted that it was very surprising that erling stepped forward as leader of home front in trondelag after german capitulation he had entered administration in stockholm in february 1945 but he had not been contacted whatsoever by lark decision of putting gjems onstad on sideline in march 1945 led him to become increasingly critical

situation at time he pointed to government fleeing country and what he considered pitiful reaction of prime minister johan nygaardsvold he also noted that while some of figures in quisling regime had acted out far too harshly some others had tried to maintain norway s interests against occupiers alternative of letting germans run country completely unopposed under josef could in his mind have
