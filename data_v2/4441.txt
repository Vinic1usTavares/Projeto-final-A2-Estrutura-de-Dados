somerset county cricket club competed in four domestic competitions during 2009 english cricket season first division of county championship friends provident trophy first division of natwest pro40 league and twenty20 cup through their performance in twenty20 cup team qualified for champions league twenty20 they enjoyed a successful season but fell short of winning any competitions prompting director of cricket brian rose to say we ve had enough of being cricket s nearly men consistent performances in county championship helped somerset remain challengers for competition until last few weeks of season but batting friendly pitch at their home ground county ground taunton meant that county finished with too many draws to claim their first championship title consistency was also key for somerset s success in one day cricket where they remained unbeaten in group stage of friends provident trophy but were eliminated in first knock out round and finished runners up by one point in natwest pro40 in twenty20 cup somerset finished as losing finalists this meant that they qualified for champions league twenty20 where they progressed into second group stage of competition they failed to win any matches in that phase of competition resulting in their elimination somerset were captained for third successive season by their australian overseas player justin langer who announced during season that it would be his last with somerset marcus trescothick topped national batting tables scoring almost 3 000 runs in all competitions in 2009 as a result he was named as both professional cricketers association pca player of year and pca s most valuable player of year background thumb right upright keith parsons one of somerset s most successful all rounders retired prior to 2009 season after promotion from second division of county championship in 2007 somerset were among first division title contenders in 2008 a loss to lancashire in final match of season meant they finished in fourth place david foot writing in wisden claimed that too many of somerset batsmen had lost their way in one day cricket as they narrowly avoided relegation in natwest pro40 and were eliminated in friends provident trophy somerset promoted four players from their academy for 2009 season giving contracts to jos buttler adam dibble chris jones and james burke of these only buttler appeared in first team during season they also signed david stiff a fast bowler capped at under 19 level for england on a two month contract at beginning of season which was later extended to end of season ian blackwell captain of side in 2005 and 2006 left for durham after coach andy hurry and captain justin langer made it clear that they regarded fitness as a priority john francis and keith parsons both retired at end of 2008 francis cited lack of first team opportunities for his departure while at age of 35 parsons declared that there comes a time when your body tells you it s time to pack in professional sport in his preview of 2009 season for espncricinfo andrew mcglashan identified somerset s opening partnerships with bat and ball as their main strengths but predicted that middle order would struggle to make an impact in county championship stating that none of middle order jump out as potential match winners in four day cricket he speculated that team s best chance of success would come in one day competitions daily telegraph provided a more positive outlook claiming that county had enough depth in batting and seam bowling to challenge for county championship again they identified spin bowling as an area of weakness following departure of blackwell bob willis writing in guardian shared this view and predicted that somerset would also be hindered by difficulty of getting 20 wickets at home resulting in too many draws squad following players made at least one appearance for somerset in first class list a or twenty20 cricket in 2009 age given is at start of

matches to pose a real challenge in 2009 county championship flat pitch at county ground taunton did not help their efforts imbalance in favour of batsmen meant that all but one match at ground was drawn total of 742 5742 5 indicates that sussex scored 742 runs and lost five wickets in their innings declared was fifteenth highest total in history of county championship while murray innings of 344 not out in that match was sixth highest score by a batsman in history of competition in total six of somerset s eight home matches contained scores of 500 or over in a single innings in contrast 500 was reached in only one of their away matches by hampshire at rose bowl home conditions helped three of somerset s batsmen pass 1 000 first class runs in season including craig kieswetter and arul suppiah who were both awarded their county caps after passing landmark trescothick s 1 817 runs were most by any batsman in 2009 competition finishing over 200 runs ahead of next most prolific batsman and he was named as both pca player of year and pca s most valuable player of year for 2009 he was also selected as part of team of year along with wicket keeper kieswetter in contrast to strong batting line up foot suggested that somerset lacked a seam bowler to compensate for andrew withdrawal caddick who made his first class debut for somerset in 1991 only played five matches in 2009 and announced his intention to retire at end of season he took ten wickets in 2009 and finished his career as somerset s sixth highest wicket taker of all time this placed majority of wicket taking burden upon charl willoughby south african fast medium pace bowler he responded well and took 54 wickets in county championship more than any other bowler in first division he was aided by seam bowlers david stiff who returned to first class game for first time since 2006 and alfonso thomas stiff took 31 wickets more than quadrupling his career first class wicket total and thomas took 35 his highest return in an english domestic season somerset lacked an effective spin bowler in 2009 following departure of ian blackwell previous season and spinners combined only claimed 31 wickets bowling less balls between them than willoughby alone somerset began their season by playing out a high scoring draw at home against warwickshire in which both teams reached 500 in their first innings james hildreth scored a triple century reaching milestone earlier in an english season than any player previously and became first english player to pass 300 runs in an innings for somerset since harold gimblett in 1948 in contrast somerset had to battle back for a draw in their second match after durham scored 543 in their first innings somerset collapsed to 69 all out in reply only langer passed 20 runs while six of his batting colleagues made ducks after being forced to follow on trescothick langer and kieswetter all scored centuries to secure a draw somerset s third match resulted in their only loss of county championship season coming against nottinghamshire at trent bridge and at end of may they were second bottom in first division their next match finished in a draw against lancashire a result which was always likely after first day was lost to rain somerset next picked up victories against yorkshire and sussex before scoring second highest ever fourth innings winning total in county championship to beat yorkshire at taunton these three wins propelled somerset to third in competition at start of july and they did not drop below this position for remainder of season in each of their following two matches at home against hampshire and away to worcestershire somerset batted first and then enforced follow on after bowling their opponents out cheaply in each their opponents managed to avoid defeat and both matches resulted in draws during worcestershire match langer s first innings 107 took him past sir donald bradman s total of 28 067 first class runs to become highest scoring australian batsman successive draws against nottinghamshire warwickshire sussex and hampshire meant that somerset travelled to durham requiring a victory to maintain any realistic hopes of claiming county championship title no play was possible on third and fourth days and match resulted in another draw leaving somerset with only a slim mathematical chance of title another draw against lancashire while durham beat nottinghamshire meant that durham clinched title somerset drew with worcestershire their ninth draw in a row in competition and finished third in

quarter final against group c runners up sussex somerset won toss and opted to bat at taunton they struggled initially losing early wickets of trescothick james hildreth and ben phillips for just 39 runs a fourth wicket partnership of 167 dominated by powerful hitting from kieswetter in which he scored a superb century according to espncricinfo s andrew mcglashan helped somerset to recover to

warwickshire and middlesex and by more than a hundred runs against kent and scotland their match against middlesex at lord s was marred by some controversy after somerset were allowed too many

by dwayne smith s 59 runs off 26 balls set somerset a target of 173 to win in opening overs of somerset s reply trescothick scored powerfully making chase look simple according to mcglashan however after he was caught on 33 somerset lost regular wickets a partnership of 41 between de bruyn and trego steadied somerset for a time but when pair were dismissed in subsequent overs their team collapsed from 104 4 to 109 all out at start of competition somerset played with aggressive batting tactics opening innings with kieswetter and trescothick for first six matches this opening pair only passed 20 runs together on one occasion against glamorgan and for rest of tournament kieswetter dropped down batting order and langer joined trescothick at top of innings in a move that kieswetter said adds a bit of balance to side by putting a bit more firepower down end and experience up top more experienced pair passed 40 runs together on four out of five occasions county s bowling relied
