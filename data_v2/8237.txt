drown seemed to be particularly apt when rovers lost as bristol frome flows alongside old eastville ground it is believed that john clapham is responsible for song as he used to work at eastville stadium for greyhound racing and last record he would play at end of night was goodnight irene also having a daughter called irene record would then be left in player and was played at football another theory is that it was sung at a fireworks display at stadium night before a home game against plymouth argyle in 1950s during game following day rovers were winning quite comfortably and few argyle supporters present began to leave early prompting a chorus of goodnight argyle from rovers supporters tune stuck and irene became club song byrne jay 2003 p225 another popular bristol rovers
