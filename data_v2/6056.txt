wilhelm cauer 24 june 1900 22 april 1945 was a german mathematician and scientist he is most noted for his work on analysis and synthesis of electrical filters and his work marked beginning of field of network synthesis prior to his work electronic filter design used techniques which accurately predicted filter behaviour only under unrealistic conditions this required a certain amount of experience on part of designer to choose suitable sections to include in design cauer placed field on a firm mathematical footing providing tools that could produce exact solutions to a given specification for design of an electronic filter cauer initially specialised in general relativity but soon switched to electrical engineering his work for a german subsidiary of bell telephone company brought him into contact with leading american engineers in field of filters this proved useful when cauer was unable to feed his children during german economic crisis of 1920s and he moved to us he studied early computer techniques in us prior to returning to germany according to wilhelm cauer s son emil rise of nazism in germany stifled cauer s cauer wilhelm cauer his life and reception of his work because he had a remote jewish ancestor cauer was executed during fall of berlin by soviet soldiers manuscripts for some of cauer s most important unpublished works were destroyed during war however his family succeeded in reconstructing much of this from his notes and volume ii of theorie der linearen wechselstromschaltungen was published after his death cauer s legacy continues today with network synthesis being method of choice for network design life and career early life and family wilhelm adolf eduard cauer was born in berlin germany on 24 june 1900 he came from a long line of academics his early grammar school gymnasium was kaiserin augusta gymnasium an institution founded by his great grandfather ludwig cauer this school was located on named after ludwig in charlottenburg district of berlin die geschichte unserer schule ludwig cauer grundschule official site in german accessed and archived 29 july 2012 building still exists but is now a primary school ludwig cauer grundschule ludwig cauer grundschule berlin architektur bild archiv in german accessed and archived 29 july 2012 he later attended mommsen gymnasium berlin his father also wilhelm cauer was a privy councillor and a professor of railway engineering at technical university of berlin cauer became interested in mathematics at age of thirteen and continued to demonstrate that he was academically inclined as he grew e cauer et al p2 briefly cauer served in german army in final stages of world war i he married karoline cauer a relation accessed and archived 29 july 2012 in 1925 and eventually fathered six children career cauer started off in a field completely unrelated to filters from 1922 he worked with max von laue on general relativity and his first publication 1923 was in this field for reasons that are not clear he changed his field after this to electrical engineering he graduated in applied physics in 1924 from technical university of berlin he then spent a period working for mix genest a branch of bell telephone company applying probability theory to telephone switching he also worked on timer relays he had two telecommunications related publications during this period on telephone switching systems and losses of real inductors relationship of mix genest with bell gave cauer an easy path to collaboration with at t s engineers at bell labs in us which must have been of enormous help when cauer embarked on a study of filter design bell were at forefront of filter design at this time with likes of george campbell in boston and otto zobel in new york making major contributions bray p62 however it was with r m foster that cauer had much correspondence and it was his work that cauer recognised as being of such importance his paper a reactance theorem foster r m a reactance theorem bell system technical journal vol 3 267 1924 is a milestone in filter theory and inspired cauer to generalise this approach into what has now become field of network synthesis in june 1926 cauer presented his thesis paper realisation of impedances of specified frequency dependence at institute of applied mathematics and mechanics of technical university of berlin this paper is beginning of modern network synthesis belevitch p850 in 1927 cauer went to work as a research assistant at richard courant s institute of mathematics at university of gottingen in 1928 he obtained his habilitation and became an external university lecturer cauer found that he could not support his family during economic crisis of 1920s and in 1930 took his family to usa where he had obtained a scholarship a rockefeller fellowship to study at mit and harvard university he worked with vannevar bush who was building machines for solution of mathematical problems essentially these were what we would now call analogue computers cauer was interested in using them to solve linear systems to aid in filter designs his work on filter circuits was completed in 1931 while still in us cauer met and had strong contacts with many of key researchers in field of filter design at bell labs these included hendrik bode george campbell sidney darlington foster and otto zobel e cauer et al p8 for a short while cauer worked for wired radio company in newark new jersey but then returned to gottingen with intention of building a fast analogue computer there however he was unable to obtain funding due to depression cauer seems to have got on very poorly with his german colleagues according to rainer pauli his correspondence with them was usually brief and business like rarely if ever discussing issues in depth by contrast his correspondence with his american and european acquaintances was warm technically deep and often included personal family news and greetings e cauer et al p9 this correspondence went beyond his american contacts and included a c bartlett of general electric company in wembley roger julia of lignes et in paris mathematicians gustav georg pick and hungarian graph theorist denes konig after leaving technical institute for mix genest cauer sought to become active in verband deutscher vde german electrical engineers society he left vde however in 1942 after a serious falling out with wagner previously his phd supervisor and ally nazi era in november 1933 cauer signed vow of allegiance of professors of german universities and high schools to adolf hitler and national socialistic state rising force of nazism became a major obstacle to cauer s work from 1933 onwards anti jewish hysteria of time forced many academics to leave their posts including director of mathematics institute richard courant although cauer was not jewish it became known that he had a jewish ancestor daniel who had been a banker to frederick ii of prussia while this revelation was not sufficient to have cauer removed under race laws it stifled his future career thus he gained title of professor but was never given a chair e cauer et al p3 by 1935 cauer had three children whom he was finding increasingly difficult to support which prompted him to return to industry in 1936 he temporarily worked for aircraft manufacturer at their fi 156 storch works in kassel and then became director of laboratory of mix genest in berlin nevertheless he did continue to lecture at technical university in berlin from 1939 in 1941 first volume of his main work theory of linear ac circuits was published original manuscript to second volume was destroyed as a result of war although cauer was able to reproduce this work he was not able to publish it and it too was lost during war some time after his death however his family arranged for publication of some of his papers as second volume based on surviving descriptions of intended contents of volume ii after taking his children to stay with relatives in in hesse to protect them from expected fall of berlin to russians cauer against advice returned to berlin his body was located after end of war in a mass grave of victims of russian executions cauer had been shot dead in berlin by soviet soldiers as a hostage soviet intelligence was actively looking for scientists they could use in their own researches and cauer was on their list of people to find but it would seem that this was unknown to his executioners network synthesis major part of cauer s legacy is his contribution to network synthesis of passive networks indeed he is considered founder of field and publication of his principal work in english was enthusiastically greeted even though this did not happen until seventeen years later in 1958 sooyoung chang academic genealogy of mathematicians page 60 world scientific 2010 k c garner reviews aeronautical journal volume 63 page 375 royal aeronautical society 1959 prior to network synthesis networks especially filters were designed using image impedance method accuracy of predictions of response from such designs depended on accurate impedance matching between sections this could be achieved with sections entirely internal to filter but it was not possible to perfectly match to end terminations for this reason image filter designers incorporated end sections in their designs of a different form optimised for an improved match rather than filtering response choice of form of such sections was more a matter of designer experience than design calculation network synthesis entirely did away with need for this it directly predicted response of filter and included terminations in synthesis mathis et al pp 83 84 cauer treated network synthesis as being inverse problem of network analysis whereas network analysis asks what is response of a given network network synthesis on other hand asks what are networks that can produce a given desired response cauer solved this problem by comparing electrical quantities and functions to their mechanical equivalents then realising that they were completely analogous applying known lagrangian mechanics to problem e cauer et al p4 according to cauer there are three major tasks that network synthesis has to address first is ability to determine whether a given transfer function is realisable as an impedance network second is to find canonical minimal forms of these functions and relationships transforms between different forms representing same transfer function finally it is not in general possible to find an exact finite element solution to an ideal transfer function such as zero attenuation at all frequencies below a given cutoff frequency and infinite attenuation above third task is therefore to find approximation techniques for achieving desired responses initially work revolved around one port impedances transfer function between a voltage and a current amounting to expression for impedance itself a useful network can be produced by breaking open a branch of network and calling that output realisability following on from foster cauer generalised relationship between expression for impedance of a one port network and its transfer function cauer 1926 he discovered necessary and sufficient condition for realisability of a one port impedance that is those impedance expressions that could actually be built as a real circuit in later papers he made generalisations to networks cauer himself only proved necessity for this condition later at mit cauer supervised doctoral thesis of o brune 1931 which proved sufficiency of condition now called positive real or pr transformation cauer discovered that all solutions for realisation of a given impedance expression could be obtained from one given solution by a group of affine transformations cauer 1929 1931 he generalised foster s ladder realisation to filters which included resistors foster s were reactance only and discovered an isomorphism between all two element kind networks e cauer et al p5 he identified canonical forms of filter realisation that is minimal forms which includes ladder networks obtained by stieltjes s continued fraction expansion approximation he used chebyshev approximation to design filters cauer s application of tchebyscheff polynomials resulted in filters now known as elliptic filters or sometimes cauer filters which have optimally fast passband to transitions for a given maximum attenuation variation well known chebyshev filters can be viewed as a special case of elliptic filters and can be arrived at using same approximation techniques so can butterworth maximally flat filter although this was an independent discovery by stephen butterworth arrived at by a different method cauer 1927 1933 cauer s work was initially ignored because his canonical forms made use of ideal transformers this made his circuits of less practical use to engineers however it was soon realised that cauer s tchebyscheff approximation could just as easily be applied to rather more useful ladder topology and ideal transformers could be dispensed with from then on network synthesis began to supplant image design as method of choice further work most of above work is contained in cauer s first and second monographs and is largely a treatment of one ports in his habilitation thesis cauer begins to extend this work by showing that a global canonical form cannot be found in general case for three element kind that is networks containing all three r l and c elements for generation of realisation solutions as it can be for two element kind case e cauer et al p6 cauer extended work of bartlett and brune on geometrically symmetric 2 ports to all symmetric 2 ports that is 2 ports which are electrically symmetrical but not necessarily topologically symmetrical finding a number of canonical circuits he also studied 2 ports he also extended foster s theorem to 2 element lc n ports 1931 and showed that all equivalent lc networks could be derived from each other by linear transformations publications a cauer w die der archiv fur vol 17 388 1926 realisation of impedances of prescribed
